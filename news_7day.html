Trump, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention, said in a social media post on Monday that the new levies would “immediately” hit the Islamic republic’s trading partners who also do business with the United States.
“This Order is final and conclusive,” he wrote, without specifying who they will affect.







Iran’s main trading partners are China, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, according to economic database Trading Economics.
Trump has been mulling his options on Iran, which has been roiled by more than two weeks of demonstrations that have defied a near-total internet blackout and lethal force.
Sparked by economic grievances, the nationwide protests have grown into one of the biggest challenges yet to the theocratic system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the shah.
Iranian authorities have blamed foreign interference for stoking the unrest and staged their own nationwide counter-rallies.

Rights groups warned that the severed communications were aimed at masking a rising death toll.
The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said the internet shutdown has made it “extremely difficult to independently verify reports” of casualties.
“The international community has a duty to protect civilian protesters against mass killing by the Islamic republic,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.
The White House said Monday that Trump remained “unafraid” to deploy military force against Iran, but was pursuing diplomacy as a first resort.
US asks citizens to leave Iran
The State Department asked US-Iranian dual nationals to “exit Iran on Iranian passports”.
“The Iranian government does not recognise dual nationality and will treat US-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens, “and added that US nationals face“ significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran”.







“Showing a US passport or demonstrating connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone,” added the advisory from the State Department.
“The US government cannot guarantee your safety if you choose to depart using the following options. You should leave only if you believe it is safe to do so.”
China opposes Trump’s tariff threat
China said late on Monday that it opposed “any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction” after US President Donald Trump posted on social media that nations doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff on US trade.
“China’s position against the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems,” a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Washington said on X.
“China firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”
‘Four-front war’
Iran on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated.
In power since 1989 and now 86, Khamenei said the pro-government turnout was a “warning” to the United States.
“These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to state TV, referring to pro-government demonstrations.
In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed “riots”.
At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a “four-front war” listing economic war, psychological war, “military war” with the United States and Israel, and “today a war against terrorists” - a reference to the protests.
Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Trump “an unforgettable lesson” if attacked.
But Trump said Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called him seeking “to negotiate”.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was “not seeking war but is fully prepared for war”, while calling for “fair” negotiations.
Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS news the government was “trying to trick the world into thinking that (it) is ready to negotiate once again”.
He said Trump was “a man that means what he says and says what he means” and who “knows what’s at stake”.
“The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime.”
‘Respect for their rights’
State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies.
The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed.
The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Monday said it was “looking into” imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations.
The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assembly’s premises.
French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement condemning “the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights”.
Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by “foreign powers” to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscow’s first reaction to the protests.</p><small>2026-01-13 05:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13095338db3d919.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966642/reduced-gas-supply-intensifies-cold-weather-ordeal-for-karachiites' target='_blank'><strong>Reduced gas supply intensifies cold-weather ordeal for Karachiites</strong></a><br><p>• Several neighbourhoods have to make do without gas for four days straight as temperatures drop to single digits• Households turn to costly LPG cylinders• PPP senator seeks PM’s intervention• SSGC says shortfall from two fields reaches 45MMcf/d
KARACHI: The gas crisis that Karachiites have been facing for the past four days further intensified on Monday, as several neighbourhoods remained completely without gas, while other areas struggled with critically low gas pressure.
While office-goers, schoolchildren and other people continue to endure the cold-induced agony of a crippled gas supply, the gas utility concedes the problem, saying it experienced a reduction in gas supply from one more field.

 

City’s minimum average temperature remained in the single digit as the Met Office said it was 8.1 degrees Celsius on Monday.
Residents across the city said that the winter freeze had once again exposed the complete failure of the gas utility’s distribution infrastructure and system, turning everyday life into a continuous struggle for them.
Public frustration
“How long will Karachi tolerate a utility that can’t secure its own supply,” wondered a disgruntled housewife from Gulistan-i-Jauhar.
A resident of Nazimabad, where gas supply was disrupted for hours, said that the gas utility offered the same tired narrative each winter, while the public paid the price.
“Until the company is held accountable, infrastructure is upgraded and the government stops turning a blind eye, Karachi’s residents will remain hostages of a broken system,” she added.
As the temperature dropped to single digits, homes were left with cold kitchens and delayed breakfasts, forcing students, workers and the elderly to turn to expensive LPG cylinders — a short-term arrangement that only added to their financial burden.
Pakistan Peoples Party’s Sindh General Secretary, Senator Waqar Mehdi, voiced deep concern over the ongoing gas shutdowns, loadshedding and dangerously low pressure reported across Sindh, especially in Karachi.
In a press statement, he noted that regardless of the weather, be it scorching heat or biting cold, Karachi’s residents continued to endure persistent gas cuts, erratic pressure and frequent power outages.
“The prime minister should take immediate notice of the gas shutdown in Karachi,” he demanded and urged that strict action be taken against anyone responsible for the continued suffering of the city’s residents.
He said that even as gas supplies were cut and loadshedding persisted, residents were still being hit with bills running into the thousands, while the gas utility continued to fall short of delivering a normal, reliable service to the public.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) announced that the utility had experienced a reduction in gas supply from two fields, which disrupted service to several parts of the city.

 

A gas utility spokesman said that the amount of gas received from these two gas fields was about 45 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d). “Due to this, gas pressure has decreased in some areas of Karachi; however, the situation has started improving in the last one hour,” he added.
The spokesperson said that the SSGC was taking various steps to ensure gas supply, the most significant of which was the suspension of gas supply to Fauji Fertiliser. “At the same time, a decision was taken to suspend gas supply to industries on Sunday so that gas supply to domestic consumers can be ensured,” he added.
The spokesperson claimed that the gas company was supplying 28 MMcf/d more gas to domestic consumers this winter compared to last year. “However, the system line pack has been severely affected due to the drop in temperature in the franchise area,” he added.
He said that the gas utility was monitoring the situation and that the restoration of gas from the fields would be immediately delivered to domestic consumers.
Published in Dawn, January 13th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-13 04:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13091922e648292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966596/new-ordinance-set-to-further-delay-local-govt-polls-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>New ordinance set to further delay local govt polls in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The local government elections in Islamabad are once again set to be postponed as President Asif Ali Zardari has approved an ordinance which introduces several amendments to the Local Government Act 2015.
Besides replacing the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) with three town corporations, the ordinance gives the government-appointed administrator more powers and an indefinite tenure.
The new ordinance was introduced at a time when the local governments in Islamabad were scheduled to be held on February 15. Thousands of people from all 125 Union Councils had already submitted nomination papers for the elections. However, sources said, chances are now slim that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will assert holding the elections as scheduled.
Meanwhile, the ordinance also stated that in the absence of local government, the administrator can hold office until the new local government elections are held - replacing the bar that the administrator’s tenure shall not exceed six months.
The ordinance also empowered the administrator to levy tax, fee, rate, rent, toll charge or surcharge.

Amendments to LG Act replaces MCI with three town corporations, gives administrator more powers and indefinite tenure

The federal cabinet recently approved 14 amendments to the Act, including a change in the name of the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad, replacing it with town corporations.
According to the ordinance, there will be three town corporations in Islamabad and each town corporation will comprise, as far as practicable, the territorial limits of a National Assembly (NA) constituency within the capital. Islamabad has three NA seats.
It is relevant to note here that when the election schedule was announced by the ECP, the local chapter of the PTI had claimed that the government fearing defeat would opt for an escape route and would not conduct the elections in February.
However, PML-N former deputy mayor Syed Zeeshan Ali Naqvi had rejected the claim of the PTI, stating that the ordinance was brought for a better local government system in Islamabad.
“It is habit of PTI to make false claim. We will defeat them in local government elections whenever held as we did in 2015-16. Actually, through this ordinance, we want to have three separate town corporations and three mayors for better service delivery,” he said and added that his party wanted a vibrant local government system in Islamabad.
“You know the previous election was held on the basis of weak local government Act that was why the local government representatives could not live up to the expectations of the their constituents. Local government representatives in their tenure remained busy in removing bureaucratic hurdles,” he said. “Now, when elections will be held people of Islamabad will have an effective local government setup,” he said.
Whenever elections are held, according to the new ordinance, each town corporation will have a mayor and two deputy mayors, four women, one peasant/worker, one trader/ businessman, one youth member and one non-Muslim member.
The term of the last local government expired in February 2021, and since then elections have been delayed under various pretexts. As a result, around 2.5 million residents of Islamabad continue to face issues ranging from water shortages to unpaved streets etc.
Earlier, the ECP conducted delimitations of constituencies multiple times and issued election schedules on several occasions, only to be cancelled later.
A few years ago, the elections were even cancelled a day before polling.
It is pertinent to note that when the local government’s term ended in 2021, the PTI was in power and elections were supposed to be held within 120 days. However, the PTI government did not take serious steps to conduct the polls. When the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) came into power, it too delayed the elections.
During the PDM’s tenure, elections were set to be held in 50 union councils (UCs), but the government argued that the number should be increased to 101 UCs, leading to further delays.
Later, when arrangements were finalised to hold elections in 101 UCs, the PDM government proposed increasing the number of UCs from 101 to 125. Elections were then scheduled for 125 UCs, but in September last year the government decided to increase the number of general seats in the UCs.
Last month, the ECP decided to hold elections for 125 UCs, but the government has now introduced fresh amendments to the local government law.

Back then, it was a sleepier city but a very green one. The main boulevard in Gulberg was a long road with a wide and very green belt in the centre that ran from the Jail Road-Sherpao intersection all the way to Liberty market. The road on both sides of this green expanse was smallish and not that busy. But as the city grew, a decision was made to broaden the road and reduce the green belt, in order to accommodate the traffic. Since then, concrete has swallowed up most of the green. And the traffic continues to be a nightmare. The roads are wide and there are limited spots for U-turns or crossings but the traffic is far from manageable. Those who are forced to walk have to dash across between fast-moving cars and motorcycles.
It is hard to think of any place in Lahore where the traffic is less chaotic, despite the flyovers and underpasses that have mushroomed all over the city, replacing the greenery in many cases. The canal, which once was the preferred spot for those who wanted to go for a ‘long drive’, is now a noisy, chaotic place, despite a series of underpasses. There was a time a drive next to the canal could be a relaxing affair as the city ended close to where Johar Town is. When an aunt of mine moved near Thokar Niaz Beg, it seemed so far away that a trip to her place was planned with as much fanfare as a day trip out of town. By now, of course, the city has spread far beyond what then seemed to be nowhere land.
The city has become much bigger, swallowing areas around it and the people travelling in and out and through the city have also increased; but decades later, no one seems to realise that widening roads and installing flyovers doesn’t lead to a smooth traffic flow. In fact, more and bigger roads mean more cars and motorcycles. In the process, the sleepy green city of my childhood and youth has become ugly and concrete-ridden. For people such as myself who left Lahore some years ago, finding one’s way is at times impossible.
Readers may be wondering what the point of this trip down memory lane is. There is a point. I was reminded of the disappearance of the city of my childhood because of the debate raging in Islamabad where trees have been cut down in what is said to be large numbers and in more than one location. For once, so intense and consistent was the criticism that the government was forced to pay attention.

Islamabad’s greenery is being replaced by big roads, flyovers and underpasses.

The authorities, which range from climate change to interior to CDA, insist that only paper mulberry trees (the cause of allergies) were cut down and that each tree will be replaced by three saplings — as if a fully grown tree which is removed today can be adequately replaced by three saplings, which may or may not survive.
The larger context is not about how these trees were cut down but the mindset of what constitutes development and work across our political landscape. Since the 1990s, the political obsession is with building roads, broadening them, installing flyovers — a version of Dubai or Midwestern US. However, in the decades since, the world has moved on to a different version of urban living but as with our politics, we are stuck in a world and a vision that no longer works.

 

And so, ‘development’ continues to be pushed. In Islamabad, the greenery is being replaced by big roads, flyovers and underpasses with little thought for their need or their capacity to manage traffic. If it seems there is a crossing where there is a wait and queues due to traffic lights, the ‘solution’ is to build an interchange or flyovers. No one realises that the wider roads in Lahore will eventually prove insufficient. Slowly, the greenery will give way to more concrete till the city is unrecognisable to those who grew up in it decades ago. And with the challenge of climate change, more roads and cars with less green cover is really a case of pouring oil on fire.
At one level the problem is not just about outdated notions. They are also vanity projects for our ruling elite. In Islamabad, for instance, at one level the rapidity with which construction takes place is about ‘Shehbaz speed’ in competition with ‘Mohsin speed’. If the former built one in record time, during his previous stint, taking over land belonging to a university, the current interior minister has to be faster and more efficient. He is now busy transforming the city and who can stop him? Education, land rights, city character, the discomfort of the poor who are forced to be pedestrians, are all irrelevant issues.
With this approach, is there any surprise that CDA officials went ahead and chopped down trees ruthlessly in different parts of the city? At one place it was to build a road to a new DHA phase; at another it was to help allergy patients. Who will ask questions about who profited from the wood, or the road to yet another housing society? In this environment, very few. Accountability has no role in this age of authoritarianism. And some years from now, when the air in Islamabad is as toxic as in Lahore, and the skies just as grey as the concrete covering the city, everyone will wring their hands, and blame the richer countries for climate change. Most of those who laid down this concrete in the shape of roads and housing societies (and profited from it) will be living in lands elsewhere.

The PC-1 worth of Rs40 billion has been approved by the National Steering Committee of Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP) chaired by Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal. The service will be resumed from Jan 16.
The meeting of the committee was attended by health secretary Hamid Yaqoob, special secretary of health and CEO of SSP Arshad Khan, along with members of the National Steering Committee.
The committee reviewed progress on the restoration and launch of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) services to all permanent resident families of ICT, AJK, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The CEO of Federal SSP Arshad Khan shared prime minister’s directives for immediate restoration of the services.

Rs40bn approved for the programme

“The committee approved the revised PC-I with an estimated cost of approximately Rs40 billion, extending up to 30th June 2027, to provide free hospitalisation services to all permanent resident families of ICT, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan under the UHC model of Federal Sehat Sahulat Programme.
“It was also decided to extend existing contracts with State Life Insurance Corporation and Nadra through addenda to ensure uninterrupted services, while outstanding liabilities will be cleared from the PSDP as per the prime minister’s directions,” a statement issued by the health ministry claimed.
Speaking on the occasion, Syed Mustafa Kamal said the country must adopt modern health insurance and strategic purchasing models rather than directly managing hospital services to ensure quality, efficiency, and dignity in healthcare delivery.
The minister confirmed that the prime minister will launch the restored services on Jan 16.
Over 10 million residents of Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan were (GB) suffering since March 2024 as the service was suspended because the federal govt had failed to clear its dues. On the other hand, residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab were enjoying the facility. Residents of KP have been getting the best possible medical facility as they can get medical treatment at private and public sector hospitals whereas residents of Punjab can only get treatment at public sector hospitals.
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had launched the health card programme on Dec 31, 2015, for Islamabad and described the move a first step towards making the country a welfare state. He had also announced the card would be expanded to all parts of Punjab, Balochistan, AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and then Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
People of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) could not benefit from the initiative at that time because their governments had declined to become part of the federal government’s programme in which they also had to contribute. Later, the KP had launched its own health card namely Sehat Insaf Card.
During the tenure of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, the programme was expanded across the country.
In April 2022 some of the hospitals had suspended the service as they feared that the PML-N government might discontinue the programme as PTI promoted/marketed the programme as its initiative.
Later, the PML-N government limited the programme to public sector hospitals in Punjab and the service was completely suspended in Islamabad, AJK and GB.
Since the start of health card in year 2015, the State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan has been dealing with the card facility, and in 2021 it again won the contract of insurance of health cards for the next three years (2022 to 2025). The insurance has been further extended to June 30, 2027.

Europe too has discarded a long cultivated democratic pretence and is eyeing its chance in the melee. Hungary, Poland, Austria and Italy have been singled out by Donald Trump’s strategists, according to their leaked documents, to subvert democracy for a right-wing takeover in Trump’s footsteps. British, French and German establishments are nudging their countries also towards militarism. EU is targeting Russia, Palestine and Iran even as Nato looks poised to implode in the chaos of Trump’s claims over Greenland. The EU seeks to humour Trump over Venezuela while retaining a different yardstick to judge Vladimir Putin’s advances in Ukraine.
But the masses are retaliating. Venezuela and Mexico are staging massive rallies with sleeves rolled up to combat Trump’s threat to them. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, sensing enough was enough of his neighbour, is mending his country’s ties with China. He could be visiting Beijing shortly to counter the ultimatums to Canada’s economy.
Ideally, this is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide. Jeremy Corbyn recently unfurled the flag with a separate party to challenge the British establishment, which includes his former Labour Party colleagues who he watched with dismay removing the last stitch of morality by abetting Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza.
French left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is leading a mass upsurge against Emmanuel Macron and the EU, accusing European leaders of “prostrate servility” to Trump. Mélenchon homed in on President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas on sending troops and long-range weapons to Ukraine. He demanded referendums in Donbass, Crimea and all contested regions because “it’s the people who decide” rather than warmongering elites who “don’t give a damn about people’s lives”.

This is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide.

The left in the US is punching above its weight to hold its ground, using every chink in Trump’s armour to put up a promising fight for democracy. In the absence of trustworthy support from the mainstream media, YouTube channels are abuzz with analysts and activists keeping Trump in their crosshairs. A white woman activist raging against MAGA’s nativism was murdered by Trump’s hired guns from ICE. The killing in Minneapolis has set off a prairie fire across states. In the absence of vocal criticism of Trump from the Congress, the left, increasingly joined by Jewish students and senior scholars, is intervening strategically to ensure that Trump gets his comeuppance in the November mid-term polls and thereby can be reined in from doing further damage. Regardless of the outcome the left won’t be accused of sitting on its hands when America was dismembering democracy.

 

Brazil and Colombia have slammed Trump’s abduction of a fellow Latin American president from his home in Caracas. Trump’s toolkit for Iran is different. A colour revolution is being quelled, says Pepe Escobar, a well-regarded Brazilian observer of the Middle East. Regardless of the images posted in Western media, Escobar says the Iranian leadership is braced for another round of war with US and Israel, only this time better prepared. It is a testament to the feckless ways of the left that a group like Mujahideen-i-Khalq, which was instrumental in deposing the Shah of Iran, has become a catspaw for Israeli and US intrusion in its own country. Veteran Iran watchers are sanguine that without the organisational skills and a well-oiled machinery of the deeply camouflaged Mujahideen-i-Khalq, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince would have no standing with the rioters.
The Gulf has also been jolted by the events in Venezuela. “We are entering an era where international guarantees are fragile, institutions are weakened and power speaks louder than principle. Awareness today is not a luxury; it is a requirement for survival,” cautioned Saudi Arabia’s Arab News. It stressed that the seizure of Russian funds in Western banks was a betrayal of crucial trust that the world took for granted. “The lesson is clear. The time to act is now.” Interestingly, the writer in the Saudi paper is prominent UAE businessman Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor. It says something for the thread that still unifies the two countries despite their recent aloofness.
South Asia is inevitably deeply affected by the turn of events unfolding at breakneck speed in the Middle East and in Latin America. Pakistan, currently in the good books of Trump (for no palpable reason), has spoken out boldly on the heist in Venezuela, with its defence minister reportedly calling for the abduction of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by the US (instead of Nicolás Maduro who should be freed). Bangladesh has witnessed street protests for Nicolás Maduro.
However, India, once a champion of lost causes in the Global South has been slow poisoned into becoming a basket case by its leaders seeking anchor in the West. When George W. Bush was in bad odour right across the world, a PEW survey said India was the rare country where Bush was popular. What does that say about the current leadership? Pulverised as a stag caught in the headlights of an approaching truck, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left his foreign policy to the tender care of hope and prayer. What excites him, however, is any lurking campaign to win another state election, or even a municipal poll, preferably by communally polarising voters.
Modi’s calendar this year perhaps captures the essence of his preferences and fears. To cheer him, assembly polls are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in May. On the other hand, he is to host the BRICS summit around August, which comes with the terror of having to take an unequivocal stand on Trump’s thuggery and India’s one-sided love with the US. In the meantime, China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa’s waters on Saturday. The ‘BRICS Plus operation’ would “ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities”. The sleeves have been rolled up, mostly.

GILGIT: Gilgit-Baltistan is in the grip of severe cold temperatures as local people are suffering multiple difficulties owing to acute power shortages and absence of basic facilities.
Three people, including a woman tourist, died due to suffocation caused by LPG leakage in Ghanche and Skardu.
According to police, a couple died of suffocation inside a room due to leakage of LPG in Khawla Brah area of Ghanche district.
The couple had been married only three months ago and were residing together at their home. The couple went to sleep on Sunday night in a room where an LPG heater was operational.
Later, family members found them lying unconscious inside the room. They were immediately shifted to DHQ Hospital, Khaplu, where they were declared dead on Monday.
In another incident, a woman tourist was found dead while her husband was injured due to LPG suffocation in their hotel room in Skardu on Sunday.
Police said the tourist couple from Punjab’s Talagang area were sleeping in a local hotel room in Skardu. They added that both of them were found unconscious on Sunday and shifted to hospital, where the woman was declared dead. The police suspected that leakage of LPG in the room caused her death, while the condition of her husband is stable.
The body was dispatched to their native village, while police have kicked off an investigation into the matter.
‘20-hour power outages’
People across the region are facing severe difficulties due to harsh weather, with most of them remaining indoors. Locals said the region faced over 20 hours of power outages during winter, along with shortages of firewood and gas.
Authorities said that in upper areas of Baltistan — Astore, Hu­­nza, Nagar, and Ghizer — the mercury plunged to minus 16 degrees Celsius on Sunday night, bringing life to a standstill.
Ahmed Khan, a local resident of Astore, told Dawn that residents had been experiencing harsh weather conditions since this week.
Frozen water has made roads slippery, while unavailability and high prices of firewood and electricity shortages have added to the misery of people.
Zulfiqar Ali from Skardu said tourism, the main source of income for locals, had declined completely, leaving people jobless.
Other activities, including agriculture and local commerce, have also been suspended.
Rahim Karim from Gojal said the area experienced less snowfall this year; however, temperatures plunged to minus 14 degrees Celsius. People in the area depend on tourism, which is seasonal, and for half of the year many remain jobless.
PMD refutes claims
The Pakistan Mete­orological Department (PMD) certain social media platforms were circulating misleading and unverified forecasts claiming an extreme cold wave across Pakistan from Jan 16 to 25, with record-breaking temperatures.
The PMD refuted these claims, clarifying that no such extreme or historic cold wave was expected during this period.
It advised the public and stakeholders to rely solely on official forecasts, warnings, and advisories issued by the PMD and to avoid spreading unverified information that might cause unnecessary concern.

The panel was formed by the prime minister to devise a strategy to exit the IMF programme once the current bailout facility ends at the end of next year. Its weeklong consultations with public and private sector stakeholders this month has apparently concluded that the current state of affairs cannot drive the 250m-strong population towards sustained progress due to cross-cutting constraints affecting all 20 priority export products and six export drivers.
There is nothing new in the diagnosis of the problems hampering economic and export growth, or the solutions suggested by the panel. If anything, both diagnosis and prescription echo past policy pronouncements that were never followed up. The constraints to economic and export growth — high, volatile energy costs, policy unpredictability, distorted taxation, logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, institutional fragmentation, regulatory burden, etc — cited by the panel are old hat. These have featured in donor and government reports and in media commentary.
The persistence of these structural problems shows that the challenge lies less in their diagnosis or analysis and more in the state’s capacity and willingness to deliver politically tough, rules-based reform. Against this backdrop, the panel’s implicitly holding restrictive IMF financing responsible for the government’s failure to aggressively implement reforms to return the economy to a sustainable growth path is an attempt to gloss over the state’s own dereliction of duty. Indeed, the IMF programme conditions and targets primarily aim for economic and fiscal stabilisation by imposing fiscal discipline rather than driving the economy towards growth.

 

However, the lender does not stop the government from undertaking or implementing reforms to restructure the economy or address stagnant growth. For example, it may demand that the authorities increase tax revenues as a ratio of GDP to slash the budget deficit — which should encourage the government to broaden the tax base. Nor does it ask them to cut development spending — instead of this, the government could reduce its own wasteful expenditure.
Rather, the IMF — ideological and policy differences with its prescriptions aside — encourages the government to create a conducive business clime. The authorities are blaming the IMF programme for a sluggish, moribund economy to cover up their own incompetence, and obscure the ruling party’s unwillingness to dismantle the entrenched politically protected rent-seeking structures.
Unless the government walks the talk on reform to create a rules-based economy, its rhetoric of doubling exports and breaking the proverbial begging bowl will remain a pipe dream.

Meeting at Parliament House under Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the party passed a unanimous resolution seeking the immediate release of political prisoners and the restoration of family visits for the former prime minister. The group claimed the country is passing through a “sensitive phase.”
Participants called on democratic forces to agree on a new Charter of Democracy to ensure transparent, free and fair elections so people can elect their true representatives. The resolution also demanded the implementation of the Peace Jirga declaration for lasting peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The party condemned the police brutality against the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan in Punjab and obstacles created for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister in Sindh.
Paying tribute to Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan and de-seated members, the group praised supporters in Lahore and Karachi for demonstrating their struggle for democratic rights.

Officials said over a hundred students and pilgrims entered Pakis­tan through Gabad-250 border crossing point, while more were expected to return on Tuesday (today).
A group of Pakistani students reached the border in coaches and crossed into Pakistan from Iran on Sunday evening while pilgrims reached on Monday afternoon.
The officials of the FIA immigration confirmed the return of students and pilgrims from Iran. “Over 100 students and pilgrims have returned to Pakistan from Iran in the last two days,” Balaach Yaqoob, senior FIA official told Dawn over the phone. He said another group of 50 students was expected to reach the Gabad-250 border on Tuesday morning.
“Around 40 Pakistani pilgrims including women and children reached Gabad on Monday afternoon,” the official in charge of the Gabad border post said. He added, “We have also received an 18-member family of Pakistani pilgrims at the immigration office.”
According to them, he said, more pilgrims were on their way to Gabad. He said most of the students and pilgrims, who arrived at the border crossing, later left for their hometowns.
About the 50 other students who were expected to arrive on Tuesday, the official said, “We are waiting for them. They are students of Zanjan University of Medical sciences.”

The issue resurfaced a couple of days ago, after an alleged statement attributed to the proscribed religious outfit surfaced, claiming that both were “in the custody of agencies”.
However, senior law enforcement officials are sticking to their earlier stance, maintaining that the two are hiding somewhere in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). They said the Rizvi brothers had fled on the day the Punjab police launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke to dismantle the TLP protest camp along G.T. Road.
“I give you my word that they are not in the custody of any security agency and are still in AJK. They are most likely sheltered by a loyal worker of the banned organisation somewhere in the hilly areas,” said a senior officer. Talking to Dawn, he rejected the alleged TLP statement, terming it a “false, funny and self-generated claim”.
A source said a senior Punjab official was tasked with contacting federal authorities to verify the claim after the statement went viral on social media.
He said the provincial official conveyed to a senior official in Islamabad the Punjab police intent to arrest the “fleeing Rizvis” in multiple cases if they were in custody of any security agency, but the federal authorities told him the absconding TLP chief and his brother were not in the custody of any agency.
The source said the two brothers had assumed the status of “high-profile wanted criminals” in cases registered against them under serious and heinous offences, including anti-terrorism charges.
“So far, 44 FIRs have been registered against Saad and Anas in Sheikhupura and 11 in Lahore, in which they are nominated,” he said, adding that the charges were of a grave nature.
Asked why the LEAs had failed to trace them, the official said the absconding TLP leaders were not using phones or other devices, making it difficult to track their location or hideouts.
“We have activated all systems across the country, and it has been confirmed by relevant state institutions that the TLP chief and his brother are still in Pakistan,” he said, ruling out the possibility of their fleeing abroad.
He added that the Punjab police were actively pursuing the fugitives and had constituted several teams.
About the charges, the official said both had allegedly instigated TLP workers and hardcore activists to carry out attacks on law enforcement officials, besides damaging government vehicles and property.
An SHO lost his life, while dozens of others sustained injuries during repea­ted attacks by TLP workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura. He said the TLP chief and his brother had led the “Gaza March”, launched from Lahore, where the party’s headquarters are located, in October last year, with the stated aim of marching towards Islamabad.
Meanwhile, the FIA also moved swiftly, traced around 95 bank accounts allegedly operated by Saad Rizvi, and initiated investigations under money laundering charges, the official said.
Dawn tried to contact the spokesperson/representative of the banned TLP to verify the recent statement claiming that Saad and Anas were in the custody of state agencies. However, the representative neither answered the call nor responded to WhatsApp messages.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts, officials said on Monday.
A police official said SHO Gomal police station Ishaq Ahmad Khan, five other policemen were martyred when an improvised explosive device (IED) targeted an armoured personnel carrier (APC) in Tank’s Gomal area, about 25km from Kot Wali. He added the powerful explosion completely destroyed the police vehicle and also claimed the life of a passer-by.
Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene soon after the incident and shifted the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals.
The martyred police personnel were identified as SHO Ishaq Ahmad Khan, Assistant Sub-Inspector Sher Aslam Khan, driver Abdul Majeed, Arshad Ali, Hazrat Ali, and Ehsan­ullah, who served as driver.
Police said the passer-by who was critically injured in the blast later succumbed to his injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The identity of the civilian victim could not be immediately ascertained.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report from senior officials regarding the attack on Tank police. He expressed deep condolences to the families of the martyrs and their colleagues.
Cop, his cousin martyred
Separately, an Elite Police Force constable was martyred alongside his cousin, in a gun attack in Paharpur tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan, police said.
According to the officials, the incident occurred on Kathgarh Road within the jurisdiction of Paharpur police station. Elite force constable Ismatullah and his cousin Amir died on the spot, while the attackers managed to flee.
Police reached the spot and shifted the bodies to a nearby hospital for medico-legal formalities.
Three cops injured in Lakki blast
Meanwhile, three policemen, including an SHO, were injured when an APC was targeted with an improvised explosive device on the Lakki-Darra Tang Section of the busy Bannu-Mianwali Road on Monday.
A police official said the bomb attack occurred near Jabbarkhel within the limits of Saddar police station and added that the injured policemen were out of danger.
According to a police statement, Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan visited the site, assessed the situation, and ordered a search operation in the area.
The district police chief said that such cowardly acts could not lower the morale of the police force. He said that Lakki Marwat police were responding vigorously to every challenge and were ready to render any sacrifice for the protection of the public.
The DPO asserted that police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khawarij and added that security had been further increased in the area.
Two terrorists killed in Lakki
Two terrorists were killed in a clash with security forces and police in the Kaichi Kamar area of Lakki Marwat district on Monday.
A police official confirmed the development and said that the security forces and police jointly launched an intelligence-based operation after receiving information about the presence of Fitna al Khawarij in the trans-river belt.
Fitna al Khawarij is the term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the operation, an intense exchange of fire took place, resulting in the neutralisation of two terrorists”, the official maintained.
The slain terrorists were identified as Sheryar alias Sheri and Irfan alias Paan. Police said they were wanted by law enforcement agencies in several terrorism-related cases, including attacks on law enforcement personnel, targeted killings, and IED blasts.
Two killed in Bannu IBO
In Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department, in coordination with local police, carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO), which left two militants dead.
According to police, following an exchange of fire on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel, two terrorists were found dead. They were identified as Sohail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman.
Police said both were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building.
Attack foiled
In another incident, militants attacked the Nala Kasho police post. However, the attack was foiled due to timely retaliation by police personnel.
Bannu DPO Yasir Afridi later distributed awards among the personnel who repulsed the attack.

ISLAMABAD: The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) confirmed the appointment of three ad-hoc judges currently performing their duties at the Islamabad High Court despite a letter by JCP member and IHC senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani questioning the competence of his colleagues.
The JCP meeting at the Supreme Court, chaired by the chief justice of Pakistan, considered the names of Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, Justice Mohammad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas from the IHC and Justice Najamuddin Mengal and Justice Ayub Khan from the BHC. Except for Justice Ayub Khan, all judges were cleared.
In his letter to the CJP and the IHC chief justice, Justice Kayani, who is also a JCP member, opposed the confirmation of his colleagues. Sources said that the judge labelled the fellow judges as ‘incompetent’ and objected to their confirmation. They said the senior puisne judge had sought the record of these judges from the high court, but the progress reports were not shared with him.
He subsequently received this information from the JCP Secretariat, and the record provided by the secretariat formed the basis of his letter. During the meeting, the JCP discussed the contents of the letter as well as measures to regulate the provision of judges’ records to the JCP members.
During the meeting, the hit-and-run accident involving Justice Asif’s son also came up. The judge had found himself embroiled in a controversy following an accident by his underage son that killed two girls on the spot. IHC CJ Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Kayani appreciated that Justice Asif did not use his official position to influence the aggrieved family. Subsequently, Justice Kayani and Justice Munib Akhtar did not vote for him.
The commission, however, recommended, by majority, his confirmation, as well as that of Justice Khan and Justice Minhas, as IHC judges, after due consideration of the relevant data forms, antecedents, and evaluation of the material placed before it.
Also, the judicial commission also recommended, by consensus of the present members, the confirmation of Justice Najamuddin Mengal as a judge of the Balochistan High Court, while the confirmation of another additional judge, Justice Ayub Khan, was not approved by majority on the report of the antecedent committee.
Despite the strongly worded letter, the three additional IHC judges secured 13 votes each out of 17 votes. Two PTI members were absent from the JCP meeting, while two judges did not vote in their favour.

 

Justice Khan and Justice Minhas were appointed as additional judges in the IHC on Jan 17 last year. Justice Asif was also appointed the same day as an additional judge of the Balochistan High Court. However, he was later transferred from the BHC to the IHC.
According to the official data, Justice Minhas decided the highest number of cases in 2025. His single-bench disposal stood at 2,039; Justice Khan decided 1,841 cases in the single bench, while Justice Asif decided 1,338 cases.
CJ Dogar decided 1,236 cases, Justice Kayani 1,081, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri 706, Justice Babar Sattar 387, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan 347, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir 812, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz 685, and Justice Khadim Soomro 529.
Meanwhile, the JCP met in different compositions to deliberate on key institutional and policy matters, besides making recommendations for the confirmation of ad-hoc judges. It will meet again on Tuesday to confirm the appointment of 12 SHC judges.
The commission also discussed the criteria for nominating judges of the constitutional benches of different high courts, policy decisions regarding the interview of candidates for the appointment of judges, and amendments to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (Appointment of Judges) Rules 2024 for the inclusion of a provision for the appointment of judges of the FCC, as inserted by the 27th Amendment.
Following deliberations, the JCP authorised the committee headed by Justice Aamir Farooq to place recommendations before it regarding the procedure for interviews, and amendments to the rules, ensuring effective and transparent implementation of the constitutional framework.

“We will have to transform the entire system and become an export nation on an emergency basis, otherwise, the dependence on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and friendly countries for financial support would continue,” said Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal at a news conference on Monday.
He conceded the country’s export performance in first four months (July-October) was not satisfactory even though exports grew by around 1pc. He also said there were genuine questions and impatience why GDP was not growing fast quickly but it was a pragmatism decision of the government not to rush for growth through consumerism as was done by the previous government in 2022.
To gain quick growth to 6pc in 2022, the then government facilitated consumerism by opening imports which increased growth rate but created $50bn trade deficit that evaporated the country’s foreign exchange reserves and then led to massive devaluation and inflation whose impacts are felt even today despite corrective measures.

Ahsan Iqbal says special cell to be created at PM Office for addressing hurdles to achieving ‘40pc growth’ target

“We don’t have to go for artificial growth but the one which is backed by all sectors of economy including agriculture, industry and exports for sustainable path. This can only be done through pragmatism. If we were to break free of external crutches and achieve economic independence, we have to leapfrog exports. There is no other option,” he said.
The minister said a committee he led proposed comprehensive measures to the PM, including announcement for an export emergency, rapid payment of refunds and a special unit in the PM Office with a dedicated hotline tasked with listening to exporters and businesses issues for settlement on emergency basis.

 

He said the committee had also proposed allowing the industrialists and businesses negotiate with their employees to give up long holidays on special occasions against special incentives and payments to avoid break up production cycles. He said other proposals had been framed in consultation with 20 high priority potential sector for export growth.
He said the prime minister had taken those proposals very seriously and had constituted another committee, led by the deputy prime minister and represented by the ministries of finance, planning, economic affairs and other public and private stakeholders for implementation. These recommendations would be finalised next week and presented to the PM for an implementation strategy.
“There is no other way to gain economic sovereignty. The question is how fast we grow our exports,” he said, otherwise the country would again need IMF or friendly countries’ support or both.
He said the government was engaging with the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) to make export plans with local chambers at district level.
The minister conceded that uncompetitive energy prices were a challenge and also because of IMF programme but these conditions should be put to best use to reform agriculture, fiscal and energy sectors in two years for accelerated growth immediately after 2027.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court finally settled into its newly renovated building on Constitution Avenue on Monday, where FCC Chief Justice Amin­uddin Khan presided over a bench to resume hearing challenges to the imposition of the super tax inside the refurbished Courtroom No. 1.
Before the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan inaugurated the new court building in a simple ceremony attended by Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamir Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi and K.K. Agha, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rashid, FCC Registrar Hafeez Khan, along with lawyers and staff of the new establishment.

 

The FCC has a total sanctioned strength of 13 judges. Soon after its establishment, the FCC was shifted to the Islamabad High Court on a temporary basis, though it was originally envisaged that the new apex court would be housed in the building designated for the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). The FCC had to move to the IHC after FSC judges resisted the plan and denied access to their premises.
Courtroom No. 1 has been completely revamped with new furniture and fixtures, replacing the older seating, along with the installation of a modern audio system to facilitate lawyers and litigants.
However, a senior lawyer expres­sed disappointment over the curre­ntly available facilities in the buil­ding. “Neither is there a bar room for lawyers nor any canteen for litigants inside the FCC,” Advocate Tallat Abbas Khan told Dawn, adding that lawyers had no choice but to cross the road and enter the Supreme Court building just to sit and rest after a day’s work.
He said that since the FCC had become the country’s top court, it would attract a large number of lawyers and litigants in the future, but the facilities currently available were in­­sufficient to cope with the expected volume.
Inside Courtroom No. 1, lawyer Rashid Anwar complained before a three-judge bench headed by the FCC chief justice, hearing the super tax case, that he could not determine how much time he had consumed during arguments as there was no wall clock in the courtroom.
At this, the chief justice obser­ved that the present set-up lacked several facilities, but assured that the issues would be addressed soon.
Referring to a request regarding video-link facilities to different cities, the chief justice said that while the facility was currently not available, it might be provided in the future.
The new FCC building houses seven courtrooms, though only three are currently functional, all located on the first floor. Recently, 22,910 cases were transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC.
Litigant Facilitation Centre
In a separate development, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi inaugurated a newly constructed room for advocates-on-record and a Litigant Facilitation Centre at the Supreme Court building as part of ongoing reforms aimed at strengthening service delivery and improving access to justice.
SCBA President Haroonur Rashid, along with members of his cabinet, was also present on the occasion. The newly established centre will provide structured facilitation to advocates-on-record, enabling them to guide litigants on procedural requirements, case filing, documentation and related matters.
However, some lawyers said the facility did not adequately cater to their needs.

Sources told Dawn that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had forwarded a summary advising President Zardari to withdraw the Special Economic Zones (Amendment) Ordinance, 2026.
In his remarks during the year’s first NA session, PPP’s Naveed Qamar had not specified which ordinance was promulgated without the president’s approval when he led a walkout by the party, saying it would not participate in proceedings until the situation was addressed.
Sources in the PPP, however, had confirmed to Dawn he was referring to an ordinance related to special economic zones.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, meanwhile, said that nowadays there was an e-office through which files were approved online. “This ordinance was also approved. Staff to staff, it was considered approved,” he said in a statement.
The minister acknowledged that when the ordinance’s file was received, it did not bear the president’s signature.
“It had already been printed. A mistake was made which has been rectified,” he stated. “As a goodwill gesture, these bills were not notified because the president did not approve them,” he said.
He noted that the president had 10 days to give his assent to bills passed by a joint sitting of Parliament.
“As a goodwill gesture, these bills were not notified because the president did not approve them,” he said.
“The PPP and the PML-N have a good relationship and because of this relationship, the ordinance has been withdrawn,” the minister said. “In the future, we will approach these matters with understanding,” he concluded.
After the withdrawal of the ordinance, PPP’s Shazia Marri said the party would now attend Tuesday’s NA session.
PPP stages walkout in NA, calls move ‘shameful’
Speaking on the floor of the NA earlier in the day on a point of order, PPP’s Qamar said, “There is a very serious constitutional anomaly taking place.”
He highlighted that Parliament’s primary responsibility was to legislate. “Without the assemblies, there is only one way of legislating, which is if the president promulgates an ordinance under Article 89(1) of the Constitution,” he said.
“For the first time in Pakistan’s black legislative history, an ordinance has been promulgated without the approval or the signature of the president, which is shameful and against the Constitution,“ he alleged, without specifying what the ordinance was.
He said that for the first time, the government was “deviating from the Constitution”.
“How can you promulgate an ordinance and put it into effect without getting the president’s approval on it?” he asked. The PPP leader said that the party had not seen such a practice even during military dictatorships.
“I do not know what the government’s excuse is for doing this,” he remarked. He made it clear that the law would have no standing anywhere, including in a court of law and Parliament.
Declaring that the PPP would not participate in proceedings until the situation was addressed, he announced a walkout along with other members of his party.
For his part, Law Minister Tarar had attempted to call the PPP members back to no avail.
“Please come back and join the proceedings. Let me explain that things are going in the right direction,“ he said. He explained that an ordinance was issued on the premier’s advice and “there is no doubt that the president has to assent to it”.
Tarar insisted that Article 89 of the Constitution was subject to Article 48(1) of the Constitution under which the advice of the prime minister was binding on the president.
“It has been brought to our notice … there is something circulating on social media. Let me recheck,” he said.
He noted that “nine or 10 bills and ordinances” were pending presidential assent, and the ministry only came to know on Sunday that President Zardari had given his assent to those bills.
“Maybe it is part of that or it is not part of that,” he said.
He said the deeming clause is invoked under Article 75 of the Constitution when the bills returned by the president and passed by the Parliament in a joint sitting are not assented to within ten days. “But we never notified them out of respect for the president,“ he remarked.
He said he would speak to the relevant quarters and get back to PPP’s Qamar.
Later, PPP MNA Hussain Tariq returned to the assembly only to point out the lack of quorum. After a headcount, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq suspended the proceedings. Subsequently, the session was adjourned till 11am on Tuesday.







NA speaker gets ball rolling on opposition leader’s appointment
Separately, NA Speaker Sadiq also sought proposals for the nomination of the opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament during Monday’s session.
The post has been vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). While the opposition has accused the government of delaying the appo­intment despite them putting forward Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s name for the role, Sadiq has maintained that the delay was because the matter was sub judice.
At the outset of Monday’s session, Sadiq reiterated his stance that he could not initiate the nomination process earlier as the matter was subjudice and the NA Secretariat had been made a party in the cases.
He said that as PTI’s Ayub had withdrawn his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal, the nomination process could now be formally initiated.
“This issue had to head towards resolution only then. We would have done so if we had not been made a party [to the case],” Sadiq said.
Addressing the opposition benches, he said proposals for nominating the opposition leader may be submitted in his chambers by 3pm tomorrow (Tuesday), as per Rule 39(ii) of the Rules of Procedures.
Rule 39 confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.







Sadiq stated that the nominations should be accompanied by the signatures of members of the opposition. The count will be made at 3pm on January 14 in accordance with Rule 39(iii) of the NA rules, the speaker announced.
The MNA having the greatest numerical strength after the signature of the members shall be declared as the opposition leader.
It is worth noting that the opposition had submitted the name of Achakzai — who heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office in October 2025 rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
Speaking in the NA, Sadiq recalled that he had informed PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and opposition chief whip Malik Amir Dogar that the matter was sub judice when they had called on him in November 2025.
He highlighted that he had written letters to the opposition on Nov 19, Dec 5, Dec 19 and Dec 29 to “confirm the status”, following which Dogar submitted the required documents.
Responding to him on the assembly floor, Dogar said he had submitted an application with the signatures of 76 opposition MNAs keeping in view Rule 39.
“We are unanimously willing to provide verification however you want,” he said, reiterating that Achakzai was their choice as per PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision.
Dogar assured the speaker that the opposition would fulfil the required process tomorrow, and requested him to formally notify the opposition leader immediately.

The collaboration marks a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally developed its core technologies in-house.
A joint statement said Apple selected Google’s AI technology after a “careful evaluation” determined it provided “the most capable foundation” for the iPhone-maker’s AI ambitions.
The announcement represents a rare alliance between two companies that have long competed in the smartphone market, where Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems dominate globally.







However, the two rivals have maintained a lucrative partnership for years, with Google paying Apple billions of dollars annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices.
That arrangement has faced scrutiny from regulators, with the US Justice Department arguing in an antitrust case that the deal helps Google maintain its search monopoly, though a judge said the arrangement could continue.
Financial details of the AI arrangement were not provided.
Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the partnership was “a major validation moment for Google” and “a stepping stone” for Apple to get its AI strategy on track into 2026 and beyond.
Apple reportedly also considered partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.
The company co-founded by Steve Jobs is largely perceived to have stumbled in efforts to roll out AI capabilities across its products and last month announced the head of its artificial intelligence team was stepping down.
Apple last year delayed the release of an improved Siri digital assistant and is now promising it for later in the year.
Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech rivals have been releasing ever-improved AI models and features in a fierce race to lead the sector.
Despite the collaboration, Apple emphasised that its in-house AI system, Apple Intelligence, will be used to power its iPhones and iPads at the device-only level, maintaining what it described as “industry-leading privacy standards“.</p><small>2026-01-12 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12212532b9d51a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966581/indonesia-expresses-desire-to-expand-defence-ties-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia expresses desire to expand defence ties with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Indonesia has expressed its desire to further expand defence ties with Pakistan across multiple domains, the military’s media affairs wing said on Monday.
The development came as Indonesian Defence Minister Lieutenant General (retd) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin called on Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“The meeting focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” it said.







“Both sides underscored the importance of strengthening institutional linkages, training collaboration and defence industrial cooperation between Pakistan and Indonesia,” it added.
“The visiting dignitary lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. He also expressed Indonesia’s desire to further expand defence ties with Pakistan across multiple domains,” it said.
CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a strong and enduring defence relationship with Indonesia, based on shared values, mutual respect, and convergence of strategic interests, the statement concluded.
Meanwhile, a defence delegation led by the Indonesian minister also called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, a separate ISPR statement said.
“The meeting reaffirmed the historic and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Indonesia and focused on strengthening bilateral air force cooperation, particularly in capacity building, training and technological collaboration,” the statement said.
It added that the air chief briefed the delegation on PAF’s modernisation drive, including infrastructure development, revamped training and the induction of niche capabilities to enhance readiness for multi-domain operations.







The Indonesian defence minister praised the PAF’s professionalism, combat readiness and indigenisation achievements under the National Aerospace Science and Technology Park, expressing strong interest in expanding cooperation in training, aviation and aerospace domains, the statement added.
“The meeting reflected growing momentum in Pakistan-Indonesia defence ties and a shared resolve to deepen cooperation through sustained engagement and dialogue,” it concluded.
The meetings come a month after Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance bilateral trade, expand cooperation in health, agriculture, information technology, science and education, and deepen coordination on regional and global issues, including Palestine.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12160415ef37620.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966562/indian-rocket-loses-control-after-lift-off-in-fresh-blow-to-countrys-space-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Indian rocket loses control after lift-off in fresh blow to country’s space agency</strong></a><br><p>An Indian rocket carrying 16 loads of equipment and experiments, including an earth surveillance satellite, went off track after lift-off on Monday in a fresh setback to the workhorse launch vehicle of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
It was a second disappointment for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in about eight months, denting its reputation for reliability, with a more than 90 per cent success rate over about 60 past missions.
The PSLV-C62 lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the island of Sriharikota at 10:18am local time, carrying the EOS-N1 observation satellite and 15 other payloads developed by startups and academic institutions in India and abroad.

 


The ISRO’s mission control said the rocket performed normally for most of the flight before an unexpected disturbance and deviation from its path.
“The PSLV-C62 mission encountered an anomaly during the end of the PS3 stage. A detailed analysis has been initiated,” ISRO said in a statement, without giving further details on what had gone wrong or where the rocket ended up.







The PSLV has been central to India’s space programme, having launched missions such as Chandrayaan-1 and the Aditya-L1 solar observatory. It also underpins India’s push to open space manufacturing to private industry.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/122211394111160.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966583/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance' target='_blank'><strong>Greenland rejects US takeover ‘under any circumstance’</strong></a><br><p>Greenland’s government on Monday said it could not accept a US takeover of the Arctic island under “any circumstance”, after US President Donald Trump said that the United States would take the territory “one way or the other”.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bring the island under US control, arguing that the Danish autonomous territory is crucial for national security.
He reiterated that the United States must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future.
“The United States has once again reiterated its desire to take over Greenland. This is something that the governing coalition in Greenland cannot accept under any circumstances,” the Greenlandic government said in a statement.
On Sunday, Trump warned that if the United States didn’t take Greenland, “Russia or China will, and I’m not letting that happen”.
The US leader said he would be open to making a deal with the Danish self-governing island, “but one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland”.
Last week, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement with Denmark to show their backing for Copenhagen and Greenland against Trump.
“On the basis of the very positive declaration from the six Nato member states regarding Greenland, the government of Greenland will intensify efforts to ensure that the defence of Greenland is carried out within Nato,” Monday’s statement said.
“Greenland will always be part of the Western defence alliance,” the government added.
“All Nato member states, including the United States, have a common interest in the defence of Greenland,” the island’s coalition government said in a statement, adding that it can in no way accept a US takeover of Greenland.
“As part of the Danish commonwealth, Greenland is a member of Nato and the defence of Greenland must therefore be through Nato,” the government said.
The European Union Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius said earlier on Monday that any US military takeover of Greenland would be the end of NATO.
While Denmark has ruled Greenland for centuries, the territory has gradually been moving towards independence since 1979, a goal shared by all political parties elected to the island’s parliament.
“We are a democratic society that makes our own decisions. And our actions are based on international law,” Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen wrote on LinkedIn.
Trump first floated the idea of a US takeover of Greenland in 2019 during his first term in office, although he faces opposition in Washington, including from within his own party.
Denmark and other European allies have voiced shock at Trump’s threats over the strategic island, which has been home to a US military base since World War II.
A Danish colony until 1953, Greenland gained home rule 26 years later and is contemplating eventually loosening its ties with Denmark. Polls show that Greenland’s people strongly oppose a US takeover.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/131016112428003.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966524/iran-condemns-interventionist-statements-by-trump-other-us-officials-about-its-internal-affairs' target='_blank'><strong>Iran condemns ‘interventionist statements’ by Trump, other US officials about its internal affairs</strong></a><br><p>Iran, which has accused the US and Israel of fomenting the ongoing unrest in the Middle Eastern country, said on Monday it strongly condemned “interventionist statements” by US President Donald Trump and other officials regarding its internal affairs.
Trump has warned Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on the protests and also said on Sunday that he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against protesters.
Iran’s latest condemnation of his statements came in a press release titled “Fact Sheet on Recent Protests in Iran”, which was shared by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the social media platform X.







In the statement, Tehran expressed “deep concern regarding overt and increasing foreign interference in the country’s internal affairs and recent protests”.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the interventionist statements made by the president of the United States of America and other American officials,” it said.
“Such coercive and unlawful positions constitute a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of UN Charter and international law, particularly the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention, and effectively amount to encouragement of violence and terrorism against Iranian citizens. These reckless statements are not unprecedented.“
It was recalled that days earlier, the US president had “publicly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force, including the prospect of renewed military attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities and its defensive capabilities“.
The press release also mentioned economic pressures on Iran, resulting from universal coercive measures.
“The extensive imposition of unilateral coercive measures had a direct and adverse impact on the Iranian people’s livelihood and economic situation, severely restricting the country’s financial resources, disrupting trade and investment, impeding access to essential goods and services, and consequently intensifying economic pressure on ordinary citizens,” it said.
In a reference to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the statement said: “The prime minister of the Zionist regime has made blatantly interventionist statements regarding Iran’s internal developments and has portrayed himself as sympathetic to the Iranian people.
“Such claims are profoundly deceptive, particularly considering the aggressive actions of this regime against Iran, which have resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 Iranian citizens.“
It further stated: “Decades of criminal actions by the Zionist regime against the Iranian people cannot be concealed by rhetorical manoeuvres and or hypocritical behaviour. It is evident that the Zionist seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion.
“Statements by him and certain hardline American officials amount to incitement to violence, terrorism and criminal acts,” it added.
The statement also recalled that on December 28, 2025, following an increase in foreign exchange rates, sector-based protest gatherings were formed by some traders in the Tehran Bazaar, motivated by economic concerns.
The escalating protests in Iran, which began in December last year in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirm its commitment to its obligation under international human rights law regarding respecting and protecting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed under the Constitution.
“Government recognised the lawful demands of peaceful protesters and started utilising all available capacities to address the demands,” the statement added.
However, it continued, a distinction should be made between peaceful protests and riots or violent acts.
“Just as Iran considers itself fully committed to supporting and protecting the right of its citizens to peaceful and lawful protest, it is equally obliged to prevent threats to public security.
“Accordingly, it must adopt necessary legal and preventive measures to confront any form of violence that endangers the lives, property, or psychological well-being” of its citizens and society. Within this framework, the rights of millions of peace-seeking Iranians will not be compromised due to the actions of a very limited number of violent individuals,” it said.
It further stated that no international official, mechanism, or human rights body “expect law-enforcement forces to remain indifferent to armed or violent acts occurring simultaneously with or alongside peaceful assemblies, or to allow perpetrators of violence free rein to impose damage, harm, or costs on society and peaceful protesters”.
“Nevertheless, a significant portion of the peaceful and fully lawful protests by some bazaar merchants and members of the public, held in protest of the country’s economic conditions, were exploited — due to foreign interference — by a very small group, and in some cases escalated into violent and even armed clashes with law enforcement forces at protest sites.
“These acts bore no connection to the legitimate demands of the protesters nor endorsed by most of the population.”
At the same time, the statement said, Iranian authorities observed instances of violent unrest perpetrated by a limited number of individuals, including attacks on police stations, the use of incendiary devices such as Molotov cocktails against law enforcement officers and, in some cases, the use of firearms.
“Such actions constitute serious crimes involving violence against people and destruction of public property and fall outside the protective scope of peaceful assemblies under international human rights law.
“It is evident that such violent acts, including the use of weapons and various types of hand-made explosive devices by terrorist groups, not only harm public security and endanger the lives and property of citizens, but also undermine the peaceful nature of protests and give rise to public concern as explicitly underscored in the remarks of the supreme leader on January 3, 2026.”
The statement further added: “Despite the occurrence of violence by some individuals, law enforcement forces have acted with restraint and in accordance with applicable laws, exercising utmost care to restore public order and security while minimising harm and observing human rights principles, including necessity and proportionality.“
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar discussed “current developments in Iran” with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi during a phone call, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
“[The] DPM/FM reaffirmed the importance of sustained dialogue and engagement. Both sides agreed to continue to maintain close contact,” the FO said.







Trump weighing tough options
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests.
He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June.
“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.
“The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters.
Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days.
“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.







Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
‘Not seeking war but fully prepared’
Following Trump’s statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said.
Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.”

 

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.
Near paralysis
In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis.
The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse.
There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown.
One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy.
The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States.
State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel.
Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests.
After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed.
President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence.
Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’
The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic.
“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media.
Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag.
“The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said.
In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah.
The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.</p><small>2026-01-12 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/122104081a2190b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966579/kp-speaker-swati-seeks-in-camera-briefing-on-military-operations-from-peshawar-corps-commander' target='_blank'><strong>KP Speaker Swati seeks in-camera briefing on military operations from Peshawar Corps Commander</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati has requested the Peshawar Corps Commander to give an in-camera briefing on military operations being carried out in the province’s merged districts, it emerged on Monday.
In a letter dated January 8, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the speaker said that the KP Assembly had constituted a 40-member special house committee on September 8, 2025 to examine the overall security situation in KP.
Swati said that the committee comprised more than 40 members, including the leader of the house, the leader of the opposition, provincial ministers, parliamentary leaders of respective political parties and members of the KP Assembly, reflecting a “broad-based and representative forum of the house”.
The speaker said that in pursuance of the committee’s mandate, it had received detailed briefings from key stakeholders — including from the chief secretary, the additional chief secretary of the Home and Tribal Affairs Department and the provincial police chief — which was regarded as essential input for the committee “prior to the finalisation of its findings and presenting a report to the house”.
Swati said that during the second meeting of the special committee, the members further resolved to engage all political parties and relevant stakeholders across the province.
He also noted that a grand peace jirga was held on December 12, 2025, which “unanimously adopted a comprehensive declaration outlining a roadmap for long-term peace and stability in the province”. He further said that the declaration was also shared with the federal government.
“In continuation of the consultative process, the committee desires to receive a detailed briefing from Headquarters XI Corps, Peshawar, particularly in the context of the ongoing operations being conducted by the federal government and law enforcement agencies in the merged districts of KP,” he said.
“The committee acknowledges the importance of security measures, however, it considers that operations alone, without broader political, social, and developmental initiatives, might not ensure sustainable peace and stability and could risk further unrest in the province,” he said.
“In view of the sensitivity of this matter, I am further directed to request that an in-camera briefing for the special committee kindly be arranged at the KP Assembly on a mutually convenient date and time,” he said.
He said that the committee would highly appreciate the Corps Commander’s cooperation in this regard, which would assist it in discharging its constitutional responsibility.
Security sources, however, said the Corps Commander had not received any such letter and termed sending a direct communique from the office of the KP Assembly speaker a violation of official protocol.
They said that under the Constitutional and administrative framework, the provincial government lacked the authority to directly contact the Corps Commander or General Headquarters (GHQ) for any kind of formal, in-camera or institutional briefing from the military.
“In this regard, the legal and recognised procedure is that the provincial government sends the matter in writing to the federal government; the federal government forwards it to the General Headquarters through the Ministry of Defence and then formal instructions are issued from there to the relevant formation,” a security source said.
Security sources also said that by ignoring clear, established and legal procedure, the PTI government’s act of writing directly to the Corps Commander was not only a violation of Constitutional order but also a deviation from the established institutional principles of civil-military relations.
Sources said that GHQ had authorised the day-to-day liaison or routine coordination but an in-camera briefing was by no means a routine matter, adding that it required the federal government’s approval.</p><small>2026-01-12 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121930304363909.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966574/govt-castigates-kp-cm-for-saying-state-should-give-evidence-of-kabuls-soil-being-used-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt castigates KP CM for saying state should give evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday took strong exception to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi saying the state should provide evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan.
In a media interaction at the home of PTI leader Alamgir Khan on Sunday night, Afridi said that the state should give evidence for the claim that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism in Pakistan. He said that other countries also shared a border with Afghanistan but they did not have the same complaints.
The clip was also shared by state broadcaster PTV on the social media platform X.







In a post on X, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Afridi was speaking as Afghanistan’s “spokesperson“ which was highly “condemnable and shameful”.
“The whole world has seen evidence of the Afghan Taliban regime’s support for terrorists, and there is also irrefutable evidence that Afghanistan’s soil is being used for terrorist activities,” Tarar said.
“Sohail Afridi has reached the peak of lies and hypocrisy. The Pakistani nation has made immense sacrifices while fighting terrorists,“ he said. He added that whenever the party opened its mouth, they always facilitated terrorists.
“Pakistan’s development is unacceptable to Fitna al Khawarij which is why Pakistan is targeted,” he said. The minister concluded that Afridi needed to “come to his senses”.







Speaking to the media in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry said that it had been the PTI’s “consistent policy” to create “uncertainty” on national issues, adding that they also refrained from calling perpetrators of terrorism terrorists.
“They are always reluctant to call terrorists terrorists and say things that spread doubt amongst the common man,“ he said.
He also held neighbouring countries responsible for terrorism, saying that one was “investing” while the second was “implementing”.
He took strong exception to Afridi’s remarks, saying: “The KP CM, once again, said in Karachi that we should provide the Afghan government with evidence of terrorist activities.
“Do you still not know who’s behind terrorism?“ he asked. He said that at least two dozen countries had pointed out that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism.
“They intentionally spread doubt. They do not want military operations. They do not want to expel illegal Afghans and want to negotiate instead of taking action,“ he said.



“There must be a reason for this soft attitude,” Tallal said. “They have something in common, and I’ll say it on record: there has not been even a single attack on any PTI leader, worker, adviser, minister in the past 11 years,“ he alleged, criticising the party for ”spreading doubt“.
“You create ambiguity in the minds of common people, so the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other groups may operate in KP and also get the sympathies of the common man,” the state minister added.
Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister questioned whether party leaders had taken the time to meet with the families of martyrs.
“You stand against the national narrative because you are a beneficiary,” Tallal said.
“Let me say this again: no matter if you are a chief minister or an ordinary representative, speaking against the national narrative or spreading any doubt will not be tolerated,” he warned.
Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister said that the PTI “could run 100 political movements“ but having a soft stance on terrorism or forming a narrative in favour of terrorists would be unacceptable.
“We will send you where we are going to send them. If you have such empathy for them, then go to Afghanistan,” Tallal stated.
“Over 1,200 people have been martyred; families and children have been killed in bombings; 60-70pc of incidents take place in KP,“ he added.
“What is more important: to run a street movement or stand alongside our security forces and martyrs against terrorism?”
The state minister accused the PTI of trying to create unrest “so it can be weakened and then blackmailed, and you (PTI) can benefit”.
“There will be no softness,” he warned. “We will not tolerate even a word coming in favour of those terrorists from any of your leaders. We will not tolerate the ambiguity anymore.
“There is no space for terrorism in Pakistan. Sympathisers will be treated like terrorists. If you love Afghanistan that much, then leave or we’ll send you there,“ he said.
The state minister warned that nobody would be allowed to “play with the blood” of Pakistanis, either through narratives or weapons.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal termed Afridi’s remarks “upsetting” and stated that KP witnessed the most terrorist incidents in the country.
“As far as proof is concerned … when we had dialogue with them (Afghan Taliban) in Doha and Istanbul, Afghanistan did not deny that their soil is being used for cross-border terrorism, but they denied that they have control over it,” he said in a video statement posted to X.







“Our demand was for them to take control of the situation.”
The minister questioned whether the KP CM was acknowledging the sacrifices of security forces and civilians and noted that major terrorist attacks, including the bombing outside an Islamabad district court, were linked to Afghanistan.
“If you mistakenly became the chief minister of a province facing such challenges, then please stop giving such upsetting and shameful statements,” Chaudhry said.
“Your statement today is like rubbing salt in the wounds of the families of martyrs and slain civilians,” he added.
The minister then noted that Pakistan had provided evidence and footage on the international stage, which showed terrorists crossing over from Afghanistan.
“Pakistan remains a friendly nation to Afghanistan, but no country forms relations based on internal security,” he said. “We have served the Afghans for 40 years, housing 4 million Afghan refugees as our guests and brothers. There is still a large number of them here.”
“However, Pakistan’s security and the safety of the people are our responsibility and we will fulfil it in any circumstance. Afghanistan also wants the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that no terrorist group can use its soil to attack Pakistan in these cowardly acts,” Chaudhry added.
“If they continue to attack, we will deal with them and send a message to Afghanistan telling them to stop engaging in this game.”</p><small>2026-01-12 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121756465afa118.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966572/info-ministry-rubbishes-claims-of-pakistan-being-used-as-a-base-for-possible-us-strike-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Info ministry rubbishes claims of Pakistan being used as a base for possible US strike on Iran</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has rejected claims circulating on social media alleging that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support the United States for a possible military strike on Iran, which has been rocked by protests in recent weeks.
The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to “propaganda machineries in Afghanistan“ and Indian accounts, particularly identifying three handles — Khurasan Media Urdu, Baba Banaras and Afghan Defense.
Among them, a post by Khurasan Media Urdu claimed that “special American aircraft have reached Pakistan for an attack on Iran”. The post also mentioned “unusual” flight activity of US aerial refuelling and surveillance aircraft between Pakistan and Iran.
A post by Afghan Defense repeated the claim.
Baba Banaras’ post made a similar claim, stating: “Multiple US reconnaissance aircraft and cargo planes with weapons landed at Dalbandin Airbase and Pasni Airbase of Pakistan. Looks like the game has been set for Iran.”
The ministry’s fact check account said false claims had been made “that the US has moved aerial refuelling (KC-135R) and surveillance aircraft to Pakistan, that these aircraft are conducting unusual flights towards or into Iranian airspace, and that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support US stealth fighters (F-35/F-22) for a possible imminent military strike on Iran”.







The post added that while it was true that the activity of US aerial refuelling aircraft had increased, it was not from Pakistan. “Reuters reported the US moved a large number of refuelling aircraft to Europe as Middle East tensions rose,” the ministry clarified, referring to a June 2025 report.
It also referred to a June 2025 report by The Washington Post, which it said mentioned Pentagon dispatching “refuelling aircraft to European bases as posture expanded”.
The ministry’s post further stated: “No credible outlet confirms that US KC-135R/ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) aircraft are operating in Pakistan.”
It reiterated that “US refuelling aircraft movements have been reported, but mostly linked to Europe”.
“No credible proof that US aircraft/ISR are based in Pakistan. No credible proof of Pakistan-to-Iran operational flights for strikes,” it added.
It recalled that Pakistan had “publicly condemned US strikes on Iran” — ostensibly a reference to Islamabad’s stance during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, during which the US also carried strikes in Iran.
“This clearly denied the ‘Pakistan is facilitating strikes’ story,” the information ministry said. “This is a reckless, blame-pushing narrative that tries to drag Pakistan into a US-Iran conflict without any verifiable evidence.”
It said that the claim that “US aircraft arrived in Pakistan for Iran strikes’ is purely disinformation”.

 

The claims have surfaced as tensions are growing between Iran and the US, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on ongoing protests in the Middle Eastern country. Iran subsequently issued stern statements in response.
On Sunday, the Iranian government — which blames Washington and Tel Aviv for fomenting the unrest — warned the US of retaliation against its military bases and Israel if the Trump administration attacked the country over a crackdown on protesters.
The same day, Trump said he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against the protests. He also said, “The leaders of Iran called [yesterday], … a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
A subsequent statement by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he added.</p><small>2026-01-12 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12192514c0905f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966576/noor-surges-into-world-top-30-after-karachi-open-boosts-pakistani-squash-players-rankings' target='_blank'><strong>Noor surges into world Top 30 after Karachi Open boosts Pakistani squash players’ rankings</strong></a><br><p>Noor Zaman surged in the global squash rankings to break through in the Top 30 on Monday and reach a career best after a scintillating performance at last week’s Karachi Open that saw all six Pakistani players at the tournament improve in the PSA list.
Noor reached world number 30 on the Professional Squash Association (PSA) rankings, having achieved his previous career best of 37 on October 27 after a series of international wins.
The 21-year-old gave former world champion Mohamed Elshorbagy a run for his money as he took the Englishman to five intense games at the Karachi Open quarterfinals before being defeated 3-2, thereby ending Pakistan’s streak at the international championship.

 

Noor, the U23 world champion at the same venue last year, is no stranger to strong comebacks and lengthy, five-game matches. He was narrowly defeated in the fifth game with a match scoreline of 11-2, 11-8, 6-11, 8-11, 11-9.
Former world number one Elshorbagy called Noor one of the most focused players he’s ever seen.
“It’s great for Pakistan to have someone coming up, you guys need another world champion coming up soon since you’re a squash nation, and it’s very exciting for Pakistan to have Noor,” Elshorbagy said after the match.
Ashab Irfan, Noor’s only other compatriot in the Top 50, jumped up two spots for a career best 45 on PSA’s list.
Ashab also gave former world champion Karim Gawad a scare when he took the Egyptian to a five-game match that saw Gawad take the last three games with a scoreline of 7-11, 9-11, 11-8, 11-5, 11-5.
The duo were accompanied by two men and two women, wildcard entrants.
Although veteran player Nasir Iqbal surged 35 places in the ranking to sit at world number 99, he has a career best of 35 achieved in February 2016.
Nasir was Pakistan’s only wildcard entrant to advance to the Round of 16, where he was defeated 3-1 (11-6, 7-11, 11-7, 11-5) by Egyptian teenage sensation Mohamad Zakaria, who won the championship title in front of a packed audience on Sunday.
Like Nasir, Tayyab Aslam surged 50 points in the rankings to reach 149, which pales in comparison to his all-time high of 41 achieved in January 2021.
Tayyab was ousted 3-0 in the first round by Spain’s Iker Pajares (11-6, 11-2, 11-7).
Nasir and Noor were part of Pakistan’s Asian Games squad in 2023 to win a silver medal in the men’s team squash event.

 

Over on the women’s side, Sana Bahadar and Mariam Malik also achieved career-best rankings despite being knocked out of the Karachi Open in the first round.
Sana, who is entirely deaf and cannot speak, broke into the Top 200 to sit at 197. Her previous career best was 212 in Jan 2023. She was defeated 11-4, 11-1, 11-6 by Egypt’s Mariam Metwally.
“I was emotional when I found out Sana is deaf. I’ve never competed against a deaf player before, and it makes me realise how much we take for granted when you see her overcome the obstacles she has to reach this level,” world number 35 Metwally told Dawn after her match with Sana.
PSA’s latest rankings see Mariam at 214, up from 248, also in Jan 2023. Mariam was defeated 3-0 by Sin Yuk Chan of Hong Kong, China (11-2, 11-4, 11-0).
“It’s definitely a big margin to lose by, but it’s also a matter of trust to be playing at a gold level event like this,” Mariam, 22, told Dawn after her match.
“I can’t remember the last time a Pakistani woman player competed at a competition of this calibre, which helps build up local players like myself and my teammates.”</p><small>2026-01-12 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1218335677e4836.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966571/uk-regulator-investigates-musks-x-over-concerns-on-grok-sexualised-deepfakes' target='_blank'><strong>UK regulator investigates Musk’s X over concerns on Grok sexualised deepfakes</strong></a><br><p>Britain’s media regulator launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X on Monday to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by its Grok AI chatbot violated its duty to protect people in the UK from content that could be illegal.
“There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material,” Ofcom said in a statement.
The regulator is under pressure to act after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the images produced by Grok were “disgusting” and “unlawful”.







When asked for comment on Monday on the launch of the formal investigation, X pointed to a previous statement in which it said it takes action against illegal content on the platform — including child sexual abuse material — by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.
“Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” it said.
Grok images are disgusting: Starmer
The regulator is under pressure to act after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Thursday the images produced by Grok were “disgusting” and “unlawful”.
Musk’s X had to “get a grip” on Grok, Starmer said.
Asked on Monday whether X could be banned, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: “Yes, of course,” but he noted that the power to do so lay with Ofcom.
Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated sexual imagery, is illegal in Britain.
Additionally, tech platforms must prevent British users from encountering illegal content and remove it once they become aware of it.
X has faced condemnation in other countries over the feature, which can produce images of women and minors in skimpy clothing.

 

French officials have reported X to prosecutors and regulators, calling the content “manifestly illegal”, while Indian authorities have also demanded explanations.
X said it has restricted requests to undress people in images to paying users.
Asked about the subject recently, xAI told Reuters: “Legacy Media Lies.”
Ofcom will investigate whether X failed to assess the risk that people in Britain would see illegal content, and whether it considered the risk to children.
Ofcom said in the most serious cases of non-compliance, it could ask a court to require “payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from a platform”, or make internet service providers block access to a site in Britain.
X did not immediately reply to a request to comment on the Ofcom investigation.







British Technology Minister Liz Kendall welcomed Ofcom’s investigation.
“It is vital that Ofcom complete this investigation swiftly because the public and most importantly the victims will not accept any delay,” Kendall said in a statement.
“The content created and shared using Grok in recent days has been deeply disturbing,” she said, adding that she would update parliament later on Monday.</p><small>2026-01-12 13:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1213561047611b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966556/kp-cm-afridi-decries-treatment-by-sindh-government-in-address-to-shcba' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi decries treatment by Sindh government in address to SHCBA</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Monday that the Sindh government had not upheld the honour of the ajrak and topi and criticised its treatment of its “guests”.
The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday.
In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there.
In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi.







“I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd.
The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan.
“On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.”
Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them.
He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”.
“We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.”
He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer.
“We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said.
The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate.
“If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.”
Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against.
However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle.
Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent.
“These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”.
The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them.
Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.”
‘No Section 144 can stop us’: Salman Akram Raja
Addressing the ceremony, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said, “We talk about the constitution, we talk about the law, this is our job. No section 144 can stop us”.
“Today, our rights are being attacked again and again,” said the PTI general secretary.
He stressed that the “living Constitution and law” must be restored.
Raja also said that Karachi’s vote had been robbed “in an attempt to take away the rights of the people”.
The PTI leader said that whenever the Constitution had been attacked, the SHC had been the first to raise its voice.
“The Pakistani nation is alive, due to which the chief minister of KP has been elected,” he said. “If the vote is stolen in front of you, if the judiciary is attacked, how can we remain silent? We are an alive and proud people, we have to fight for our rights.”
He added, “This country was not made for the elite. This country is a country of farmers, no matter which province they are from“.
“We stand like a lead wall against oppression.”
SHCBA President Jamali says lawyers will participate ‘fully’ in KP convention
President of the High Court Bar Muhammad Haseeb Jamali, addressing the event, called Sindh a land of peace.
“Along with peace, this land also belongs to those who have raised their voice against oppression,” he said.
The president stressed that the bar would talk about its rights as it was independent and did not belong to any party.
He added that every citizen of this country held equal opportunities under the law.
Jamali further said that lawyers of the bar had protested the 26th Amendment, the 27th Amendment and the issue of Karoonjhar as they happened.
“We are not part of any revenge politics, nor do we support it.”
“Hold a convention in KP — we will participate in it fully,” he said.
“This Pakistan is dear to all of us. Lawyers built the country; lawyers will save it,” he added.
‘Only want supremacy of Constitution’: Amir Nawaz Warraich
Sindh Bar Council Member and head of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) Amir Nawaz Warraich, also addressed the ceremony, welcoming all those present.
He said that when any bad time came about, the bar association raised its voice against it.
“Whenever there is talk of supremacy of law and putting a curb on the Constitution, we raise our voice,” he said. “We do not support any party but only want the supremacy of the Constitution.”
Warraich added that the KBA would continue to protest against the recently passed Constitutional Amendment until the Constitution was restored to its rightful form.
Visit to Mazar-i-Quaid
Earlier in the day, the KP chief minister paid a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid, where he had also criticised the Sindh government’s treatment of the PTI delegation.
Speaking to the media, he called Sindhis a “proud nation” and said that the imposition of “such people” on a proud nation was a cruelty.
“Punjab’s false government also did this; Sindh’s false government also did this,” he said.
However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect.
“This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.”







Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission.
“This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership.
“Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”

Ilyas — a right-hand batter and right-arm leg-spin bowler — played 10 Test matches along with 82 first-class and two List-A games between 1961 and 1976, PCB said in a statement as it expressed its grief following Ilyas’s passing.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi also extended his heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved family, while also paying homage to the late Ilyas for his valuable services to the game of cricket in Pakistan.
Ilyas made his Test debut against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 4, 1964 and played his last Test match against England at Dhaka from February 28 to March 3, 1969, according to the national board.







Apart from one Test century, the opening batsman boasted a record of 12 first-class tons, having scored 4,607 runs in the format.
His solitary Test century came in the third Test match of a 2-0 home series win over New Zealand in March-April 1965. He played a masterful 126 while opening the batting as Pakistan hunted down the 202-run target in Karachi to seal the series.
He played twice when England toured in 1968-69, making 42 runs in four innings. Early on his second tour to Australia, he was struck in the face, and he was also accused of indiscipline.
Rather than fly home, he applied for Australian citizenship and ended the season playing grade cricket for Waverley in Sydney. He made his last appearance in Pakistan in the BCCP Trophy final in 1971-72 when he helped PIA to victory.</p><small>2026-01-12 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1216225475179aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966564/president-zardari-to-embark-on-4-day-official-visit-to-bahrain-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari to embark on 4-day official visit to Bahrain tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari will undertake an official visit to Bahrain from January 13-16, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement on Monday.
According to the FO, the president will be accompanied by a “high-level delegation”.
It said that during the visit, the president will hold meeting with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who is also the prime minister.
“The discussions will focus on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest,” the FO said.







“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” it added.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Earlier in September, Bahrain’s interior minister had visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-12 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12124840db4297e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966551/pmd-dismisses-reports-of-extreme-cold-wave-temperatures-to-remain-within-normal-winter-range' target='_blank'><strong>PMD dismisses reports of ‘extreme cold wave’, temperatures to remain within normal winter range</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday said that, according to the latest numerical analysis of weather data, temperatures in the coming days will stay within the “normal winter range,” dismissing reports claiming an “extreme cold wave” expected from January 16 to 25.

The weather body dismissed the reports of extreme weather, stating that “No such extreme or historic cold wave is expected during the mentioned period”.
“According to the latest analysis of numerical weather prediction models and observational data, temperatures are within the normal winter range, with no indication of widespread or persistent record-breaking conditions,” PMD said.
It urged the public to rely on official forecasts, warnings and advisories issued by the PMD.

Separately, Weather Updates PK, an independent weather agency, took to X and said that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) “has been indicating a large and rare weather scenario since yesterday” — a polar vortex disruption.
A polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles, according to the US National Weather Service.
ECMWF is a service that provides global numerical weather predictions.
It said the forecast had drawn attention on social media, with some platforms claiming that “due to severe Arctic cold winds, record-breaking negative temperature anomalies could be observed in southern Pakistan, including Karachi and its surroundings.”







Weather Updates PK clarified that the forecast made by ECMWF was “long range“ and subject to “change with each passing day”.
The weather body said that no other weather models had yet confirmed the forecast, stating that it was “not right to take it seriously”.
It further added: “However, it is true that a western disturbance is expected between January 18 and 20 […] usually, every western system is followed by a cold wave; however, there is no final confirmation about its intensity yet”.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:24</small></div><hr>
