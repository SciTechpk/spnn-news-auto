<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1321225249cd7f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960923/pcb-extends-bid-deadline-for-new-psl-franchises-amid-international-interest' target='_blank'><strong>PCB extends bid deadline for new PSL franchises amid international interest</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi announced on Friday an extension of the deadline for submitting bids for the two new franchises in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), citing growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond.
In a post on X , Mohsin said the original deadline of December 15 had been pushed back by one week to December 22, to accommodate the surge in inquiries.
“Witnessing growing interest from Europe, USA, the Middle East and beyond in acquiring new HBL PSL teams, we have decided to extend the bid submission deadline by one week to 22 December 2025,” he wrote, while quoting an earlier PSL announcement about a promotional roadshow in New York.
“Good luck to everyone excited to welcome our new franchise owners to the HBL PSL family,” Mohsin added.
The announcement came on the very day the PCB hosted a high-profile PSL roadshow in New York City, featuring current Pakistan players including T20 captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Saim Ayub, Shan Masood and Saud Shakeel, along with legends Wasim Akram and Ramiz Raja, and singer Ali Zafar.
The event followed a similar roadshow at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London last week, as part of efforts to attract global investment ahead of the league’s expansion to eight teams for its 11th edition in 2026.
The addition of two new franchises marks the PSL’s first major structural growth since 2018, when Multan Sultans joined as the sixth team.
The auction for the new teams is expected to follow shortly after the bidding process concludes.
Mohsin, who also serves as Pakistan’s Interior Minister, has been vocal about elevating the PSL’s global standing, including recent pledges for transparent bidding and infrastructure development.
The league’s expansion is seen as a step towards enhancing its commercial appeal and competitiveness on the international T20 circuit.</p><small>2025-12-13 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13194529275d195.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960899/information-minister-accuses-pti-of-promoting-character-assassination-politics-of-hatred' target='_blank'><strong>Information minister accuses PTI of promoting ‘character assassination, politics of hatred’</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI of promoting “character assassination and politics of hatred” in the country.
He also blamed the opposition party for “conspiring to mislead the young generation”.
“There had been a tradition of decency and respect in Pakistan’s politics before the PTI. PML-N President Nawaz Sharif always promoted a culture of tolerance in the country. But contrary to this, the PTI promoted character assassination and politics of hatred,” Tarar said at a book launch ceremony in Lahore on Saturday.
Recalling the 2013 elections, the minister said when PTI founder Imran Khan, who has been in jail for over two years in multiple cases, got injured after falling from a crane, Nawaz Sharif immediately cancelled his public rallies as a “gesture of sympathy”.
“Politics of hatred and division have ruined Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) over the past 12 years under the PTI rule as well. The PTI government in KP has no performance to show. Not a single hospital in KP can be compared to Lahore’s Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute and Research Centre (PKLI) during this period,” he lambasted.
The information minister further said the PTI caused severe damage to the country and its economy and that the slogan of “change” was used to bring destruction.
“The international institutions are now acknowledging improvement in Pakistan’s economy,” he claimed.
He added Nawaz’s core mission was providing relief to the people.
“The Sharif family played a vital role in promoting industrial development in the country, while development projects bear the hallmark of Nawaz’s leadership,” he said, adding that the elder Sharif introduced the politics of public service in Pakistan and that every major development project carried his name.
The minister further claimed that the national economy had gained stability under the leadership of the Sharif brothers.
The war of words between members of the PTI and the ruling coalition has continued, particularly in recent days, after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6..</p><small>2025-12-13 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1311484075ed9f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960880/rt-india-deletes-x-post-about-pm-waiting-to-meet-putin-says-it-may-have-been-misrepresentation-of-events' target='_blank'><strong>RT India deletes X post about PM ‘waiting to meet’ Putin, says it ‘may have been misrepresentation of events’</strong></a><br><p>RT India has deleted a post on social media platform X about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “waiting to meet” Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that it “may have been a misrepresentation of events”, it emerged on Saturday.
The development came as PM Shehbaz was in Ashgabat to attend an international forum. On Friday, the premier met a host of leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov and Putin.
“Great interactions with world leaders. Pakistan shining at the global stage,” said Information Minister Ataullah Tarar on X on Friday night, sharing a video of PM Shehbaz shaking hands with Putin as the two stood in what appeared to be a hallway.
He also termed the meetings with Putin, Erdogan and Pezeshkian “warm and cordial exchanges”.







Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media Mosharraf Zaidi also shared the same video, saying PM Shehbaz had “productive meetings with his peers from all the countries” that attended the forum.
“The customary warmth in relations was in ample evidence as the prime minister shared the day with President Erdogan, President Putin and a host of other key world leaders,” he said.







The same video was also shared by the Russian embassy in Pakistan.







However, RT India, appeared to have shared a different video, which has since been deleted from X.
In a clarification issued late on Friday night, it said, “We deleted an earlier post about Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif waiting to meet Vladimir Putin at the Peace and Trust forum in Turkmenistan. The post may have been a misrepresentation of the events.”
RT India is the newest branch of Russia’s state-funded global media network. Putin had launched the RT India news channel last week during a visit to New Delhi.







According to Indian media, the original RT India post stated that PM Shehbaz waited for Putin for 40 minutes before “growing tired and gate-crashing” the Russian leader’s meeting with Erdogan.
“He left ten minutes later,” Times of India and Hindustan Times quoted the original post as saying.
Meanwhile, Russia’s RIA news agency reported that PM Shehbaz had later joined the talks between Erdogan and Putin, which had lasted 40 minutes behind closed doors.
In a remark on the situation, Tarar told Dawn: “No need for any comment on an Indian outlet which posted a fake story then deleted it, calling a misrepresentation of facts.”</p><small>2025-12-13 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1319144969153e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960900/pm-shehbaz-says-economy-out-of-the-woods-key-indicators-show-wonderful-performance' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz says economy ‘out of the woods’, key indicators show ‘wonderful’ performance</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the country had exited a period of economic turmoil and jeopardy, with its key indicators now showing “wonderful” performance due to the government’s efforts.
The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of an economic free fall has eased, but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path, marked by weak growth, heavy debt, and limited relief for households.
Projections by the Fund, released early on Tuesday alongside the statement announcing a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that the country’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026.
Addressing the launch ceremony of the National Regulatory Reforms in Islamabad, the prime minister said the national economy was in a very difficult situation when the current government took the reins.
“Through our outstanding teamwork, excellent planning and untiring efforts, I can say today with a sense of relief and achievement that Pakistan is economically out of the woods; our mega indicators are wonderful,” he said, pointing to the news of the recent release of the $1.2bn IMF tranche.







The premier said the government was now focused on and discussing how to move forward and grow the economy with foreign investment in “attractive areas of mutual benefits” such as agriculture, information technology, and mines and minerals.
“We have a very young population, a youth bulge. We are offering them vast opportunities for vocational training and with international certification. They will find productive jobs not only in Pakistan but abroad, making Pakistan richer and prosperous.”
He termed the launch of the regulatory framework as a “quantum jump” that would facilitate the business community, industry, agriculture and foreign direct investment, adding that it would also eliminate the “immense waste of time and resources” in the country that led to corruption and nepotism.
“We are able to now announce and let the nation know … that the government is fully aware of the challenges of the day and they are ready to walk with them with the speed they want us to walk,” the premier added.
PM Shehbaz also thanked the British government for its support.
The prime minister said that the United Kingdom had been a great partner in the country’s progress.
He also said that Pakistan had a “wonderful relationship” with the United States and was looking forward to a “wonderful time of mutual cooperation”.
Earlier, Special Assistant to PM for Industry and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said today was more than a policy moment as it also marked a turning of the page.
He said that, among the many reforms the government was undertaking, one stood out as foundational: the transformation of Pakistan from a regulatory state into a developmental state.
Khan added that the regulatory reform was not an isolated effort, but part of a wider transformation guided by three pillars: tariff rationalisation, regulatory modernisation, and export-led industrial revival.
“Under the new national tariff policy, we are moving towards predictability, competitiveness and phasing out of arbitrary duties,” he added.
UK Minister for International Development and Africa Baroness Jenny Chapman also highlighted the full potential, prospects of entrepreneurship, availability of natural resources and Pakistan’s place at the centre of global trade.
Terming the reforms as a positive achievement, she said these were the ambitions that both the UK and Pakistan shared.
“The links between our people play a huge part in the flow of trade and investment between our two countries as well. Trade is now at 5.5bn pounds a year. We’ve got a new trade dialogue and we’re supporting Pakistan’s efforts to work with the 1.6 million-strong Pakistani diaspora in the UK to unlock private capital,” she added.</p><small>2025-12-13 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13190431d467d97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960898/us-ukraine-to-discuss-ceasefire-in-berlin-before-european-summit' target='_blank'><strong>US, Ukraine to discuss ceasefire in Berlin before European summit</strong></a><br><p>Germany will host US and Ukrainian delegations over the weekend for talks on a ceasefire in Ukraine, before a summit with European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Berlin on Monday, a German official said.
A US official said President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans.
The choice to send Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia regarding a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress after nearly four years of war since Russia’s 2022 invasion.
The White House had said on Thursday Trump would send an official to talks only if he felt there was enough progress to be made.
Show of support for Ukraine
“Talks on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine are taking place in Berlin this weekend between foreign policy advisers from, among others, the US and Ukraine,” a German government source said on Saturday when asked about the meetings.
On Monday, Merz is hosting Zelenskiy and European leaders for a summit in Berlin, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe as Kyiv faces pressure from Washington to sign up to a peace plan that initially backed Moscow’s main demands.
Britain, France and Germany have been working in the last few weeks to refine the US proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces.
Merz said in a speech on Saturday that Europe had to brace for a fundamental shift in its relations with the US while facing a growing threat from Russia.
“The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe, and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists as we knew it. And nostalgia won’t change that,” he told a party congress in the southern city of Munich.
“The Americans are now very, very aggressively pursuing their own interests. And that can only mean one thing: that we, too, must now pursue our own interests.”
Attacks cause blackout in Odesa
The European Union has sought to shore up Ukraine’s position by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.
Ukraine meanwhile has battled to contain Russian advances on the battlefield and the frequent bombardment of its energy and water supplies going into winter.
The southern Black Sea port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered blackouts on Saturday after a large missile and drone attack on the electricity grid that left more than a million households without power, officials said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, said “peace is not far away” and that he hoped to discuss a peace plan with Trump.
Erdogan had told Putin on Friday that a limited ceasefire in the war, focused on energy facilities and ports in particular, could be beneficial.
“The Black Sea should not be seen as a battleground. Such a situation would only harm Russia and Ukraine,” Erdogan said in comments released by his office on Saturday.
Russia attacked two Ukrainian ports on Friday, damaging three Turkish-owned vessels including a ship carrying food supplies, Ukrainian officials and one ship-owner said, days after Moscow threatened to cut Ukraine off from the sea.

Addressing the ceremony, Bilawal said, “These National Games were not merely a competition of speed, strength or skill; they were a celebration of Pakistan itself.
“From Gilgit-Baltistan to Gwadar, from Khyber to Karachi, from Lahore to Larkana, every athlete who competed here carried the colours of their province but stood united under one flag,” he said.
He said that Sindh was “proud” to have hosted the sporting event.
“To our athletes, you are the pride of Pakistan. Whether you return home with medals or memories, you return as ambassadors; ambassadors of discipline, perseverance and national unity.
“You have shown us what Pakistan’s youth can achieve when given the opportunity and encouragement,” he said.







“Sport teaches us teamwork, courage, respect for rules and resilience in the face of challenge. These are not just sporting values, they are national values,” Bilawal said.
Talking about the May conflict with India, the PPP Chairman said that the army, airforce and navy demonstrated professionalism, coordination and strength.
“Pakistan emerged victorious with its sovereignty defended and its honour upheld. This victory was not only a military victory, it was a national one. It reflected the unity of our people, the discipline of our forces and the unbreakable bond between the nation and those who stand guard over it,” he said.
“As these National Games conclude, may the friendships formed here endure, may the lessons learnt here guide us and may the unity displayed here continue to define our federation,” he concluded.</p><small>2025-12-13 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13174501cd1fef6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960896/fans-vandalise-india-stadium-after-football-star-messis-abrupt-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Fans vandalise India stadium after football star Messi’s abrupt exit</strong></a><br><p>Angry spectators broke down barricades and stormed the pitch at a stadium in India after football star Lionel Messi, who is on a three-day tour of the country, abruptly left the arena.
As a part of a so-called GOAT Tour, the 38-year-old Argentina and Inter Miami superstar touched down in the eastern state of West Bengal early Saturday, greeted by a chorus of exuberant fans chanting his name.
Hours later, thousands of fans wearing Messi jerseys and waving the Argentine flag packed into Salt Lake stadium in the state capital Kolkata, but heavy security around the footballer left fans struggling to catch a glimpse of him.
Messi walked around the pitch waving to fans and left the stadium earlier than expected.

Frustrated fans, many having paid more than $100 for tickets, ripped out stadium seats and hurled water bottles onto the track.
Many others stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents.
“For me, to watch Messi is a pleasure, a dream. But I have missed the chance to have a glimpse because of the mismanagement in the stadium,” businessman Nabin Chatterjee, 37, told AFP.
Before the chaos erupted, Messi unveiled a 21-metre (70-foot) statue which shows him holding aloft the World Cup.
He was also expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium.
Another angry fan told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that people had spent “a month’s salary” to see Messi.

“I paid Rs 5,000 ($55) for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians. The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame,” Ajay Shah, told PTI.
Javed Shamim, a senior police official in the state, told reporters that the event’s “chief organiser” had been arrested, without giving any further details.
“There is total normalcy,” he said, adding that authorities would look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets.
State chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was “disturbed” and “shocked” at the mismanagement.
“I sincerely apologise to Lionel Messi, as well as to all sports lovers and his fans, for the unfortunate incident,” she said in a post on X, adding that she had ordered a probe into the incident.
The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the “organisation, planning, or execution” of the “private event”.
“Furthermore, the details of the event were neither communicated to the AIFF, nor was any clearance sought from the Federation,” a statement said.

Messi will now head to Hyderabad, Mumbai and New Delhi as part of the four-city tour.
His time in India also includes a possible meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Messi won his second consecutive Major League Soccer Most Valuable Player award this week after propelling Inter Miami to the MLS title and leading the league in goals.

This was stated at the 56th meeting of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC), chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, held on Saturday.
Earlier, the AGP had informed the forum, at the 55th meeting of the NJPMC, that the issue of enforced disappearances has largely been addressed through the recent amendment to Section 11EEEE of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, which requires the production of a detained person before a magistrate within 24 hours.
The AGP had assured the committee that a comprehensive mechanism to redress complaints of non-compliance with this legal requirement is being considered by the government and will be presented to the committee in its next meeting.
Today, the NJPMC deliberated on key policy issues while reviewing the implementation status of the decisions taken at the previous meeting. The committee unanimously reiterated its commitment to strengthening institutional capacity, accelerating access to justice, and ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of justice.
The meeting, convened at the Supreme Court of Pakistan building, was also attended by the chief justices of all high courts, while the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Pakistan attended the meeting on special invitation.
Commercial Litigation Corridor
On the Commercial Litigation Corridor (CLC), the committee reviewed the recommendations of the sub-committee constituted to address protracted litigation and injunctive orders in commercial, revenue, and fiscal cases.
The sub-committee’s report highlighted key reforms, including the establishment of dedicated benches, the curtailment of frivolous litigation, the constitution of a screening committee at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) level, the avoidance of coercive revenue targets for state-owned enterprises, and improvements in tribunal structures. The report, which was shared with the high courts for input, was unanimously endorsed.
The forum also decided to implement the recommendations and instructed the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) to share them with the FBR for implementation.
The LJCP was further instructed to approach the FBR with a request to establish a mechanism for taxation and revenue case management at each high court, on the pattern of the Supreme Court.
Timeline for disposal of cases
On the timelines for disposal of different categories of cases, the committee lauded the disposal of 558,474 cases out of 1,253,425 of specified categories within the notified timeframe during the preceding quarter, saying it was reflective of the strong commitment of the high courts.
The forum placed on record its special appreciation for the Lahore High Court (LHC) for deciding a record number of 465,455 cases in the notified categories.
Likewise, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) was commended for the initiatives undertaken to prioritise inheritance cases and implement the double docket regime.
The committee also asked the high courts to dispose of the oldest succession cases, up to the year 2019, within 30 days.
Attendees of the meeting appreciated the high courts for establishing model trial courts for the disposal of chronic civil and criminal cases.
The LHC disposed of 6,246 civil and 22,594 criminal cases; the Sindh High Court (SHC) 1,108 and 8,368; the PHC 308 and 332; the Balochistan High Court (BHC) 235 and 374; the Islamabad High Court (IHC) 99 and 21.
District judiciary and jail reforms
The NJPMC asked a special committee to finalize its recommendations on District Judiciary Reforms within 30 days, for consideration at the next meeting. For this purpose, the LHC chief justice was asked to convene a meeting of the reform committee in Lahore.
Referring to jail reforms, the LJCP Secretariat confirmed that the reports of the sub-committees and the consolidated action plan had been shared with the chairpersons of the Provincial Justice Committees.
Use of AI in judiciary
Following extensive consultations with experts, a draft titled National Guidelines for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial Institutions in Pakistan was presented before the committee, highlighting the finalisation of the National Judicial Automation Committee (NJAC).
The draft guidelines shall be finalized and placed before the NJPMC for approval at the next meeting.
E-filing of cases
Under the digital transformation roadmap and the launch of e-filing of cases, the committee approved the immediate initiation and implementation of e-filing in all district courts as the first phase of the National E-Court Project.
It was further decided that the high courts would review existing rules, including the relevant parts of Schedule I of the Code of Civil Procedure, or invoke their rule-making powers, as has been done by the SHC, to enable electronic filing of cases.
Family support and mediation centres
The committee appreciated the concept of establishing one-window, integrated family and women facilitation centers within judicial complexes, a proposal presented by the National Commission on the Status of Women and approved in principle, subject to the Government’s commitment to provide the necessary funds.</p><small>2025-12-13 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13135745136ae70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960887/khawaja-asif-holds-ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameed-responsible-for-nawazs-ouster-says-more-charges-to-come' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif holds ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed responsible for Nawaz’s ouster, says more charges to come</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday held ex-spymaster Faiz Hameed responsible for the ouster of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017, adding that more charges against him were to come soon.
The minister’s remarks come two days after Hameed, in a first, was sentenced to a 14-year jail term after being convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, the defence minister said, “A former head of ISI has been convicted in a trial that ran for 15 months; there are still other charges on which legal proceedings will be initiated soon.”
The defence minister assailed the former spymaster, claiming that Nawaz was ousted through a “conspiracy”.
“The removal of Nawaz, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed,” the defence minister said.
He said that Hameed, along with his “partner” Imran, was responsible for causing “significant damage” to the country. Asif also said that Hameed was “in charge of project Imran”, highlighting the 2018 general elections.
“Faiz was the most important part of that government,” the minister stated.
He said that during PTI’s tenure, the ex-spymaster facilitated the “imprisonment of opponents”.
“He used to threaten and imprison political opponents,” he said, stressing that Imran’s “vision” was materialised through Hameed. The minister also said that Hameed’s main beneficiary was Imran.
The minister termed the period a “shameful” chapter in the country’s history.
The minister alleged that “bringing Imran into power, lodging cases against Nawaz, exiling him, imprisoning his family and his party leaders and workers”, all of it was orchestrated by Hameed.
He went on to say that the former ISI chief “was given the opportunity to govern Pakistan through Imran”.
The minister said that during the ex-spymaster’s tenure, the institution used to “dictate” legislation to parliament.
“Decisions for the country’s future used to be made in the backyard of the prime minister’s house,” he said.
He noted that after Hameed’s transfer, his “project” started to slowly “unravel”. He went on to say that as a corps commander, Hameed continued to facilitate Imran.
He further alleged that Hameed was involved in the violent riots in the country on May 9, 2023.
“It was his planning; people within the institution also played a part, but the manpower was PTI workers,” he said. “It was a joint venture by General Faiz,” he claimed.
At this point, the minister paused to correct himself for calling Hameed a general. “I keep saying general because it has only been four days since his title was revoked,” he said.
He further maintained that the “conspirators attempting to prop up Imran today and bring him back to power, all these seeds were sown by Faiz.”
“These two personalities can not be separated,” he stressed.
Calling the May 9 riots an “attack” on the sanctity of armed forces, he emphasised that the same armed forces had raised the nation’s pride after the operation “Bunyan ul Marsoos” against India in May.
It brought Pakistan international acclaim, the minister said.
“Now imagine, if Faiz and Imran’s plans had succeeded, where would we be today?” he warned.
“God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said.
In his concluding remarks, the minister vowed to continue the “process” of accountability, stressing that “Pakistan’s enemies will be held accountable”.
“Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power can not be considered Pakistanis. Whether they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-13 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13145901d994583.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960891/indonesia-flood-death-toll-passes-1000-rescuers' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia flood death toll passes 1,000: rescuers</strong></a><br><p>Devastating floods and landslides have killed 1,003 people in Indonesia, rescuers said on Saturday as the Southeast Asian nation grapples with relief efforts.

With vast tracts of territory hit, 1.2 million residents have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters.
Frustration has grown among flood victims, who have complained about the pace of relief efforts.
President Prabowo Subianto said on Saturday the situation has improved, with several areas which had been cut off now accessible.
“Here and there, due to natural and physical conditions, there have been slight delays, but I checked all the evacuation sites: their conditions are good, services for them are adequate, and food supplies are sufficient,” Prabowo said after visiting Langkat in North Sumatra province.
Costs to rebuild after the disaster could reach 51.82 trillion rupiah ($3.1 billion) and the Indonesian government has so far shrugged off suggestions that it call for international assistance.</p><small>2025-12-13 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13142239b452fc6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960889/cdf-field-marshal-munir-says-pakistan-army-fully-focused-on-internal-external-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir says Pakistan Army fully focused on internal, external challenges</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Saturday that the Pakistan Army remained fully focused on both internal and external challenges, including hostile hybrid campaigns, extremist ideologies, and divisive elements seeking to undermine national stability.
According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), he made the remarks while visiting the Gujranwala and Sialkot garrisons, where he was “briefed on the formation’s operational readiness and key initiatives for strengthening combat preparedness”.







During the visit, CDF Field Marshal Munir witnessed field training exercises and advanced simulator training facility, “lauding the formation’s high professional standards and overall state of readiness”.
“Emphasizing the significance of technological adaptability, he noted that modern warfare demands agility, precision, situational awareness and swift decision-making,” the ISPR handout said.
While interacting with officers and soldiers, the CDF lauded their high morale and steadfast commitment to national security while underscoring the importance of rigorous and mission-oriented training, it added.
“He emphasised that Pakistan Army remains fully focused on both internal and external challenges, including hostile hybrid campaigns, extremist ideologies, and divisive elements seeking to undermine national stability,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-12-13 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13134306dbb917e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960888/1-killed-9-injured-as-speeding-bus-collides-with-trailer-on-m4-near-khanewal' target='_blank'><strong>1 killed, 9 injured as speeding bus collides with trailer on M4 near Khanewal</strong></a><br><p>A bus hostess was killed while nine other passengers were injured when a speeding bus collided with a trailer on the Pindi Bhattian-Faisalabad-Multan Motorway (M4) near Khanewal late on Friday night.
According to a statement by motorway police, the Lahore-bound bus, which was headed to Multan, collided with a trailer near Khanewal. Police said that the bus hostess succumbed to her injuries on the spot, while nine passengers were injured.
The statement said that the accident occurred due to the driver’s “negligence and sleepiness”.
It added that the injured, four of whom were in critical condition, were shifted to the Khanewal District Headquarters Hospital.
Meanwhile, dense fog again forced motorways to close temporarily early on Friday, which reopened after 11am once visibility improved.
The National Highway and Motorways Authority (NHMP) temporarily closed the entry of traffic at several points; M2 from Lahore to Kot Momin, M3 from Faizpur to Darkhana, M4 from Pindi Bhattiyan to Faisalabad, M11 from Lahore to Sialkot, and M5 from Multan to Sukkur.
Heavy fog also descended on national highways, causing low visibility in Manga Mandi, Phool Nagar, Jamber, Patoki, Mian Channu, Khanewal, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Ahmadpur Sharqia, Taranda Muhammad Panah, Rahim Yar Khan, and Sadiqabad.
The spokesperson for the motorway police, Syed Imran Ahmad Shah, in a statement said that travellers should ensure they follow lane markings on the road to avoid accidents.
He said that people should travel during the daytime as heavy fog was causing a sharp reduction in visibility on the roads. He said that drivers should use fog lights and avoid travelling at night for their safety.</p><small>2025-12-13 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1311430214594c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960883/analysts-say-us-package-to-keep-pakistans-f-16s-combat-ready-through-2040' target='_blank'><strong>Analysts say US package to keep Pakistan’s F-16s combat-ready through 2040</strong></a><br><p>The $686 million defence package offered to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump’s administration this week will transform the country’s ageing fleet of F-16 fighter jets into a modernised force capable of operating securely and efficiently alongside contemporary air forces, according to defence experts and officials.
At its core, the upgrade will allow the F-16s to operate safely and effectively for at least another decade and a half by extending their service life, strengthening secure communications, enabling real-time sharing of tactical data, and ensuring sustained maintenance through comprehensive parts, training, and support.
Enhanced mission planning and testing tools included in the package will also improve pilot proficiency and overall mission effectiveness. Beyond specific equipment, a substantial portion of the package is devoted to spare parts, maintenance, engineering, and logistics support.
This includes replacement components, repair parts, technical documentation, engineering assistance, and logistics services. Training for pilots and maintenance personnel, along with simulators and technical manuals, is also included to ensure sustained proficiency as systems evolve.
According to analysts, the equipment the US has agreed to provide will make Pakistan’s F-16s fully networked, interoperable, and operationally viable well into 2040.
The Brussels-based International Crisis Group (ICG) has described the package as “a continuation of a long-standing relationship,” highlighting “the need to maintain Pakistan’s F-16 fleet for regional stability, despite India’s concerns over its use against New Delhi”.
ICG analyst Praveen Donthi told Al Jazeera that “extending support for Pakistan’s jets remains a core part of US-Pakistan ties, with continuity from the Biden to the Trump administration”.
He added that the package includes advanced technologies and new avionics to keep the jets combat-ready until 2040 — a move India views as potentially strengthening Pakistan’s offensive capabilities.
According to Janes, a leading global provider of defence and security analysis, “the inclusion of Link-16 in the Fighting Falcons of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) would allow the aircraft to access networked information from command centres and ground units, enhancing their combat capabilities”.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia specialist, has said in interviews with several news outlets that while “the optics of the deal might suggest leverage” and could serve as a pressure point in US-India trade and defence negotiations, the package “has a logic of its own,” rooted in long-standing US support for Pakistan’s American-made aircraft.
Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) places the deal in a broader strategic context.
In a report released earlier this year, it said that between 2020 and 2024, more than 80 per cent of Pakistan’s weapons imports came from China, reflecting Islamabad’s growing reliance on Beijing for major defence platforms.
Chinese J-10 fighter jets played a prominent role in the May conflict, and Pakistan continues to diversify its air power in ways that reduce dependence on the United States.
A letter by the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) sent to Congress on December 8 regarding the sale stated that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations”.
The letter noted that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
It added that the updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns”.
The letter also emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addressed regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”</p><small>2025-12-13 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130818091008059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960720/un-expert-decries-imrans-detention-calls-on-authorities-to-ensure-compliance-with-international-standards' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Imran’s detention, calls on authorities to ensure compliance with international standards</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.
Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.”
The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions.
“I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement.

 

“Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.”
“Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison.
Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled
Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account.
“According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool.
“You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.”







Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers.
However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach.
“The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform.
Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters.
“I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-13 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10234104c7d1a18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959545/what-happens-when-you-let-women-live-alone-pakistan-needs-to-find-out' target='_blank'><strong>What happens when you let women live alone? Pakistan needs to find out</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s prolonged economic downturn is not driven by policy failures alone — it is also fuelled by the systematic underutilisation of its most capable women. Cultural norms that restrict women’s mobility, police their autonomy, and dictate their living arrangements, have become economic barriers, keeping productivity low and growth stagnant.
Pakistan could unlock this economic potential by confronting one of its most rigid social boundaries: women’s freedom to live independently in urban centres.
This article makes a case for a segment already positioned to contribute: urban, educated, skilled, and financially capable women, while recognising that many working-class women also live alone out of necessity or opportunity. Their struggles differ in context but not in significance, facing even harsher structural obstacles. Their participation in the economy is equally critical.
If accelerating growth, reducing brain drain, and closing gender gaps are national priorities, then enabling safe, viable independent living for women in major cities must finally be treated as an economic imperative.
The cost of excluding women
Pakistan’s female labour participation rate sits at a concerning 22.6 per cent for women aged between 15 and 64, which is significantly lower than the world average of 52.6pc, and even lower than the South Asian average of 25.2pc. According to the World Bank, a 10pc increase in female labour participation could increase Pakistan’s GDP growth by 1.5pc annually.
Countries with similar cultural foundations have already demonstrated this. Bangladesh leveraged female-intensive industries to improve GDP and reduce poverty levels. Saudi Arabia, after easing restrictions on women’s mobility and employment, saw an increase in billions to their economy within years. Vietnam attributed significant portions of its growth to educated women entering productive sectors at scale.
In Pakistan, however, even educated women frequently choose to opt out of the workforce or exit early. The reasons being predictable: restricted mobility, lack of safe transport, hostile work environments, and most crucially, a cultural expectation that they must live with their family until marriage, regardless of their professional needs.
“Being brought up in Pakistan, I was always told that I will go from my mother’s house to my husband’s house. The only interim freedom you get is if you go abroad for university,” reflected Elsa Sajjad, who lives with her sister in an apartment in Karachi. “I didn’t go abroad, but those who do, they get a taste of freedom and then it’s snatched back.”
While the decision to migrate abroad for better opportunities is understandable, the loss of these women — artists, academics, designers, lawyers, engineers, doctors — inflicts a drain on human capital Pakistan can no longer afford. Remittances soften the blow, but they do not compensate for the long-term erosion of youthful innovation, research capacity, and domestic talent pipelines.
If women had the option to live independently in city centres, closer to workplaces, training hubs, and universities, they would be less enticed to build their futures abroad.
Benefits of living alone
Ample evidence from across the world suggests that when educated women have control over their time, mobility, and finances, they are more likely to invest in skills development, career advancement, and entrepreneurship. Independent living for women in Pakistan, for those who can afford it, directly supports these outcomes.
“It made me grow up a lot faster than my friends. You’re working, you’re also paying your own electricity and gas bills, and you also have to keep savings aside in case of medical emergencies,” Sajjad pointed out.
Women in joint households shoulder disproportionate unpaid labour. Studies show Pakistani women spend up to 10 times more hours on domestic responsibilities than men. Living independently would allow women to reallocate this time toward networking, internships, freelance work, and degrees and certifications.
“I started my own company, which I could do because of the peace of mind I have. I don’t have to worry about silly things like household tiffs,” added Sajjad.
Women living alone in urban centres can avoid long commutes, unsafe travel, or family-imposed curfews that hinder employment. Living near business districts and transit hubs not only reduces transport costs and safety risks, but also increases workforce reliability, a crucial factor in gaining economic efficiency.
When educated daughters support themselves financially, families experience higher household income, reduced economic burden on parents, greater investment in the education of their younger siblings, and improved social mobility. Independent living also disrupts intergenerational poverty traps, especially for families who struggle to support adult daughters indefinitely.
“Not only am I supporting myself financially, but I can also support my mother,” Sajjad noted.
A rise in independent female tenants would expand rental markets, women-only hostels, co-living spaces, and local services such as laundries, transport, food, and security. This microeconomic ripple will strengthen the service sector, which is already Pakistan’s largest contributor to GDP.
Many women leave Pakistan not because they lack opportunity but because they lack agency over their lives. Facilitating independent living will keep human capital at home.
Living alone also compels women to confront the cycle of fear they have long been conditioned to stay within, ultimately making them more resilient and confident as they navigate the realities of household duties, maintenance issues, tenant rights, and even bribe-hungry police officers who try to take advantage of women driving alone.
“As a woman living alone in Pakistan, the law doesn’t always protect you,” Sajjad emphasised. “It pushed me to do things many women might not consider — like learning the basic laws every Pakistani woman should know. I studied workplace regulations, sexual harassment laws, and driving rules. There have been times when police tried to intimidate me, but now I know my rights and can stand my ground.”
The barriers: Real, serious, and solvable
A meaningful conversation around women’s independence and autonomy must acknowledge the barriers they face in attempting to live alone in Pakistan’s major cities. The most immediate challenge is financial. Even for educated, urban professionals, the cost of rent, utilities, transport, and basic living expenses can be prohibitive without the shared resource of a family household.
“Even the reason I have roommates is economic. I can’t afford rent by myself,” Yusra Amjad remarked, who rents an apartment in Islamabad to be closer to her place of employment.
The economic burden is compounded by discriminatory practices in the housing market, where landlords frequently refuse to rent to single women, demand the involvement of a male guardian, or impose intrusive questioning about marital status and daily activities — requirements less frequently applicable to male tenants.
It is also unconventional for unmarried men in Pakistan to live apart from their families, but the social implications based on gender vary greatly: women are often labelled as dishonourable and shameful, while men are praised as responsible and ambitious for prioritising their careers.
Safety remains an even more pressing concern. In many neighbourhoods across Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and other major cities, urban design offers little consideration for women’s security. Street harassment, break-ins, and the constant threat of gender-based violence dictate where women feel safe to live.
Even when a woman does find suitable housing, navigating the city independently brings its own set of risks. Public transport is often unreliable and unsafe, especially after dark, and ride-hailing services, while widely used, are not immune to harassment or predatory behaviour.
“I would call Careems and they were very unreliable. Some of the cars were very sketchy; I would get in and hope they wouldn’t break down,” recalled Maha Shahid, who once lived alone in her grandmother’s house in Karachi. “I would call them at the end of the street, never to my gate, because you never know who you’d get. I took little precautions like that, and I would always try to get out of the office before dark.”
In most cities, for those without a car, ride sharing is the only option. Trains, buses, and other forms of transport are inaccessible and widely unavailable, especially for women. For example, in Islamabad, a metro system has recently been established, but the stations are situated sparsely, and reaching them is another challenge.
“How am I getting to the metro? Am I calling an Uber to the metro? In New York you can walk to the bus. But here it becomes kind of counterintuitive,” said Amjad.
These constraints make late work hours, night classes, internships, and networking events far less unobtainable to women who rely on safe and reliable mobility to advance their careers.
Social scrutiny adds another layer of deterrence. Neighbours, building guards, and even extended family often view a woman living alone as a challenge to cultural norms, subjecting her to suspicion and moral policing. This informal yet pervasive surveillance fosters a hostile environment, deterring women who have the financial means and professional need to live independently. In an already conservative society, the perceived “impropriety” of a single woman managing her own home can translate into daily stress, reputational risk, and familial pressure to abandon the arrangement altogether.
“Women living alone are much more vulnerable in a country like ours. People are more likely to make judgements about their character,” relayed Amjad.
Yet, crucially, none of these barriers are insurmountable. They are symptoms of structural gaps — unregulated rental markets, insufficient women’s housing, inadequate urban planning, and a lack of gender-conscious transport policies — that can be addressed through both public reforms and private-sector innovation. Other countries with comparable cultural norms have expanded women-only hostels, implemented legal protections for single female tenants, strengthened public transport systems, and introduced safe co-living spaces that blend affordability with security. Pakistan can do the same. The obstacles are real, but so are the solutions.
Reframing the cultural conversation
Independent living for women in Pakistan is still seen as a radical challenge to cultural norms, but viewing it solely as a moral or social issue ignores its broader economic significance.
It is crucial to separate religious doctrine from cultural practice: Islam grants women the right to own property, enter contracts, manage finances, and make independent decisions about their livelihoods. The unease around women living alone, then, is not rooted in faith, but in inherited social norms that no longer align with the country’s economic realities.
At a time when Pakistan is grappling with shrinking productivity, declining competitiveness, and an accelerating brain drain, maintaining restrictive norms around women’s autonomy imposes a measurable financial cost. The issue is not whether tradition should be discarded, but whether our economic future can withstand the continued exclusion of half the population from fully participating in public and professional life.
“To me it’s not about feelings but about rationality. Often, I just wouldn’t understand the why. The why has to make sense to me. If the why is just a feeling you have, to me that’s not rational so I can’t just fall into line with what my mother says,” said Shahid, reflecting on the familial backlash she faced when deciding to live alone.
While this analysis primarily examines the economic case for women’s independent living, it is important to acknowledge that many women have no choice but to live alone due to unstable or controlling households, domestic abuse, divorce, or broader safety concerns
Let the women live
Pakistan still has a long road ahead before its cities are truly safe for women to live, work, and move through without fear or scrutiny. It also has a long way to go before women’s right to choose how they live is seen as acceptable, let alone normal.
In a country so deeply entrenched in culture, tradition, and religious routine, a break from conventions, especially by women, is often considered radical or defiant. Yet acknowledging the economic potential of independent living is a critical step toward unlocking the talent that already exists within our female population.
For the segment of women who are financially capable and professionally ambitious, living alone is a decision grounded in necessity, efficiency, and ambition — qualities any society striving for progress should value rather than resist.
“The two jobs that I had in Pakistan really set me up for success. I moved back to New England and got a six-figure salary job without even networking. My work experience in Pakistan really shaped me,” Shahid explained.
Understanding the benefits of female self-determination and highlighting stories of successful independent women can help normalise these choices. The journey is not easy, but the freedom and mobility it brings make it worthwhile. Challenging tradition is rarely comfortable, but clinging to the status quo no longer serves the country.
If Pakistan hopes to rebuild its economy, retain is skilled professionals, and participate competitively in a global landscape, it must allow its most capable women the freedom to structure their lives in ways that support their productivity.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.
Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organisations.
They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa programme.

 

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement, said Trump’s administration engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas”.
The programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in speciality fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.
Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programmes say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour.
But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.
Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.
Trump’s order opens a new tab and bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment.
The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
Trump, in his unprecedented order, invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals who would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B programme have undercut its integrity and that the program threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.
He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B programme threatens the country’s economic and national security.
The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa programme and cannot, under the US Constitution, unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.
“The proclamation transforms the H-1B programme into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.
The groups argue that agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US State Department, likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.
India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.</p><small>2025-12-13 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1310195338be2f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960879/thailand-vows-to-keep-fighting-cambodia-despite-trumps-ceasefire-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand vows to keep fighting Cambodia, despite Trump’s ceasefire claim</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s leader vowed to keep fighting on the disputed border with Cambodia as fighter jets struck targets on Saturday, hours after US President Donald Trump said he had brokered a ceasefire.
Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted on Facebook that the Southeast Asian nation would “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”.
Trump, who brokered a ceasefire in the long-running border dispute in October, spoke to Anutin and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”.
Neither of them mentioned any agreement in statements after their calls with Trump, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire.
“I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke,” Anutin said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the continued fighting.
Hun Manet, in a statement on Saturday on Facebook, said Cambodia continues to seek a peaceful resolution of disputes in line with the October agreement.
Since Monday, Cambodia and Thailand have been exchanging heavy-weapons fire at multiple points along the 817km (508 mile) border, in some of the heaviest fighting since the five-day clash in July.
Trump halted that fighting, the worst in recent memory, with calls to both leaders.
Trump, who has repeatedly said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, has been keen to intervene again to rescue the truce.
Thailand suspended it last month after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine, one of many that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia.
Cambodia, which nominated Trump for the peace prize in August, rejects the landmine allegations.
On Saturday, a Thai Defence Ministry spokesman, Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, told a press conference that clashes had taken place across seven border provinces and Cambodia had fired heavy weapons, “making it necessary for Thailand to retaliate”.
Cambodia’s Information Ministry said Thai forces had struck bridges and buildings overnight and fired artillery from a naval vessel.
Thai leader Anutin dismissed comments by Trump that a “roadside bomb” that wounded Thai soldiers was accidental, saying the incident was “definitely not a roadside accident”.
Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he had asked the US and Malaysia, which has been a mediator in peace talks, to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.</p><small>2025-12-13 05:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130952339795570.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960771/using-official-cavalcade-punjab-minister-travels-700km-to-dine-at-a-wedding' target='_blank'><strong>Using official cavalcade, Punjab minister travels 700km to dine at a wedding</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique skipped scheduled visits to public sector health facilities in Multan on Friday and rather attended a wedding ceremony along with his official cavalcade comprising multiple SUVs  and police mobile.
The visit attracted strong criticism from social media after it transpired that the minister had attended the wedding ceremony of a son of a doctor who was recently held guilty of gross negligence in a medicines theft case and was awarded a major penalty under the Peeda Act.
The minister returned to Lahore without discharging official assignments/meetings as announced officially and conveyed to the higher authorities of Multan, including the police.
The issue came to the limelight when pictures of the minister with the doctor went viral on social media where critics accused him of misusing official resources for his private trip. Multan is 340km from Lahore.

Kh Salman defends his visit being a public figure

On Thursday, the office of the minister for the Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department issued an alert for the Multan commissioner, regional police officer (RPO), deputy commissioner (DC), city police officer (CPO) and the information officer of Multan and intimated them about the official visit of Khwaja Rafique.
“Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique will proceed on an official tour to Multan as per the schedule/programme given in the letter,” reads the notification.
The office of the Punjab Health Department mentioned the official vehicles, including GBK-313 (Fortuner) and GBK- 434 (Double Cabin) in the letter to be noted for the senior officers including the commissioner, RPO and others for protocol.
They were further informed about the busy schedule of  the minister in Multan that would start from Lahore at 8:30am and reach the Circuit House in Multan at 12 noon.
As per the next schedule, the health minister was supposed to visit the Nishtar Medical University at 1pm, Nishtar Hospital at 2pm, Nishtar Hospital-2  at 3pm and would leave for Lahore at 4pm on Friday. 
Some officials in the NMU and the attached government hospitals told this reporter that the minister had not visited the places he was scheduled to visit and rather attended the wedding before his return to Lahore. 
MINISTER: Khwaja Salman Rafique clarified his position saying that being a political figure there was no bar on him to attend private ceremonies.
He said that though he didn’t visit the NMU and attached hospitals in Multan as per the officially announced schedule, he held some meetings at Circuit House which were related to the health issues.
“I spent a busy day in Multan where I attended a private marriage party and met many people being a politician,” the minister said.
“Some elements involved in corrupt practices in the health sector are trying to make my official tour controversial and I will keep hammering them for looting public funds for their vested interests,” he said.

KARACHI: Indian forces have detained 11 Pakistani fishermen, including two boys, from Pakistani waters near Kajar Creek and confiscated their boat.
However, Indian media reported that their Coast Guard had on Dec 10 apprehended the 11 Pakistani fishermen after their boat was allegedly found inside Indian waters near Jakhau.
According to Kamal Shah of the Coastal Media Centre, all 11 fishermen belonged to Ibrahim Hyderi and they were out on a fishing expedition.
As news of their arrest reached Ibrahim Hyderi, there was utter confusion and panic in their homes. The fishermen, said to be related to each other, live in close vicinity to each other, which created an atmosphere of mourning in their neighbourhood.

All those captured are residents of Ibrahim Hyderi; their families seek govt intervention

The fishermen’s families have urged that the government intervene in retrieving them.
Local residents and area leaders have also demanded that the federal and provincial governments ensure the early return of the fishermen and adopt effective strategies to protect those fishing in the sea.
The held fishermen are Safi Mohammad Tandel (aged 50), Ibraham (52), Ghulam Mustafa (31), Surmirbar (32), Habib Beela (15), Sultan Ahmed (35), Suma (51), Sarfaraz (24), Mehtab Ali (25), Zaheer (12) and Hussain Bogani (56).
‘India urged to release children’
The chairperson of the Sindh Fisheries Department, Fatima Majeed, told Dawn that it is a reality of the seas and poor fishermen that the sea has no visible borders.
“These poor folk don’t realise when they may have crossed over to the other side. The same is the case with Indian fishermen, who accidentally cross over to Pakistani waters,” she said.
Kajar Creek and Sir Creek, a little ahead of Thatta, are marshy areas from where fishermen from both countries are often arrested by the Indian authorities in the case of Pakistani fishermen and by the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency in the case of Indian fishermen crossing here from their Gujarat.
Fatima said that it is unfortunate that the fishermen arrested this time have two children, Zaheer and Habib, aged 12 and 15, respectively. “I urge the Indian authorities to release the children at least, on humanitarian grounds,” she said.
She also added that with the latest arrests, the number of Pakistani fishermen languishing in Indian jails rises to 74.

In a statement, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said Dawn is among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation. Attributed to CPNE’s president and secretary general, the statement recalls Dawn Media Group has been providing unbiased information since the creation of Pakistan.
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also spoke out against the stoppage of government ads to Dawn Media Group outlets, saying it is ‘dismayed’. “For the last 13 months, Daily Dawn was suffering from [the] curtailment of government advertising, but now the news channel and radio [channel] owned by Dawn Media has also been subjected to denial of government advertising, which is not only unjust but also [an] attack on freedom of expression,” a press release from the body read.
The APNS noted the step has been taken to “force the media group to change its editorial policy” and opined that since these ads were paid for through the treasury, they ‘should not be used as [a] tool to strangle the dissenting voices’. “The APNS expresses its solidarity with [the] Dawn Media Group in this hour of financial stifling and urges … the federal and provincial governments to review their unconstitutional decision and restore government advertising to Dawn Media Group,” it concluded.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) slammed the ban on ads for Dawn outlets as well, saying it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”.
“In an age when fake news on social media is widespread, the role of traditional media becomes even more critical,” the PBA stated. It urged the government to immediately withdraw the advertising ban “in the interest of free and responsible journalism”.
The Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, also criticised the restriction. The JAC includes office-bearers of Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, APNS, CPNE, Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors and PBA.
In its statement, the JAC said the government is using official advertising as a tool to pressure media organisations. It noted that Dawn Media Group has remained the main target of this ‘undemocratic’ measure.
It said the group had faced the withdrawal of government ads for a long time due to its editorial stance and impartial reporting, and that the same restrictions are now being applied to its TV and radio platforms as well. It demanded that the government immediately restore advertising.

Based on existing tax rates, the informed sources said the ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) has been estimated to drop by about Rs11.80 per litre (over 4pc) depending on final calculations, while petrol rate may be kept unchanged as the estimated reduction was less than a rupee per litre.
The government may also build about Rs1.28 per litre additional cost to the prices to accommodate 61 paise and 67 paise per litre higher margins to oil companies and their dealers, respectively, as approved earlier this week by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet.
The ex-depot prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Rs11.50 (6pc) and Rs10 per litre (6pc), respectively. The kerosene and LDO rates currently stand at Rs192.86 and Rs173.77 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs263.45 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class. The ex-depot price of HSD stands at Rs279.65 per litre which may drop to Rs268 per litre on Dec 15.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares on the basis of about Rs27 per litre increase between May and August and have not reversed despite Rs9 per litre cut. The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs96 per litre on diesel.
Although, general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL)

WASHINGTON: International troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as next month to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force, two US officials told Reuters, but it remains unclear how Hamas will be disarmed.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) would not fight Hamas. They said lots of countries had expressed interest in contributing and US officials are currently working out the size of the ISF, composition, housing, training and rules of engagement.
An American two-star general is being considered to lead the ISF but no decisions have been made, the officials said.

 

Deployment of the force is a key part of the next phase of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan. Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year war began on October 10 and Ham­as has released hostages and Israel has freed detained Palestinians.
“There is a lot of quiet planning that’s going on behind the scenes right now for phase two of the peace deal,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told rep­o­r­ters on Thursday. “We want to ens­ure an enduring and lasting peace.”
Indonesia has said it is prepared to deploy up to 20,000 troops to take on health and construction-related tasks in Gaza.
“It is still in the planning and preparation stages,” said Rico Sirait, spokesperson of Indonesian Defence Ministry. “We are now preparing the organisational structure of the forces to be deployed.”
Demilitarising Gaza
The Security Council authorised the ISF to work alongside newly trained and vetted Palestinian police to stabilise security “by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” However, it remains unclear exactly how that would work.
US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz noted on Thursday that the ISF was authorised by the Security Council to demilitarise Gaza by all means necessary - which means use of force. “Obviously that’ll be a conversation with each country,” he told Israel’s Channel 12, adding that discussions on rules of engagement were under way.
Hamas has said the issue of disarmament has not been discussed with them formally by the mediators - the US, Egypt and Qatar - and the group’s stance remains that it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established.
Support for UNRWA
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of eight Muslim and Arab countries issued a statement of support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees on Friday.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar affirmed “the indispensable role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in protecting the rights of Palestinian refugees and caring for their affairs”.







The statement follows a report by Reuters that the Trump administration has discussed slapping a terror designation on UNRWA.

ISLAMABAD: Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed Ankara’s readiness to contribute to a mechanism established to maintain stability amid ‘extended ceasefire’ between Pakistan and Afghanistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at an international forum on Friday urged the global community to press the Afghan Taliban to honour their international obligations and curb terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
President Erdogan made the offer during a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the international forum held in Turkmenistan, where the premier also held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon and Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov.







Addressing the event dedicated to the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality and the anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality, PM Shehbaz said peaceful dispute resolution was “a cornerstone” of Pakistan’s foreign policy. In this regard, he also cited Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and its subsequent endorsement by the UN Security Council.
Pakistan began the year by taking its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Cou­ncil, where it was working to uphold global peace and security, he said.
“While we persevere in this quest for peace, the scourge of terrorism is, however, raising its head yet again, and this time, unfortunately, from Afghan soil,” he said, urging the international community to press the Taliban government to fulfil its commitments and rein in terrorist elements operating from its territory.
PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Isla­mabad and Kabul. He noted that the ceasefire still stood though it remained ‘fragile’. He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to ‘peaceful dispute resolution’.
He also referred to the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2788 earlier this year as an endorsement of Pakistan’s approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes.
The premier said he hoped ongoing peace efforts in the Middle East would help protect Palestinian lives, ensure a lasting ceasefire, enable the flow of humanitarian assistance and support reconstruction in Gaza. He reiterated Pakistan’s support for the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine and Kashmir.
Stressing that lasting peace was intrinsically linked to sustainable development, PM Shehbaz said the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provided a blueprint for a more peaceful world and described socio-economic development as a key government priority. He said Pakistan had made progress in areas including financial inclusion and greater economic participation for women and marginalised groups.
He said Pakistan’s pursuit of sustainable development faced headwinds from climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations, adding that access to advanced technologies, particularly digital technologies, must be equitable and non-discriminatory.
He urged global leaders to treat the forum as a call for urgent action and a new paradigm in international relations, calling for investment in connectivity as “bridges for people, ideas and prosperity”. Earlier, the prime minister congratulated Turkmenistan on the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality and on the UN’s designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
The premier also joined other leaders at the Neutrality Monument, where they attended a wreath-laying ceremony before addressing the forum.
PM meets Iran president
PM Shehbaz later held a bilateral meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the forum, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Both leaders appreciated the support the neighbouring countries provided to each other when they faced external aggression earlier this year, according to the statement.
Referring to the 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission, PM Shehbaz emphasised the need to strengthen bilateral cooperation to expand trade, operationalise border markets, enhance border security and improve connectivity, including through the Isla­mabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network.







He also reiterated the need to urge the Afghan Taliban to take meaningful action to address Pakistan’s security concerns related to terrorism. The two leaders discussed Gaza as well, the PM Office said.
President Pezeshkian expressed a desire to further strengthen ties with Pakistan, and both sides agreed to maintain regular high-level engagement. Mr Sharif conveyed his regards to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
In his interaction with President Erdogan, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the significance of bilateral ties and discussed cooperation in areas including energy, the economy, defence and investment. He welcomed Turkish interest and investment in petroleum, energy and minerals and underscored the importance of regional connectivity including the revival of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail link.
President Erdogan thanked the prime minister and expressed a desire to work together to strengthen relations.

• Single Secondary School Certificate proposal still under review                  
ISLAMABAD: The Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) on Friday notified a new policy allowing students with an arts background in matric to enroll in pre-medical and pre-engineering groups (FSc) at the intermediate level.
The notification, issued by the IBCC, which is the main coordinator for all education boards, stated that arts students could register in these groups starting from the first annual examinations of 2026.
“Consequent upon the recommendation of the Sub-Committee and response received from Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PM&DC), Higher Education Commission (HEC), National Curriculum Council (NCC) and Provincial Curriculum Authorities, the IBCC Forum [meeting of all boards] in its 183rd meeting held on Dec 4-5, 2025 has unanimously resolved that the students who have passed the SSC (Arts Group) may be allowed to register for HSSC pre-medical and pre-engineering groups, effective from the [H]SSC 1st annual examination 2026 onwards,” read the notification. 
It added that the forum also recommended that “[the] concerned institutions may take appropriate measures, such as setting minimum marks/merit, threshold, conducting placement or aptitude tests, etc, in order to maintain uniformity across all boards”.
However, it continued that the final decisions for this purpose — related to aptitude test, etc — “shall be taken at the respective board level, subject to obtaining the requisite approval from their boards of governors and other competent forum, where applicable”. 
The notification has been shared with all education boards of the country. 
The meeting also approved a major shift for O/A level students. Those who pass two major subjects in O/A level will now receive equivalence in the science group rather than humanities.
SSC proposal 
The forum further discussed the abolishing of separate science and arts groups at the matriculation level and replacing them with a single Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with flexible elective subject choices. However, this proposal will be further debated in the upcoming meetings before reaching any final decision.
When contacted, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah elaborated that the change was made by all boards of the country and other stakeholders to serve the wider interests of the students.
He argued that “rigid and narrowed” policies limited opportunities and that any student capable of clearing the FSc (pre-medical and pre-engineering) curriculum should be allowed to sit in the exam. “This is a great decision to open new avenues for students,” he added. 
Asked about notification issued on Friday, he clarified that although it specifically mentioned pre-medical and pre-engineering, arts students could now also opt for any group, including ICS and I.Com. “Actually, the main issue was pre-medical and engineering and that’s why these groups are reflected in the notification.”

Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh issued the ruling on a petition filed by Jameel Ahmad seeking the quashing of an FIR registered at Police Station City Liaqatpur under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes punishment for rape. 
The complainant had alleged that the petitioner lured her into cohabitation and later married her on April 22, 2024. She claimed she later discovered he was already married and, upon her protest, he divorced her on Oct 14, 2024. 
According to the FIR, three days later — on Oct 17 — the petitioner and a co-suspect allegedly entered her home at night, where the petitioner raped her at gunpoint. 
The petitioner, however, denied the allegation of a live-in relationship and contended that the FIR was fabricated as retaliation for the divorce. He admitted issuing a written Talaq deed but argued that he had revoked the divorce on Dec 23, 2024, within the 90-day statutory reconciliation period. 

Court quashes FIR registered against petitioner 

He further submitted that he had filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, which remained pending. 
In his judgement, announced at the court’s Bahawalpur bench, Justice Sheikh noted that the central question before the court was whether Talaq had legally taken effect by Oct 17, 2024 — the date of the alleged offence. 
The judge undertook a survey of Islamic jurisprudence as well as statutory requirements under Section 7 of the MFLO, observing that although Islamic law recognises multiple forms of Talaq, Pakistani law mandates a specific legal mechanism. 
Section 7 requires a notice of Talaq to be provided to the chairman of the relevant union council, and mandates a 90-day reconciliation period. Talaq does not become effective unless this period expires without revocation. 
The judge noted that the petitioner had dispatched notice of Talaq to the union council but had subsequently revoked it before the expiry of the statutory period. 
Citing Supreme Court precedents, Justice Sheikh reiterated that failure to comply with statutory requirements renders the divorce legally ineffective, even where a Talaqnama exists under Islamic law. 
The judge observed that under Section 7(3) of MFLO, the parties remain husband and wife until either the 90-day period expires or the husband explicitly revokes Talaq, whichever comes first.  
He concluded that on Oct 17, 2024, the date of the alleged incident, the marriage had not dissolved in the eyes of the law. 
Under Shariah, the judge noted, a crime is an act prohibited by divine injunction and punishable by Hadd or Ta’zir penalties. 
In the present case, Justice Sheikh maintained, the marital bond between the parties continued to exist legally at the time of the alleged occurrence. He said the petitioner’s conduct may be considered immoral or inappropriate under religious or social norms, but prosecution under Section 376 of PPC could not be sustained as the essential ingredients of the offence were not made out on the FIR’s own assertions. 
With these observations, the judge allowed the petition and quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner.
