The senior PTI leader, incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail since 2023 in cases related to the May 9 riots, made the remarks during an informal discussion with a journalist in a courtroom.
In response to a question on “consensual” meeting with Chaudhry, the PTI leader said, “While I was in the hospital, he visited to inquire about my health. We both remained in a political party. How could I ask a guest why he came to meet me?”
Last year in November, Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood tried to gain access to Qureshi, who was hospitalised, when he was alone in his room, ostensibly to convince the senior PTI  leader to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by him.
Speaking on the current political situation, he said a solution needed to be found as “the country could only move forward with dialogue”. “Reconciliation is followed by resistance,” he said.
In reference to the dialogue between the government and opposition, he said, “[PTI’s incarcerated leader] Imran Khan has authorised Mehmood Khan Achakzai to take a decision regarding dialogues. He can make a better decision regarding the future course of action, as we are in prison with limited information.”
While speaking on the prevailing relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, he said that Islamabad had supported Kabul, and this had been our “legitimate demand” that “their soil must not be used against us”.
If Afghan Taliban “want stability, they have to maintain good relations with Pakistan” as their “road to prosperity passes through Pakistan,” he said, adding Islamabad “desires peace and Afghanistan has to support us against terrorism”.
He also spoke about relations with Iran and India, saying the situation was under control at the Iran border. Despite winning the war with India, he said, “the danger is not over yet”.
Last month, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) acquitted Qureshi in one of the cases related to the May 9 riots.</p><small>2026-01-16 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16170337f116368.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967312/pm-shehbaz-relaunches-sehat-card-health-insurance-scheme-in-ict-ajk-and-gb' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz relaunches Sehat Card health insurance scheme in ICT, AJK and GB</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reintroduced the state-run health insurance programme — popularly known as the Sehat Card Programme — in the federal capital, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Speaking at the launch ceremony of the facility in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz said, “Access to health facilities is the right of every citizen, and such facilities should be delivered to their doorsteps.”
The prime minister added that through the launch of the Sehat Card, his government had taken yet another swift step to serve the nation.
“This step is the revival of the same scheme that my leader, Nawaz Sharif, had initiated in 2016 for the first time,” he said.
The scheme was originally introduced in 2016 when the PML-N government was in power. It was made available to citizens in Punjab, Balochistan, and the then Federally Administered Tribal Areas (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), with expansion plans.
In 2019, the PTI-led government relaunched the programme under the title of Sehat Insaf Card after making some changes to it, such as the provision of up to Rs720,000 worth of medical expenses of the family of each beneficiary annually, while those earning less than Rs150,000 per annum were also covered, provided such people also contributed a little to the insurance plan.
The service was partially suspended in the federal territories for three years, while residents of Islamabad, AJK and GB were suffering since March 2024, as the service was completely suspended because the federal government had failed to clear its dues.
“Nothing is more precious in life than health, as it is needed to pursue education, to earn money, take part in sports, and defeat the opposition. Nawaz Sharif’s services will be remembered and spread on a priority basis.
“Today, the Sehat Card is being issued for Islamabad, AJK and the people of GB.”
Congratulating the Health Minister, Mustafa Kamal, health secretary, and all the members of his team, PM Shehbaz added: “It should be noted that the elite in Pakistan and across the world can afford expensive treatment for themselves and their families, but it’s very hard for a common man, orphan children and labourers to earn money.
“If they or their family members fall sick and die without treatment, the lives of their dependents become very dark.”
He added that good health and the right to treatment were every Pakistani’s right.
“I hope the health minister, the secretary, and his team, through a third party, will ensure the treatment will be provided properly. And I hope this programme will continue at speed, and you will monitor it,” he said, addressing Kamal and his team.
PM Shehbaz also said that he would talk to the chief minister of Sindh regarding the initiative based on Kamal’s suggestion.
“In Punjab, this programme is onging and billions of rupees are being spent on it. Likewise, in Balochistan and KP, the programme is running successfully. I  am sure Sindh has a similar programme, and its CM is very active regarding health and education. But I will talk to him and resolve the issue so this facility will take shape there as well.”
Total of 70 hospitals to be added to covered regions: Kamal
Speaking during the ceremony, Kamal thanked the prime minister for his guidance and efforts to make the initiative possible.
“This programme was initiated in 2016 by your government, and provinces took it up. However, it was abandoned in the federal territories for the last three years, so we’ve proposed its revival.
“Now, the government will provide free-of-charge health facilities to citizens living in Islamabad, GB and AJK, making up nearly 10 million people,” he said.
Detailing the benefits of the Sehat Card, the health minister said that citizens would be able to use their card instead of cash at hospitals.
“Today, you have resolved the problem of a lot of people. May Allah help us in sustaining this initiative. Over the last four to five weeks, your efforts led to the revival of a dead programme. When we talk about healthcare, it is a matter of preventing people from falling sick, ensuring adequate gaps in childbirth, immunising children, and providing them with clean drinking water.
“Our ecosystem of health is not in an ideal condition. Our hospitals are overpopulated, so we blame doctors for this, but a doctor, who should ideally treat 35 patients, is responsible for 350 patients.”
Kamal added that under the initiative, more hospitals will be added to all three regions, “We will add a total of 70 hospitals in Islamabad, AJK and GB,” he said. “Akin to that, people possessing the CNICs of these territories can get treatment from 16 hospitals in Karachi as well.
He, however, stated that Sindh is the only province where this card cannot be utilised. “We have shortlisted 10 urban and rural districts of Sindh. We request the prime minister to include Rs24 billion for two years in the budget. For the third year, we will make the programme self-sustainable,” Kamal said.</p><small>2026-01-16 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16125209964ce96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967306/ecp-suspends-membership-of-159-lawmakers-over-non-filing-of-assets' target='_blank'><strong>ECP suspends membership of 159 lawmakers over non-filing of assets</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday suspended the membership of 159 lawmakers of the National Assembly, Senate, and provincial assemblies who failed to submit a statement of their assets and liabilities by the due date.
The commission directed that “they shall cease to function as members with immediate effect until such statements are submitted by them,” according to a statement issued by the ECP.
On Thursday, the ECP reminded lawmakers to submit the details of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouse and dependent children, for the financial year 2024-25, warning of suspension if they fail to do so by January 15.
Syed Ali Musa Gilani, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Muhammad Akhtar Mengal are among 32 members of the National Assembly whose membership has been suspended, while Musadik Malik is among nine Senators also suspended by the election regulator.
Out of the suspended MPAs, 50 are members of the Punjab Assembly, 33 of the Sindh Assembly, 28 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, and seven of the Balochistan Assembly.
Saeed Ghani and Hafiz Naeeemur Rehman are among the lawmakers from the Sindh Assembly who failed to submit details of their assets and liabilities.
The ECP had stated that the submission was a mandatory requirement under Section 137 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137 (1) of the Elections Act, 2017 stipulates that “every member of an assembly and senate shall submit to the Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a copy of his statement of assets and liabilities, including assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day of June on Form B.”
Last year, ECP suspended the membership of 139 lawmakers after they failed to submit their annual statements of assets.</p><small>2026-01-16 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161544536269e5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967309/who-is-mehmood-khan-achakzai-the-new-na-opposition-leader' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Mehmood Khan Achakzai, the new NA opposition leader</strong></a><br><p>It was the afternoon of October 7, 1983, and former dictator General Ziaul Haq’s martial law was in effect, when a young man decided to lead a procession in Quetta to demand the restoration of democracy. Despite grave life threats, his stance remained firm, even when four of his supporters were shot dead, and dozens were injured by the authorities.
Today, the man, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has been appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly. His name for the slot was recommended by incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan last year.
In the past few years, Mehmood Khan’s name has appeared in the mainstream media one time too many. But who is this man, and what is his story?
Entry into politics
Mehmood Khan, whose name and face have been a mainstay of the opposition benches for decades, was born in the village of Inayatullah Karez, Gulistan, in Balochistan’s Killa Abdullah Khan, which at the time was part of the Quetta-Pishin district.
He received his early education in Gulistan and completed his F.Sc. from Science College, Quetta, before graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering from the Peshawar University of Engineering.
A major but tragic turning point in his life came on December 2, 1973, when his father, Khan Abdul Samad Khan, was martyred in Quetta because of his political stance.
Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai had parted ways with the National Awami Party (NAP) after the abolition of One Unit, when instead of forming a united Pashtun province by merging the Southwestern Pashtun belt with the Northwestern Pashtun belt — or restoring British Balochistan (the Pashtun-majority province) — the party accepted the merger of British Balochistan with the Brahui confederacy or states union to constitute what is today Balochistan. This decision was taken after General Ayub’s resignation, when NAP leaders had already been released, but Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai was still in prison.
In protest, Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai formed a new party called the Pashtunkhwa National Awami Party — a decision that ultimately led to his assassination. Ironically, the strongest opposition did not come from the NAP leadership or the Pakistani establishment but also from Afghan President Daoud Khan, who disliked Abdul Samad Khan’s argument of forming a separate “Pashtunistan province” by uniting all Pashtun areas.
It was during this period, after completing his education, that young Mehmood Khan was thrust directly into a political storm. Following his father’s assassination, he was nominated in the subsequent by-election, which was not just a political contest. It was painted as a clash between Afghan President Daoud and then-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
The rise of the maverick
In January 1974, just a few days before the election, Mehmood Khan received a message that a senior Afghan official wanted to meet him. Along with two companions — one of whom had been his slain father’s deputy — he went to a border village near Chaman, where the governor of Kandahar arrived in a Mercedes.
The conversation began politely, but when Mehmood Khan refused to change his stance, he was bluntly warned that this election was actually a contest between Daoud and Bhutto, and that he should withdraw and rejoin the NAP.
While his colleague could not withstand the pressure, the young and fiery Mehmood Khan displayed what has been described as remarkable courage. “This is the political legacy of my leader and father. It is the principled stance for which he was martyred. If President Daoud considers this a contest with Bhutto, then tell Daoud he has already lost,” he had said.
At a time when fear prevented anyone else from taking up the party’s leadership, this heavy responsibility fell on the young shoulders of Mehmood Khan . From the very beginning, he swam against the tides, one reason why he remains the only politician in the country who, without the support or patronage of any domestic or foreign establishment, has sustained his political existence solely through his own resilience and the sacrifices of his workers.
One purpose
In fact, Mahmood Khan Achakzai has played a central role in shaping and leading various opposition political movements in Pakistan, consistently standing for democratic rights, constitutionalism and federalism.
During General Ziaul Haq’s dictatorship, he was an active participant in the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), where he allied with progressive and democratic forces to resist military rule. In the late 1990s, he co-founded the Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement (PONAM), uniting nationalist parties from smaller provinces to struggle for provincial autonomy and equal rights within the federation.
Later, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement (APDM), he joined mainstream political forces in opposing General Pervez Musharraf’s military regime and demanding free and fair elections. More recently, Mehmood Khan was seen as a prominent figure in the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a broad alliance of opposition parties formed to challenge authoritarianism, uphold parliamentary supremacy, and ensure the sanctity of the Constitution.
In 2025, he launched the Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Aain-e-Pakistan, a new political platform aimed at uniting diverse political and social forces to safeguard the 1973 Constitution, strengthen democratic institutions, and promote civilian supremacy.
His continuous involvement in these movements reflects his lifelong commitment to democracy, provincial rights, constitutionalism and rule of law in Pakistan’s political landscape.</p><small>2026-01-16 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16143349dc2bf15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967299/achakzai-named-opposition-leader-in-national-assembly-after-months-long-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Achakzai named opposition leader in National Assembly after months-long delay</strong></a><br><p>After a months-long delay, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly on Friday.
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had named Achakzai for the opposition leader’s slot in the NA in August last year.
The notification, seen by Dawn, read: “Honourable Speaker has been pleased to declare Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai, member of the National Assembly, as leader of the opposition in the NA, with effect from January 16, 2026.”
“The notification has been issued under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007,” said a statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat.

Prior to the notification being issued, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq summoned PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Chief Whip Amir Dogar to his chambers, stating that he had a “notification to give” them.
“Come to my chamber, I have a notification to give,” said Sadiq while addressing Gohar. The three proceeded to the speaker’s chamber while the acting speaker presided over the lower house session.







After emerging from the speaker’s chamber, the PTI chairman announced that the opposition leader had been appointed.
Gohar said that the “notification was supposed to be issued yesterday; however, it was not, due to some issues.”
“Today, it has finally been issued,” he added.
“Although it was our right, we received it today after a long delay,” he further said.



Congratulations pour in
Former opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan congratulated Achakzai on the appointment, voicing optimism that he will “fulfil his responsibilities brilliantly”.
In a post on X, Ayub said, “Heartiest congratulations to Mahmud Khan Achakzai sahib, who has been officially declared as the ‘Leader of the Opposition National Assembly’.
“It is a great singular honour, and Mahmud Khan Ackhakzai sahib will, InshahAllah, fulfil his responsibilities brilliantly,” he said.







PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan also congratulated Achakzai.
In a post on X, the PTI leader said, “Congratulations on becoming the opposition leader. It’s a great honour and responsibility given to him by our leader”.
Khan expressed hope that Achakzai, in his position, “will do his best” to ensure the release of Imran and “other innocent political prisoners, including our vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi”.
He also hoped that Achakzai would put “derailed democracy back on track”.
PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari also took to social media to congratulate the opposition leader.
“I’m sure he will not let down the trust Imran Khan has put in him. Best of luck, sir,” he said.







PTI leader Ali Asghar Khan hailed the development as well and congratulated Achakzai.
“We are sure you will fulfil this responsibility with the commitment to the people’s cause we have come to expect of you.”







The Senior Vice President of PTI’s Women’s Wing, Naureen Farooq Ibrahim, also hoped that Achakzai would “fulfil his responsibilities brilliantly”, congratulating the opposition leader.







PTI’s struggle to appoint new opposition leader
On January 13, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirmed the party’s submission of Achakzai’s nomination papers to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
It was the second time that the party had formally proposed his name for the post of opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
The slot has been vacant for almost five months since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August 2025.
On January 6, NA speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had said that the process for the appointment of the opposition leader was to be initiated afresh.
The opposition had also submitted the nomination papers for Achakzai — who also heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office in October 2025.
Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
But the submission in October was made to the speaker’s office rather than to him personally.
The opposition has also repe­atedly accused the government of delaying Achakzai’s appointment, while the NA speaker had maintained until recently that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
Ayub had filed pleas in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal, but later withdrew the petitions.
Subsequently, the NA Secretariat sent a letter to PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar in December, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing was necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
Dogar submitted the required documents to the NA speaker on January 5, following which the latter had said that the constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader would be initiated afresh in the next parliamentary session.
During the January 6 NA session, the speaker formally initiated the process for the appointment of the NA opposition leader by seeking proposals for the nomination.</p><small>2026-01-16 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16135644ed33154.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967308/ecp-withdraws-schedule-of-local-body-polls-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>ECP withdraws schedule of local body polls in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday withdrew the schedule for local government polls in Islamabad.
The development came after the promulgation of an ordinance that changed the structure of local government and the mode of elections in the federal capital.
On Monday, President Asif Ali Zardari approved the ordinance, which introduces several amendments to the Local Government Act 2015. Besides replacing the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) with three town corporations, the ordinance gives the government-appointed administrator more powers and an indefinite tenure.
The statement issued by the ECP today stated that since “the structure of Local Governments and mode of Local Government Elections in Islamabad Capital Territory have been changed” after the “promulgation” of the local body ordinance, the schedule issued earlier is being withdrawn.
Thousands of people from all 125 Union Councils of the federal capital had already submitted nomination papers for the elections.
Meanwhile, the ordinance also stated that, in the absence of local government, the administrator may hold office until new local government elections are held, replacing the previous bar that the administrator’s tenure shall not exceed six months.
The ordinance also empowered the administrator to levy tax, fee, rate, rent, toll charge or surcharge.
The federal cabinet approved 14 amendments to the Act, including a change in the name of the Metropolitan Corporation of Islamabad, replacing it with town corporations.
PTI, human rights activists, civil society organisations and residents of the federal capital rejected the new amendments to the Islamabad local government system promulgated through an ordinance.
On Wednesday, Emir Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Hafiz Naeemur Rehman demanded that local body polls in the federal capital be held as per the earlier announced schedule.
“The elections should be held on time and on the basis of nominations that have been done, while the ordinance needs to be abolished and undemocratic practices need to end,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-16 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16141432e851a11.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965796/why-do-so-many-people-in-pakistan-suddenly-have-a-button-phone-its-not-for-the-vibes' target='_blank'><strong>Why do so many people in Pakistan suddenly have a button phone? (It’s not for the vibes)</strong></a><br><p>Years ago, when I got a feature phone at the age of 12 — my very first cellphone, a hefty little brick — I quickly developed the terrible habit of slamming it on the ground for dramatic effect. It was a cool way to punctuate very ordinary statements, I thought.
In reality, though, it was a ridiculous joke; a silly imitation of television drama that got old really fast, but was mostly inconsequential since the phone was a little black Nokia 2220, cheap but sturdy. Its only worthwhile feature was the single greatest game in mobile phone history — Pinball Club (sorry Snake fans). You could throw that thing off the second floor of your house at least half a dozen times before any real damage occurred, not exactly how I’d handle my current, delicate, shatter-prone smartphone — 80 per cent glass screen, 100pc pain in my clumsy neck.
Today, these small, stocky phones are making a resurgence. In the US, folks call them ‘dumbphones’ tied directly to their use case as tools for social media cleanses. In Pakistan, or more specifically, at the Saddar Mobile Market in Karachi, shopkeepers refer to these devices as ‘button phones’ and maintain a diverse collection of brand-new and second-hand options for potential customers to peruse, and — spoiler alert — they happen to be pretty popular around here.
Built to last
Of the 12.05 million mobile phone units assembled during the first five months of 2025, 54pc or 6.53 million were 2G feature phones, according to data shared by the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA). During the same period, 94pc of the mobile phone demand was met through local manufacturing and assembly, compared to the five-year (2020-2024) average of 77pc and the nine-year (2016-2024) average of 52pc, per media reports.
Hence proven: the button phone market in Pakistan is alive and pumping. But to learn more, I walked along the margins of the Saddar Mobile Market eyeing road-facing stores looking for stubby boxes of G’Five, Vivo, and the occasional second-hand Nokia — the Godsend button phone to end all button phones.
Directness seemed most appropriate, so upon locating a store that not only dealt with button phones, but had a front counter laden with refurbished landline telephones, I presented the question with what the sophisticated may excuse as ‘straightforwardness’: “Who even buys button phones nowadays?”
Stupid question; I saw it on Naveed the salesman‘s face. “The elderly, the older generation, don’t care about smartphones; they don’t like them,” he said, almost as if stating the obvious.
Set in their ways, the 16.5m Pakistanis over the age of 60, as per the latest census in 2023, seem to swear by button phones for communication. Look no further than your own grandparents.
“I could put my SIM card in any set I wanted,” said Muhammad Ilyas, an elderly salesman. He stood by his store counter at the mobile market, holding a worn-out, ancient-looking CAT button phone.
Behind him, sleek and shiny smartphones were laid out neatly on a shelf to entice customers. They do not attract Ilyas, though. “I don‘t really need one,” he said, pointing toward them. “I have this phone, and I’ll probably use it for years … because it will last forever.”
Gen Z and security concerns
The elderly are, however, not the only target market for button phones. As it turns out, Gen Z — for all their tech-savvy and screen-addicted ways, their social media branding, and apparent diminishing attention span courtesy  the constant doom-scrolling — are also as ready and willing customers.
Granted, they are not as lucrative a consumer group as the tech-averse boomers, but Gen-Z, especially those in Pakistan, do have their own vested interest in maintaining a button phone.

 

For one, security. Karachi reported about 13,213 phone snatching cases in the first nine months of 2025, according to the Citizens Police Liaison Committee, maintaining its legacy as ‘phone-snatching central’.
“Younger people prefer to keep button phones when they’re outside,” said Muhammad Irfan, who sells second-hand smartphones and tablets. He sells roughly 20 button phones a month, and a majority of them are to the younger generation.
It is a creative security measure. Simply put, a button phone a day keeps snatchers away.
Enter taxes and button phone loopholes
The sight is not strange; that one friend (or in my case, four) taking out their iPhone, the latest model, at the lunch table for ‘foodgram’. But this phone seldom rings, unless they have managed to secure the WiFi password of the restaurant. For the menial tasks — calls and messages — they have a substitute, usually a button phone.
This is yet another creative loophole that many millennial and Gen Z iPhone enthusiasts have adopted to dodge paying exorbitant taxes just to keep their SIMs alive.
Pakistan tech laws require all imported devices to be registered with the PTA, threatening to block users’ SIM cards otherwise, using its Device Identification Registration and Blocking System that tracks compliance. The regulation is not only restricted to imported phones but is also applicable to foreigners who travel to Pakistan with their unregistered devices.
But does this only impact iPhones? Why the correlation? Because iPhones are very expensive, more so than your average Android-run device. Even the most recent depreciated valuations of older iPhone models by the Directorate General of Customs Valuation range from Rs70,000 to Rs350,000. Of course, buying the phone is one thing; the taxes that follow are another bane.
Consider the iPhone 16 Plus (512GB) that was valued at $1,050 — a little over Rs300,000 — in the April 2025 valuation. For Pakistanis, an additional Rs87,219 would be required to pay off the necessary duty as per the Federal Board of Revenue’s ‘Rate of Duty and Taxes on Mobile Phones (2021-22)’.
No wonder Gen Z is suddenly so interested in the ‘so-2010’ button phones.
Endlessly appealing iPhones
But here is what bothers me. Is it really worth purchasing a six-figure iPhone and then spending more money on getting its life jacket (button phone) too?
According to Midhat, a software engineer and recent proud owner of a non-PTA-approved iPhone 15 Pro worth Rs140,000, it is. There are two reasons: security and features.
“If someone steals my iPhone and it’s screen-locked, they can’t break into it like other phones,” she explained. “Sure, there is software you could use to break into it, but that would ruin its IMEI number.”
Other brands, such as Samsung, she continued, are improving their features, but they aren’t a match to the iPhone when it comes to data security. “It also has some great features that you can’t find on other phones, like the camera.”
There is some irony here, though; you can’t get a phone stolen if it never leaves the house with you. Midhat shared that she doesn’t take her iPhone everywhere with her. “It’s such an expensive phone. You can’t take it out in Karachi. Most people I know just keep it at home and use another phone for everyday purposes.”

 

Rameesha, another iPhone enthusiast and a customer experience consultant, added that there was no sense in spending thousands on PTA registrations because, like most tech, iPhones too depreciate merely with months, given the speed at which Apple keeps updating their models.
However, particularly with iPhones, there is a “bitter reality” that is often overlooked. “They are widely recognised as a status symbol. It’s a good visual to have,” Rameesha told Dawn. Pull out an iPhone in a room full of people, and the aura flips.
And so, whether for safety, money or status, the verdict is in: button phones, once obsolete, have made a comeback in the Pakistani tech scene with quiet confidence. While they may not promise flashy cameras, seamless functionality or social clout, they are unbreakable (quite literally) and will keep you out of trouble, mostly.

She was recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case, which revolved around the purchase of an expensive jewelry set gifted to ex-premier Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during his May 2021 visit.
Bushra’s daughter, Mubashra Khawar Maneka, filed the petition through LHC Bar President Asif Niswana under Article 199 of the Constitution.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, named the Punjab government, via the home department secretary, the provincial inspector general of prisons, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
It said that Maneka was a “law-abiding citizen of Pakistan” as well as the real biological daughter of Bushra Bibi, and was “aggrieved” by the “unlawful, arbitrary, and unjustified refusal of the jail authorities to allow her to meet her mother, despite repeated requests, clear entitlement under law, and absence of any legal bar”.
“The petitioner, being her (Bushra’s) real daughter, is deeply concerned about her physical, emotional and psychological well-being,” the petition stated.
It added that under the Pakistan Prison Rules as well as the Constitution, prisoners were entitled to family visitation, particularly by immediate blood relatives, “subject only to reasonable security regulations”.
According to the petition, Maneka had made repeated visits and requests to meet her mother but had been denied access, although she had not been informed of “any security concern, restriction, prohibition or legal impediment” that justified the denial.
“The refusal is therefore arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Pakistan prison rules and the fundamental rights granted by the Constitution of Pakistan 1973,” it said.
Further, the petition said that the sustained denial of meetings over a long time had caused mental agony, emotional trauma and psychological distress to the petitioner.
It pointed out that the right to life and liberty guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution included the right to dignity, emotional well-being and family association, while Article 14 further ensured the inviolability of human dignity, including for prisoners.
The petition requested that the LHC “issue a direction to the respondents to immediately allow the petitioner to meet her real mother, Mrs Bushra Imran Khan, at Central Jail Adiala, Rawalpindi, on any designated visitation day and time deemed appropriate”.
It also requested that the court declare the denial of visitation to immediate family members without lawful justification to be “illegal, unconstitutional and void”, and to direct the respondents of the petition to adhere to Pakistan’s Prison Rules and constitutional safeguards regarding family visitation.</p><small>2026-01-16 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16113958da931a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967301/social-media-posts-case-court-directs-islamabad-dig-to-arrest-imaan-hadi-within-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Court directs Islamabad DIG to arrest Imaan, Hadi ‘within 24 hours’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad district and sessions court on Friday issued directions to law enforcement authorities to arrest lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, “within 24 hours”, warning them of contempt in case of non-compliance.
Mazari and Chattha have been facing legal proceedings in a case on accusations of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
During today’s hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued strict orders to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Islamabad, Jawad Tariq, to arrest Mazari and her husband within 24 hours.
“Take them from Pakistan, India or Afghanistan. You have 24 hours. I don’t know whether they are at sea or in the sky. Wherever they are, arrest Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha within 24 hours, otherwise contempt of court proceedings will be initiated,” the judge remarked during the hearing.
A day earlier, the court cancelled the interim bail granted to the accused after they failed to appear before the court despite repeated directions.
Judge Majoka directed the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCIA) to arrest both accused and keep them in lockup upon arrest.
Additionally, the court ordered that the statements of Mazari and Chattha be recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) via video link, should their physical presence not be immediately possible.
On January 7, Mazari and her husband submitted an application seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in the case.
The duo claimed that during a recent presser by the military spokesperson, an attempt was made to influence the ongoing criminal trial, as the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-16 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161208498843754.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967302/trump-says-he-supports-transitional-palestinian-panel-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he supports transitional Palestinian panel in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was backing the newly appointed “Palestinian Technocratic Government” in Gaza, where Washington has announced the launch of a second phase in a ceasefire that went into effect in October but remains fragile.
“I am backing a newly appointed Palestinian Technocratic Government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, supported by the Board’s High Representative, to govern Gaza during its transition,” Trump said on social media.
Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas signed off in October on Trump’s plan, which says the Palestinian technocratic body will be overseen by an international so-called “Board of Peace” that is meant to supervise Gaza’s governance for a transitional period.
In another post, Trump said the “Board of Peace,” of which Trump himself is the chair, was formed, and its members would be announced shortly.
Israel and Hamas have accused each other of ceasefire violations in Gaza, where, since the start of the truce in October, over 440 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed.

 

The ceasefire has also been tested by the failure to retrieve the remains of one last Israeli hostage, Israeli delays in reopening Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt, and Hamas’ refusal so far to disarm.
By pressing on with the second phase of the ceasefire, Washington and its mediator partners will need to tackle the vexing challenges of disarming Hamas, further Israeli withdrawal tied to the disarmament and deploying an international peacekeeping force.
The Palestinian technocratic body will have 15 members and will be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority who had been in charge of developing industrial zones, according to a statement by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey.
“These Palestinian leaders are unwaveringly committed to a PEACEFUL future,” Trump said. Many experts say that Trump being the chair of the board meant to supervise Gaza’s governance resembled a colonial structure.
He also said Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will help to secure what he called a “comprehensive demilitarisation agreement” with Hamas.
Israel’s assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis, and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.
Israel has said it took action in self-defence after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages in their 2023 attack.</p><small>2026-01-16 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/160914257f950ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967288/at-un-pakistan-voices-hope-for-early-normalisation-of-situation-in-iran-rejects-any-external-interference' target='_blank'><strong>At UN, Pakistan voices hope for early normalisation of situation in Iran, rejects any external interference</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has told the UN Security Council that it hopes for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, warning that the UN Charter and international law prohibit external interference in the internal affairs of states.
“The UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against other states’ territorial integrity or political independence, or interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the 15-member Council on Thursday evening.
The United States convened the Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Iran, with the country’s Ambassador Mike Waltz criticising the actions taken against Iranian protesters and assuring them of President Donald Trump’s support.







In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said, “We have been carefully observing developments in Iran and the region in recent days,” pointing out that new threats to regional peace and stability remain a serious cause of concern.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
A stable and peaceful Iran is in the interests of Pakistan, the region and beyond, he said, adding that his country has full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and leadership, rooted in the country’s culture, history and resilience.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad highlighted that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct, noting that the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.
Any external interference in the internal affairs of states, he added, is inconsistent with international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
“We strongly believe that all disputes must be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with international law,” the Pakistani envoy affirmed, warning that continued hostilities, use of force and unilateral actions would only deepen crises and cause unnecessary suffering.







“We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure, and that all relevant parties will return to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said in conclusion.
Opening the debate, UN Assistant Secretary-General Martha Pobee, briefing the Security Council members, called for restraint by all parties to prevent further escalation.
Pobee described the situation in Iran as fluid and deeply concerning, noting that protests continue, albeit reportedly at a smaller scale than last week.
She voiced alarm, however, over public statements suggesting possible military strikes on the country.
“This external dimension adds volatility to an already combustible situation. All efforts must be undertaken to prevent any further deterioration,” she said.
Moreover, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remains convinced that all concerns regarding Iran, including those related to the nuclear issue and ongoing protests, are best addressed through diplomacy and dialogue.
He also urged maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and called on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation.
The protests erupted on December 28 after shopkeepers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, took to the streets to rail against the collapse of the national currency, soaring inflation and worsening living conditions.
Ambassador Waltz, the US envoy, accused the Iranian government of actions against its own citizens that have repercussions for international peace and security.
“President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America stand by the brave people of Iran,” he said. “Regardless of its excuses, the regime is solely responsible for the economic misery of the Iranian people and will be held accountable.”
Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back, saying the world has been watching as the United States continues to escalate tensions and fuel hysteria around Iran.
He said that the current Security Council meeting, requested by the United States, is nothing more than yet another attempt to justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
“And if, as Washington puts it, Iran’s authorities do not come to their senses, then Washington will solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime in order to lend credibility to and justify its actions,” the Russian envoy said.
China’s Ambassador, Sun Lei, said the United States has openly issued threats of the use of force against Iran.
Stressing that China has always advocated adherence to UN Charter principles and international law, he said sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the most fundamental norms of international affairs.
“The use of force can never solve problems,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that military adventurism would push the region towards an abyss.
“No action that defies international law can be tolerated,” he added.
Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iran, said he was speaking on behalf of a nation in mourning.
“It is deeply regrettable that the representative of the United States, which requested this meeting, has today resorted to lies, distortions of facts and deliberate disinformation to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran towards violence,” he said.
He added that the United States requested the meeting in order to conceal its direct complicity in the crimes its mercenaries have committed against Iran.
“The United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,” he said.
He described these claims as particularly cynical in light of what he called the United States’ long and well-documented record of unlawful military interventions, regime-change operations and systematic violations of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.</p><small>2026-01-16 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161043503ec89c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967300/netanyahu-urged-trump-not-to-attack-iran-report' target='_blank'><strong>Netanyahu urged Trump not to attack Iran: report</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged United States President Donald Trump to delay any American military strike on Iran, according to a report by The New York Times, a development that highlights growing regional unease over the risk of a wider conflict.
Netanyahu spoke to President Trump on Thursday, the same day the US president publicly suggested that Tehran had eased its internal crackdown and halted executions, citing information from “very important sources on the other side”, remarks that were widely read in Washington as a signal of hesitation about imminent military action, the report said.
The Israeli leader’s intervention comes as several key Arab partners of the US have also pressed the Trump administration to avoid an attack on Iran, warning that such a move could trigger a broader regional war, according to a senior official from a Gulf Arab country cited by the newspaper.
Officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt have contacted senior US officials over the past two days to convey concerns that a US strike could destabilise the region, disrupt energy flows and provoke Iranian retaliation beyond US targets, the official told NYT.
At the same time, the four Arab states have been urging Iranian officials to refrain from attacking regional countries should the United States decide to strike Iran, reflecting a coordinated effort to contain escalation on both sides, the Gulf official said.

 

Two diplomats based in the region also confirmed that multiple Arab governments have privately warned Washington against military action, reinforcing a rare convergence between Israeli caution and Arab anxiety over the potential consequences of open conflict with Iran, the report added.
Saudi Arabia has articulated its position publicly in measured terms, with Minister of State Adel al-Jubeir saying in Riyadh that the kingdom believes disagreements should be resolved through dialogue and negotiations rather than military confrontation.
Netanyahu also spoke with Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday, the same day senior Trump administration officials met at the White House to review military options against Iran, underscoring how diplomatic engagement and military planning have been unfolding simultaneously, US officials told the newspaper.
The White House has offered few details about the discussions, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirming that President Trump spoke with Netanyahu but declining to elaborate, while the Israeli prime minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment, according to the report.
For the Trump administration, the episode reflects a familiar tension between projecting military resolve and avoiding another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, particularly as US allies in the region signal concern about the fallout of escalation rather than confidence in its outcomes.
The alignment of Israeli and Arab appeals for restraint suggests that, despite deep divisions over Iran’s policies, regional actors see greater danger in a rushed military confrontation than in a temporary pause that keeps diplomatic channels open, the report concluded.</p><small>2026-01-16 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16100822b675de4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967289/trump-accepts-nobel-medal-from-venezuelan-opposition-leader-machado' target='_blank'><strong>Trump accepts Nobel medal from Venezuelan opposition leader Machado</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to US President Donald Trump on Thursday during a White House meeting, as she tries to gain some influence over how the president shapes the South American country’s political future.
A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.
In a social media post on Thursday evening, Trump wrote: “Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Maria!”







Machado, who described the meeting as “excellent,” said the gift was in recognition of what she called his commitment to the freedom of the Venezuelan people.
Machado’s attempt to sway Trump came after he dismissed the idea of installing her as Venezuela’s leader to replace the deposed Nicolas Maduro. Trump openly campaigned for the prize before Machado was awarded it last month and complained bitterly when he was snubbed.
Though Machado gave Trump the gold medal that honorees receive with the prize, the honour remains hers; the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.







Asked on Wednesday if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump told Reuters: “No, I didn’t say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize.”
The Republican president long expressed interest in winning the prize and has at times linked it to diplomatic achievements.

 

The lunch meeting, which appeared to last slightly over an hour, marked the first time the two have met in person. Machado then met with more than a dozen senators, both Republican and Democratic, on Capitol Hill, where she has generally found more enthusiastic allies.
While the visit was ongoing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had been looking forward to meeting Machado, but that he stood by his “realistic” assessment that she did not currently have the support needed to lead the country in the short term.
Machado, who fled Venezuela in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump’s ear with members of Venezuela’s government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.







After the US captured Maduro in a snatch-and-grab operation this month, various opposition figures, members of Venezuela’s diaspora and politicians throughout the US and Latin America have expressed hope that Venezuela will begin the process of democratisation.
Hopes of a move to democracy
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the senators who met with Machado, said the opposition leader had told senators that repression in Venezuela was no different now than under Maduro. Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez is a “smooth operator” who was growing more entrenched by the day thanks to Trump’s support, he said.
“I hope elections happen, but I’m sceptical,” said Murphy, of Connecticut.
Trump has said he is focused on securing US access to the country’s oil and economically rebuilding Venezuela.
Trump has on several occasions praised Rodriguez, Maduro’s second-in-command, who became Venezuela’s leader upon his capture. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said, “She’s been very good to deal with.”
Machado was banned from running in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with Maduro allies. Outside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, won by a substantial margin, but Maduro claimed victory and retained power.
While the current government has freed dozens of political prisoners in recent days, outside groups and advocates have said the scale of the releases has been exaggerated by Caracas.
In an annual address to lawmakers, Rodriguez called for diplomacy with the US and said that should she need to travel to Washington, she would do so “walking on her feet, not dragged there.”
She also said she would propose reforms to her country’s oil industry aimed at increasing access for foreign investors.</p><small>2026-01-16 05:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16083926e65b8ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967267/taliban-leaders-speech-lays-bare-kandahar-vs-kabul-divide' target='_blank'><strong>Taliban leader’s speech lays bare ‘Kandahar vs Kabul’ divide</strong></a><br><p>• Report claims Hibatullah Akhundzada ‘spooked’ by possibility of schism between his hardline base in the south, more pragmatic ministers in the capital• Zabihullah Mujahid ‘confirms’ existence of audio recording, but terms BBC claim ‘unfounded’
A STARK message from the Taliban supreme leader, warning of internal threats to the Islamic Emirate, has seemingly laid bare the long-speculated divide bet­ween Kandahar and Kabul, BBC News reported.
An audio recording of a speech — delivered by Hibat­ullah Akhundzada at a seminary in Kandahar aro­und a year ago — contains what some are interpreting as confirmation of differences among top Taliban leaders.
In the leaked clip, obtained by the BBC, Akhundzada can be heard saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.
According to the investigation by BBC Afghan, two distinct groups have eme­rged within the Afghan Tali­ban, each presenting competing visions for how Afgh­anistan should be governed.
One is entirely loyal to the Akhundzada-led Kandahar faction, who is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate — isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.
The second faction is made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which — while still following a strict interpretation of Islam — engages with the outside world, builds the country’s economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.
The question was always whether the Kabul group — made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists — would ever challenge Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.
Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.
In late September, Akhun­dzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world. But just three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.
What had happened behind the scenes was seismic, insiders said. It was thought that the Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada’s order and switched the internet back on. According to one expert, this was nothing short of rebellion for a group that doesn’t brook dissent amongst its echelons.
Consolidation in Kandahar
Although Akhundzada was the lone power centre by the time the Taliban recaptured Kabul in 2021, his earlier lack of battlefield experience meant that his deputies — Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Omar’s son Yaqoob — shepherded him through the period when the group was still consolidating its power.
But once they came into power, the two powerful men were designated as mere ministers, and even a figure like Mullah Baradar — the co-founder of the Taliban movement — found himself handed the title of deputy PM.
Akhundzada — having shunned the capital in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban — began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners, the BBC noted.
The supreme leader, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban’s Sharia courts of the 1990s, quickly began announcing edicts without consultation with Kabul, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education.
Getting a meeting with him has also become increasingly difficult, as Akhundzada is said to be extremely reclusive. Photographing or filming him is forbidden and only two photos of him are known to exist. Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units — bypassing ministers in Kabul.
An observer argued that the “real authority has been transferred to Kandahar” but Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied this impression.
“All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions — all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,” he told the BBC.
In a subsequent tweet, he termed the BBC report “unfounded”. He did, however, implicitly confirm the existence of the audio recording cited as the basis for the report, only taking issue with its interpretation.
“Statements by the leadership emphasising the importance of unity and cohesion, or minor matters in which opinions may differ, should never be interpreted as disagreement… there is no fear of discord,” Mujahid wrote on his X account.
Kabul left fretting
On the other side, the Kabul group — unofficially led by Mullah Baradar — wants to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.
They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women’s education and employment.
But rather than being ‘moderate’, this faction is seen as being more pragmatic. Mullah Yaqoob is becoming increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, while Sirajuddin Haqqani has managed to rebrand himself to near-mythical status among supporters.
But despite all this, analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.

The rocket was fired from an unknown direction, resulting in a several-feet-deep crater and the collapse of the house’s ceiling.
Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
Earlier, on the night of December 31, 2025, Bannu Cantonment was also targeted in a rocket attack when a rocket landed in vacant houses near the CMH. While no loss of life occurred in that incident, property damage was reported.
According to initial information, the same type of rocket was used in both attacks, which militants have named the “Al-Farooq 2”. Following the December 31 attack, the model of the fired rocket was also widely circulated on social media.
Security agencies have launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident, while evidence is being collected from the site to determine the motives behind the attack and identify those responsible.
In another incident, militants launched an attack on the Fateh Khel police check post in Bannu.
According to Bannu Police spokesman Asif Hassan, an intense exchange of fire continued for quite some time.
The police successfully repulsed the attack, forcing the attackers to flee. However, a search operation is currently underway in the area.</p><small>2026-01-16 04:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/160847290ff0736.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967269/15-terrorists-gunned-down-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>15 terrorists gunned down in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least 15 terrorists, including two armed suspects who were killed in an encounter with the police, were gunned down in different operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Rela­tions (ISPR) said 13 members of the “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were killed in two separate engagements on January 13 and 14.
In Bannu, the security forces effectively engaged the militants’ location and gunned down eight militants following an intense exchange of fire.
The stat­e­ment read that an­other intelligence-based operation was conducted by the troops in Kurram, adding that five terrorists were killed in that operation.
Meanwhile, two armed militants were killed and a policeman was injured in a shootout between the pol­ice and the militants in Dera Ismail Khan on Thursday.
According to a police spok­esperson, the clash took place when the militants attacked the Khutti police check-post located within the limits of Dera Town police station on Wed­nesday night, triggering a fierce exchange of fire that left two attackers dead and a police constable injured.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
In a press conference last week, ISPR Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.
Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.

The day after the Jan 3 operation, he expressed doubts that Machado had the backing needed to return to the country and govern, telling reporters: “She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.” Trump has on several occasions praised Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela’s interim president, saying in an interview on Wednesday: “She’s been very good to deal with.”
A Nobel for Trump?
One potential topic of conversation for Thursday’s White House meeting was the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Machado last month, a snub to Trump, who has long sought the award.
Machado has suggested she would give the prize to the US president for having deposed Maduro, though the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.
Asked if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump said: “No, I didn’t say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize.” Pressed on what he would do if she brought the prize nonetheless, he responded: “Well, that’s what I’m hearing. I don’t know, but I shouldn’t be the one to say. “I think we’re just going to talk.”

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) was told on Thursday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s having its own narcotics law, in addition to the Control of Narcotics Substances Act (CNSA) 1997, would only undermine the federal government’s anti-drug efforts and might add to legal complications.
The arguments were advanced by the federal government before a two-judge FCC bench comprising Justices Ali Baqar Najafi and Muhammad Karim Khan Agha.
The bench was hearing a petition jointly moved by the federal government and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) seeking to set aside the KP Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019.
The controversy revolves around whether a province can enact a parallel narcotics law in the presence of Section 71 of the CNSA 1997 — a move that the petitioners argue “undermine the federal government’s authority to legislate”.
Filed against the backdrop of KP’s parallel legislation, despite the CNSA 1997 already being in effect, the petition asked the FCC to interpret the executive powers of both the federal and provincial governments under the Constitution.
The petition argued that the federal government played a vital role in controlling and eliminating the narcotics threat in the country, particularly in the processing and trafficking of heroin and charas.
It stated that the federal government had already taken effective measures to combat all aspects of the multifaceted drug problem since long.
‘Not a dispute’
During the hearing, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, representing the KP government, argued that the matter did not represent a dispute between the federal and provincial governments, as the law was duly enacted by the KP Assembly.
In response, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman questioned how a provincial law could repeal a federal legislation.
He added that once a province established its own force or agency to implement such a law, a dispute between the federal and provincial governments was bound to erupt.
The FCC adjourned further proceedings until next week.
‘Comprehensive law’
The petition expressed the concern that the provincial law repealed the CNSA 1997 within KP to the extent of cultivation, possession, sale, purchase, delivery, and transportation of narcotics.
It termed the KP law a “mala fide” and “colourable” exercise of power, seeking its declaration as illegal.

 

It stated that licensing authority for import, export, internal transport, manufacturing, and transshipment of narcotic drugs fell within the purview of the federal government under the CNSA 1997.
The provincial law, the petition contended, would create grave legal and constitutional chaos, including duplication of special courts, overlapping jurisdiction, and conflict of authority with other law enforcement agencies. This, the plea added, could lead to a legal and constitutional crisis.
The petition argued that the CNSA 1997 was a comprehensive law applicable across Pakistan to curb the menace of narcotics as airports, dry ports, seaports, and land borders fell under the exclusive control of the federal government, which exercised its jurisdiction through the ANF.
It contended that as narcotics trafficking was not only a cross-border offence but one with regional and international implications, only a federal agency could effectively deal with the menace, as the jurisdiction of provincial force extended only within its frontiers.
The petition further argued that in the presence of a federal law enacted by parliament within its legislative competence under Articles 90 and 142 and Entries 3, 26, 27, 32, and 58 of the Federal Legislative List, any provincial law would be contradictory and thus void.

The exchange companies are the third-largest component of foreign exchange inflows to Pakistan, accounting for up to $4.5 billion annually.
The foreign direct investment (FDI) has been declining, and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb admitted that international companies are leaving the country due to the high cost of production, but urged multinationals to review their business models.
At the same time, exports have not performed well, even though the government has set an ambitious target of $60 billion. This is the reason the SBP has been looking for higher inflows from overseas, for which the government is facilitating Pakistanis to go abroad and seek jobs.
The government and the State Bank are taking every measure to improve inflows and minimise outflows of dollars from the country, which is why the exchange companies were stopped from providing cash dollars to customers. Instead, they either directly transfer dollars into the customer’s foreign currency accounts or issue a cheque to get the dollars from a bank.

Move expected to boost remittances and take country towards a cashless economy

“The SBP has now allowed exchange companies (ECs) to utilise Raast, a state-of-the-art payment system launched by the SBP in 2021, to facilitate remitters and beneficiaries of home remittances,” said a circular of the central bank on Thursday.
“Through this enablement, the beneficiaries receiving remittances through ECs can receive their funds in their accounts and wallets maintained with banks, MFBs, or EMIs, in a safe and efficient manner,” said the circular.
The SBP has launched a series of measures to bring the payment system up to international standards and replace paper-based transactions with cashless ones. Globally, the digital payment system has already captured a major share of transactions. Now, the latest Chinese payment system makes it even easier, as international payments take just 5 seconds compared to the old dollar-based system, which usually takes 5 to 6 days.
“This facilitation (Raast) is a step forward in achieving the overall national objective of a cashless economy,” said the SBP.
The circular said that the digital enablement of exchange companies and the building of an innovative and inclusive digital financial services ecosystem are key objectives of the State Bank under its Strategic Plan 2023-2028. “To achieve this objective, SBP continues to strengthen digital payments infrastructure, promote innovation and redesign regulatory frameworks to facilitate cross-border transfers using secure, interoperable and customer-centric solutions,” said the circular.
“This facilitation is a step forward in achieving the overall national objective of cashless economy,” it added.
SBP reserves up $16m
The central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $16m to $16.071bn during the week ending Jan 9.
According to SBP, the country’s overall liquid foreign reserves stood at $21.248bn, including $5.176bn held by the commercial banks, during the week under review.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has announced a sweeping $500 million development package for southern Yemen following a government offensive against allied separatists, while Pakistan has urged the UN Security Council to push for an inclusive political settlement to the protracted conflict.
The development initiative, spanning 10 provinces, signals an increasingly assertive posture by the Kingdom after recent volatility in the region. Last year, the separatist South­ern Transitional Council swept through parts of the south, advancing near the Saudi border.
Riyadh declared the manoeuvre a threat to its national security and backed a military offensive earlier this month that routed the STC from power.
Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman met on Wednesday with the head of Yemen’s internationally recognised government and members of the Presidential Leadership Council to affirm the kingdom’s backing.

Pakistan urges UN to push for inclusive political deal

According to a statement on his account on the social platform X, the new projects include the construction of hospitals, schools and roads, as well as fuel donations to boost power production.







The kingdom also announced the construction of a mosque on the island of Socotra named “The Cus­todian of the Two Holy Mosques,” a reference to the Saudi king.
“This support embodies the kingdom’s keenness to enhance security and stability, and to contribute to building a better future for Yemen and its brotherly people,” the statement read.

 

Separately, Pakistan called on international powers to address the deepening crisis. Speaking to the UN Security Council, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Ahmad warned that millions are suffering due to the collapse of basic services.
“We encourage all Yemeni stakeholders and regional partners to engage constructively towards an inclusive and durable political settlement that reflects the aspiration of all the Yemeni people and safeguards regional peace and stability,” Mr Ahmad said.
The Pakistani envoy welcomed a call by the Aden-based Presidential Leadership Council to convene comprehensive talks in Riyadh.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to Yemen’s territorial integrity and opposed unilateral actions that risk deepening divisions.
Furthermore, Ahmad condemned the detention of UN and relief personnel and the seizure of UN premises in areas controlled by the Houthis, terming it a “blatant disregard for international law”.
Only two-thirds of Yemen’s children are fully immunised, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly diseases such as measles, diphtheria, cholera and polio. Ahmad urged the Security Council to act with unity to support a credible pathway toward peace.
“We hope that these efforts will result in concrete steps towards achieving lasting peace and an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people,” Ahmad said.
Meanwhile, UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg noted that in response to STC’s expansion in Hadramout and Al Mahra, Saudi-backed government for­ces moved in early January to reassert contr­­ol, emphasising that Ye­­men’s future cannot be determined by force.
Political uncertainty has devastated Yemen’s economy, eroding household resilience through rising prices and unpaid salaries. Ramesh Rajasingham, director of the humanitarian sector for the UN aid coordination office, told the Council that needs are rising while access becomes restricted.
Rajasingham warned that over 18 million people will face acute food insecurity next month.

The ministry on Wednesday issued an SRO 61(I)/2006, which said that used cars would be imported only under the “transfer of residence and gift schemes.”
Vehicles imported under the gift and transfer of residence schemes shall remain non-transferable for a period of one year from the date of importation, the SRO said.
Vehicles imported under the transfer of residence scheme shall be from the same country in which the overseas Pakistani resides. The time frame for importing the vehicles has also been extended to 850 days from the previous 700 days from the date on which the Goods Declaration for the last import under this order was filed.

Commerce ministry restricts import of second-hand vehicles to ‘gift’ and ‘transfer-of-residence’ schemes

The SRO further stated that minimum safety and environmental standards and regulatory measures, as applicable to the commercial importation of used vehicles, duly notified by the Ministry of Industries and Production or the Engineering Development Board (EDB), shall apply mutatis mutandis to vehicles imported under the gift and transfer of residence schemes.
Earlier in January, the Federal Cabinet ratified the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decision of December 9, 2025, allowing overseas Pakistanis to import used vehicles up to three years old under two schemes.
All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association (APMDA) Chairman H.M. Shahzad painted a gloomy picture of the arrival of used cars in 2026, following an influx of 40,000 used cars in FY25 and 18,000 units in 6MFY26 (first six months of FY26).
He said on Dec 9, 2025, the personal baggage scheme, which had long facilitated overseas Pakistanis, had been abolished, while the gift and transfer of residence schemes were further tightened with additional restrictions. The decision has created anxiety among overseas Pakistanis and stakeholders in the motor import business.
The government, he said, would lose millions of dollars in duties and taxes, as the import of 40,000 vehicles had contributed $500 million to the exchequer in FY25. The commercial import of vehicles has also been subjected to highly unreasonable terms, he added.
Mr Shahzad said that out of the total imports of used cars, the share of small cars (660cc) was 90 per cent, while 99pc of small cars were finding their way into Pakistan from Japan.
He said that previously, out of the total imports of used cars, 99 per cent arrived under the “personal baggage scheme.”
Regarding commercial imports of used cars, he said standard operating procedures are being formulated, but the government has already imposed a 40 per cent regulatory duty on used cars (under five years old) until June 30, 2026, on top of existing duties. He said the regulatory duty would be reduced by 10 per cent annually from FY27, reaching zero by FY30.
On Jan 12, Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers Chairman Usman Aslam Malik and Senior Vice Chairman Shehyar Qadir said that the government’s decision to regularise used car import schemes is a major step towards restoring their original intent for genuine overseas Pakistanis while safeguarding the country’s local automotive and auto parts industry.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to formally launch the project within the next couple of days.
This was one of the five health sector projects worth Rs79.35bn cleared by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) at a meeting presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal.

 

The Sehat Sahulat Programme was originally launched on Feb 7, 2018, and gradually expanded across the country and extended from the initial three years to seven years, ending June 2025 and was devolved to provinces.
Presiding over a meeting on Jan 2, 2026, PM Shehbaz approved the continuity of the programme beyond June 30, 2025, until June 30, 2027, for AJK, GB and ICT only.

Rs79bn health projects approved; Polyclinic-II plan revised

Under his directives, a modified project with a revised capital cost of Rs40.188bn was cleared by the CDWP and referred to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for formal approval under universal health coverage (UHC) scope.
The project is a key component of the Uraan Pakistan social sector Initiative and seeks to ensure equitable access to quality healthcare services for all citizens, particularly the poor, vulnerable and underserved segments of society.
Under the revised framework, the Sehat Sahulat Programme is being implemented through the development budget on a universal basis in the three federal territories for improving overall public health outcomes by expanding coverage of secondary and priority inpatient treatments.
The programme would provide health insurance coverage for indoor healthcare services to all permanent resident families in the covered districts as per Nadra records to reduce out-of-pocket expenses and catastrophic health expenditures related to hospitalisation by up to 60 per cent.
The minister told the meeting that the programme was initially launched in 2015 by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif with the core objective of providing 100pc health coverage exclusively to poor and deserving families.
He alleged that the subsequent renaming and expansion of the programme to affluent segments in certain regions led to the misuse of resources and restricted access for genuinely deserving households.
He directed that the programme be renamed its original title, i.e. the Prime Minister’s National Health Programme, and that public resources remain focused on protecting vulnerable groups and strengthening the social safety net.
All in all, the CDWP approved three smaller development projects with a combined estimated cost of Rs12.5bn under its financial powers and referred two larger (Rs56.8bn) projects,
including the Rs40.188bn Sehat Sahulat and Rs15.95bn Jinnah Hospital (Polyclinic-II), Islamabad, to Ecnec for formal approval.

Citing a significant increase in demand for Pakistani labour in GCC countries and other regions, he said Pakistan was launching soft-skills training programmes in collaboration with Korea and Japan. He also announced that the minimum age for women seeking overseas employment had been reduced from 35 to 25 years. A Pakistani worker employed in Korea is currently remitting an average of $1,800 per month to Pakistan, he said while speaking at a meeting with members of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (Kati). 
The minister said the government was undertaking comprehensive reforms to address issues faced by overseas Pakistanis, promote skills development and create better employment opportunities. 
He advised the Korangi office of the Employees Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) to coordinate with Kati before issuing recovery notices, stressing that matters should be resolved through dialogue and facilitation. 
He said EOBI’s fund size had increased from Rs500 billion to Rs650bn within one-and-a-half years due to improved governance and transparency. He added that EOBI was focusing on enhancing investment returns, resolving property-related litigation through mediation, activating idle assets, overhauling IT systems and digitising statutory notices. 
The minister said EOBI’s Complaint Management System was being integrated with the Prime Minister’s Portal, Wafaqi Mohtasib and other relevant departments, while help desks had been established in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi to facilitate employers, employees and pensioners. 
He said key institutions such as EOBI were being digitalised to facilitate industrialists rather than harass them, and to create a more business-friendly environment for taxpayers. He said EOBI had the potential to become self-sustaining due to the availability of substantial funds.

According to a press release issued by the Petroleum Division, the price of petrol will remain at Rs253.17 per litre and that of HSD at Rs257.08 for the upcoming fortnight starting January 16. 
The petroleum levy was increased by Rs4.65 on petrol and by 80 paise on diesel. Together, the petroleum and carbon levies now total Rs87 on petrol and Rs79 on diesel. 
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers, directly affecting the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes. 
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines, particularly contributing to rising prices of vegetables and other food items.
