As the country crosses the quarter-billion mark, a stark mismatch is forming between an exploding demand for essentials and a shrinking natural base that supplies them.  When demand grows faster than what land, water, and climate can support, the potential of a demographic dividend becomes a demographic emergency.
Pakistan is unusually young, with a median age of 20.6 years, and roughly two-thirds of its population is under the age of 30. Millions of Gen Z (born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s) are entering adulthood amid the sharpest resource squeeze in the country’s history. This is not a distant-future problem. It is already visible in water taps that run dry, crops that fail under erratic weather, and job markets that shut out millions of educated youths.
The water crunch is behind every crisis, making it perhaps the most urgent indicator of imbalance.  Per-capita water availability has plunged from abundance at independence to well below global scarcity thresholds, putting severe constraints on irrigation, industry and household use.
The Indus Basin — the backbone of our agriculture and food security — is overstretched even in normal years. Add a bad monsoon or extended drought, and entire farming districts can tip into crisis.
Every weakness in Pakistan’s resource base is being magnified by climate change. The 2022 floods, which displaced millions and caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, proved how quickly decades of development can evaporate with one stroke of nature.
Heatwaves are becoming longer and deadlier; rainfall patterns are turning increasingly erratic; and glacier melt is threatening both seasonal water flows and long-term storage. This makes climate change not just an environmental but a national security risk. It accelerates the breakdown of infrastructure, pushes households into debt, disrupts schooling, and erodes the productive capacity of entire regions. And it is Gen Z that will pay the steepest price, with disrupted education, uncertain employment, and a lifetime of lower earning.
A resource-strained future has profound social consequences. When demand outstrips supply, society frays. Households forced to choose between food, school fees and medical bills inevitably pull girls out of classrooms first. Young men facing long-term unemployment are more vulnerable to recruitment into criminal or extremist networks. Mental-health stress spikes when economic hopelessness becomes a way of life.
The political implications are equally severe. Urban migration is swelling informal settlements faster than local governments can respond. Competition over water between provinces, cities, farmers and industries is already triggering disputes that weaken national cohesion. A generation raised with smartphones but without opportunities is a generation primed for political volatility.
Gen Z is both the face of the crisis and the key to its solution. Their aspirations for decent work, stable housing, and quality public services are colliding with hard ecological limits. If Pakistan fails to create pathways for youth inclusion in a resource-constrained economy, the result will not just be economic stagnation. It will be a legitimacy crisis for the state itself.
The country needs to climate-proof its future with resilient infrastructure, water governance reform, food security and green/ digital job creation, but the state cannot make this happen if the demand keeps growing beyond its response capacity. The moment demands political courage and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths: our institutions weren’t designed for 255 million people, and our policies still assume natural abundance that no longer exists.
The road ahead is difficult but not impossible. Gen Z can play a major role in advocating for smaller families to protect its own future by investing in quality over quantity. Every child, irrespective of gender, deserves a decent life. The state must step forward to play its role in ensuring equitable distribution of resources by revisiting the criteria for the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and bringing critical subjects such as population, education, health and climate back into the federal legislative list.
The common denominator of resilience and prosperity in the developed world is a combination of a smaller population, higher productivity and plentiful resources. Pakistan is a study in contrast to this formula.
The demographic dilemma is not only about the arithmetic of people versus resources; it is the political economy of who wins and who loses as the arithmetic tightens. The cost of a rapidly growing, unusually young population with a shrinking per capita water supply and recurrent disasters will take the heaviest toll on the largest cohort (youth), and the country will have to pay an exorbitant social, economic and political cost of this imbalance for decades.
Pakistan’s growing population is not the problem. The problem is the gap between how quickly we are expanding and how slowly we are adapting to a climate-stressed, resource-limited world. If the country does not correct this course, the generation that should have powered its rise will instead be the generation that inherits its decline.
The window of opportunity is narrowing but has not yet closed. Pakistan can still convert its youth bulge into a national strength. We need to move beyond slogans towards a strategy that will ensure not just future survival but also a promise of life with dignity for all its citizens.

Bringing the international event to home soil was a dream come true, Aisam, who is president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF), said at a press conference for the event earlier this month.
“I don’t know if my tears are for my career or hosting the challenger cup as president,” the visibly emotional 45-year-old joked as he addressed the audience on a chilly evening.
PTF described his retirement as the “conclusion of an era”.
“His legacy will continue to inspire upcoming players and contribute to the growth and recognition of tennis across the nation,” the federation said in a post on social media.

The right-hander turned pro in 1998 and was the only Pakistani tennis player to have played in a Grand Slam final at the 2010 US Open in both the men’s and mixed doubles.
Aisam achieved a career-high singles ranking of 125 in December 2007, and a doubles ranking of 8 in June 2011 with recently-retired partner Rohan Bopanna of India, according to the ATP Tour, who honoured Aisam and seven other retired stars at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin earlier this month.
“Obviously it’s an amazing feeling [to be here],” said the former Top 10 star, who is one of only four men to win the ATP’s Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award twice.
“Growing up as a Pakistani, a young kid, I never thought I would have such a long career to start with. Playing with the top guys, at the top tournaments, and qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals also four times. It’s been amazing, and this is like a full circle,“ Aisam had said.
“The ATP was like a second family to me. I’ve had some ups, I’ve had some downs, but overall, I think it was a mutual friendship and trust that I gathered the most.”
 






The tennis star made his final tour-level appearance in a Davis Cup tie in Paraguay in September. He won 18 tour-level doubles crowns, including two ATP Masters 1000 titles.
He is also the most successful Davis Cup player in Pakistan’s history, with the team most notably reaching the World Group play-offs in 2005.
Aisam’s efforts on the humanitarian front were recognised as he and partner Bopanna were honoured with a Peace and Sport award for their ‘Stop War Start Tennis’ campaign, with the goal of playing a match on the Pakistan-India border.
He is also the recipient of the Pride of Pakistan award in 2004 and the Salam Pakistan Youth Award in 2007.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25123520b13bade.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957265/india-issues-demarche-to-china-after-woman-from-arunachal-detained-mocked-by-shanghai-airport-officials-report' target='_blank'><strong>India issues demarche to China after woman from Arunachal ‘detained, mocked’ by Shanghai airport officials: report</strong></a><br><p>India has issued a demarche to China after a woman from Arunachal Pradesh alleged that she was detained at the Shanghai airport by immigration officials for 18 hours, who “mocked” her and said that the territory was not part of India, according to Indian media.
China says Arunachal Pradesh is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.
The woman, named Pema Wangjom Thongdok, said in an interview to ANI that she was an Indian citizen residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years. Thongdok said she was travelling from London to Japan’s Osaka via Shanghai on November 21, when Chinese authorities held her back for 18 hours.
 






Detailing her “very long ordeal”, Thongdok alleged that Chinese immigration officials at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport declared her visa as “not acceptable” and her Indian passport as invalid.
She further said the officials “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India.
“You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying.
“The airline staff of China Eastern and about two other immigration officers were speaking in their language and saying […] ‘Arunachal’ and laughing and calling it ‘China, not India’,” Thongdok told ANI, describing the immigration and airline staff’s behaviour as “very humiliating [and] questionable”.
Frustrated by their conduct, she reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country.
“We are part of India … We speak ‘shuddh Hindi’, we don’t understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian,” Thongdok told ANI.
On Monday, The Print quoted a source as saying that a “strong démarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place”.
“Our consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended the fullest assistance to the stranded passenger,” the source added, terming Thongdok’s detention based on “ludicrous grounds”.
“Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory, and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,“ they added, according to the publication.
Following the incident, Thongdok also wrote to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), and the foreign secretary, asking them to ensure that any Indian citizen does not face such a situation in the future, The Statesman reported.
The incident comes as both China and India, for the past year, have been seeking to put aside differences lingering since their 2020 border standoff.
Sources in India’s MEA, as per The Hindu, said that at a time when both sides were working to improve ties, such actions by the Chinese side introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process,  reported.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25115905e067097.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957266/trump-signs-order-for-initiating-process-of-labelling-muslim-brotherhood-chapters-as-terrorist-organisations' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order for initiating process of labelling Muslim Brotherhood chapters as terrorist organisations</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday evening, directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations.
The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. More recently, Jordan banned it in April of this year.
Signed at the White House on November 24, the order specifically mentioned its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt.
It stated that it “sets in motion a process by which certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation” as both foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs) under US counterterrorism laws.
 






The directive described the Brotherhood as having developed into a “transnational network” since its founding in Egypt in 1928, with chapters across the Middle East that, according to the order, “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens, and American interests.
The order highlighted activities attributed to Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt.
It cited the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which led to Tel Aviv’s relentless military campaign in the Palestinian enclave, stating that the Lebanese chapter’s military wing “joined Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian factions to launch multiple rocket attacks against both civilian and military targets within Israel”.
The White House document further noted that “a senior leader of the Egyptian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood … called for violent attacks against US partners and interests”.
It added that the Jordanian chapter’s leaders “have long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas”.
“It is the policy of the US to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the capabilities and operations” of chapters that may be designated under this process, the order said.
It also instructed agencies to act to “deprive those chapters of resources, and thereby end any threat” they posed to US nationals and national security.
Implementation timeline
The executive order also established a clear timeline. Within 30 days, the secretaries of State and Treasury must submit a joint report evaluating which chapters should be designated.
After that, the order directed that the relevant department must, within 45 days, take “all appropriate action” to complete the designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood has been the subject of long-running debate within US policymaking circles.
 
 

Some chapters have functioned as political parties participating in elections, while others have been accused by regional governments of supporting militant groups.
Past US administrations resisted designating the organisation outright, citing its diverse branches and concerns over destabilising political consequences.
Trump’s order marks the most detailed administrative mechanism yet to evaluate specific national chapters individually rather than treating the Brotherhood as a monolithic entity.
Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is also a Republican like Trump, had designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation at the state level.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25102921c42777b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957260/pindi-police-say-3-arrested-after-video-of-girls-hair-being-forcibly-cut-goes-viral-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi police say 3 arrested after video of girl’s hair being forcibly cut goes viral on social media</strong></a><br><p>Rawalpindi police have stated that three suspects have been arrested after a harrowing video of a girl’s hair being forcibly cut went viral on social media.
The video, which has been making the rounds on social media since Tuesday, shows a man standing over what appears to be a young girl and cutting her hair with a pair of scissors while others in the background watch.
Subsequently, another video also surfaced on social media, purportedly of the victim, in which she alleged that the incident occurred one-and-a-half months ago in Rawalpindi’s Christian Colony. She also alleged that she was beaten and threatened, adding that four men were involved in the incident.
In a statement early on Tuesday, Rawalpindi police commented on the incident. The statement referred to the victim as a “girl”.
“A video of a girl being beaten and her hair being cut has come forward, after which a video statement also came forward,” the statement said.
The incident took place in Rawalpindi and Islamabad a month and a half ago, the statement said, adding that it was not reported to the police earlier.
It went on to say that the Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani had taken notice of the incident, adding that police had gotten in touch with the girl in the video.
“Legal action is being taken at her request at the Naseerabad Police Station,” it said.
“Three accused have been taken into custody in light of the victim’s statement,” the statement added.
It said that crimes pertaining to violence, coercion and exploitation of women would not be tolerated.
“All the accused involved in the incident will be arrested and punished to the fullest extent of the law,” the statement quoted the Rawalpindi CPO as saying.
 






A first information report (FIR) of the incident has been registered under Sections 337V (intentional uprooting of hair) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on behalf of Duty Foot Constable (DFC) Asad Hussain at the Naseerabad police station in the early hours of Tuesday against four named and “a few other” unidentified suspects.
It said that “a video went viral on social media, including on Facebook, in which some people can be seen forcibly cutting the hair of a girl”.
Upon further investigation, it was found that the incident had occurred in Christian Colony, the FIR said, adding that the suspects had committed a serious crime by forcibly cutting the girl’s hair and then widely sharing the video on social media.
Last night, Islamabad police also commented on the incident, saying that it had taken place in Rawalpindi and not in the capital’s Lohi Bher area as was being reported.
“Islamabad police have traced the girl and have recorded her statement,” it said. Police further said that they had “conducted raids” and taken those involved into custody.
“However, since the incident took place in Rawalpindi, the suspects are being handed over to the police concerned,” it added.

Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated, along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police.
Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a post on X on Monday, the PTI said Noreen had filed a formal complaint with the Punjab IG over the “brutal assault and unlawful detention of peaceful citizens”.
 






The party also shared the two-page letter, in which Noreen called the incident “deeply disturbing”. She said the violence was “brutal and orchestrated” and was carried out without provocation.
According to her, her and her sisters had for weeks been denied access to see Imran without justification, leading them to “peacefully and democratically protest” over concerns for his condition. She said that they were also accompanied by members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet, lawyers and party workers.
“We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct,” she said.
“Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” she said.
“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she said.
Noreen also recounted that other women were slapped and dragged, and peaceful citizens were rounded up in vans, only to be later abandoned in remote areas in the middle of the night.
“The fact that ministers and elected officials from another federating unit were subjected to this violence further underscores a dangerous erosion of political comity and the misuse of provincial police power to suppress legitimate political expression,” she said.
She said that the police’s conduct was part of a “broader and troubling pattern” of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years, reflecting a “troubling impunity”.
Noreen called the Punjab police’s conduct “not only indefensible (but) wholly criminal, illegal, morally reprehensible, and in direct contradiction to the foundational duties of any law enforcement agency in a democratic society”.
She said their actions amounted to actionable criminal offences as they were in breach of the provisions of the Police Order 2002.
She called on the Punjab IG to immediately initiate proceedings against all police personnel who participated in and authorised the incident, or failed to prevent it.
She also requested the preservation and impartial review of “all visual evidence” from the incident and the constitution of an impartial inquiry that treated peaceful citizens “as criminals”.
On November 20, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern and called for an inquiry into the alleged mistreatment of the PTI protesters.
In a post on X, the HRCP had expressed concerns over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly are protected under national and international human rights law.
“The HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it added.
Subsequently, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, had also raised concerns over the incident and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights.</p><small>2025-11-25 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2510511186d2b2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957263/china-launches-shenzhou-22-early-for-stranded-space-station-crew' target='_blank'><strong>China launches Shenzhou-22 early for stranded space station crew</strong></a><br><p>China conducted an urgent unmanned spacecraft launch on Tuesday, after damage to a previous mission’s return capsule left the crew on its space station without a means of getting back to Earth.
The Long March-2F rocket carrying Shenzhou-22 lifted off shortly after midday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China, footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed.
Shenzhou-22 was originally slated for a crewed launch in 2026. But it was launched early after a suspected space debris strike to the Shenzhou-20 return capsule made it unsafe for re-entry to Earth, leaving its crew briefly stranded.
 






The Shenzhou-20 team returned aboard Shenzhou-21 on November 14 — nine days later than planned — leaving their relief crew without a reliable return vehicle.
Recent Shenzhou missions have been used to crew China’s Tiangong space station, exchanging teams of three astronauts every six months.
The accelerated launch ensures Shenzhou-21 astronauts Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang have a safe return option.
The three were “working normally and in good condition”, the China Manned Space Agency said on Monday before the Shenzhou-22 launch.
China is the third nation to put humans in orbit after the United States and the former Soviet Union. It has been excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the US banned Nasa from collaborating with Beijing.
It has since sought to bring other countries into its efforts and signed a deal with Pakistan in February to recruit the first foreign “taikonauts” — a term used for astronauts in China’s space programme.</p><small>2025-11-25 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2413551340c2175.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957046/jinnahs-federal-court-was-a-bridge-the-27th-amendment-burns-it' target='_blank'><strong>Jinnah’s federal court was a bridge. The 27th Amendment burns it</strong></a><br><p>The promulgation of the 27th Amendment marks a moment of unmistakable constitutional rupture in Pakistan. For the first time, the Supreme Court has found its writ substantially curtailed.
The jurisdiction to enforce fundamental rights and to pronounce upon the central questions of our constitutional order has been transferred elsewhere, leaving the once apex court — the ultimate sentinel of our basic freedoms — ‘supreme’ largely only in name.
Yet, this is not the first time our subcontinent has grappled with the creation of a federal court.
For an all-India federation
In 1935, the British Parliament enacted the Government of India Act. Among its many innovations, it established a federal court for the nascent Indian federation. It provided, for the first time, a higher court within India to hear certain appeals from the high courts.
But the new court’s remit was intentionally narrow: its concern lay with disputes arising from the architecture of the federation itself; from the allocation of powers between the centre, the provinces, and the princely states. It had no role in enforcing fundamental rights, for none existed in a justiciable form, and it remained subordinate to the Privy Council in the UK, which retained the final word.
The impulse for a federal court was rooted in the ambition to create an all-India federation in the 1930s. The idea was shaped at the Indian Round Table Conferences held between 1930 and 1932, where delegates from British India and the Indian States gathered to chart a path towards self-government.

The conferences followed the Simon Commission Report of 1930, a document notable both for its diagnosis — that any meaningful constitutional settlement must include the Indian states — and for the controversy it provoked, owing to the absence of any Indian representation at the commission itself.
The Muslim League and the Congress rejected it. Nehru countered with his own report but failed to address the demands of Muslims, so Jinnah advanced his Fourteen Points, in which federalism, provincial autonomy, minority safeguards, and the treatment of the States formed recurring themes.
At the time, the high courts of India were, for most practical purposes, the final judicial authorities in their provinces. There was no apex court within India; only the distant Privy Council stood above them. It was therefore natural that, when the first Roundtable Conference convened in late 1930, the question of a supreme court, or at least some kind of federal court, should arise.
Although the discussion was preliminary, Lord John Sankey, the Lord Chancellor, observed that any federal constitution must have at its centre a federal court, as was the case in Canada, Australia, and the United States.
 
 

The real work took place at the second Roundtable Conference in 1931 within the Federal Structure Committee. Here, the delegates concurred that a new court was needed to manage disputes inherent in federal design and to interpret the new constitution.
Opinions diverged on whether this new body should also assume the mantle of a supreme court for ordinary appeals. Some wished to fold all appellate functions into a single institution; others preferred a more cautious approach, starting with a federal court of limited jurisdiction. The discussions, spread over several meetings, circled the twin questions of scope and composition.
Political necessity
Jinnah, during these sessions, played the part of the measured inquirer. His interventions reveal a statesman preoccupied with the fragile architecture of an all-India federation. He made clear that “the question” which they had to approach was one “which must be approached from a very different point of view … for the simple reason that we are proceeding now on the basis of all-India Federation”.
His principal concern was the position of the princely states, which resisted any arrangement that would permit their ordinary cases to be appealed to a federal court. As he pointed out, a court with broad appellate jurisdiction would be one to which “one third of India does not submit”. Yet, Jinnah added that he personally favoured a supreme court, and had done so since the early 1920s, when the issue was debated in the Legislative Assembly. He said:
“[P]ersonally, I have no hesitation in saying that I have always been a supporter of the Supreme Court, and I have always maintained that it is high time that we had a Supreme Court in British India. The question has been debated more than once since 1921, and even before that it was discussed, and we pressed in the Legislature more than once that a Supreme Court should be established; but then we were contemplating a very different state of things; we were then confining our attention only to British India, and the question did not present itself in that difficult aspect which it now bears”.
It is here that Jinnah’s strategy becomes unmistakable. His preference for a federal court with narrow, constitution-specific jurisdiction was not born of constitutional philosophy but of political necessity. He understood that the Indian states would refuse to join a federation if it meant subjecting themselves to a general appellate court.
 
 

Thus, the limited federal court was a temporary accommodation, a means of keeping the States at the table long enough for a federation to take shape. In reality, his goal remained unchanged: an Indian supreme court that would ultimately replace the Privy Council and exercise the full range of appellate and constitutional jurisdiction befitting a sovereign people.
This becomes clearer as the Committee’s debates matured. Jinnah submitted that the federal court should initially be confined to exercising “only original jurisdiction” over constitutional questions so as not to jeopardise the larger federal settlement:
“You may be startled when I say that you have to divide this thing into three parts, and keep them separate. I would suggest that we should start with the Federal Court on the hypothesis that we have solved this conundrum of all-India Federation, and confine ourselves to giving jurisdiction to the Federal Court only in matters relating to the constitution and arising out of the constitution.”
The ultimate objective
But he immediately tied this limited beginning to a much broader future. He articulated a clear, sequential vision: first a narrow federal court; then a full supreme court with the same civil appellate jurisdiction as the Privy Council; then, in time, the addition of criminal appellate jurisdiction; and ultimately, an apex court to which even the Indian states would voluntarily accede.
His words are unmistakable: “let us develop the idea of a separate Supreme Court having the same jurisdiction as the Privy Council has now, and, in the course of time, that Supreme Court may succeed in attracting the attention of the Indian States…”
Towards the end of the Committee’s work, Jinnah emphasised that the separation between a federal court and a supreme court was a temporary necessity, an accommodation to the peculiarities of federal formation. Ultimately, he insisted, India ought to aspire to its own supreme court, as other dominions had done.
 
 

No nation, he observed, should remain permanently tethered to the Privy Council.
“Above all, Sir, I cannot understand why India should not aspire to its own Supreme Court. Other Dominions have got it. There can, therefore, be no question as to the necessity and as to the justice of this; and accordingly, I say that we should have a Supreme Court. … I am only prepared to agree to this separation in view of the idea of an all-India Federation, apart from which our task would have been much easier.”
Although the Roundtable Conferences faltered on larger political questions, the idea of a federal court survived. It was endorsed in the British government’s subsequent white paper, examined by the Joint Committee of Parliament, and carried into the Government of India Act, 1935.
The committee, wary of jurisdictional overlap, postponed the creation of a supreme court, though it recommended that the federal legislature retain the power to enhance the federal court’s jurisdiction in time. This became the basis of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 1956 Constitution, with an extended jurisdiction to enforce fundamental rights and hear ordinary appeals arising from the high courts.
Jinnah’s accommodation in favour of a narrowly drawn federal court during the Roundtable Conferences was therefore a transient one, adopted only to secure the federation; the ultimate objective, to which he returned repeatedly, was the establishment of a true supreme court.
His proposals reveal a statesman intent on building durable institutions suited to the realities of a diverse subcontinent at the time. He was motivated by the ideal to create unity and build long-lasting, sustainable institutions — not to tear down existing ones.

CM Shah described the remarks as “a historically illiterate and diplomatically reckless statement”.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: “Sindh chose to separate from the Bombay Presidency in 1936, even before the Partition of Pakistan, because the people of Sindh sought autonomy, dignity and their own political identity. Sindh is an integral, inseparable part of Pakistan — yesterday, today, and forever.”
 






CM Shah advised India’s defence minister to focus “on his own country’s internal divisions instead of daydreaming about ours”.
Meanwhile, Ms Rehman said that India’s defence minister’s comments are “provocative, revisionist, and deeply irresponsible”, reflecting a dangerous pattern of rhetoric that undermines regional stability and violates internationally recognised norms governing state sovereignty.
 






She noted that such statements were not just factually baseless but also expose an alarming escalation in expansionist Hindutva narrative within India that has no place in responsible statecraft.
“The Indian Defence Minister’s remarks on Sindh are not only offensive, but expose an aversion or ignorance of history that borders on self-sabotage,” she said.
It may be recalled that India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had in a recent speech said that although Sindh is not part of India today, borders can change in the future and Sindh may return to India.

A statement by the ISPR said that security forces conducted the IBO on Monday, based on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists in the area.
The ISPR also said that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue with full pace to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.”
 






Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered.
According to the state-run APP, initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.</p><small>2025-11-25 05:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/250841314285aa2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957247/pakistan-carried-out-strikes-in-afghanistan-claims-taliban-spokesman' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan carried out strikes in Afghanistan, claims Taliban spokesman</strong></a><br><p>Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, claimed on Tuesday that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country.
In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
No official statement has been issued by Pakistan thus far.
The strike was reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office (FO) said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-25 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6924ff9e19a17.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957243/decency-knows-no-passport' target='_blank'><strong>Decency knows no passport</strong></a><br><p>IT was meant to be like any other day of mastery and daredevilry in Wing Commander Namansh Syal’s life. His plan was to showcase the acclaimed calisthenics of Indian Air Force’s largely homegrown if acrimoniously delayed light combat aircraft Tejas before a global audience at the Dubai Air Show last week. Fate had other plans. The Tejas fell silent as it dove to the ground during an aerobatic manoeuvre killing Syal in the horrific fireball it became.
Things go wrong when least expected. The Titanic comes to mind. Another example is of Yuri Gagarin, the hero of our world of science and wonder, the first man to go into outer space in 1959. The Soviet cosmonaut died eight years later when the MiG-15 he was flying with a co-pilot in a test flight crashed in bad weather. For the Tejas, it was the second crash in 20 months, but the pilot had bailed out safely then. The high-profile Apollo disasters showed the best technology can be flawed. All three astronauts perished in the 1967 fire in a pre-launch test of Apollo-1. The Apollo-13 accident on the other hand happened in outer space, but miraculously no lives were lost.
 
 

Syal’s tragedy prodded a gentle side of the human spirit when deeply felt tributes started coming from across the border to the fallen Indian. One heartwarming letter published on Indian social media apparently from a Pakistani well-wisher is the kind of stuff that helps tone down the toxicity unleashed on both sides by the short and bitter military stand-off in May between the two countries.

Syal’s tragedy prodded a gentle side of the human spirit when deeply felt tributes started coming from across the border.

“To the Indian Air Force, to the family now navigating an ocean of absence: I offer what words can never carry — condolence wrapped in understanding that only those who’ve worn wings can truly know. A pilot has not merely fallen. A guardian of impossible altitudes has been summoned home. Somewhere tonight, a uniform hangs unworn. Somewhere, a child asks when the father returns. Somewhere, the sky itself feels emptier.” This letter from Pakistan was shared online by Sabrang India, an NGO that works for human rights and communal harmony in South Asia.
Among the grieving recipients would be Syal’s wife Afshan, herself an IAF officer. The condolence message reflected a sense of empathy from across the borders. It slammed the loutishness that passes for patriotic fervour between the two countries.
The letter purportedly from a PAF veteran could not be completely ascertained for authenticity, but such sentiments are not unknown to exist in India and Pakistan and occasionally do carry the day on both sides.
There is palpable moping in the Indian media about the likelihood of business loss from the second consecutive crash of Tejas in 20 months. This is the kind of stuff that makes the soul cringe. I had a similar experience working with a Western news agency when the Rwanda massacres were happening. The news of daily gory killings had become smaller than a single column weather insert. Then one day, the stringer in Kigali filed a story about how the massacres were negatively impacting Rwanda’s coffee crop. The bells at the New York Stock Exchange went wild, and the news agency’s stringer was publicly praised as a role model.
Britain’s fabled Red Arrows flying heroes have been involved in several flight accidents, but did we ever hear of the Hawk T1 jet losing money in the bargain? Red Arrows lost Flt Lt Jon Egging in 2011. Egging’s Hawk T1 jet crashed after a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival, leading to the determination that G-force impairment may have contributed to the crash. There is speculation that a similar roller-coaster-like impairment may have visited Syal, which comes with sharp acceleration against gravity. Cpl Bayliss died in 2018 when his plane crashed at RAF Valley shortly after take-off during a faux engine failure manoeuvre as the pilot Flt Lt David Stark ejected safely.
The Wire carried a troubling report on the problems India has faced in defence manufacturing and vending hardware to foreign buyers. “The Tejas crash inevitably revives memories of an earlier disastrous export venture: the sale of its seven Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters (ALHs) to Ecuador in 2008-2009 for $42.5 million, of which four crashed,” wrote well-regarded defence analyst Rahul Bedi. “These crashes eventually led to the Ecuador Air Force (EAF) terminating its ALH contract with HAL in October 2015, in a major setback to what was then the first ever major export of an indigenous military platform.”
If money is really a concern, then a great tribute to Syal’s death could be a national call for total transparency in arms deals that Indian governments have become so brazenly infamous for.
Instead, Syal’s death has set off a frantic search for someone to blame. The official inquiry hasn’t begun, but the more nationalist TV discussants on Indian channels are blaming the US for allegedly selling Indian Air Force inferior engines used in Tejas.
At a human level, Syal’s death and the heart-tugging tributes pouring in for him can be seen as a reminder that people-to-people ties deserve to be placed at the heart of promoting a nicer, friendlier future for both countries. Let that be the essence of what the letter said in its tribute to the Indian pilot.

Given the vast experience of dealing with survivors of terror attacks, LRH recently organised training wherein healthcare professionals from Karachi, Lahore and other cities were imparted training in mass emergencies.
LRH, the 1,800-bed oldest hospital of the province, has the first-ever emergency specialist due to which the level of mortalities from the terror strikes is very low.
“During the last few years, we have handled 320 mass emergencies including suicide and bomb attacks. We treated affected persons with fractured bones, head and chest injuries and multiple wounds. The ratio of deaths remained extremely low because our staff has mastered the art of lifesaving procedures,” LRH spokesman Mohammad Asim told Dawn.
According to him, more than 600 staffers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics have been deployed in addition to radiologists, pathologists and cardiologists and other consultants in accident and emergency department of the hospital to make it sure that people receive services during ‘golden hour’ –the critical 60-minute period after a traumatic injury when a patient’s chances of survival are the highest with prompt medical attention.

Spokesperson says 10 injured were treated effectively at the hospital after attack on FC headquarters

“So, our doctors are well-trained to make prompt decision in first hour about patients. LRH is the only hospital where basic life support and mass emergency preparedness, advanced cardiac life support and other trainings are happening on regular basis. Traditionally, our staff, even not on duty, rushes to the hospital to support lifesaving efforts,” said Mr Asim.
He said that emergency department of the hospital had consultants round the clock. “Recently, we started collaboration with American Heart Association and partnership with ICRC for scaling up emergency response as a regular feature,” he added.
He said that the hospital could manage 300 patients simultaneously. LRH is the first priority of patients as people are rushed to it not only from sites of terror attacks in Peshawar but from every nook and corner of the province.
“On Monday, we received 10 wounded persons from the suicide attack at Federal Constabulary’s headquarters in Peshawar. They were treated effectively,” he said.
Mr Asim said that more often people from manmade or natural disasters were brought to the hospital with multiple wounds. “They are given first aid in emergency and subsequently shifted to orthopaedic, neuro-surgery, general surgery and other wards for proper medication,” he said. He said that after every attack, most patients were sent home after their recovery with the advice for follow-ups while some remained for their surgeries and reconstruction procedures at general surgery and plastic surgery units of the hospital.
“None of the injured persons are referred outside because the hospital has all specialties with more than two-decade experience,” he said. He also appreciated the people, who donated blood on every occasion due to which the hospital had enough stock that was transfused to patients. Mr Asim said that senior doctors in LRH were getting invitations from organisers of international seminars and symposiums where they shared their experiences regarding management of trauma patients.
A doctor at the emergency department of the hospital said that first they carried out priority surgical procedures and stoppage of bleeding and later focused on other issues of blast victims.
He said emergency department was headed by trauma specialist where all the facilities including operation theatres, blood bank, pharmacy, CT scan, ultrasound and X-ray machines and pathology were available under one roof and patients received implants, blood and surgical disposable free of cost.
“The endless wave of terrorism in the province resulted in huge destruction and killing of security people but at the same time we have upgraded facilities and skills of health professionals to manage trauma incidents effectively,” he said.

But boy, would she have turned out to be right! May onwards, it seems as if the government — and others in the vicinity — can do no wrong.
Islamabad (and Pindi) seemed to have been gifted with the Midas touch. Pushed into a conflict with India, it came out on top with an air combat that is being discussed around the world. The number of planes that Pakistan shot down is a topic no one can get enough of. But this wasn’t all. Even the communications battle was won hands down. And since then, there has been no looking back.
This was followed with a romance with the US that no one had predicted. There was a one-on-one lunch at the White House and then a few months later a meeting at the Oval Office where both the field marshal and the prime minister were present. And before, during and after these meetings, the US president can’t stop praising the country and its military leadership. Some put it down to the decision to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel or give him credit for the cessation of hostilities in South Asia or lobbying. Regardless, it now appears to be a match made in heaven.
Along with this came warmer relations with the Middle East and respect that perhaps had been missing in the past few years. Pakistan now has a seat at the table in the Middle East, whether on discussions on Gaza or in relations with Iran — and also thanks to the Saudi-Pak defence pact, which has ears wagging everywhere.
If this weren’t enough, the government has been managing the IMF programme well enough so that no one fears any delays or any calls to ‘do more’ from the Fund. The missions visit Pakistan and leave without any major hiccups in terms of expectations or conditionalities, compared to the mess back in 2022.

Foreign policy miracles and numerous trips abroad still haven’t yielded the awaited manna.

And now there are no local challenges either. Legislation has taken care of all else. In the rest of the world, they may have forcible conversions but in Islamabad, we have forcible consensus, which allowed for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the Constitution. ‘Pesky’ judges have been reined in and the entire judiciary defanged with the government in charge. If this weren’t enough, immunity was granted to the president and field marshal. The opposition is now in jail or disqualified. If someone still wants to be a troublemaker, Peca is there to the rescue. Even reporting or commenting on cricket can get one in trouble. Journalists have taken note.
 
 

Is there anything left for Santa Claus to bring for the inhabitants of Constitution Avenue and Pindi?
But for those gossiping in the drawing rooms in Islamabad, there is one question left unanswered. The great foreign policy miracle and the innumerable trips abroad still have not yielded the manna from the skies that is anxiously being awaited. For the well-heeled, foreign policy success is not entirely a success if it doesn’t bring foreign rents for the state and good times for the former. This also allows them to let the vulnerable breathe.
So be it a lunch at the White House, or the defence pact with Saudi Arabia, or rumours about troops for Gaza, the relevant press release is scanned minutely for mention of aid, assistance or any such word that holds out the promise that the dollars-are-a-comin’. But so far, the press releases have let us all down.
As a result, ministers wax lyrical about foreign policy successes and point at the plane flying over, carrying the PM or the FM or the DPM to the next trip but the ordinary citizens get easily distracted by the grocery bill or the latest message from FBR. The more generous and patriotic among the citizenry may even have felt happy that government officials could burn jet fuel for Pakistan’s success and worldwide fame, although the former could barely pay the monthly petrol bill. The rulers can make pit stops in London while the ruled cannot even fly from Karachi to Lahore. But it’s all about loving your country. For another, who woke up to the news of another attack in the nearby town, the debate over whether Pakistan shot down five planes or six by an American publication may also not bring much joy.
The government ignores this just as some of us ignore the pressure of the ever-increasing waistline on the hapless button. Easy to do especially as the press/ media has also been reined in through hook and by crook and compelled to avoid the real stories out there. Be it the crisis in the agricultural sector, or the export and import of sugar or the whispers about corruption matters, few in the journalistic community are going to run with this.
But a government of boomer uncles trying to adopt a Gen Z philosophy of ‘delulu is the solulu’ will eventually end up like Joe Biden. By the time it will fall apart, no one will be interested in their side of the story, while dumping all the blame on them. More importantly, like Biden, they also have a narrow window to take decisions. After that, it will be too late.
And by this, I don’t mean they need to retire in time. But that if they don’t manage to improve the life quality of those paying the taxes and struggling with no purchasing power or get a handle on militancy, the photo ops abroad and foreign policy successes will be hard to wax lyrical about. Without improving the economy and addressing militancy, the successes in the air, the constitutional amendments and by-election wins will soon outlive their efficacy. The party is not going to last forever.

With its main rival, the PTI, largely absent from the lacklustre contest, its victory, at least in Punjab, which it has dominated for the better part of the last four decades, was a foregone conclusion.
What was surprising, however, is that the party still felt compelled to deploy the state machinery to allegedly manipulate results for inflating its votes in many constituencies. The PML-N’s victory is real; but the method allegedly employed to construct a narrative of reclaimed popularity makes it questionable, even if it does not totally discredit this success. A victory that requires the absence of a credible opponent from the contest and a suspect voting process is without substance.
On its part, the PTI has done itself or democracy no service by staying away from the process. With the viewpoint that certain quarters would not in any case let it win the polls prevailing in its rank and file, its decision was apparently influenced by the persecution of the party and its leadership and the way it was denied its mandate in the February 2024 elections. Nonetheless, the boycott of the by-election meant serving the national and provincial seats it had won then on a platter to its rival.
 
 

More importantly, the PTI missed a huge opportunity to mobilise its popular support by conducting a rigorous campaign for its candidates. Any crackdown on its support base would have further exposed its opponents. Late PPP leader Benazir Bhutto had for years regretted the decision to give an open field to pro-Zia forces by boycotting the 1985 party-less elections. The PTI may also regret its decision unless it is still banking on a break-up between the ruling PML-N and the powers that be.
While its ‘overwhelming’ victory has delivered the PML-N a simple majority in the National Assembly and freed it from its dependence on its coalition partners for legislative changes, the by-polls have killed whatever little hope the PPP had of regaining some ground it has lost in Punjab over the past decade and a half. The only provincial seat from which it has returned its candidate is the one that was doled out in Muzaffargarh by the PML-N. That its coalition partner refused to accommodate the PPP in D.G. Khan underscores that it wants not just the PTI out of its way in Punjab but also its coalition partner which will continue to exist on the margins in the province in the foreseeable future.
In short, it is not just that major political parties have lost something on the weekend; democracy too has emerged as a loser in the process.

The decision was made during a meeting, chaired by the prime minister, during which proposals from a dedicated working group were reviewed. Among the key recommendations was the removal of the EDS to ease pressure on the export sector and strengthen its global competitiveness.
An official announcement from the Prime Minister’s Secretariat said that the premier has directed the immediate abolition of the EDS imposed on domestic exports. He also directed the review of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan for reforms and its revamp.
Earlier, the premier had constituted a dedicated Working Group on the Export Development Surcharge (EDS), led by convener Musadaq Zulqarnain. The group included private sector members Shahzad Saleem, Misbah Naqvi, Khurram Mukhtar, Arif Saeed, Ahmad Umair, and Sualeh Faruqi. State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul were also part of the group.

Directs EDF money must be spent on boosting competitiveness of Pakistani goods on world markets

The terms of reference (TORs) of the group were to evaluate the efficacy of existing projects under the Export Development Fund (EDF) and propose measures to enhance the competitiveness of Pakistan’s exporters. After extensive deliberations and consensus-building, the Working Group submitted its recommendations to the Prime Minister last week.
PM Shehbaz issued special directives for a third-party audit of the EDF for the past five years, in accordance with international standards. He emphasised that the fund must be utilised to enhance domestic exports, support related research and development, provide skill training to the sector’s workforce, and provide world-class facilities. He added that any irrelevant or unjustified use of the fund would not be tolerated.
It was also decided that an interim steering committee, led by the private sector, will be constituted to ensure that the Rs52 billion currently available in the EDF is allocated strictly to projects that directly contribute to export enhancement. The projects should be carried out solely for R&D and skill development, and no money should be spent on infrastructure.
The matter of excessive taxation on exports was also raised during the meeting. It was highlighted that the effective tax burden on exporters is currently much higher than on domestic businesses.
Another Working Group, under the convenorship of Shahzad Saleem, has already submitted its recommendations on the tax burden on the export sector.The premier also instructed that a competent private sector chairman be appointed to ensure the optimal use of the fund’s available resources.
He resolved to promote and market Pakistan’s export products worldwide. He emphasised that providing maximum support to industrialists to enhance domestic exports is one of the government’s top priorities.

GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly completed its five-year tenure on Monday at midnight. During the final session, held here on Monday in the GB Assembly Hall and chaired by Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, members passed a dozen bills, including one related to the management of adventure tourism, by majority vote. They also unanimously approved two resolutions.
The assembly passed 12 bills, including the GB Tourism Adventure Tourism Management Bill 2025 and the GB Tobacco Control Bill.
The house also unanimously approved a resolution demanding the regularisation of Rescue 1122 and local council contractual employees.
Speaking on the occasion, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate said the democratic process in the region began later than in other parts of the country.
“We are in an evolutionary phase. GB Assembly members are elected by the public, and over the past five years, lawmakers have attempted to solve problems faced by the public,” he said.

Passes 12 bills on final day, including one related to management of adventure tourism

He noted that it had been difficult to conduct assembly proceedings in a natural manner.
GB Minister Abdul Hameed told the house that education and health issues remained serious, and that the region could progress only by developing its tourism sector.
Speaking on the occasion, Advocate Amjad Hussain, assembly member and PPP GB chapter president, said the assembly had completed its five-year tenure today.
He added that the members tried to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to them by the public through legislation and practical measures.
Five-year background
The GB Assembly elections were held on Nov 15, 2020 across 24 constituencies. The PTI formed the government, and Khalid Khurshid was elected chief minister.
However, in July 2023, the GB Chief Court disqualified CM Khurshid. Subsequently, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI disgruntled group, the PPP, and the PML-Nawaz, which elected Haji Gulbar Khan as the new chief minister of the region.
According to Abbas Ali, deputy director information for the house, the assembly adopted 63 Acts during its five-year tenure, including one pertaining to land reforms as well as six federal ones.
The GB Assembly passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare Gilgit-Baltistan a provisional province of Pakistan.
Later, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate hosted a farewell event for all outgoing assembly members.
Caretaker CM
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz, being the “Gilgit-Baltistan Council chairman, has appointed retired Justice Yar Muhammad as the caretaker GB chief minister, “in terms of Article 48-A(2) of the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018”.
It added that caretaker GB chief minister “shall take oath before entering upon the office in the form set out in the First Schedule of the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018”.
Under the GB Order 2018, elections must be held within 60 days. The GB chief minister, the opposition leader, and the Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan federal minister are required to agree on a single name for the caretaker chief minister.
“If we cannot agree on one name, the proposed names will be sent to the prime minister, who, as chairman of the GB Council, has the discretion to nominate any suitable person for the position,” Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam told Dawn recently.

It was the sixth attack on the Jaffar Express bet­ween Quetta and Sibi during the past one and a half months.
Railway officials said the Jaffar Express depar­ted Quetta for its destination, Peshawar, on schedule, and after crossing Mach station, when it rea­ched near Aab-i-Gum, ar­­med men opened fire on the train from the nearby mountains.
Security personnel, in­­cluding Railways Police tr­­­avelling on the train, im­mediately retaliated and returned fire. How­ever, after a brief exch­an­­ge, the assailants escaped from the area.
Railway officials said all bogies of the Jaffar Express remained safe in the armed attack. “No cas­ualty was reported in the shooting and all passengers travelling on the train remained safe,” a senior railway official said.
He said the train was stopped after the firing in­­cident and later procee­ded to its next destination after security clearance. Security on the railway track was tightened following the armed attack on the train.
The Jaffar Express has been facing continuous attacks, including a bomb blast on the railway track between Quetta and Jacobabad.

Nations sealed a modest agreement at the UN climate summit in the Brazilian Amazon on Saturday as many countries swallowed weaker terms on a fossil fuel phaseout to preserve unity.
The agreement calls on countries to voluntarily “accelerate” their climate action, but only with an implicit nod to phasing out fossil fuels.
 
 

In an address to the UN’s business and human rights forum in Geneva, UN rights chief Volker Turk warned that the “meagre results of COP30 in Belem” illustrated how “corporate power imbalances … play out in the climate emergency”.
“The fossil fuel industry is generating massive profits while devastating some of the poorest communities and countries in the world,” he said. “There needs to be proper accountability for this injustice, and for all other harms related to climate chaos.”
Turk highlighted a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice determining that “governments need to prevent significant harm to our climate, including by regulating businesses”. And the Inter-American Court of Human Rights had also recognised the right to a stable climate and called on countries to “enforce corporate due diligence and provide remedies for climate related harm”, he said.
 
 

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told Monday’s gathering that he often wondered “how future generations will judge our leaders’ actions — and their fatal inaction — on the climate crisis in 50, 100 years from now”.
“Could the inadequate response of today be considered ecocide or even a crime against humanity?”

• Gaza truce progress slow as Israel kills three more Palestinians in latest assault
JERUSALEM: Israel’s military announced the dismissal of three generals and disciplinary actions against several other senior officers over their failure to prevent the October 2023 assault by Hamas, the deadliest attack in the country’s history.
The move comes two weeks after Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir called for a “systemic investigation” into the failures that led to onslaught, even as the government dragged its feet on establishing a state commission of inquiry despite public pressure.
The list of generals fired included three divisional commanders, one of whom was then serving as the military intelligence chief.
A military statement released on Sunday said they bore personal responsibility for the armed forces’ failure to prevent the attack.
The firing comes after all three had already resigned from their posts, including the former head of the southern command General Yaron Finkelman.
Disciplinary actions were also announced against the heads of the navy and air force along with moves against four other generals and several senior officers.
It remains to be seen how or if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might also be pinned with blame for having a role in the inability to prevent the Hamas onslaught. For the past two years, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the failures that lead to the October 7 attacks should be addressed after the war in Gaza ended.
According to polls, a large number of Israelis across the political spectrum support the establishment of an inquiry to determine who is responsible for the authorities’ failure to prevent the attack.
Netanyahu’s government has so far refused to form such a commission.
Missile attack
Meanwhile, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in Gaza near the line demarcating areas of Israeli control on Monday, underlining the struggle to broaden a fragile ceasefire deal approved over six weeks ago to global acclaim.
Palestinian medics said incidents involved an Israeli drone firing a missile at a group of people east of Khan Younis, killing two and wounding another, and a tank shell killing a person on the eastern side of Gaza City.
Israel’s military said it had fired after identifying fighters crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching its troops, posing an immediate threat to them.
Hamas and Israel signed a truce on October 9 halting two years of devastating warfare but the agreement left the most intractable disputes for further talks, freezing the conflict without resolving it.
Both sides have since accused each other of deadly breaches of existing commitments in the agreement and of pushing back against later steps required by US 20-point peace plan for Gaza.
 
 

Former British prime minister Tony Blair, who helped the US develop the plan and who Trump has said may join the board of peace, met the PA’s deputy leader Hussein al-Sheikh in the West Bank on Sunday.
Sheikh said in a social media post they had discussed developments following the Security Council resolution and requirements for Palestinian self-determination.
Meanwhile, a Hamas delegation in Cairo, led by its exiled chief Khalil al-Hayya, held talks with Egyptian officials on exploring the next phase of the ceasefire, according to Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza Separately, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday that at least 342 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the truce.

PESHAWAR: Investi­gators and intelligence agencies are hunting for facilitators and support networks behind an attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters here on Monday, which saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered.
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said three militants tried to attack the headquarters in the morning. The first blew himself up at the main gate, while two others managed to enter the premises.
However, snipers and the armoured personnel carrier (APC) engaged the remaining bombers, restricting them to a parking lot reserved for motorbikes, he said, adding that the bombers sustained injuries in precise shots fired by the snipers and personnel from the APC.
Initial investigations revealed that the bombers had been waiting to carry out the attack. They reached the area at 7:35am while they executed the attack at 7:50am, the official said, hinting at a possible security breach that was the focus of their investigation.
“The bomber can be seen in the area at around 7:35am; the question is why did he take at least 25 minutes to carry out the attack despite the fact that he had passed the main gate twice — once while riding on a motorbike and then on foot,” a senior official said, fearing possible ‘facilitation’ from inside the headquarters.
CCTV footage showed the first suicide bomber, clad in a chador, approaching the main gate and blowing himself up, clearing the path for his accomplices, who were waiting at a distance. These bombers had arrived on a motorbike and travelled towards the FC HQ via Charsadda Road. Their movement was also captured around the Nishtar Hall.
During the investigation, it was revealed that they had been carrying backpacks, which suggested that they might have planned to take hostages once inside the premises.
According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.
It said that weapons and explosives were recovered from the deceased militants, adding that the specific identities of the Afghan terrorists were being ascertained.
 
 

According to an APP report, investigations were underway to trace the facilitators behind the attempted attack, with intelligence agencies focusing on identifying possible support networks.
The government is also expected to announce enhanced security measures for sensitive federal installations in the coming days, the agency said.
Condemnations
Soon after the attack, BRT services were suspended and the road was closed for all kinds of traffic, except for Rescue 1122 vehicles. An emergency was declared in all the hospitals as 11 injured persons were shifted to Lady Reading Hospital, while one was shifted to Khyber Teaching Hospital.
During his visit to LRH, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said that militants had always intended to disturb peace in the province and the country and that those who had resorted to such acts were the province’s and country’s enemies.
He said that the provincial government would not let them do this.
In a statement issued from his office, CM Afridi sought an immediate report from the KP police chief and directed that all available resources be utilised to bring the elements involved in this inhumane act to justice.
Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi told reporters at LRH: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.”
 
 

Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office.
“Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured.
President Asif Ali Zardari, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs.

“If the FCC hears and decides ICAs that were moved against decisions of the Supreme Court, it will create the impression that the court is sitting as an appellate forum over Supreme Court judgements, whereas the 27th Constitutional Amend­ment contains no such provision,” argued senior counsel Ibad-ur-Rehman Lodhi.
Consequently, Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was heading a six-member FCC bench, adjourned the proceedings to allow the counsel to file an appropriate petition on the matter. The counsel later told Dawn that he would file a miscellaneous application within the present ICA instead of submitting a separate petition.
 
 

The issue arose when the FCC bench, also comprising Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah, took up a set of ICAs concerning the All Public Universities BPS Teachers Association (APUBTA), an organisation that had earlier highlighted vacant positions across public-sector universities, including vice-chancellors, presidents, vice presidents, registrars, faculty heads, department heads, controllers of examination, and directors of finance.

Question of jurisdiction surfaces when court takes up varsity teachers’ appeals

When the case was taken up, Advocate Lodhi representing one of the petitioners, vice chancellor Dr Akhtar Ali Kalhoro of the NFC Institute of Engineering, Multan, argued that the FCC could not hear the matter because the appeal had been filed under Section 5 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
He contended that the matter should instead be referred back to the SC, which had issued adverse remarks against the petitioner. However, the CJ reminded him that the SC could no longer hear petitions filed under Article 184(3), which relates to the enforcement of fundamental rights, now omitted under the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “Where is Article 184(3) in the Constitution as it stands today?” Justice K.K. Agha asked.
The counsel responded that at the time the appeal was filed before the SC, Article 184(3) was still in effect, even though Article 175(E) now vests original jurisdiction in the FCC to hear such matters. He noted that no appeal or petition under Article 175(E) was pending before the SC that would require transferring cases to the FCC; rather, the appeals had been filed under Article 185 of the Constitution. Justice Najafi observed that the amendment had broadened the scope and concept of the Article, bringing such matters within the FCC’s domain.
 
 

“Confusion inevitably arises when matters are left to assumption,” the counsel argued, adding that lawmakers did not address this anomaly. He reiterated that the SC was not seized of any petition under Article 175(E) that would warrant transferring cases to the FCC after its creation.
“Why don’t you file a separate petition on this point?” Justice Najafi suggested.
The counsel replied that if the FCC proceeded with the appeal, it would give the impression that the court was acting as an appellate body over SC decisions. He added that Article 175(F) of the 27th Ame­ndment clearly states that the FCC may hear and determine appeals arising from judgements of a high court made under Article 199 — and not those of the SC.
During the hearing, the FCC also appeared constrained by the lack of readily available copies of the Pakistan Legal Decisions or the Supreme Court Monthly Review for quick reference to prior decisions. The bench had to rely on books provided by the counsel, with two judges sharing a single copy at a time.

In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at about Rs370bn — up from Rs354bn it was allowed in July — for the next fiscal year. As such, the regulator determined SSGCL’s prescribed price at Rs1,777 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), up from Rs1,659 per mmBtu, an increase of 7.11pc, or Rs118 per unit.
On the other hand, the regulator determined the revenue requirement for Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) at Rs516bn for FY2025-26 and set its final prescribed price at Rs1,853/- per mmBTU, about Rs87 per unit, or 5pc higher than the existing price of Rs1,766 per unit.
At the start of the fiscal year on July 1, the government had already increased fixed gas charges for all consumers by 50pc and up to 17pc increase in per unit gas sale rates for industrial, power and bulk consumers, envisaging around Rs85bn additional financial burden to consumers in FY26 to meet a structural benchmark of the IMF.

Semi-annual adjustments committed to IMF

Based on Ogra’s latest determinations, the government has to decide whether to increase consumer-end gas rates and, if so, by how much for each consumer category, or to further jack up fixed rates. The government has committed to “continue to notify semi-annual gas tariff adjustments as determined by Ogra. Gas tariff adjustments will continue to include the cost of imported RLNG”, the finance minister had given to the IMF in writing.
The SNGPL and SSGCL had sought increases of more than 10.7pc and 7.6pc in their prescribed gas prices, respectively, to meet their revenue requirements for 2025-26, but the regulator worked out increases of 5pc and 7pc, respectively. Under the practice in vogue, the government notifies uniform natural gas rates across the country based on the higher prescribed price of any of the two utilities. As a result, the revenue difference between the two gas companies generates a gas development surcharge (GDS) to the provinces based on the location of the gas production.
The prescribed gas prices are revised twice a year under the law, following determinations by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), based on which the government sets consumer gas prices for various consumer categories.
The government has also committed to the IMF to provide timely biannual notifications of gas rates to avoid a further buildup of circular debt, which has already exceeded Rs3 trillion.
 
 

The Ogra asked the government “that all the categories of consumers should at least pay the average cost of service or the average prescribed price” that comes to Rs1,853 and Rs1,777 per mmBtu for SNGPL and SSGCL, respectively, to ensure the full cost of gas delivery. The government has, however, been setting different gas rates for various categories by imposing an extra-fiscal burden on middle-class and high-end residential, industrial, commercial, and power sectors through a cross-subsidy mechanism to ensure the revenue requirement determined by Ogra.
Under section 8 (3) of the Ogra law, the federal government is required to “advise the Ogra within 40 days” of the Ogra determination about the revision of prescribed prices, the minimum charges and the sale price for each category of retail consumers, for notification in the Official Gazette” provided that the overall increase in the average prescribed price remains unchanged so that the gas companies are able to achieve their total revenue requirements.

The tribunal, headed by Justice Muhammad Amir Nawaz Rana, directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to cancel Mr Samiullah’s notification and hold fresh polling at 22 disputed stations of the constituency. 
In his petition, PkNAP chief Kakar alleged gross violations and bogus votes during the 2024 general elections in NA-251 (Zhob/Qila Saifullah/Sherani) and requested that the JUI-F candidate be de-seated and that he himself be notified as the successful candidate. 
After hearing the case, the tribunal instead ordered re-polling at the 22 controversial stations. 
In a statement, the PkNAP expressed disappointment over the ruling and said that despite presenting undeniable evidence, certified records from all polling stations and what it called solid proof of Mr Kakar’s victory, the decision to order re-polling made no sense. 

Orders ECP to hold fresh polling at 22 disputed stations of NA-251

The party said it had expected the tribunal to uphold Mr Kakar’s success, noting that the ECP had already acknowledged his clear lead on its website, during formal proceedings and through a specially formed inquiry commission. 
The statement added that the tribunal had earlier declared Mr Kakar successful and ordered a recount at 22 polling stations only to satisfy the opposing side. 
That recount again confirmed Mr Kakar’s lead by more than 4,000 votes, and the result was officially submitted by the returning officer, it said, adding that polling agents and presiding officers also testified in his favour, while the ECP produced complete records supporting his claim. 
Terming the order for re-polling disappointing and contrary to electoral justice, the party alleged that Mr Kakar’s original margin of more than 20,000 votes had been unlawfully altered after the Feb 8 elections.

Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict.
In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown.
The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam.
“We unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attack on a tourist area and extend our condolences to the victims, their families, and the Government of India. However, all governments must respect international human rights law while combating terrorism,” the experts said in a press release issued today on India’s response to the attack.
They noted that Indian authorities launched sweeping operations across the territory in the attack’s wake, resulting in the arrest and detention of around 2,800 individuals, including journalists and human rights defenders.
They pointed out that some were detained and charged under the Public Safety Act or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which permitted prolonged detention without charge or trial and contained “vague and overbroad definitions of terrorism”.
The experts noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members.
“We condemn reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture and other ill-treatment, lynchings, and discriminatory treatment of Kashmiri and Muslim communities,” the experts said.
They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions and forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, targeting families of individuals perceived as supporting freedom fighters, and carried out without court orders or due process.
“Such actions constitute collective punishment and defy the 2024 ruling by India’s Supreme Court, which found that such demolitions are unconstitutional and violate the rights to life and human dignity, which includes the right to protection against arbitrary displacement,” the experts said.
They also expressed concern at communication blackouts and restrictions on press freedom, saying that authorities reportedly suspended mobile internet services and blocked around 8,000 social media accounts, including those of journalists and independent media outlets.
“These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted.
They remarked that India’s response to the attacks was “also felt elsewhere in India”, with Kashmiri students subjected to surveillance and harassment, following government directives requiring universities to collect their personal data.
“Hate speech and incitement to violence increased against Muslims, inflamed by political figures in the ruling party. Demolitions were reported in Gujarat and Assam, where thousands of Muslim homes, mosques, and businesses were destroyed.”
“Nearly 1,900 Muslims and Rohingya refugees were also expelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar, often without due process,” the press release said.
The experts stressed that such expulsions violated the international obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibited returning individuals to countries where they risked persecution, arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, or other serious harm.
They further highlighted what they said was the “persistent nature of violations” in the territory with several human rights defenders, including Irfan Mehraj and Khurram Parvez, being arbitrarily detained for years under draconian security laws.
“We urge the immediate unconditional release of all individuals arbitrarily detained in Jammu and Kashmir.”
The experts also urged India to bring its counter-terrorism laws and practices “in line with international human rights obligations and independently investigate all alleged violations” and ensure accountability, including through prosecutions.
“Excessive counter-terrorism measures not only violate human dignity, the Indian constitution and international law but counter-productively fuel social division and grievances that can spiral into further violence,” the experts warned.
They lastly asked Pakistan and India to peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute, which they said had “fuelled human rights violations and the destructive cycle of cross-border violence”.</p><small>2025-11-24 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2423422523c3393.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957104/pakistani-diplomat-afghan-governor-meet-to-ease-bilateral-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani diplomat, Afghan governor meet to ease bilateral tensions</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan met a key Afghan governor amid tensions over rising terror incidents in Pakistan, saying efforts were underway to thaw bilateral ties, according to Afghan state media and Pakistani sources who spoke to Dawn.
The meeting was held hours after three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area this morning. Security forces quickly neutralised the attackers.
This was the first high-level contact in months between the Pakistani Consul General in Jalalabad, Shafqatullah Khan and Nangarhar Governor Mullah Muhammad Naeem Akhund.
Akhund is an important Taliban leader and is considered a confidant of Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.
Governor Akhund has previously served as deputy minister of Borders and Tribal Affairs and deputy minister of Civil Aviation during the Taliban’s first government from 1996-2001. He had played a key role in the Taliban’s military commission during the 20-year war against the US and its NATO allies and also led the Taliban’s military activities in southern Helmand province.
He was a close confidante of the late Taliban’s chief, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, and is considered a close associate of Defense Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid.
“The Islamic Emirate has a constructive stance towards good relations, cooperation, and safeguarding common interests with the region, neighbouring countries, and other countries of the world, and relevant efforts in this regard are ongoing,” Afghanistan’s official Bakhtar news agency reported.
Pakistan has long said that terrorist groups have used Afghan soil to plot and stage attacks across the border; a charge the Afghan Taliban deny.
“The governor of Nangarhar noted the goodwill, brotherhood, and historical kinship of the Afghan people, and explained that the foundation of positive relations can remain strong in the presence of mutual respect, understanding and systematic coordination,” according to the report.
No statement was issued by the Pakistani consulate about the meeting. The consulate and the Foreign Office spokesman did not reply to queries when approached for comments.
However, sources with knowledge about the meeting said the Afghan governor told the diplomat that he has already “made efforts to reduce tension between the two countries”.
The diplomat explained Pakistan’s position on the current security issues to Akhund, who is also keen to bring the relationship back on track.
“The meeting discussed ethnicity, language, religion, culture, and other commonalities, and discussed the current situation in the region and the daily amenities of the people based on the tradition of good neighbourliness,” Bakhtar said.
The meeting was attended by Nangarhar Deputy Governor Maulvi Azizullah Mustafa, Foreign Affairs Director Maulvi Jan Mohammad Inqelab, provincial spokesman Qari Ehsanullah Usmani and a number of other officials.
Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-11-24 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24170311550018f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957085/ash-cloud-from-ethiopian-volcano-eruption-to-have-no-significant-impact-on-southern-pakistan-says-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Ash cloud from Ethiopian volcano eruption to have no significant impact on southern Pakistan, says PMD</strong></a><br><p>The ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in northeastern Ethiopia would have no significant impact on the coastal areas of Pakistan, including Karachi, and would pass over the Arabian sea, confirmed the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday.
The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours. This was the first recorded eruption in nearly 12,000 years.
The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14 kilometres into the sky, blanketing nearby villages and drifting toward the Arabian Sea region. The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.
Met Office Spokesperson Anjum Nazeer Zaighum, while speaking to Dawn, said the effects of the ash cloud would not be felt in Karachi and it would pass over the Arabian Sea.
“The projections are from last night, and the impact would be felt in the deep Arabian Sea, in Oman, and within the Mumbai FIR (flight region),” the spokesperson explained, referring to earlier projections by Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) which stated that the ash cloud would affect southern Pakistan after passing over Yemen and Oman.
The spokesperson added that the ash cloud would be at an altitude of around 50,000 feet. He elaborated that the ash cloud was witnessed 60 nautical miles south of Gwadar today and the office has issued a warning to the concerned authorities, which is still in place.
 






A local resident told The Addis Standard that the eruption occurred eight kilometres from the main mountain itself.
“Afar TV … described a “massive eruption” late in the morning, noting that the force and sound of the blast were stronger than any previous events recalled by residents,” the Standard reported.
“‘We were extremely shocked by the sound and engulfed in fear,’ one resident said. Phone interviews conducted by the station indicated that the sound and its effects were felt as far away as Djibouti, Tigray and towns in the Wollo area.”
The Standard reported that the explosion caused tremors in the surrounding area and could be heard as far away as Djibouti. The subsequent ash cloud plunged surrounding settlements into “near-darkness”.

Citing Dutch news agency BNO News, the Standard said that the eruption began at 8:30am UTC (1:30pm PKT) and explosions continued throughout the afternoon.
“An advisory from the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said ash rose to about 45,000 feet (13.7 km) before activity subsided,” the Ethiopian outlet reported, adding that according to the latest VAAC update they received, the eruption had reportedly stopped.
The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the Holocene, which began around 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.
Simon Carn, a volcanologist and professor at the Michigan Technological University, confirmed on Bluesky that Hayli Gubbi “has no record of Holocene eruptions”.
An update from flight tracking monitor FlightRadar at 3:31am this morning showed the projected path of the ash cloud, which was being blown towards the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Sea.
Pakistan will come directly in its path, the monitor showed in its post, stating that the cloud would arrive in approximately 18 hours.
 






An interactive map from VAAC shows that the ash cloud will pass over southern Sindh before heading northeast into India.

Saudi Armed Forces Chief of General Staff General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili is currently on a visit to Pakistan and held meetings with senior officials.
A statement from state broadcaster PTV News, on his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said: “General Al-Rowaili conveyed felicitations from the Saudi leadership to the prime minister and the people of Pakistan. He reaffirmed the kingdom’s strong desire to elevate the current excellent defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.”
PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed his firm commitment to further strengthening the “historic fraternal relations” between the countries in all sectors, including economic, defence and security.
“The prime minister welcomed General Al-Rowaili and commended Saudi Arabia for the unwavering support and solidarity it has always extended to Pakistan. He emphasised that the relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are based on shared faith, common values, and mutual trust.
“The prime minister mentioned his highly successful visits to Riyadh over the past two months, during which historic Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement was signed between the two sides. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to further deepening bilateral defence cooperation, including joint training, exercises, and exchange of expertise.”
PM Shehbaz also highlighted the joint resolve of both countries to combat all forms of terrorism and extremism and to promote peace and stability in the region.
 






Earlier, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s military leadership discussed strengthening the “longstanding and strategic” cooperation between the two countries, focusing on defence, security and counterterrorism efforts, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The discussion took place during a meeting between Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and General Al Rowaili at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, according to the ISPR.
“During the meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening the longstanding and strategic military cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” the statement said.
“They emphasised the importance of further enhancing defence collaboration, security cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts, which continue to be pillars of the deep-rooted bilateral relationship,” it added.
 






The visiting dignitary, according to ISPR’s statement, appreciated Pakistan’s cooperation in multiple fields with the Saudi armed forces and “reaffirmed his commitment to furthering the strong bonds of cooperation”.
“Upon arrival at GHQ, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” said the statement.
 






General Al Rowaili later called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed evolving global and regional security environment. The dignitaries also explored concrete measures to deepen engagements between the armed forces of both countries and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen defence and security ties.
“The CJCSC reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and ensuring the protection of Harmain al-Sharifain,” the ISPR said.
 






In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
Earlier this month, CGS Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met General Rowaily in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.</p><small>2025-11-24 18:13</small></div><hr>
