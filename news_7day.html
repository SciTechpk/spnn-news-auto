<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2523272327b6da1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937173/trump-says-likely-to-visit-china-this-year-or-soon-after' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says likely to visit China this year or soon after</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that he expects to visit China this year or shortly afterwards, noting that economic ties between the two countries have improved — even as he kept the door open to steeper tariffs.
Speaking to reporters as he met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Washington, Trump pointed to recent talks with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping: “At some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we’ll go to China.
“We’re going to have a great relationship with China,” Trump vowed.
The US leader added: “They have some cards. We have incredible cards, but I don’t want to play those cards. If I played those cards, that would destroy China.”
 
 

Tensions between the world’s two biggest economies have been simmering this year, but have significantly cooled since April, when both countries slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s exports.
At one point, the tit-for-tat duties reached triple digits on both sides, snarling supply chains as many importers halted shipments to try and wait for the governments to work things out.
Since then, Washington and Beijing have reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions, temporarily lowering tariffs to 30 per cent on the United States’ side and 10pc on China’s part.
 


But Trump on Monday kept the door open to hiking tariffs again if China did not hold up its end of the bargain.
“They have to give us magnets,” Trump said. “If they don’t give us magnets, then we have to charge them [a] 200pc tariff or something.” “But we’re not going to have a problem, I don’t think, with that,” he added.
The US-China truce has been an uneasy one, with Washington previously accusing Beijing of violating their agreement and slow-walking export license approvals for rare earths.
China is the world’s leading producer of rare earths, used to make magnets essential to the automotive, electronics and defence industries.
The countries have since agreed to move forward.
This month, they delayed the threatened reimposition of higher tariffs on each other’s exports for another 90 days — meaning the pause on steeper duties will be in place until November 10.
Trump says he wants to meet with North Korea’s Kim this year
Trump said, “I have a very good relationship. I understand them. I spent a lot of free time with them, talking about things that we probably aren’t supposed to talk about. And you know, I just, I get along with him really well. I think he has a country of great potential, tremendous potential.”
Asked if he wanted to meet with Kim this year or next year, Trump replied, “Well, I’m meeting a lot of people. I mean, it’s hard to say that, but I’d like to meet him this year.”
Trump, who met Kim Jong Un three times in his first term, hailed their relationship and said that he knew him “better than anybody, almost, other than his sister”.
“Someday I’ll see him. I look forward to seeing him. He was very good with me,” Trump told reporters earlier today.
Trump contended that North Korea has been firing fewer rockets since he returned to the White House on January 20.
He has boasted that he has solved seven wars in as many months back in the job — a claim that is contested — but has been quiet on North Korea despite the unusually personal diplomacy during his 2017-2021 tenure.
Trump once said that he and Kim “fell in love.” Their meetings reduced tensions but failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Since then, Kim has forged a close relationship with Russia, including sending troops to fight against Ukraine, and has dug in on refusing any dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.
US will back Ukraine’s security, details being worked out, Trump says
The US president stated that he has not discussed specific security guarantees for Ukraine and reaffirmed the US commitment to support the country. The potential security guarantees for Ukraine represent a major obstacle to ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Trump also said that during his August 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the two leaders discussed limiting the size of their countries’ massive nuclear arsenal once the Ukraine crisis is resolved.
“We would like to denuclearise. It’s too much power, and we talked about that also. That’s part of it, but we have to get the war over with,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office.
Asked why Putin appears reluctant to sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump replied, “Because he doesn’t like him.”</p><small>2025-08-25 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25205536c3e2cd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937159/ptis-salman-akram-raja-says-will-step-down-as-secretary-general-in-wake-of-undisclosed-incident' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Salman Akram Raja says will step down as secretary general in wake of undisclosed incident</strong></a><br><p>PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja on Monday said he would request party founder Imran Khan tomorrow and step down from his party position in the wake of an undisclosed incident that occurred.
In a post on X today, he said: “An incident has occurred today that now demands a decisive decision from me. My life is an open book. None of my actions contradicts any principle. I do not accept compromise on intellectual and economic integrity. Tomorrow I will resign from my position by requesting Khan sahib. My legal services will remain available without compensation.”
Raja did not disclose what the incident was that compelled him to make the decision to step down.
 






He added that he had already sent a request to Imran last week to allow him to focus on legal matters away from the post of the secretary general.
However, he said Imran had not accepted his request, adding that he was grateful to the PTI founder for the trust reposed in him.
“My entire legal and intellectual life has been governed by the principles that are part of my nature: human dignity, which is the basis of democracy, resistance against social and state oppression of women and minorities, economic justice and the supremacy of law and Constitution.”
Listing some famous cases for which he is renowned, Raja said he had a long list in which he had the opportunity to support his principles. He added that he entered the political arena, along with providing legal assistance, on Imran’s instructions during the period of PTI’s tribulation.
“My aim was to contribute to the struggle for the supremacy of the Constitution, law and democracy. I am proud that I got the opportunity to contribute to the achievement of this goal with my body, mind and money.”
The PTI has been subject to recent discord in the party leadership and ranks that had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters and to shun all their differences.
Raja has had differences with others in the PTI before, including interim chairman Barrister Ali Gohar in April over access to Imran.
 
 

Raja had previously announced to step down from the party office in the wake of allegations and recriminations among party leaders over the ‘failure’ of PTI’s final November protest call in Islamabad last year.
Raja had submitted his resignation to Barrister Gohar, who had confirmed its receipt while maintaining that the decision to accept or reject the resignation would be made by Imran. Until then, Raja was asked to continue performing his duties.
 


Sources had said the political and core committee’s guns were trained on Raja, as he was censured for his complete failure in mobilising the masses and bringing out any rally from Lahore to reinforce the workers from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter who were pushing towards D-Chowk.
However, sources privy to developments had told Dawn that Raja was already demoralised as former first lady Bushra Bibi was calling the shots and had allegedly insulted several party leaders in meetings held in Peshawar ahead of the November 24 protest.
Raja also faced harsh and offensive commentary on his video message from a day earlier, where he presented “excuses” for not making it out of Lahore.
Hammad Azhar withdraws from NA-129 (Lahore) by-election race, nominates cousin
Separately, PTI leader Hammad Azhar withdrew from the race for the by-election for NA-129 (Lahore), which fell vacant after the death of his father, and nominated his cousin instead for the seat.
“I have no desire to be a part of Form-47 parliament that is full of fake MPs. Also, last time my 82-year-old father contested, he was harassed by police, arrested and my home repeatedly smashed. As the only son and sole male heir of the family, I do not want my mother to go through another trauma and on her instructions I have nominated my cousin and father’s nephew Chaudhry Arsalan Zaheer to contest in my place in case the party decided to not boycott the election in my constituency.”

Far-right National Rally (RN) leader Jordan Bardella immediately said his party would not back Bayrou’s planned cuts, suggesting the minority government could face defeat in the vote.
Bayrou told a news conference the National Assembly would be asked to “confirm the scale” of spending reductions, as the government seeks to save around €44 billion ($51bn) a year.
“I have asked the president, who has agreed, to convene an extraordinary session of parliament on Monday, September 8,” Bayrou told reporters.
Bayrou does not have a majority in parliament’s lower house, the National Assembly, and the upcoming vote underscores the fragility of his position.
Bayrou said France was going through a “decisive moment”.
“If you have a majority, the government is confirmed. If you do not have a majority, the government falls,” Bayrou added.
Both the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and Bardella’s far-right RN said they would use the vote to try to oust the centrist government.
“Francois Bayrou has just announced the end of his government, undermined by its complacent inaction,” Bardella said in a social media post.
“The RN will never vote in favour of a government whose choices cause suffering to the French people. Our fellow citizens are waiting for a change and a return to the ballot box: we are ready.”
 






In mid-July, Bayrou presented 2026 budget proposals, saying he wanted to reduce the number of public holidays in France as part of a bid to tackle what he called the “curse” of the country’s debt.
After years of overspending, France is on notice to control its public deficit and cut its sprawling debt, as required under EU rules.</p><small>2025-08-25 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2518330710f2c14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937098/fm-dar-says-greater-israel-plan-a-direct-threat-to-regional-peace' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar says ‘Greater Israel’ plan a direct threat to regional peace</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks about a “Greater Israel” threatened regional peace and security.
Earlier this month, AFP reported that Netanyahu was asked by i24NEWS interviewer Sharon Gal if he subscribed to a “vision” for a Greater Israel, to which he said “absolutely”, adding, “If you ask me what I think, we’re there.” These remarks drew widespread condemnation from the international community, including Pakistan. Last week, Israel’s defence minister approved a plan to conquer Gaza City, while Tel Aviv approved a controversial plan to build an Israeli settlement which would sever the occupied West Bank from East Jerusalem.
Addressing an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers (OIC-CFM) in Jeddah, Dar said that in recent days, Israel exhibited its “characteristic sordid insensitivity to international norms” with highly provocative and unwarranted statements encapsulating its “growing disdain and absolute contempt” for the international order.
“The brazen audacity of the so-called Israeli cabinet, in unveiling its ominous plan to extend Israel’s full military control over Gaza, as well as the Israeli prime minister’s recent allusion to the creation of a ‘Greater Israel’, provides an insight into Israel’s annexationist and rogue mindset.”
Pakistan strongly condemned Netanyahu’s remarks, stating that they call for action that would aggravate the already dire humanitarian situation and undermine efforts for peace in the Gaza Strip.
 


“We joined the statement issued by the Arab-Islamic Ministerial Committee, along with other countries, in expressing strong condemnation and categorical rejection of the Israeli announcement, denouncing it as an unacceptable escalation and a brazen attempt to entrench illegal occupation by coercion,” he said.
Pakistan also fully endorsed and joined the statement issued by 31 Arab-Islamic countries and the secretaries general of the OIC, the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemning Netanyahu’s comments about “Greater Israel”.
“His (Netanyahu’s) statement constitutes a direct threat to Arab national security, to the sovereignty of states, and to regional and international peace and security,” Dar stated.
“The root cause of this ongoing tragedy is Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” Dar said, quoting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “We fully stand by our brotherly Arab states in safeguarding their sovereignty against threats to their independence and territorial integrity.”
‘Wanton acts of collective punishment’
Dar called Gaza “a graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law”, lamenting the deaths of over 60,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.
“The systematic targeting of hospitals, schools, UN facilities, aid convoys and refugee camps are not incidental, these are wanton acts of collective punishment in full world view,” the deputy PM said.
“Gaza is enduring a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe. For nearly two years, it has suffered indiscriminate bombardment, total blockade, and deliberate deprivation and starvation, while violence and dispossession escalate in the West Bank and Jerusalem.”
 






The deputy PM highlighted that the humanitarian system in place was a “cruel illusion” and noted that an unprecedented hunger crisis and famine are rampant in the coastal enclave.
“Pakistan expresses its deep appreciation to all the states and stakeholders that are playing a role in advancing peace in Gaza. Their ongoing contributions and steadfast support remain essential in the pursuit of stability and justice for the Palestinian people,” he stated.
Dar also welcomed “international momentum” towards the recognition of a Palestinian state by governments around the world and appreciated the International Conference on the Two-State Solution, which was co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, on July 28.
“We urge those states that have yet to recognise the State of Palestine to do so as soon as they can,” he urged.
“We need to do more. It (the conference) must now be followed up by coordinated international action to realise the long-overdue settlement, based on a viable, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, on the basis of pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al-Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital,” Dar added.
‘A defining moment for the Muslim Ummah’
Dar outlined that Palestinians no longer need messages of sympathy but concrete action to end their suffering and ensure their freedom from Israeli occupation.
“This is a defining moment for the Muslim Ummah. History will not judge us by our words but by our actions,” he emphasised.
“The OIC must rise to this challenge with unity, resolve, and purpose. Another Nakba cannot, and must not, be allowed to happen,” he added, referring to the incident when 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948 war with Israel.
Highlighting that the Palestinian question is a litmus test for the rules-based international order, FM Dar presented the following seven “urgent and essential steps” for ending the Gaza crisis:

An immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire across Gaza and
the occupied Palestinian territory with full implementation of UNSC
resolutions
Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians
in need and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN
personnel
Reinforce international support to UNRWA — which remains
indispensable to the survival of millions of Palestinians — with the
OIC playing a proactive role in this end
An end to forced displacement, illegal settlements and annexation of
Palestinian land, particularly in the West Bank and East Jerusalem
The implementation of the OIC’s reconstruction plan for Gaza, which
represents a vital framework for post-conflict recovery and
rehabilitation, sustainable development and the restoration of
dignity of the people of Palestine
The revival of a genuine process to achieve a just, comprehensive and
a lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and
relevant UN and OIC resolutions
Accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity

The deputy PM also held meetings on the sidelines of the OIC session with his counterparts from Iran and Saudi Arabia, Dar wrote in separate posts on X.
Dar met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, where the pair “discussed the grave situation in Gaza, strongly condemning Israeli aggression, genocide and famine, and emphasised the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian aid and a lasting ceasefire”.
Additionally, the two top diplomats recalled Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit to Pakistan and discussed Pakistani-Iranian ties and exchanged views on peace and security in the region and beyond, Dar wrote.
 






Dar separately met Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal Bin Farhan, where the pair discussed Saudi-Pakistani ties and exchanged views on “key regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
“We discussed the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, including the ongoing genocide, famine and the urgent need for a permanent ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, reconstruction, and lasting peace,” the deputy PM wrote.
 






Dar also met his counterpart from Malaysia, Mohamad Haji Hasan, on the sidelines of the meeting, where both sides reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening ties through high-level exchanges, expanding trade and economic ties and people-to-people contacts.
“Expressing our firm solidarity with Palestine and deep concern over the situation in Gaza, we emphasised the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian access and a permanent ceasefire to pave the way for lasting peace,” Dar wrote on X.
 






The deputy PM also met Bangladeshi Adviser for Foreign Affairs Md Touhid Hossain once again in Jeddah, following the former’s visit to Dhaka over the weekend.
“We expressed strong solidarity with the just cause of Palestine, underscoring the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian access, a permanent ceasefire, and lasting peace through a two-state solution,” Dar wrote.
The pair reaffirmed the improving ties between their nations and “looked forward to seeing the fruits of our cooperation across diverse fields”.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) announced that Dar arrived in Jeddah earlier today to attend the meeting on the Gaza crisis amid Israeli aggression and plans to seize full control of Gaza City.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar […] has arrived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in the 21st Extraordinary Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) being held today at the OIC Secretariat in Jeddah,” the FO said in the statement.
“The DPM/FM was received at the King Abdulaziz International Airport Jeddah by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to OIC, Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah, Khalid Majid.”
 






The OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organisation after the United Nations, with 57 member states. It was established in September 1969 in response to the Israeli terrorist attacks on Al Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem.
As a founding member, Pakistan has been at the forefront of the OIC’s efforts to champion Muslim causes — from freedom of the Palestinian and Kashmiri peoples struggling under foreign occupation, to upholding the rights of Muslims in Myanmar and Bosnia, to ending conflicts in Muslim lands such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Libya.
‘Complete control’ of Gaza
Last week, Tel Aviv approved a plan to seize control of Gaza City, describing it as the last bastion of Hamas.
Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to press on with the offensive on the city where famine has been declared, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. Katz has said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas agrees to Israel’s terms.
Hamas said Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it wasn’t serious about a ceasefire, saying that a ceasefire agreement was the only way to return the Israeli prisoners, holding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for their lives.
The proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners held in Gaza and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Once a temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining Israeli prisoners.
Netanyahu said last Thursday that Israel would immediately resume negotiations for the release of all 50 Israeli prisoners held by Hamas — of whom Israel believes around 20 are still living, and an end to the nearly two-year-old war but on terms acceptable to Israel.
‘Manmade’ famine
According to a report released last week by the Famine Review Committee of the United Nations’ Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made” and could be “halted and reversed”, but it required an “immediate, at-scale response” to do so.
“The time for debate and hesitation has passed; starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the committee said in a report.
“There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay — even by days — will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.”
The report also warned that avoidable deaths would “increase exponentially” unless a ceasefire was implemented to allow in humanitarian aid and restore the delivery of food and basic supplies to Gaza’s population immediately.
Pakistan dispatches aid
Meanwhile, a fresh consignment of 100 tons of relief goods was dispatched to Palestine from the Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore via a special flight on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, marking the 21st consignment dispatched for the people of Gaza, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The consignment includes ration bags, ready-to-eat meals, and canned fruits to meet the urgent food needs of the Palestinian people. With this dispatch, the total volume of aid sent by Pakistan to Gaza has reached 2,027 tons through 21 consignments, the report said.
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed over 62,000 people and injured 157,951, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The United Nations warned last week that with Israeli forces blocking aid, half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza, with famine conditions likely to spread further across the Strip. Meanwhile, Israel has continued its bombardment after approving a plan to seize control of Gaza City, calling it the “last bastion of Hamas.”</p><small>2025-08-25 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/252105354e97a2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937160/musks-xai-sues-apple-openai-alleging-antitrust-violations' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s xAI sues Apple, OpenAI alleging antitrust violations</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk’s companies xAI and X filed a sweeping US antitrust lawsuit on Monday against Apple and OpenAI, alleging the tech giants formed an illegal partnership to stifle competition in artificial intelligence and smartphone markets.
The 61-page complaint, filed in federal court in Texas, accuses Apple and OpenAI of entering an exclusive deal that makes OpenAI’s ChatGPT the only generative AI chatbot integrated into Apple’s iPhone operating system, while blocking rivals like xAI’s Grok.
“This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,” the lawsuit states.
The plaintiffs claim Apple holds 65 per cent of the US smartphone market, while OpenAI controls at least 80pc of the generative AI chatbot market through ChatGPT.
Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership in June 2024, making ChatGPT the exclusive AI assistant accessible through Apple’s Siri voice assistant and other iPhone features.
The lawsuit alleges this arrangement gives ChatGPT exclusive access to “billions of user prompts” from hundreds of millions of iPhone users. The complaint also accuses Apple of manipulating App Store rankings to favour ChatGPT while delaying approval of updates to the Grok app.
Musk’s companies are seeking billions in damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged anticompetitive practices. They have demanded a jury trial.
Neither Apple nor OpenAI immediately responded to requests for comment.
The lawsuit follows threats Musk made earlier this month that triggered a fiery exchange with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
Altman called Musk’s accusation of ranking manipulation “remarkable,” charging that Musk himself “manipulates X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.”
Musk called Altman a “liar” in the heated exchange.
Both men were original founders of OpenAI before Musk’s departure in 2018 and now have a highly conflictual relationship. Musk founded xAI in 2023 to compete with OpenAI and other major AI players.</p><small>2025-08-25 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251603587ab4243.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937111/may-9-riots-faisalabad-atc-sentences-key-pti-leaders-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-57-others-to-10-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences key PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, 57 others to 10 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday sentenced key PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and Zartaj Gul, along with 56 others, to 10 years in jail and acquitted 34 in the case of an attack on former interior minister Rana Sanaullah’s house during the May 9, 2023 riots.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan, who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh presided over today’s hearing of the case registered at the Samanabad police on May 9, 2023.
PTI legal team head Malik Khalid Shafiq confirmed the convictions to Dawn.com. He said that out of the total 109 accused, 59 were handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and 16 were given three years’ jail time.
Ayub, Faraz and Gul, as well as Muhammad Ahmad Chattha, were recently disqualified from their parliamentary seats following their convictions in other May 9 cases.
Other PTI leaders included Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rasheed), Ashraf Khan Sohna, Rai Hassan Nawaz, Rai Murtaza Iqbal, former MNA Kanwal Shauzab and former Punjab MPA Farah Agha. They were also convicted in other May 9 cases on July 31.
 
 

Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, who quit PTI in the wake of the May 9 incidents, and MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi) were among those freed of the charges today.
Fawad and Zain had also been acquitted in three other Faisalabad cases pertaining to the May 9 riots.
PTI parliamentarians convicted would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
Reacting to the court verdict, Gul said on X that she was innocent.
She contended that the verdict was based on the argument that she was present in a meeting held at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7, 2023, where plans for the protest were reportedly made.
However, according to Gul, she was present in her Dera Ghazi Khan constituency on that day, attending a “fateha, inauguration, wedding and other events”. She also shared screengrabs of social media posts that showed her activities that day, adding that she had presented this evidence in court.
 






Ayub said he was never there outside Sanaullah’s house and the prosecution witnesses had not named him.
“In addition, these prosecution witnesses’ testimony was rejected by ATC Sargodha last year. These prosecution witnesses were branded as liars by the ATC Sargodha judge.  This brings the total jail sentences against me to 40 years.”
 






The deadline given to ATCs to decide various May 9 cases had already passed earlier this month. Therefore, day-to-day hearings were being held in the case, according to PTI lawyer Shafiq.
Last week, the Kasur Crime Control Department (CCD) presented former Faisalabad Civil Lines station house officer Zeeshan Khalid Randhawa as a witness during the trial. The former SHO was already under arrest in a separate kidnap and murder case of a Kasur resident.
A joint investigation team probing the case had been summoned by an ATC in July 2024 to submit the charge sheet.
Sentences against opposition pile up
Today’s convictions are the latest in a slew of ATC sentences, wherein over 100 PTI leaders and workers have been handed lengthy jail terms.
On July 22, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at Sherpao Bridge. However, incarcerated Shah Mahmood Qureshi and five others were acquitted.
 
 

The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced as many as 32 accused, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in a case registered at the Musakhel police station.
On July 31, a Faisalabad ATC had senten­ced over 100 PTI leaders and workers to up to 10 years’ imprisonment in three cases. Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among key opposition leaders handed 10 years’ jail time.
In one case, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted. In another case, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, while one person received a three-year sentence and 77 were acquitted.
On August 1, a Sargodha ATC sentenced PTI worker Muham­mad Ismail to rigorous life imprisonment in May 9 cases related to an attack on the judicial complex in Mianwali and declared 50 others as proclaimed offenders.</p><small>2025-08-25 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25195735be62bb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937155/doctors-warn-diseases-trauma-can-kill-more-people-than-floods-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Doctors warn diseases, trauma can kill more people than floods in KP</strong></a><br><p>Constant rains and raging floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have already destroyed a large chunk of infrastructure and agricultural lands, including hundreds of houses, roads, and bridges, and washed away livestock.
The battered locals are now facing an even worse ordeal, the outbreak of waterborne and other diseases, in addition to psychological trauma.
The expected outbreak has prompted government health authorities and non-governmental relief organisations to set up makeshift clinics and medical camps, mainly across KP, to cope with the massive outbreaks of several waterborne and skin diseases.
Rains and flood-related accidents have already killed more than 400 people across the province since August 15, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
“Post-floods situation is even more dangerous as the lurking threat of outbreak can kill more people than floods did,” warned Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, the secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association.
Speaking to Anadolu, Shoro called for an immediate “prevention plan” involving the provision of basic health necessities, including clean drinking water and hygiene, to mitigate the danger.
“Considering the given hygiene conditions, we cannot fully contain the outbreak and possible deaths, but a smart prevention plan can reduce the volume of a secondary disaster to a good extent,” he maintained.
Dr Mohammad Zahid Latif, head of the health division of Al-Khidmat Foundation, said that waterborne and skin diseases are already on the rise in the flood-stricken areas.
“Thousands of people, mainly children, have arrived with complaints of diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, dengue fever, malaria and skin issues. Thousands more [with similar complaints] are still stranded on the outskirts due to the blockade of roads and washing away of bridges,” he told Anadolu.
Reproductive and mental health requirements are another major issue, which the affected population is battling with, Latif pointed out.
“Many affected people have been brought to us with severe trauma and stress disorder because of the disaster they have gone through,” he said, fearing that the physical pain and injuries will heal in weeks or months, but the mental trauma will take a long time to go away.
Endorsing the view, Ataullah Khan, a spokesman for the KP Health Department, said the government had already taken steps to contain the problem.
“In addition to communicable diseases, people are also facing trauma and acute stress disorder. To handle the issue, the provincial government has sent trained psychiatrists to the flood-hit areas in collaboration with psychiatrist associations,” Khan told Anadolu.
CM gives 6-day deadline for payments to flood victims
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a meeting on the district-wise review of progress so far on payments of compensation to flood victims.
During the meeting, he issued a six-day deadline to officials for payments of all types of compensation.
“The pace of work on payments of compensation to victims should be further accelerated, ensuring payments of all types of compensation to victims by the upcoming Sunday. A feasible mechanism should be devised for payments of compensation to those minor children of deceased individuals who cannot have identity cards and bank accounts made,” the chief minister was quoted as saying in a statement on his X account.
CM Gandapur also ordered that compensation payments should be made to the relatives of those individuals who are still missing.
He said the amount required by the PDMA for payments of compensation to victims and rehabilitation works should be released immediately, adding that cash payments should be made to migrating families in Bajaur instead of non-food items.
 






He said additional teams from the health department should be deployed to expedite the verification process for the injured and affected homes and shops.
“Work should be started on collecting data for homes destroyed on waterways, discussions should be initiated with victims for constructing homes at safe locations for owners of such homes, arrangements should be made to pay 100,000 rupees per household for cleaning homes to those whose homes have floodwater and debris entered,” Gandapur said.
“The process of compensation payments to victims should be completed within the stipulated time so that we can start the early rehabilitation process. There is no shortage of resources for compensation payments to victims and rehabilitation. Complete transparency should be ensured in the use of funds for compensation payments to victims and rehabilitation works, for this purpose, the monitoring process should be made more effective.”</p><small>2025-08-25 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251953446edd95d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937148/punjab-cm-maryam-issues-evacuation-orders-from-areas-along-rivers-amid-flood-warnings' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM Maryam issues evacuation orders from areas along rivers amid flood warnings</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday issued orders to evacuate the people living in areas around rivers and low-lying ones ahead of heavy rains and flood predictions across the province.
Punjab is on high alert for floods before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell as the provincial government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
A statement by the chief minister’s office said that CM Maryam issued orders “to ensure timely evacuation of the stranded population in view of [the] arrival of flood torrents”.
She ordered access to “all possible available resources” to prevent loss of life, relocation of population from around rivers and low-lying areas to safe places, and prompt measures for the timely relocation of livestock to safe places, it added.
The chief minister directed authorities to “vigilantly monitor the flood situation of Sutlej River and other rivers”, make arrangements for the “accommodation, food and medical treatment” and provide “suitable temporary accommodation” to the flood victims, the statement read.
She also ordered the immediate provision of snakebite vaccines in the flood-affected areas, it added.
The statement also said that the district administration, Rescue 1122 and other departments in Kasur, Pakpattan, Taunsa Sharif and other flood-affected areas were directed to remain “alert and vigilant”.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Climate Change said on X that heavy rains in Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Lahore divisions were expected over the next 48 hours, “with a high risk of both riverine and urban flooding”. It advised citizens “to stay alert, follow safety precautions, and remain prepared during this period”.
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office confirmed India’s flood warnings to Pakistan but stressed that the alerts were routed through diplomatic channels rather than the Indus Waters Commission, as stipulated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
Last week, district administrations in Punjab started evacuating flood affectees from the inundated villages along the Sutlej and Indus rivers, which were experiencing low to medium level floods.
‘High flood level’ reported in Sutlej River: PDMA alert
The Pakistan Commission of Indus Waters reported “high flood level” in the Sutlej River at 10am, according to an alert by the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
The alert issued measures urging district administrations across Punjab to maintain a “high level of preparedness and mitigation of the disaster”.
The measures include effective coordination and response, activation of flood monitoring and early warning systems, and accurate and timely dissemination of information on safety measures and evacuation plans.
The district administrations were also asked to ensure “pre-placement of heavy earth-moving machinery at chokepoints/at-risk regions, and strengthening of embankments and inspection of flood protection structures”.
They were also advised to deploy additional staff and resources, ensure necessary equipment and transportation and establish relief camps which provide essential amenities, stockpile medicines and medical supplies and relocate livestock to higher ground and safe areas.
PMD issues flood warning for Chenab, Ravi
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued a flood warning for the Chenab River and Ravi River during the next 48 hours.
In its weather advisory, it said that “moderate rainfall has commenced over the upper catchments of the Eastern Rivers”, adding that the intensity of rainfall was  “likely to increase significantly”.
“Consequently, the flows in the Chenab River at Marala, Khunki and Qadir Abad, along with the nullahs and tributaries of the Chenab and Ravi, may rise high to very high flood levels during [the] next 48 hours,” the advisory read.
The PMD noted that the flood intensity in the Ravi River depended on the “releases from Madhupur Barrage in India”. “However, due to high to very high rainfall downstream of Madhupur Barrage and in the catchments of the nullahs of Ravi River, medium to high flood conditions may develop in the river.”
 






It also said that urban flooding was expected in Lahore, Gujranwala and Gujrat divisions during the next 48 hours due to intermittent high to very high rainfall.
“It is further informed that the Indian reservoirs on the Ravi and Sutlej are already at danger level,” the PMD said, urging authorities to take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation during the forecast period.</p><small>2025-08-25 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25185414cca76e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937146/spacex-postpones-starship-test-flight-over-ground-system-issue' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX postpones Starship test flight over ground system issue</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Sunday called off the launch of Starship’s tenth mission from Texas over an issue at its launch site, delaying an attempt to achieve several long-sought development milestones missed due to past tests ending in early failures.
The 70.7-metre-tall Super Heavy booster and its 52m-tall Starship upper half sat stacked on a launch mount at SpaceX’s Starbase rocket facilities as it was being filled with propellant ahead of a liftoff time of 7:35pm ET (4:35am PKT).
But roughly 30 minutes from liftoff, SpaceX said on X that it was standing down to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems.
 






Musk had been poised to provide an update on Starship’s development progress prior to the rocket’s launch on Sunday, but a placeholder live stream indicated it had been cancelled.
Similar postponements in the past have been resolved in a matter of days. SpaceX is now targeting as soon as Monday, August 25, for Starship’s next launch attempt, according to its website.
Development of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, the centre of the company’s powerful launch business future and Musk’s Mars ambitions, has faced repeated hiccups this year.
Two Starship testing failures early in flight, another failure in space on its ninth flight and a massive test stand explosion in June that sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s test-to-failure development approach.
Still, the company has continued to swiftly produce new Starships for test flights at its sprawling Starbase production facilities. Nasa hopes to use the rocket as soon as 2027 for its first crewed moon landing since the Apollo programme.
The setbacks underscore the technical complexities of Starship’s latest iteration, packed with far more capabilities such as increased thrust, a potentially more resilient heat shield and stronger steering flaps crucial to nailing its atmospheric reentry — key traits for Starship’s rapid reusability that Musk has long pushed for.
The stacked system had been expected to blast off from Texas around sunset on Sunday before its Starship upper stage separated from the Super Heavy booster dozens of miles in altitude. Super Heavy, which has returned for a landing at its launch pad in giant mechanical arms in past tests, would have instead targeted the Gulf of Mexico for a soft water landing in order to test a backup engine configuration.
Starship was to briefly ignite its own engines to blast further into space, where it would have attempted to release its first batch of mock Starlink satellites and reignite an engine while on a suborbital path around the planet.
After that phase, the ship targets an atmospheric reentry over the Indian Ocean, a crucial flight phase that tests a variety of prototypical heat shield tiles and engine flaps designed to endure a barrage of blazing heat that has largely shredded the rocket’s exterior during past flights.
“Starship’s reentry profile is designed to intentionally stress the structural limits of the upper stage’s rear flaps while at the point of maximum entry dynamic pressure,” SpaceX said on its website.</p><small>2025-08-25 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251649276bd2a36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937118/karachi-atc-sends-farhan-ghani-2-others-on-4-day-physical-remand-in-employee-assault-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi ATC sends Farhan Ghani, 2 others on 4-day physical remand in employee assault case</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday sent Chanesar Town Municipal Corporation (TMC) Chairman Farhan Ghani on a four-day physical remand over the alleged assault of a government employee.
Farhan, brother of PPP leader and Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, was arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case on Sunday for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal. Saeed had said his brother and his associates would voluntarily surrender themselves and prove their “innocence in court”.
Farhan, Shakeel and Qamar Ahmed were produced before the ATC today upon the completion of their one-day police custody.
The court asked the IO the charges under which the accused were booked, to which the IO responded that the accused had beaten up the complainant while he and others were laying down the fibre optic cable on Sharea Faisal.
Farhan, who did not have legal representation, denied the claim, stating that he was “falsely accused”. He went on to say that he was only passing by and, as TMC chairman, he had a “right to ask why the area had been dug up”.
“I asked for a permission certificate, but they could not produce one,” Farhan claimed, adding that it is his job “to stop anything illegal”.
In response to the court’s enquiry on how the suspects were arrested, the IO said they had turned themselves in.
 
 

The IO then requested the judge to grant the police 14-day custody of the suspects for further investigation. However, the court approved a four-day physical remand till August 28.
It also ordered the IO to present a progress report at the next hearing.
Complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon had filed a first information report (FIR) at the Ferozabad police station on late Saturday night.
According to the FIR, at around 4:47pm on August 22, around 20-25 persons, including Farhan, arrived at the site of the incident in three vehicles and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal.
Jadoon alleged that he told them he had all the required permissions, but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said that when he insisted that he had all the required no-objection certificates, they started using abusive language and beating him.
He went on to say that the men dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station, keeping him in illegal confinement and continued to beat him.
In the meantime, a police team arrived and rescued the complainant. They took him to the police station, where he lodged the FIR.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25171910ea71a5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937116/man-allegedly-throws-acid-on-wife-following-domestic-dispute-in-faisalabad' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly throws acid on wife following domestic dispute in Faisalabad</strong></a><br><p>A woman was left injured on Monday after her husband allegedly threw acid on her during a domestic dispute in Samundri tehsil of Punjab’s Faisalabad district, according to the police.
An incident report from the City Samundri Police station house officer said a call was received at 7:22am that a man had thrown acid on the caller’s daughter in Housing Colony No. 1, adding that she was in critical condition and being taken to the hospital.
The SHO added that he and other police personnel reached the Samundri Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, where the victim’s father told them that his daughter was married to the suspect about a year ago but was still living with her parents.
The father told the police that the couple had an argument earlier today over household expenditure, due to which the husband got angry and threw acid on her, wounding her face, left shoulder and hands.
The report added that doctors administered first aid and referred her to the Allied Burn & Reconstructive Surgery Centre. The SHO said that legal proceedings were being implemented in the case.
Police spokesperson Mohammad Tariq told Dawn.com that raids were underway and the suspect would be arrested soon.
Acid attacks remain a persistent form of gender-based violence in Pakistan, often stemming from domestic disputes, with survivors facing lifelong physical and psychological trauma. In April, the Punjab government, in view of acid attacks on women, finalised a bill to regulate the business of acid in Punjab.
The draft law restricts every person from carrying out the business of acid without a licence. It instructs that no acid shall be sold to the person below the age of 18 years. The law has listed 30 types of acid.
On Sunday, a woman and a man suffered serious burns in separate acid attacks in Bahawalpur.
In June, an anti-terrorism court in Sahiwal sentenced a man to 14 years in prison and imposed a fine of Rs8.1 million for critically injuring his former mother-in-law and her 10-year-old son in a brutal acid attack.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25163642cc90e83.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937122/fake-firs-being-circulated-on-fias-behalf-used-for-blackmail-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Fake FIRs being circulated on FIA’s behalf, used for blackmail: agency</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Monday warned that criminals are circulating fake first information reports using the agency’s name to blackmail people, according to a press release.
“FIA has received information that criminal elements are harassing people by sending fake and fabricated FIRs on WhatsApp in the name of” the agency, the press release, available with Dawn.com, stated. “Citizens are named in fake FIRs and terrorised.”
 






“These elements try to present themselves as FIA officials by using fictitious and misleading names,” the agency added. “In such messages, attempts are being made to blackmail citizens by making serious allegations like ‘cybercrimes and terrorism’.”
The FIA stated that it does not send messages of this nature to people via WhatsApp and urged the public to file complaints about suspicious messages with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which is the “authorised agency to investigate cybercrime”.
“Beware of fake messages, and never share your personal and financial information,” the FIA said.
A copy of the fake FIR was also shared with Dawn.com, registered under Sections 11H (fundraising), 11N (punishment under Sections 11H to 11K) and 11Q *(forfeiture) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, read with Section 3 (offence of money laundering) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010 and Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
On August 8, the agency warned citizens against “fake emails and WhatsApp messages” being sent in its name.
“The FIA has received reports that some unknown individuals are harassing the public by sending fake emails and WhatsApp messages in the name of the DG FIA,” a statement issued by the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Ghaffar, read.
“In these fake messages, the public is being terrorised by using the name and position of DG FIA,” the statement said, adding that fraudsters put a fake stamp of “Top Secret” on these messages to make them appear authentic.
On August 5, the Digital Rights Foundation issued an alert warning against an ongoing scam aiming to compromise WhatsApp accounts via fake calls requesting a code.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25153230bfe27c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937115/worlds-first-commercial-co2-graveyard-opens-in-norway' target='_blank'><strong>World’s first commercial CO2 ‘graveyard’ opens in Norway</strong></a><br><p>The world’s first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway’s coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said on Monday.
Northern Lights, led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe.
The aim is to prevent emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.
“We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,” Northern Lights’ managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. “Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.”
In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway’s western coast.
It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 110-kilometre (68-mile) pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 2.6 kilometres, for permanent storage.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries like cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonise.
The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany’s Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.
But CCS technology is complex and costly. Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase “pollution permits” on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.
Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe.
One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted’s biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.
Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.5 million tonnes, which is expected to increase to five million tonnes by the end of the decade.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25164040ba8ccfb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937121/fo-confirms-indias-flood-warnings-notes-use-of-diplomatic-channel-over-iwc' target='_blank'><strong>FO confirms India’s flood warnings, notes use of diplomatic channel over IWC</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Monday said India had shared flood warnings with Pakistan but stressed that the alerts were routed through diplomatic channels rather than the Indus Waters Commission, as stipulated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under paragraph 8 of Article IV of the IWT, “each party agrees to communicate to the other party, as far in advance as practicable, any information it may have in regard to such extraordinary discharges of water from reservoirs and flood flows as may affect the other party”.
Punjab is on high alert for floods before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell as the provincial government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
Amid the situation, a missive on Sunday from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, notified the government of a high flood in Jammu’s Tawi River that flows into the Chenab River.
Confirming the development today, FO Spokesperson Shahfqat Ali Khan said: “On August 24, 2025, India communicated flood warnings through diplomatic channels, rather than through the IWC as required under the IWT.
“We reaffirm that India is obligated to fully comply with all provisions of the treaty. India’s unilateral declaration to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a serious violation of international law and could have significant negative consequences for peace and stability in South Asia.”
An Indian government source told Reuters today that the country shared the warning on possible cross-border flooding on “humanitarian grounds” and not under the IWT.
The Indian High Commission in Islamabad shared the warning following heavy rains in occupied Kashmir, the source said. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kohat Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed confirmed the incident to Dawn.com, saying that terrorists attacked an FC fort in the Torah Wadi area of ​​Doaba. “The terrorist fired and martyred two FC personnel and injured 18 others,” he said.
The officer said that the FC soldiers retaliated to the attack, “resulting in the death of six terrorists”. He added, “The terrorists managed to escape with the bodies of their accomplices.”
He also said that the martyred and injured personnel were taken to CMH Hospital after being provided with first aid.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the terrorist attack on the Federal Reserve Police fort in Hangu by Fitna al Hindustan, state media APP reported.
In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
In a statement today, Naqvi paid tribute to the FC personnel “who embraced martyrdom while bravely resisting the assault” and directed authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured personnel.
“The brave officers of the Federal Reserve Police [the term used for FC personnel] sacrificed their lives to foil the attack of India-sponsored terrorists,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “The sacrifices of our martyrs will never go in vain.“
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Earlier this month, five cops were martyred and another eight left injured as militants attacked police checkpoints at different locations across KP, including Peshawar, Upper Dir and Lower Dir.
Last month, nine terrorists were killed and three security officers were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Hangu.
Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in KP’s Bannu district on the night of July 16.</p><small>2025-08-25 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251527453cf0819.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937113/traffic-accident-kills-3-at-karachis-drigh-road-underpass-police' target='_blank'><strong>Traffic accident kills 3 at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people were killed and one was injured after a car hit a motorcycle at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass on Monday, officials said.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
A spokesperson for the Eastern District police said that the accident took place within the limits of the Sharea Faisal police station.
“According to initial information, a car hit a motorcycle, causing serious injuries to passers-by who were taken to the hospital,” the spokesperson said.
He added that the driver of the car had been arrested and the vehicle was in custody.
Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre confirmed three fatalities, including two men and an unidentified woman, adding that another woman was injured. All were taken to Jinnah Hospital via Edhi ambulance.
The traffic police have issued an alert that the Drigh Road Underpass is blocked due to the incident, saying that an accident analysis team was inspecting the site.
“Traffic is being diverted over the underpass,” it added, directing citizens to the Traffic Police Helpline at 1915 to choose alternate routes.
Last week, a head-on collision involving a passenger coach and two pickups on the Quetta-Karachi national highway killed at least nine people, including police personnel, and left eight others injured.

“India’s economic outlook remains strong relative to peers, even as momentum has moderated in the past two years,” Fitch said in a statement.
The agency forecast GDP growth of 6.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (FY26), unchanged from FY25, and well above the ‘BBB’ median of 2.5pc.
Fitch’s rating comes days after S&P Global Ratings lifted its sovereign credit rating on India, citing strong economic growth, marking its first upgrade in 18 years.
Economic Affairs Secretary Anuradha Thakur had then said she expects other rating agencies to take note of the factors behind S&P’s upgrade and follow suit.
Domestic demand will remain “solid”, helped by the government’s ongoing capital spending drive and steady private consumption, Fitch said, but flagged that private investment will remain moderate due to risks from US tariffs.
US President Donald Trump has threatened to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50pc — among the highest rates imposed on Washington’s trade partners — targeting India’s oil purchases from Russia. The 50pc tariffs are set to kick in from August 27.
 
 

“US tariffs are a moderate downside risk to our forecast,” Fitch said, adding that they will reduce India’s ability to benefit from supply chain shifts out of China if tariff levels fail to be negotiated lower.
“Proposed goods and services tax (GST) reforms, if adopted, would support consumption, offsetting some of these growth risks,” Fitch added, referring to the tax restructuring promises made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month.</p><small>2025-08-25 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25135230df0604a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937108/sabalenka-djokovic-win-before-medvedev-tirade-sparks-chaos-at-us-open' target='_blank'><strong>Sabalenka, Djokovic win before Medvedev tirade sparks chaos at US Open</strong></a><br><p>Aryna Sabalenka and Novak Djokovic overcame early tests to reach the US Open second round before the Grand Slam descended into chaos late on Sunday when Daniil Medvedev launched a tirade at the match umpire and fans disrupted his opponent’s service game.
New York’s famously rowdy fans caused a six-minute delay by refusing to stop jeering and booing midway through Medvedev’s 6-3 7-5 6-7(5) 0-6 6-4 defeat by Benjamin Bonzi on Louis Armstrong Stadium.
The controversy began when a photographer entered the court prematurely after Bonzi missed his first serve on match point at 5-4 in the third set, prompting chair umpire Greg Allensworth to award the Frenchman another first serve for the disturbance.
An incensed Medvedev exploded at the official and whipped up the crowd, preventing a rattled Bonzi from serving.

“The energy was wild. Thanks to all the ones booing. Thanks for the energy in the fifth,” the Frenchman said.
“It was crazy match point in the third. A crazy scenario. I was exhausted in the fourth set. I gave what I had in the final set. That’s a crazy win.”

Under the tournament’s new extended 15-day format, first-round singles action is being contested from Sunday to Tuesday rather than over two days as in previous years, spreading out the star attractions and allowing access for another 70,000-odd spectators.
World number one Sabalenka was among the marquee names on the opening day’s schedule and the Belarusian fed off the vocal Arthur Ashe crowd to overcome determined Swiss Rebeka Masarova 7-5 6-1.
“I didn’t choose to play on Sunday, but if you win the match, it feels great. You have an extra day off, which can be good and bad. I’ve got used to it. I like it,” Sabalenka said.
“But it only works when you win the match. Imagine if you finish the tournament on Sunday. Then you can be a little bit frustrated with the scheduling.”
Novak Djokovic has had plenty of time to recuperate after his run to the Wimbledon semi-finals but the Serb needed to find an extra gear to battle past Learner Tien 6-1 7-6(3) 6-2 as he launched his latest bid for a record 25th major title.
Victory in draining conditions under the lights made Djokovic the first player since the sport turned professional in 1968 to win 75 straight opening-round matches at Grand Slams.
Americans Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton enjoyed more straightforward wins.
Last year’s finalist Fritz beat compatriot Emilio Nava 7-5 6-2 6-3 while 2023 semi-finalist Ben Shelton eased past Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse 6-3 6-2 6-4.
Fourth seed Fritz and sixth seed Shelton have emerged as two of the brightest hopes to end a 22-year U.S. men’s drought at their home major, as their women’s counterparts have long carried the torch for American tennis.
Different feel
Emma Raducanu, the first qualifier to win the tournament four years ago, moved into the second round for the first time since hoisting the trophy when the Briton beat Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1 6-2.
“I did feel different coming into it this year,” said Raducanu, who lost in the first round in 2022 and 2024.
“I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it’s in the back of your head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.”
 






Canada’s Leylah Fernandez, who lost to Raducanu in the final four years ago, defeated compatriot Rebecca Marino 6-2 6-1 while 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova saw off Oksana Selekhmeteva 6-3 7-6(3).
Former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko made smooth progress with a 6-4 6-3 win over Chinese qualifier Wang Xiyu before last year’s New York runner-up Jessica Pegula got past Mayar Sherif 6-0 6-4.
There were a handful of surprises, as qualifier Janice Tjen earned Indonesia’s first victory in a Grand Slam main draw in 22 years when she knocked out 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4 4-6 6-4 to book a match-up with Raducanu.
Alexandra Eala of the Philippines got the crowd on their feet as she battled back from 1-5 in the deciding set to defeat Denmark’s 14th seed Clara Tauson 6-3 2-6 7-6(11) at the Grandstand.

Torrential rains on August 19 had flooded neighbourhoods, severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, left people stranded on roads for hours, disrupted industrial operations and led to prolonged power outages.
Thoroughfares are still riddled with potholes, exposing the devastation of Karachi’s road network and posing serious dangers to commuters across the metropolis.
 
 

Subsequently, as Karachiites left their homes for offices and schools this morning, they faced hurdles caused by accumulated rainwater and “development work” being carried out to repair the ruined roads, as reported by the traffic police.
Areas in the Malir, East and Korangi districts were affected, with locations including the busy thoroughfare of Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road near Shaheen Complex.
Dawn.com staffers also reported traffic congestion near Shaheen Complex and on Sharea Faisal at around 10am.
To avoid hassle and inconvenience, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) urged commuters to call the 1915 helpline for alternative routes.
At around 12pm, Google Maps showed most main arteries as having light traffic flow. However, multiple road blockages were reported across the city, notably in locations where roads had been inundated due to rainwater.
 

This Google Maps screengrab shows traffic flow across Karachi at around 12pm on Aug 25, 2025.

Following the recent heavy downpour, roads located within the territorial jurisdictions of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, cantonment boards, Karachi Development Authority, various town municipal corporations and other land-controlling agencies are in damaged condition.
Vital arteries impacted include both tracks of Shahrah-i-Sher Shah Suri, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, University Road, S.M. Taufiq Road, Jahangir Road, Manghopir Road, Shahrah-i-Qaddafi.
Other key arteries, including M.A. Jinnah and I.I. Chundrigar Road, also have cracks.
On the stretch adjacent to Burns Garden on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road, rains have created a deep crater, raising questions about the authorities’ ability to maintain some of the busiest and most vital thoroughfares of the metropolis.
In an update at 7:37am, the traffic police said “development work on potholes” was being done on the second track of Natha Khan Bridge going towards the airport.
However, the statement said there was “no traffic problem” as vehicles passed through the sides.
 






In the Malir district, Madras Chowk heading to Sachal Goth and Muhammad Khan Goth and on Suparco Road, was blocked for traffic at 8:43am as “drain development work” was underway.
“Traffic is being diverted to other roads on both sides. Due to both roads being blocked, there’s traffic pressure at Madras Chowk,” the KTP said.
 






For similar work, both roads in front of Huma Lawn near Shaheen Chowk on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed were also closed for traffic at around 9am.
Commuters were being diverted towards Jang Press from Shaheen Complex and from S.M. Law College as well.
 






At the same time, slow traffic flow was reported at Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Johar as developmental work was being carried out on the underpass.
 






Another point impacted by accumulated rainwater and potholes was Checkpost No. 6 towards Tank Chowk near Malir Cantonment. The traffic police said it was managing the “slow” traffic flow.
 






Slow traffic flow was also reported at the main Superhighway in front of Sachal Mor before the Punjab Adda bus stand. The Frontier Works Organisation was carrying out cleaning on the first track, the KTP said.
 






Rainwater accumulation and potholes also caused traffic delays on Kashif Shaheed Chowk going towards Jamali Bridge on Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi Road at 9:18am, as vehicles were moving via a single track.
 






Bagh-i-Korangi Road from Awami Cut to Mazaar Cut was closed for traffic at 9:20am due to damage and flooding. “Traffic is being diverted to another road with double traffic,” the police said.
 






At 10:35am, traffic was moving at a slow speed on EBM Causeway heading towards Baloch Colony and Brookes Chowrangi, with KTP citing rainwater accumulation and potholes on the road as the reasons.
 






Slow traffic was also witnessed at Drigh Road Underpass, which had been closed for traffic due to rainwater last week, at 11:33am as Karachi Cantonment Board was doing drainage work.

The move came over a month after the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the World Bank teams conducted the 12th and final mission to review and evaluate progress against the targets set under the Higher Education Development in Pakistan (HEDP) project.
“The World Bank has approved a US$47.9 million grant, funded by the Global Partnership for Education Fund, to help improve girls’ and boys’ participation at pre-primary and primary levels in Pakistan’s Punjab province,” the organisation said in a press release dated August 23, shared on social media today.
According to the press release, the GRADES-Balochistan project will also improve the responsiveness of the education sector to climate change and emergencies.
Among the four million children that the project aims to benefit are 80,000 out-of-school children, over 3m in School Education Department (SED) schools, 850,000 in the non-formal sector, and 140,000 differently-abled children in Special Education Department (SpED) schools, it said.
The World Bank added that over 100,000 teachers and school leaders, as well as parents and community members, would benefit through professional development and awareness campaigns.
“The project is aligned with the Government of Punjab’s broader education reform agenda, which seeks to create a more effective, accountable, and inclusive education system,” said Izza Farrakh, World Bank Task Team Leader for the project, according to the release. “It will do so by supporting the government’s efforts to improve governance, management, and capacity in the education sector.“
Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, called the project a “crucial step towards addressing learning poverty and ensuring equitable access to quality education across Punjab”.
The statement added that the project targeted those populations that were most vulnerable, in line with the group’s goals of eliminating extreme poverty and the promotion of “shared prosperity” and its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) with Pakistan.
It highlighted that Pakistan had been a member of the World Bank since 1950 and that since this time, the World Bank had provided over $48.3bn to the country in assistance.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, had invested approximately $13bn in Pakistan since 1956, it added. The projects it funded supported renewable energy, financial inclusion, infrastructure, healthcare and agribusiness, among others.
The current portfolio has 54 projects and a total commitment of $15.7bn.
In June, the World Bank had ap­­proved $100m for the “Getting Results: Access and Delivery of Quality Education Services in Balochistan” (GRADES-Balochistan) project, which aimed to benefit around 250,000 students by increasing enrolment and improving literacy.</p><small>2025-08-25 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25113242b160f30.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937092/chinas-new-mega-dam-triggers-fears-of-water-war-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>China’s new mega dam triggers fears of water war in India</strong></a><br><p>India fears a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet will reduce water flows on a major river by up to 85 per cent during the dry season, according to four sources familiar with the matter and a government analysis seen by Reuters, prompting Delhi to fast-track plans for its own dam to mitigate the effects.
The Indian government has been considering projects since the early 2000s to control the flow of water from Tibet’s Angsi Glacier, which sustains more than 100 million people downstream in China, India and Bangladesh.
But the plans have been hindered by fierce and occasionally violent resistance from residents of the border state of Arunachal Pradesh, who fear their villages will be submerged and way of life destroyed by any dam.
Then in December, China announced that it would build the world’s largest hydropower dam in a border county just before the Yarlung Zangbo river crosses into India.
That triggered fears in New Delhi that its longtime strategic rival — which has some territorial claims in Arunachal Pradesh — could weaponise its control of the river, which originates in the Angsi Glacier and is known as the Siang and Brahmaputra in India.
India’s largest hydropower company in May moved survey materials under armed police protection near a prospective site of the Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam, which would be the country’s biggest dam, if completed.
Senior Indian officials have also been holding meetings about accelerating construction this year, including one organised in July by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.
Delhi’s concerns were described in the undated Indian government analysis of the Chinese dam’s impact, the specifics of which Reuters corroborated with four sources and is reporting for the first time.
Beijing hasn’t released detailed plans about the dam’s construction, but the analysis drew on past work conducted by Indian government-affiliated institutions like the Central Water Commission and accounted for the expected size of the Chinese project, which broke ground in July and will cost nearly $170 billion.
Delhi estimates the Chinese dam will allow Beijing to divert as much as 40 billion cubic meters of water, or just over a third of what is received annually at a key border point, according to the sources and the document.
The impact would be especially acute in the non-monsoon months, when temperatures rise and lands become barren across swathes of India.
The Upper Siang project would alleviate that with its projected 14 BCM of storage capacity, allowing India to release water during the dry season. That could mean the major regional city of Guwahati, which is dependent on water-intensive industry and farming, would see a reduction in supply of 11pc, according to the sources and the document, as opposed to 25pc if the Indian dam isn’t built.
The project could also mitigate any move by Beijing to release devastating torrents of water downstream, the sources said.
If the dam is at its minimum drawdown level — where water is stored at less than 50pc of its height — it would be able to fully absorb any excess water released from a breach in Chinese infrastructure, according to the document and the sources.
India is considering a proposal to keep 30pc of its dam empty at any time in order to account for unexpected surges, two of the sources said.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that the hydropower projects “have undergone rigorous scientific research on safety and environmental protection, and will not adversely impact the water resources, ecology, or geology of downstream countries.”
“China has always maintained a responsible attitude toward the development and utilisation of transboundary rivers, and has maintained long-term communication and cooperation with downstream countries such as India and Bangladesh,” the spokesperson added.
Modi’s office and the Indian ministries responsible for water and external affairs did not respond to Reuters’ questions. State-owned hydropower major NHPC also did not return a request for comment.
India’s foreign ministry has said that top diplomat S. Jaishankar raised concerns about the dam during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on August 18. A Jaishankar deputy also told lawmakers in August that the government was implementing measures to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of citizens in downstream areas, including building the dam.
India has itself been accused by Pakistan, a Chinese ally that it briefly clashed with in May, of weaponising water. Delhi this year suspended its participation in a 1960 water-sharing treaty with Islamabad and is considering diverting flows from another crucial river away from its downstream neighbour.
An international tribunal has ruled that India must adhere to the agreement but Delhi says the panel lacks jurisdiction.
 

India aims to construct a dam in its northeast to mitigate the potential impacts of a massive dam being built across the border in China.

Development or destruction?
When NHPC workers moved surveying materials near the village of Parong in May, angry locals damaged their machinery, destroyed a nearby bridge and looted the tents of police sent to guard the operation.
Many of them are members of Arunachal’s Adi community, who live off paddy, orange and sweet lime farms in the mist-shrouded hills and valleys nourished by the Siang.
The villagers have set up makeshift watch posts on regional roads to deny access to NHPC workers. That has forced security personnel to trek miles, often under the cover of night, to reach a prospective site of the dam.
At least 16 Adi villages are likely to be lost to the storage area of the dam, directly affecting an estimated 10,000 people, according to two of the sources.
Community leaders say more than 100,000 people will be impacted overall.
“The cardamom, paddy, jackfruit and pear we grow on this land help educate our children and support our family,” said Odoni Palo Pabin, an Adi grocer and mother of two. “We will fight the dam to death.”
The dam has the support of Arunachal’s chief minister, who is a member of Modi’s party and has called the Chinese project an existential threat.
The project will “ensure water security and provide flood moderation to counter any potential water surges,” the state government said in a statement, adding that it decided in June to engage in detailed compensation discussions with families that could be affected by the dam.
Lawmaker Alo Libang, an Adi who represents an area that would be submerged by the Indian project, said he believed locals could be convinced to move if they received generous compensation.
NHPC has plans to spend more than $3 million on education and emergency infrastructure to incentivise the villagers to move elsewhere, three of the sources said, citing instructions from Modi’s office.
In one sign of progress, three villages in the area recently agreed to let NHPC officials carry out dam-related work, according to the Arunachal government and dozens of locals.
India has a history of activist movements against large dams, which have sometimes slowed these projects by years or forced them to scale down.
Even if the Upper Siang dam gets the go-ahead, it could take a decade to build after breaking ground, according to four of the sources.
That means the project would likely be completed after China’s project, which Beijing expects to start generating power by the early-to-mid 2030s.
The delay means an Indian project would be vulnerable during construction if Beijing suddenly releases water during the monsoon season, triggering a surge that could wash away temporary dams, two of the sources said.
International experts and Adi activists have also warned that building large dams in seismically active Tibet and Arunachal could heighten risks for downstream communities.
The Chinese “dam is being built in a zone of high seismicity and in a zone that experiences extreme weather events,” said Sayanangshu Modak, an expert on the India-China water relationship at the University of Arizona.
“These kinds of extreme weather events trigger landslides, mudslides, glacial lake outburst flooding,” he said. “So that raises concerns about dam safety… it’s a very legitimate concern, and India should engage with China.”</p><small>2025-08-25 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251112132675dea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937081/fatima-sana-to-lead-womens-side-as-pcb-announces-15-member-squad-for-icc-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Fatima Sana to lead women’s side as PCB announces 15-member squad for ICC World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Fatima Sana will lead the women’s side in the upcoming ICC Women’s World Cup as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday announced a 15-member squad for the tournament set to take place in India and Sri Lanka in September.
Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo when India hosts this year’s tournament from Sept 30 to November 2. Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
The women’s national selection committee named the squad for the tournament, and announced that the same squad will also feature in a three-match ODI series against South Africa, scheduled at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore from Sept 16-22.
 






“Uncapped right-handed batter Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland, is part of the ODI squad,” PCB said.
“Fatima Sana, who represented Pakistan in the previous edition of ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, will lead the side for the first time in the mega event,” it added.
The 23-year-old had previously captained the side in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier held in Lahore this year, where the team maintained a 100 per cent win record to secure qualification for this year’s ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup set to take place in India and Sri Lanka, the statement added.
 
 

Six players are set to feature in their maiden ODI World Cup, namely: Natalia Parvaiz (8 ODIs, 24T20Is), Rameen Shamim (8 ODIs, 11 T20Is), Sadaf Shamas (15 ODIs, 12 T20Is), Sadia Iqbal (27 ODIs, 50 T20Is), Shawaal Zulfiqar (3 ODIs, 9 T20Is) and Syeda Aroob Shah (2 ODIs, 15 T20Is).
Moreover, 21-year-old Aroob, 20-year-old Shawaal alongside 20-year-old Eyman featured for Pakistan in the inaugural edition of ICC Women’s U19 T20 World Cup held in South Africa in January 2023.
“Additionally, two changes have been made from the 15-member squad that featured in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier,” PCB said.
“Eyman and Sadaf come into the squad in place of Gull Feroza and Najiha Alvi, who have been named in the five-member non-travelling reserves alongside Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.”
The 15 players alongside five reserves players will take part in a 14-day pre-South Africa series camp from August 29. “The players under the coaching staff led by Muhammad Wasim will undergo practice sessions as well as 50-over practice matches.”
South Africa women’s cricket team will arrive in Lahore on Sept 12.
Pakistan became the fourth side to announce their squad after Bangladesh, England and India announced their squads earlier this month.
15-member squad:
Fatima Sana (captain), Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (vice-captain), Aliya Riaz, Diana Baig, Eyman Fatima, Nashra Sundhu, Natalia Parvaiz, Omaima Sohail, Rameen Shamim, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal, Shawaal Zulfiqar, Sidra Amin, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper) and Syeda Aroob Shah.
Non-traveling reserves:
Gull Feroza, Najiha Alvi, Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.
Player support personnel:

• This is not a political matter and we will address it through legal means, says elder brother
KARACHI: Chanesar Town chairman Farhan Ghani, younger brother of senior Pakistan Peoples Party leader and local government minister Saeed Ghani, was booked, arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal.
Police got one-day remand of Farhan from a duty magistrate on Sunday. He will be produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday (today).
In a statement, Saeed Ghani, who is also the president of the PPP Karachi division, said that a dispute occurred on Sharea Faisal within the remit of the Chanesar Town and a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against his brother Farhan and some others. “Soon after, Farhan and his associates voluntarily surrendered themselves to the authorities.
“This is a legal matter, not a political one, and we will address it through legal means,” the elder Ghani said.
Earlier, the Ferozabad police registered a case under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 379 (theft), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Without identifying his department, complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon told the police that he is a “government employee” and was supervising fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal on Aug 22.
He stated at around 4:47pm, around 20-25 persons, including Chanesar Town chairman Farhan, in three vehicles arrived there and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal. He said he told them that he had all permissions but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said when he insisted that he had all required no-objection certificates, they started using smear language and beating him.
He said they dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station where they kept him in illegal confinement and continued beating him. In the meantime, a police team arrived there, rescued him and took him to the police station where he lodged the FIR.
On Sunday, the investigating officer (IO) produced three suspects, including Mr Farhan, before Judicial Magistrate (East) Waseem Abbas and sought their one-day police custody.
The IO informed the court that the suspects had been arrested on terrorism charges and their custody was required to apprehend their remaining accomplices with their help and to check their criminal record.
He further submitted that since the case was registered under terrorism charges and ATCs remained closed on Sunday, he was seeking their one-day custody to produce them before the concerned anti-terrorism court for remand.
After hearing the IO, the duty magistrate granted one-day physical custody of the suspects and directed him to produce them before the administrative judge of the ATCs on Monday (today).

He was identified as Rashid and his brother Wajid had already died of severe torture marks at the spot.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in Raiwind area two days back.
They were lying in a pool of blood and the suspected attackers holding clubs in hands were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around.
According to the video clip, no one from the passersby tried to rescue the two young men when they were being tortured by the attackers.
There were reports that the police traced and arrested two of the suspected attackers after lodging a case against them.
A police official said Wajid and Rashid had argued with a street vendor over the price of the fruit.  
He said the minor issue later led to the heated debate and then physical attack by the suspects.

The party contends that the video being relied on pertains to its Kahna public meeting, held on Sept 21, 2024.
Shahrez Khan was “arrested” from his home, when he was preparing to go abroad to participate in an athletic international championship on Thursday (Aug 21) after men in plainclothes barged into his home on the Canal Road.
The next day, his younger brother Shershah was also arrested from outside his house. Both are on police remand.
In a video posted to state broadcaster PTV News’ official X handle, a series of clips are shown wherein Shahrez can be seen walking alongside his mother Aleema Khan, as well as PTI’s Khadija Shah, Shayan Bashir and some others.
 






In the caption of the clip, it is claimed that both Shahrez and Shershah were arrested over their involvement in the attack on the Lahore corps commander’s residence on May 9, 2023.
However, PTI’s Shayan Bashir stated the video clip in question was from the party’s public meeting in Lahore’s Kahna area, for which the party had obtained an NOC.
 






He said Shahrez, owing to non-availability of a driver, had driven his mother to the public meeting. He claimed that since police had stopped party leaders’ vehicles some five kilometres from the venue, they could be seen walking to reach the venue.

According to a provisional schedule shared by UN officials, Pakistan may have a strategic advantage of speaking after India, giving it a direct platform to respond to New Delhi’s narrative.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level Pakistani delegation, which will include Deputy Prime Mini­ster Ishaq Dar, as well as the PM’s adviser on foreign affairs, Tariq Fatemi.
 
 

The 80th UNGA officially opens on Sept 9, with the high-level general debate running from Sept 23 to 29.
Brazil will speak first, followed by the US, where President Trump will deliver his first address to the UNGA in his second term.
This year’s theme is: ‘Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights.’
According to the provisional list, India’s premier will speak in the morning, while Pakistan’s leader, along with the heads of Israel, China, and Bangladesh, is scheduled for later that day. Officials in New Delhi have indicated that their prime minister will also participate in the general debate.
Observers note that the back-to-back appearances of PM Shehbaz and Modi will underline the gulf in perspectives. While India is expected to stress sovereignty and security, Pakistan will be able to respond directly, emphasising Kashmir and regional peace as core issues.
A senior Pakistani diplomat said: “The world has seen how quickly South Asia can slide toward conflict. Without a just settlement of Kashmir, the UN’s own pro­mise of peace, development, and human rights cannot be fulfilled in our region.”
The 80th UNGA promises to be one of the busiest diplomatic seasons in years, taking place amid the Israel’s war on Gaza, the Ukraine conflict, and the lingering aftereffects of the May India-Pakistan war. For Islamabad, the message is clear: the world cannot ignore South Asia’s flashpoints, and Kashmir remains the key to lasting peace.
According to the provisional schedule, a special event on climate will be held on Sept 24, while a high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons will be held on Sept 26.
