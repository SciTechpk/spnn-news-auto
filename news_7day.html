<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101310024ebd2da.gif?r=131141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923280/interior-minister-rebuts-rumours-about-president-zardari-resigning-from-office' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister rebuts rumours about President Zardari ‘resigning’ from office</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday rebutted rumours of President Asif Ali Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.
“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi wrote on X.
“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.
 






“The president of Pakistan enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces,” the minister said.
He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.
“To those involved in this narrative, do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.
Speaking on Geo News’ programme “Geo Pakistan” today, PML-N Senator Irfanullah Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.
“Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”
Siddiqui said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.
He said the PML-N had “no trouble” working with the president and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.
“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.
Over the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.
The government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.
In May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.
In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.
 
 

The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.
In May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their concern over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.</p><small>2025-07-10 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101429374df5323.png?r=143210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923261/pakistan-china-agree-on-joint-media-cooperation-against-fake-news' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China agree on joint media cooperation against fake news</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China on Thursday agreed to further enhance ties and joint broadcasting projects between their state broadcasters to tackle fake news and disinformation, Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
The government, as well as the military, have previously warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the law.
The decision was made during a meeting in Beijing between Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Cao Shumin, Deputy Head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Minister and Party Secretary of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA).
 






“Both leaders also agreed on a joint narrative against fake news and emphasised technical training and institutional collaboration,” the report said. “They described the ongoing partnership in the media as a reflection of mutual trust and longstanding friendship.”
The report added that the two sides also held talks related to a proposed agreement between China Central Television (CCTV) and PTV to promote the exchange of information and cooperation.
Tarar said Pakistan was ready to translate bilateral media cooperation into practical steps and that state-run media entities — PTV, Radio Pakistan and Associated Press of Pakistan — were playing a crucial role in communicating stories of China’s development, the Belt and Road Initiative, CPEC, cultural ties, and bilateral cooperation to the people of both countries.
Per the report, Tarar said PTV was building intellectual and cultural bridges between the two nations by broadcasting Chinese programmes, documentaries and news reports in Urdu.
He said APP’s “China News Service” had crossed a significant milestone in effectively conveying Pakistan’s narrative to Chinese readers.
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India tensions, the information minister noted that the youth of China and Pakistan expressed strong solidarity with each other, which went viral on social media.
The meeting also discussed exchange visits of digital influencers from both Pakistan and China. Tarar said in the digital age, exchanges between influencers and social media representatives of both countries can inject new energy into bilateral relations.
Shumin said China considered Pakistan a trustworthy partner. “Media organisations of Pakistan and China can come closer through the exchange of experiences,” she was quoted as saying in the report.
Both sides agreed that media, culture, and people-to-people relations can introduce new dimensions to the Pakistan-China friendship, and these efforts will be further strengthened under a joint strategy.
In February, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong said: “We are ready to expand cooperation with Pakistan in education, media, think tanks, youth exchanges, and the film and television industries, to foster mutual learning between civilisations and strengthen cultural and people-to-people ties.”</p><small>2025-07-10 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101341431ba4a52.jpg?r=134152' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923274/4-killed-in-kps-mardan-as-two-groups-clash-over-personal-dispute-police' target='_blank'><strong>4 killed in KP’s Mardan as two groups clash over personal dispute: police</strong></a><br><p>Four people from two different groups were killed while two others were injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district over a personal dispute, police said on Thursday.
Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan told Dawn.com, “There was a clash between two groups over a personal dispute, resulting in the killing of four people — three from one group and one from the other group—while two people sustained injuries.”
“The motive behind the clash was a personal dispute between them,” he added.
One of the injured filed a first information report (FIR) at the Garhi Kapura police station on Wednesday night.
According to the FIR, seen by Dawn.com, the complainant said that the incident occurred around 10pm when he was returning home with his brothers and cousins, saying that they were attacked by armed assailants who were already present there.
The FIR was registered under Sections  148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (intentional murder) and 324  (attempted mu­r­der) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
“Five armed men opened fire on us, resulting in the instant death of three people, while my cousin and I got injured,” the complainant wrote in the FIR.
A relative of the deceased from the second group also filed a police case at the Garhi Kapura police station under Sections 302 (intentional murder), 324  (attempted mu­r­der) and 34 (common intention).
Police spokesperson Faheem added that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Bala Garhi Hospital for autopsy and medical assistance.
“An FIR had been lodged and raids are being conducted to arrest the suspects,” he added.
In May, six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar.
A clash between two parties over a land dispute in Battagram district killed four people and injured five others in April.</p><small>2025-07-10 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10122033a01d633.jpg?r=122401' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923264/india-electoral-roll-revision-sparks-fear-and-fury' target='_blank'><strong>India electoral roll revision sparks fear and fury</strong></a><br><p>Indian election officials have given voters in Bihar state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp set to be applied nationwide, triggering disenfranchisement fears.
The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the revision of the voter rolls in June ahead of upcoming polls in the eastern state.
It said the exercise will later be replicated across the nation of 1.4 billion people.
According to the ECI, the “intensive revision” was needed in part to avoid the “inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants”.
Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have long claimed that large numbers of undocumented Muslim migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh have fraudulently entered India’s electoral rolls.
Critics say the overhaul could render vast numbers of Indian citizens unable to vote.
“You are being asked to produce documents that very few people have,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim lawmaker.
 
 

“It will lead to mass disenfranchisement.”
Opposition lawmakers say it will impact minorities the hardest, including Muslims and Dalit communities, those on the bottom rung of India’s rigid caste hierarchy.
‘Engineered exclusions’
All potential voters in Bihar will have to provide proof of citizenship by July 25.
Those registered in 2003, the last time scrutiny of the voter list took place in Bihar, can submit a copy of that.
The rest — around 30 million people, according to the ECI’s estimates — have to provide evidence of their place and date of birth.
And those born after 1987 must also furnish proof of their parents’ Indian citizenship.
The requirement affects more than a third of potential voters in Bihar, India’s third most populous state and its poorest.
It is also a crucial election battleground as the only state in India’s northern Hindi-speaking belt where Modi’s BJP has only ever governed in a coalition.
Bihar’s main opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, has challenged the election commission in the Supreme Court, along with other parties and activists.
“It is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor (Indian) migrant communities,” the court petition read.
“They are not random patterns but… engineered exclusions.” Unlike many other countries, India does not have a unique national identity card.
The widely used biometric-linked “Aadhaar” identity card is not among the documents listed by the ECI as acceptable proof.
Documents that can be used include birth certificates, passports and matriculation records.
Of these, most people are likely to rely on their matriculation certificates.
But even those are in short supply in Bihar, where literacy rates are among the lowest in India.
According to an analysis published in The Indian Express newspaper, only 35 per cent of people in the state hold such a document.
“In Bihar, where literacy is not very high, many people are not likely to have the kind of documents the ECI has demanded,” said Jagdeep Chhokar from the
New Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).
“The poor, poorly educated, uneducated, and minorities will be the most impacted.”
‘Foreign infiltrators’
Detractors say the drive is unprecedented because “documentary proof has never been demanded” of people to vote in India.
“Only those who especially wanted their name inserted needed to fill a form,” said political activist and academic Yogendra Yadav. “For the rest, someone would come to their house and get their names registered.”
“The onus in India was never on the voter but on the ECI officials,” he added.
In previous verification drives, modifications were made to the existing rolls, Yadav said.
Now, a list is being drawn from scratch.
Yadav said the drive was a “de facto” implementation of an earlier plan to put together a list of Indian citizens.
The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was compiled in the eastern state of Assam in 2019, left out almost two million people. Many of them were Muslims.
The BJP had said the NRC would be replicated nationwide as it was necessary to detect “foreign infiltrators”, but was forced to backtrack after furious protests.
“Everyone has to now prove that they are citizens of India,” said Yadav.
“That is exactly what the NRC is… this is NRC by the backdoor. “</p><small>2025-07-10 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/101001453e86194.gif?r=114415' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923109/three-month-rent-assistance-announced-for-families-displaced-by-demolition-of-54-dilapidated-buildings-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Three-month rent assistance announced for families displaced by demolition of 54 dilapidated buildings in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani on Wednesday revealed that after the collapse of a building in Lyari, some 54 other dilapidated structures, mainly in the old city area, were being demolished to avert any tragedy.
“The process of evacuating buildings declared unsafe is also underway at a rapid pace,” said Mr Ghani while talking to reporters after a meeting with chairmen of different towns associated with the Jamaat-i-Islami.
“The government has decided to provide immediate rental assistance to those displaced by the demolition of dangerous structures. For all buildings being vacated and demolished due to structural risks, the Sindh government will pay three months’ rent to the affected residents as a temporary relief measure.”
The minister clarified that the support would not be limited to homeowners alone as the tenants living in these hazardous buildings would also receive three months of rent from the government.

In meeting with JI town chairmen, Saeed Ghani says dedicated committee to oversee rehabilitation of affected people

If needed, the financial support could be extended to six months or even a year, depending on each family’s situation and the progress of their rehabilitation, he said.
“We’ve established a dedicated committee to oversee the complete rehabilitation of the affected families and ensure that no one is left behind,” the minister said.
PTI files resolution in PA
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) legislators have demanded that a high-level probe body is formed, which should be comprised of members of the Sindh Assembly, to look into the “horrific” incident that claimed 27 innocent lives.
 
 

Parliamentary party leader of the PTI in the Sindh Assembly Muhammad Shabbir Qureshi submitted a resolution in the assembly addressing the alarming rise in building collapse incidents in Karachi.
Referring to the recent tragic Lyari incident, Mr Qureshi demanded that all negligent officials were identified and held accountable.
“The resolution further demanded that officers involved in corruption and criminal negligence face strict legal consequences,” said the statement.
“The resolution also urged the Sindh Assembly to approve the resolution and initiate a full debate on the issue of illegal constructions in Karachi, calling for policy reforms to prevent future tragedies.”
Governor sets up cell
A cell has been established in Governor House to assist affected families.
The cell will coordinate with relevant government agencies to ensure timely support and resolution of complaints from affected families, said a statement.
“Governor Kamran Tessori has also announced helplines — 1366 and 021-99204748 — for victims seeking help,” said the statement.

The outreach comes as Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has successfully arranged a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan, partially backed by the Asian Development Bank — the first such guarantee-based facility for the country.
Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, said in a post on X on Wednesday that the MoF team had engaged in technical discussions with prospective investors, underwriters, guarantors, a Chinese rating agency, and legal advisers. The meetings, which began on July 7, will continue until July 11 as part of a non-deal roadshow (NDR) ahead of Pakistan’s debut Panda Bond issue.
Mr Schehzad noted that the roadshow had attracted encouraging initial interest, reflecting investor confidence in Pakistan’s reform trajectory and its improving credibility in international markets. He added that the visit underscores the government’s commitment to proactive investor engagement and its strategy to broaden access to China’s deep and diversified onshore capital market.
 






In a separate development, Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has finalised a $1bn syndicated loan for Pakistan in partnership with a consortium of regional and international financial institutions, according to an official statement on Wednesday.
The five-year facility is partially guaranteed by a Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG) from the Asian Development Bank, marking the first transaction of its kind undertaken by the ADB for Pakistan.

The chairman of the committee, Senator Ali Zafar, also observed that the ministry of information had fai­led to provide a report in this regard and that its request to the ministry of interior had gone unanswered.
The committee decided to summon the secretary of interior in the next meeting for clarification regar­ding registration of cases against media persons under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
While discussing the Prohibition of Unethical Advertisements Act, Senator Afnan Ullah voiced concern over increasing display of content promoting gambling, alcohol and inappropriate clothing on TV and social media. He cited the appearance of betting ads during international cricket matches and depictions of alcohol use in TV dramas as evidence of regulatory lapses.
Senator Sarmad Ali highlighted the accessibility of gambling apps and proposed regulatory action by PTA or religious advisory mechanisms, along with the formation of a content monitoring body.
 
 

The committee members raised questions about the implementation of existing Pemra laws over such advertisements. Senator Pervaiz Rashid argued that penalties have failed to deter misconduct but cautioned against overregulation of cultural norms, especially for attire.
Senator Afnan clarified that the legislation does not aim to target women. The committee decided to seek the opinion of the minister of information over the Prohibition of Unethical Advertisements Act.
On the Right of Access to Infor­m­a­tion (Amendment) Bill, Senator Za­­rqa Suharwardy Taimur expressed serious concern about government departments providing incomplete or selective data. The senator cited Scotland as a role model where public institutions ensure transparency and timely responses.
The committee also discussed ad­­ministrative matters of PTV and exa­­mined budget and staffing issues.
The ministry officials reported that Rs11bn annual budget had been exhausted, with Rs8.5bn consumed by salaries of the PTV staff alone.
Senator Waqar Mehdi raised alarm over the illegal occupation of Radio Pakistan buildings in Karachi and electricity theft through unauthorised connections.
He called for inspections of Radio Pakistan properties outside Islamabad to assess conditions and prevent further encroachments.

There are no schoolbags slung over their shoulders, no uniforms, no books — it is not the children who will sit in class, but their mother.
The journey starts from a mud-walled house in one of the area’s scattered villages, situated approximately 40 minutes from Turbat city. Inside a small classroom at one of Dasht’s last standing primary schools, Shareefa takes her place on the bench.
Her children roam freely in the schoolyard, tumbling over one another in games that sometimes erupt into fights. When one of them cries, she rises quietly, calms the chaos, and returns to her seat. The chalkboard has already moved on to the next math question. The teacher never questions the interruptions; she never needs to.
 

Students of all ages sit inside a classroom at a boys primary school in Dasht.

When Shareefa first arrived to enrol, she was clutching the hand of her youngest child, and carrying eight years of silence. She had dropped out after the fifth grade, not for lack of will, but because there was no schooling beyond that in her village. Girls like Shareefa, who could not afford to move to Turbat, stayed behind. Early marriage followed, then motherhood.
“If you allow a woman with four children, I will study,” she had said softly. The teacher nodded, and so began her second chance at life.
Life in Dasht
Tucked in the rugged terrain of Kech district in sourthern Balochistan, Dasht is a scattered region comprising several remote settlements, each more isolated than the other. The people here have long depended on farming, but the drying local dam has snatched that livelihood too. With water now rationed by number, farmers have to wait days for their turn, ultimately forced to give up altogether.
In search of work, many of them have crossed over to the other side of the border into Iran, while others have moved into darker trades.
 

Residents of Dasht rely on farming for their livelihoods.

But that isn’t all of what is plaguing Dasht. The area lacks fundamental infrastructure — schools, hospitals, clinics. In times of emergencies, there is nowhere to go. Literally.
“A [sick] person has to die in Dasht … or wait,” a resident tells Dawn.com. Pickups leave for Turbat only once a day, typically before 11am, and if you miss it, you wait another day. Those without a vehicle of their own have little to no choice.
However, what Dasht suffers from the most is addiction.
 

The remainder of what agricultural land is left in Dasht.

“Here, drugs are like sweets,” says Salma, a widow from Sangai Dasht. “Some powerful men come, ask our men to cut wood, and in return, they hand them crystal meth. That’s how I lost my husband. That’s how many other women are losing theirs.”
Hence, survival in the area often rests on the backs of women. They farm what little land remains, sew intricate embroidery for mere pennies, and walk miles to fetch water from deep, uncovered wells. There’s no reliable mobile network, no electricity, and the only internet is patchy fibre WiFi, accessible only to those who own farmland, not the families working it.
Amidst the mess, it is education that remains the most neglected.
According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan 2024-25, unveiled just days earlier, the country’s cumulative expenditure on education — including the federation and provinces — remains a meagre 0.8 per cent, with the literacy rate a little above 60pc. Balochistan tops all the provinces in terms of out-of-school children, with a majority of them being girls.
The condition of schools that do exist is a completely different issue altogether. The survey shows that Balochistan consistently lags behind when it comes to access to electricity, water facilities, and toilet access.

The education epidemic
“There is no schooling after the fifth grade,” says Sanji, a young mother. “Even that exists only on paper. Teachers take their salaries but never show up.” Salma scoffs, recalling the time when she tried to enroll her daughter in the sixth grade in Turbat. “They told me she’s not even fit for the first grade. And they were right. Our kids hardly see a teacher’s face. How can they read?”
At government schools in Dasht, if a teacher appears at all, they arrive at 8am and leave within an hour. There are no peons, no inspections, no accountability. “No officer has ever visited our school,” claims Sanji. “Why would they? They get paid either way.”
 
 

“Teachers who are posted here from Turbat often don’t come themselves,” she continues. “They find someone local, hand them half their salary, and never set foot in the school again.” The locals assigned in their place, she adds, have only seen a blackboard from afar. “How are they expected to teach?”
It’s in this forgotten stretch of Balochistan, where silence and survival go hand-in-hand, that a class of 49 students, ranging from 11-year-old boys to 25-year-old girls, have gathered under a short-term, accelerated learning project supported by Unicef.
 

The white board in the class.

The United Nations agency’s 18-month initiative focuses on providing access to education for out-of-school children through the establishment of middle-level Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) centres. They educate children who have either never enrolled in school or dropped out, enabling them to catch up academically and transition into the formal education system at the middle-school level.
According to Faiz ur Rehman, Unicef’s Kech district project coordinator, the programme was launched in Tehsil Dasht on March 12, 2025, with a syllabus designed by the Bureau of Curriculum, Balochistan. “It’s different from the regular classroom syllabus,” he noted, “and is specifically tailored for children aged nine to 15.”
A second chance
The class gathers each morning in the lone room of a crumbling government boys’ primary school in Kont-e-Dar, one of Dasht’s few remaining functional school buildings. Here, under one roof, students from four distant pockets of Dasht — Kont-e-Dar, Jangol ay Mehtag, Merani Dem Mehtag, and Achanak Bazar sit shoulder to shoulder.
Some walk up to 40 minutes on foot to reach the school. Boys often hop onto the back of passing pickups. Girls, in pairs or alone, walk dusty roads under the unforgiving sun — Kech is known for being one of the hottest regions in the province — with their books wrapped in cloth.
 

Girls walk long distances to get to school in Dasht.

These long walks are not a rarity in other areas of Balochistan, where schools are few and far, with limited resources to reach them. The distances between settlements are vast. “In this heat, it feels like the head is boiling by the time we get to school,” says Ghani, a 12-year-old student.
“Whenever a biker or a pickup stops to give us a lift, it feels like the happiest day. When they don’t stop … we just send a pitiful curse their way.”
At the school, the classroom space is tight. The heat is unforgiving. There’s no electricity, no solar power. The washroom is nonfunctional. Children take breaks just to splash water on their faces before returning to class, their clothes soaked in sweat. The desks, small and few, strain to hold both the young boys and grown women. The students sweep the classroom floor themselves.
“Sometimes our hands ache,” says Shamsi, who just enrolled without ever having had a pause in her education, “but that doesn’t trouble us.”
“In winter, it becomes worse. When the cold wind hits us, we shake, we keep trembling. Sometimes, on our way, we stop at a villager’s kitchen just to warm up in front of the fire, and then go back to school… only to find the teacher absent,” she scorns.
But what now troubles them is something else entirely: the fear that this opportunity might vanish after 18 months. “What happens after that?” the children ask. It’s not a question about the syllabus. It’s a question about continuity.
For many in the room, this isn’t the first time their education has stopped, and they fear it won’t be the last. In most parts of Dasht, schooling ends at the fifth grade. The children who once dropped out for lack of options now fear another long wait. Another lost decade.
Sangeen, 22, sits at the far end of the classroom. A widow with no children, she walks nearly 30 minutes from Jangol Mehtag each day. “There’s nothing for me at home,” she says. “After school, I do embroidery to survive.” She had passed the fifth grade seven years ago. “I don’t know with what hope I’m studying now.
“Maybe just because they say education opens your eyes.” She pauses, then laughs. “But if this project ends, will I have to wait another seven years?”
Usman is 13, his skin sunburnt from days of walking under the scorching sun. A hat shields his face. “It protects me from the sun,” he grins. Each morning, he joins the class and learns what everyone else learns, but often leaves early as there’s work to be done — he is a shepherd and must tend to his goats. The little he earns from collecting grass and watching over the herds, he hands to his mother.
When asked what his father does, he smiles with blank eyes. “Mani pith, mani pith ady cryshtal kasheeth (my father uses crystal meth),” he says.
 

Usman and his mates sit on benches inside the classroom.

What will he do after the project ends? Usman shrugs and looks over at the girls in the class, many of whom returned to school after years. “I’ll wait another seven years,” he laughs. The chuckles follow, reverberating through the school’s weak walls. But the silence returns the next moment, heavy and unspoken.
Maryam returned to school this March after a gap of five years. She had once completed fifth grade, yet couldn’t spell her own name. “Now I can,” she says, a hint of pride tucked behind her shy smile.
She recalls those early school days with a dry laugh. “The teacher would show up early, stay for an hour, and then vanish. We’d be thrilled, we could go home!” Maryam pauses. “We thought that was happiness. Now we know it was not.”
The current project offered her another chance. But with only 18 months promised, uncertainty looms again. “If this ends,” she says, “I’ll ask the whole class to stage a dharna (protest). But I don’t know where we’d even go. No one listens anyway.”
Against all odds
Only two teachers run this middle-school-level class in Dasht: Mahwish, who travels from Turbat city, and Shabeena, a local from Dasht. Each day, Mahwish makes the bumpy journey to Kont-e-Dar, often passing children walking alone or in clusters along the dusty road.
“Sometimes I give them a lift,” she says. “They come from different bazars, and when they see my car, they start running. They know the teacher is here.”
Their rush, she adds, carries a history. “Maybe it’s because they’ve grown up not expecting teachers to show up. So when one actually does, they run not to miss it.”
 

The classroom at Kont-e-Dar has students across ages.

At 22, Ganjatoon is married and back in school after a six-year hiatus. She doesn’t speak in abstractions. Her words are blunt. “Ma zaalbol eda barbaady (we women here are suffering),” she says in Balochi.
In her part of Dasht, she says, it feels like there are no men left. “Most are addicted. Some sell drugs openly. If anyone dares to complain, the naib arrests them, but then a phone call comes, and the drug seller walks free.”
She traces the suffering back to the shoulders that carry everything. “We women do it all,” she says. “From farming to embroidery, to fetching water, we have to, because the men are lost to addiction.”
Their struggle doesn’t end with work. Ganjatoon says their homes, made of mud, collapse into crisis every time it rains. “When it pours, water drips from the roof until the house is soaked from top to bottom,” she says. “After the rain, another struggle begins, of drying, rebuilding, just surviving.”
 

Young boys attend class in Dasht.

She is aware that the odds are stacked against her. “I won’t get a job because I’m studying,” she says. “That post will go to someone who will never show up to teach.” But still, she shows up every day.
“I will study so that at least I can teach the children in my bazar when this project ends. I want to keep them away from nasha.”
Promises or distant echoes?
Aurelia Ardito, chief of education at Unicef Pakistan, acknowledges both the progress and persistent gaps.
“Kech is among the top-performing districts in Balochistan, second only to Quetta,” she notes, citing Education Management Information System 2022–23 data showing over 86,000 enrolled students. Girls’ enrollment rose by 30 per cent in recent years, and progression rates surpass provincial averages.
“But in Dasht, challenges remain — missing infrastructure, no toilets, no electricity, and serious teacher shortages.”
 

Students leaving the classroom.

The district education officer of Kech, Sabir Ali, confirms these struggles. “Most schools are single-teacher institutions,” he says. “If that one teacher is absent, the school simply can’t run.”
He says the education department is developing a 365-day plan for Kech — with reforms in teacher attendance, filling vacancies, and improving quality. Unicef, too, emphasises its commitment to supporting education in Balochistan and beyond.
But for the 49 students in this dust-walled classroom, the promises are distant echoes. They have already spent years watching schools remain locked, waiting on teachers who never came, and watching futures slip quietly out of reach. Whether this school will continue once the project ends — or slip back into silence — is a question that lingers like chalk dust in the dry air of Dasht.
Yet, the students of Dasht show up every day. Because hope, here, is not a policy. It’s the act of walking miles in the heat, of sitting on hard desks, of vowing to teach the next child even when no one is teaching you.

In a statement posted on the platform, she said she had decided to step down following what she described as  “two incredible years” leading the company through a major transformation.
No reason was given for her exit, but the resignation came as Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok was under fire for anti-Semitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and insulted Islam in separate posts on the X platform.
Yaccarino — a former NBCUniversal advertising executive — took over as X’s CEO in June 2023, replacing Musk who had been serving in the role since his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October 2022.
Her appointment came as Musk sought to focus on product development while bringing in an experienced media manager to restore advertiser confidence.

The 32-year-old actor was found dead when police, accompanied by a bailiff, broke open the door of her fourth-floor apartment in Ittehad Commercial, Phase VI.
DIG-South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police surgeon Summaiya Syed along with SSP-South Mahzoor Ali visited her flat and they suspected that she might have died around six months ago.
Elaborating, he said that the date of expiry of the bread and packaged milk kept in the refrigerator was September 2024.
Similarly, two SIMs in her cell phone were dead /inactive since September 2024 as per the call data record obtained by investigators. Besides, he said that power supply to her flat was disconnected in October 2024 reportedly by the KE ostensibly over non-payment of dues.
The police said the adjacent flat was empty during the period in which she was believed to have died.
Family refuses to take body
The DIG said that her family lived in Lahore and when the police approached them they, particularly her father, refused to take the body for burial.
Later, he said, the deceased’s brother-in-law approached the police and he was expected to arrive here on Thursday (today) to meet with the police.
As people learned that her father refused to take the body, prominent showbiz personalities approached the police, expressing their willingness to perform the last rites and arrange the burial, the DIG said.
“We shall hand them the body in case the family refuses,” he added.
He said that the cause of the death could be ascertained only after receiving chemical examiner’s report.

Presiding over a review meeting on development of the agriculture sector, the prime minister directed the authorities concerned to formulate a strategy for sustainable agricultural reforms in collaboration with provinces.
“Agricultural reforms shall commence with the provision of easy loans to farmers, for which a public-private partnership model is to be adopted,” Mr Sharif was quoted as saying in a press release issued by the PM Office.
 
 

The PM issued directives for urgent reforms in the Zarai Taraqqiati Bank for transparent provision of easy loans to farmers. He said the coming Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) would prioritise agricultural projects, focusing on mechanisation, digitisation, easy access to loans for farmers, and creating a business-friendly environment.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said sustainable agricultural reforms would boost the economy and reiterated the government’s commitment to an enhanced focus on reforming the livestock sector alongside agricultural commodities.
He said the federal and provincial governments would coordinate for implementation of agricultural reforms, calling for proposals to work out short-term and long-term strategies to enhance storage capacity for agricultural commodities.
The prime minister said progress in agriculture would primarily benefit farmers, emphasising collaboration among experts to develop the sector on modern lines.
He called for utilisation of agricultural zoning and value chain strategies to boost exports and introduce technology tailored to the needs of small landholders.
Proposals were presented to the prime minister for increasing agricultural production, improving infrastructure, establishing simple and sustainable regulations for a business-friendly environment, and ensuring easy access to loans for farmers.
The meeting was told that an “agriculture innovation and growth action plan”, focused on increasing farmers’ income, raising productivity and implementing reforms, was going ahead in the right direction.
 
 

The prime minister was told that measures were being taken to establish secure storage facilities for agricultural commodities.
Record remittances
The prime minister expressed satisfaction over record remittances received during the fiscal year 2024-25, saying that the government was committed to ushering in economic prosperity for all.
The prime minister observed that Pakistanis had sent remittances totalling $38.3 billion during the previous financial year, surpassing the tally for 2023-24 by $8bn.
“The record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis’ valuable contribution and their confidence in the national economy,” the PM observed.
He added that the recent positive economic indicators proved beyond doubt that the government’s policies were paying dividends.

The case relates to Bahria Town’s alleged illegal occupation of 684 acres in Rakh Takht Pari and 732.5 acres in the Loi Bher forests.
Takht Pari, located six kilometres from Rawal­pi­ndi near G.T. Road, spans a total of 2,210 acres and was transferred to the forest de­­­partment on Aug 4, 1856.
According to a Punjab government report, the land consists primarily of natural shrub forest, dominated by Phulai and Sanatha bushes.
Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan, representing Bahria Town owner Malik Riaz in the Supreme Court, defended his client by highlighting his charitable contributions, including the provision of medicines to the underprivileged and food to the needy. However, the court, while acknowledging Mr Riaz’s philanthropy, remarked that the case was akin to the saying: “Rob Peter to pay Paul.”

• Official statement causes confusion by terming ordinance an ‘act of parliament’
• Companies must be licensed by authority to offer virtual asset services
ISLAMABAD: The government announced on Wednesday that President Zardari had approved the ‘Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025’ to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
However, an official statement  from the office of the state minister referred to it as the ‘Virtual Assets Act, 2025’, leading to confusion and concerns about why the draft law had not been moved to the National Assembly or Senate, as required for a bill to become an act of parliament.
The confusion was clarified later when the authorities confirmed to Dawn that the regulation was not an act of parliament but rather an ordinance, issued under Article 89 of the Constitution. The provision allows the president to issue an ordinance in urgent matters when both houses are not in session; such ordinances remain in effect for 120 days and do not require passage through the National Assembly and Senate.
According to the Gazette of Pakistan dated July 9, 2025, seen by Dawn, the ordinance (No. VII of 2025) was promulgated on July 8 by the president to establish a regulatory authority for the licensing, regulation and supervision of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.
Earlier, the SAPM on blockchain and crypto said in a statement that the president “has approved landmark Virtual Assets Act 2025 on the prime minister’s advice”. It added that the government has formally approved the “act” following endorsements from the federal cabinet, the prime minister and the president.
The statement said that the law (ordinance) established “the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regul­atory Authority (PVARA), an autonomous federal body empowered to license, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets”.
The authority has been granted comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, financial integrity and the prevention of illicit activities in alignment with international standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
The authority’s board will include key government stakeholders, such as the State Bank’s governor, secretaries of finance, law and justice, and information technology and telecommunications, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and the Digital Pakistan Authority.
Two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance or technology will also be appointed by the federal government. The board’s chairperson will be chosen based on demonstrated experience in finance, law, technology or regulatory affairs.
Under the ordinance, any person or company intending to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by the PVARA. A structured licensing regime will be introduced, with specific requirements for incorporation, operational capacity, compliance frameworks and reporting obligations, the statement added.
“The legislation (ordinance) also incorporates a framework for responsible innovation by establishing a regulatory sandbox, allowing emerging technologies and business models to be tested under supervisory oversight,” it said.
In addition, the authority may issue no-action relief letters under defined conditions to facilitate experimentation while preserving regulatory accountability.
To ensure compatibility with Islamic finance principles, the law mandates the formation of a Sharia Advisory Committee, which will advise PVARA on matters related to the Sharia compliance of virtual asset products and services.
Licensed entities offering Islamic financial products will be bound by the rulings issued by the committee, the statement said, adding that the ordinance “also provides for the establishment of a Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals against regulatory decisions”.
The tribunal will function with judicial independence and a specialised bench comprising experts in law, finance and technology.
With this forward-looking legislation, Pakistan takes a major step in shaping a secure, inclusive and innovation-friendly digital financial ecosystem, ensuring that technological progress is matched with institutional readiness and public interest safeguards.
This milestone comes less than four months after the launch of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on March 14, marking the beginning of a new era in the country’s digital finance journey.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb serves as the chairman of the PCC, while Bilal Bin Saqib is its CEO, holding the status of the prime minister’s special assistant and the minister of state.

Officials told Dawn that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a meeting on Tuesday night, which lasted over 90 minutes, in which it was decided to convene a multi-party meeting to be attended by the heads of all parliamentary parties on Monday. This sitting would be followed by a PTI parliamentary party meeting on the same day.
“Apart from these two mee­tings, the provincial government has also decided to hold another meeting and to engage tribal elders along with other stakeholders in order to overcome the law and order situation,” officials said. Following these meetings, government delegations would be constituted to visit tribal districts, the officials said, adding that the invitations for the meeting were being sent.
When contacted, the chief minister’s adviser on information, Barrister Muham­mad Ali Saif, confirmed the development, saying the government intended to consult public representatives and stakeholders to devise a strategy for lasting peace in the region.

Huddle with govt allies, opposition parties likely on Monday; meeting with tribal elders also on the cards

“I will not say the situation is volatile, but there is unrest among people against the Taliban (Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan), with tribesmen from North Wazir­i­stan already holding a sit-in for peace while those from South Waziristan planning to hold a sit-in today [July 10],” Barrister Saif told Dawn. He said the protesters included people from all walks of life and from almost all political parties. He stated that some people had expressed concern over a military operation in their areas, calling such an action an extreme step.
 
 

“Now this is the reason we want to take everybody along — like all the stakeholders, including political parties, locals, tribal elders and others, so that they come up with their proposals and then those proposals along with suggestions from the government, are deliberated upon,” the CM’s aide said.
“The provincial government wants to develop a consensus. Like, whatever the government does for lasting peace, [it] should have public and political support,” he added.
Meanwhile, a statement issued from the chief minister’s secretariat read that the meeting was held to review the law and order situation in the merged districts with a special focus on North and South Waziristan. It said that the meeting decided to formulate a joint and consensus-based strategy involving all schools of thought and segments of the population to eliminate militancy.
 
 

CM Gandapur emphasised that the prevailing circumstances demanded that all political parties set aside their differences and unite on a single platform to work towards restoring peace and security and urged elected representatives to speak with one voice and implement a unified strategy for the eradication of terrorism. He further stated that lasting peace could only be achieved through meaningful action, mutual consultation, and collective decision-making.
Last week, thousands of people gathered in Mirali to protest an anticipated military operation in the area. In December last year, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly unanimously passed a joint resolution against potential military action in parts of Khyber and Bannu districts.

• Rubio announces sanctions against outspoken UN expert Francesca Albanese
• Six children among 26 killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza
JERUSALEM: As Israel fell in line with US President Donald Trump and his optimism about the prospects for a ceasefire and prisoner-release deal in Gaza, Hamas called the talks difficult due to Israel’s “intransigence”, but said it was working seriously to overcome hurdles.
The Palestinian group announced it would release 10 prisoners amid ongoing peace efforts, but clarified that the agreement still had several sticking points, including the flow of aid, withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and ‘genuine guarantees’ for a permanent ceasefire.
The announcement came after four days of indirect talks brokered by Qatar.
“Despite the difficulty of negotiations over these issues until now due to the intransigence of the occupation, we continue to work seriously and with a positive spirit with the mediators to overcome the hurdles and end the suffering of our people and ensure their aspirations to freedom, safety and a dignified life,” the group said.
Hamas has vowed “Gaza will not surrender” and a Palestinian official close to the ceasefire talks indicated that Israel was still holding back a deal by refusing to allow free entry of aid in Gaza.
One Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations in Doha said the Israeli delegation was “mostly listening rather than negotiating, which reflects Israel’s ongoing policy of obstruction and sabotaging any potential agreement”.
Meanwhile, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu – who met with top officials in Washington – struck a more upbeat note, in line with President Trump’s hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza this week or the next.
“I think we’re getting closer to a deal,” Netanyahu told Fox Business Network. “There’s a good chance that we’ll have it.”
Sanctions on UN expert
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the sanctioning of UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, following her criticism of Washington’s policy on Gaza.
The action was supposedly taken over the outspoken UN rapporteur’s “efforts to prompt (International Criminal Court) action against US and Israeli officials, companies, and executives”, Rubio claimed..
The Italy-born expert, who has consistently been a leading voice speaking for Palestinians, released a damning report earlier this month denouncing companies she said “profited from the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid, and now genocide” in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Rubio also attacked her for “biased and malicious activities,” and accused her of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism (and) support for terrorism.”
He said she escalated her contempt for the US by writing “threatening letters” to several US companies, making what Rubio called unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC pursue prosecutions of the companies and their executives.
Gaza strikes
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Wednesday that 26 people were killed in Israeli strikes, at least six of them children.
“The explosion was massive, like an earthquake,” said Zuhair Judeh, 40, who witnessed one of the strikes, which prompted frantic scenes as people scrabbled in the rubble for survivors.
“The bodies and remains of the martyrs were scattered,” he added, calling it “a horrific massacre”.

The two separate but iden­t­ical intra-court appe­als (ICA) were filed before the Supreme Court through senior counsel Hamid Khan and Muhammad Waqar Rana against the June 19 ruling.
The bar associations moved the apex court after five judges of the IHC — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Jus­tice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — challenged the same ruling before the SC on June 28.
In its decision, the constitutional bench, by a three to two majority, had held that the transfer of three judges from three different high courts to the IHC was within the framework of the Constitution. Less than two weeks after the decision, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan nominated Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as the permanent chief justice of the IHC and he was sworn in on July 8.
The fresh ICA requests the SC to set aside the June 19 judgement, arguing that it failed to resolve the key constitutional question regar­ding the requirement of taking an oath before assuming office as a judge of the IHC.
“It is an admitted fact that the transferred judges did not take oath upon their transfer to the IHC; therefore, they cannot legally assume office,” the petition stated. It added that the June 19 ruling was liable to be set aside as it failed to resolve the issue in essence.
The appeal contended that by remanding the matter to President Asif Ali Zardari, the majority judgment of June 19 effectively allowed the executive to rectify legal deficiencies in the Feb 1 notification, thereby facilitating executive to infringe upon the independence of the judiciary. The ruling, it claimed, violated the doctrine of trichotomy of powers.
It further argued that the June 19 order was against the law and all rules of fairness and thus void, without jurisdiction, coram non judice having been passed without lawful authority and thus of no legal effect.
The appellants submitted that all related actions as well as subsequent proceedings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan regarding the IHC chief justice’s appointment were unconstitutional and must be declared void. The judgment, notifications and appointments were purportedly made in pursuance of the directions given in the judgment, the petition said.
 
 

It is an accepted principle of constitutional interpretation that all articles and legal provisions were aggregate formulations incorporating therein constitutional values/principles and structure, the petition said. A constitutional document is to be read as a whole to understand the underlying constitutional values, principles and objectives, it said.
It explained that the independence of the judiciary was a basic feature of the Constitution and must be protected from executive interference, especially in matters of appointment, transfer, and removal of judges. The Supreme Court recognise the independence of the judiciary as one of the basic features of the Constitution, the petition said, adding the appointments, transfer and removal of judges having been provided in different provisions of the Constitution.

• KKH reopens for traffic but heatwave persists in GB; glacial melting, floods cause severe damage
LAHORE / GILGIT: At least 11 people lost their lives and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore, its surrounding districts and some parts of Balochistan on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.
In Lahore, the heavy rainfall submerged low-lying areas and major roads, exposing the city’s inadequate drainage infrastructure.
According to data from the Water and Sanitation Agency’s (Wasa) Monsoon Control Room, Lahore received an average of 58.8mm of rain, with some areas like Nishtar Town recording the highest 84mm, followed by Lakshmi Chowk (78mm) and Paniwala Talab (74mm).
The first spell of rain lashed the city from 2:45am to 5:40am, with a second, more intense downpour hitting between 10:45am and 12:11pm.
The heavy showers exposed the weaknesses in Lahore’s drainage system, with key areas such as Jail Road (63mm), Qurtaba Chowk (68mm) and Wasa Head Office in Gulberg (69mm) experiencing severe water accumulation. The rainwater mixed with sewage, creating a public health crisis as residents struggled to navigate flooded streets.
 
 

At Yakki Gate, a child was electrocuted by exposed wiring, while multiple Lesco feeders tripped across the city, leaving thousands without electricity for hours.
“We’ve been without power since the morning and the stagnant water is making it impossible to leave our homes,” said Rukhsana Bibi, a resident of Mughalpura, which received 60mm of rain.
Residents of Barki Road also faced immense difficulties in travelling. They complained that no machinery was sent to clear the water from the roads and streets until evening, with the Wasa and district administration focusing efforts on draining water only from “elite” areas.
Despite claims from the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) about deploying cleaning teams and clearing over 6,000 waste containers, citizens reported minimal improvements on the ground.
“The main roads are still submerged, and no one from the administration is here to help,” said Asif Mahmood, a shopkeeper at Lakshmi Chowk.
The situation was particularly dire in low-lying areas like Farrukhabad (49mm) and Johar Town (39mm), where drainage systems were virtually non-existent.
Monsoon rains also affected several other districts across Punjab in the last 24 hours. Khanewal recorded 51mm, Rawalpindi 42mm, Sahiwal 44mm, Murree 41mm, Okara 30mm, Mandi Bahauddin 27mm, Mangla 24mm, and Toba Tek Singh 13mm.
Other regions like Gujranwala, Bahawalpur, Gujrat, Kasur, Bahawalnagar, Sargodha, Multan and Jhang also experienced downpours.
Deaths and injuries
According to Rescue 1122, nine people lost their lives and many others were injured in rain-related incidents across the province.
Two children died when the roof of their house collapsed due to the rain in Sheikhupura. Rescue teams also retrieved four people trapped under the rubble of a collapsed house in Pakpattan. In Jhelum valley, a cloudburst caused severe damage to houses and vehicles, while roads were destroyed.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast more intense rainfall over the next 24 hours in Lahore and much of Punjab.
Irfan Ali Kathia, director general of Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), said the rains are expected to continue until July 13. Thunderstorms are likely on Thursday in Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujarat, Lahore and Hafizabad. The Punjab government has also imposed Section 144 around rivers and canals.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), water levels are expected to rise in the Kabul, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with low-level flooding likely at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Taunsa along the Indus.
Low-level flooding is also feared in Marala and Khanki on the Chenab River, and at Mangla on the Jhelum River. Tributaries of the Swat and Panjkora rivers may also experience flooding.
Heavy rainfall is expected to cause a significant rise in water flow in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur, as well as in local streams in Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob and Musakhel districts in Balochistan.
Two people were killed and another injured in separate rain-related incidents in Balochistan’s Khuzdar and Mastung districts on Wednesday. Heavy rainfall and strong winds caused a wall to collapse in Khuzdar, resulting in the death of a man named Muhammad Arif and injuring Ehsanullah.
In Bolan Colony in the Kanak area of Mastung, a tanker carrying LPG overturned on a person due to slippery roads caused by the rain. The victim, identified as Muhammad Yaqoob, was killed on the spot.
Glacial melting intensifies in GB
The current heatwaves have accelerated glacial melting across Gilgit-Baltistan, leading to widespread flooding and soil erosion that have disconnected roads, damaged homes, agriculture and disrupted power and water supplies in various areas.
 
 

Rising water levels in rivers and streams have put downstream communities at significant risk. According to the local administration, river erosion has severed links to the Hoper, Hisper and Nagar Khas areas on Thursday, with access roads submerged or washed away.
Flooding from the Supultar Nallah has once again damaged the RCC bridge and agricultural land in Tokorkot, while water from the Hamari Nallah and Supultar Nallah has cut off drinking and irrigation water supplies to most residents in Nagar Khas and Hoper.
The surge of glacial water near the Hamorkhay area has led to continued erosion, endangering homes in nearby villages. In Upper Hunza, rising water levels in the Khunjerab River have caused the destruction of power infrastructure, with two electricity poles submerged, cutting off the electricity supply to several villages in Gojal.
The situation has also affected irrigation and drinking water systems, crops and bridges, leaving the residents of Nagar and Hunza districts without essential services like water, electricity and road access.
In Gilgit, the increasing water levels in the Shigar River have damaged the K2 Road, leaving hundreds of residents and foreign tourists stranded. Officials said the melting Baltoro Glacier had rapidly increased the volume of water in nearby rivers and streams, further exacerbating the situation.
Flash floods in Babusar Valley, Chilas, also caused significant damage, with 10 homes destroyed and crops damaged. The Karakoram Highway, which had been blocked in Chilas, was reopened for traffic on Thursday, allowing thousands of stranded passengers, including tourists, to continue their journeys.
Rising water levels in the Jutal area in Gilgit have damaged homes and farmland, with many people living near rivers facing the imminent threat of flooding. Local officials have warned that the situation remains precarious, with many areas still without power, water and proper access routes.
The Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) expressed fears of a major water crisis in the region due to climate change, which is causing a decrease in snowfall and rapid melting of glaciers.
Geo-fenced SMS alerts
Meanwhile, Jazz and the NDMA have partnered to deliver geo-fenced SMS alerts to millions of citizens in flood-risk areas. The alerts, part of the Disaster Early Warning System (DEW-3), are designed to enhance public awareness and enable timely evacuations or precautionary measures in flood-prone areas.
Under the agreement, more than 23 million Jazz users residing in regions identified as vulnerable by the NDMA will receive location-based alerts, ensuring that citizens are informed of impending flood risks.

The petitioner also requested the SHC to restrain the respondents from seizing vehicles and imposing hefty fines during the ongoing crackdown on old number plates.
Citing the secretary excise & taxation department, deputy director motor vehicle registration wing and deputy inspector general of traffic police as respondents, Faizan Hussain petitioned the SHC and submitted that he was a social worker and chairman of Karachi Nojawan Party and Nojawan Foundation.
He said that thousands of helpless individuals had been deprived of their legal and constitutional rights due to the influence of powerful individuals and the harsh attitude of the authorities. Citizens, he argued, were being forced to purchase expensive new number plates and were facing harassment.
He further submitted that the excise and taxation department had ordered the replacement of the old yellow number plates on all private and commercial vehicles with newly designed plates featuring the Ajrak pattern and set a deadline of May 3.
The petitioner maintained that vehicles were being seized and heavy fines imposed for failing to replace the number plates, despite the fact that the old registration plates had also been issued by the government for a fee. He argued that there was no legal justification for penalising citizens or depriving them of the right to use their vehicles.
He contended that if a new policy for number plates had been introduced, the plates should be issued free of cost, as citizens had already paid fees for registration. He claimed that the respondents’ actions were in violation of principles of natural justice and constitutional provisions.
The petitioner also alleged that the issuance of new number plates had turned into a commercial activity which was causing hardship and financial strain on citizens. Despite collecting significant fees, the authorities had failed to issue the new plates in a timely manner, forcing many people to wait for months.
He further claimed that the official plates were not being issued through proper channels but were instead being produced by unauthorised individuals operating roadside stalls, who were minting money from citizens illegally.
According to the petitioner, the respondents were charging Rs500–700 for motorcycles, Rs1,500–2,000 for private vehicles, and Rs2,000–3,000 for commercial vehicles. He argued that such costs were financially burdensome, especially for people already struggling to afford petrol, food, school fees and other basic necessities.
He also alleged that in addition to the fixed fees, officials were demanding bribes and harassing citizens during the ongoing crackdown, including seizing vehicles and imposing excessive fines without justification.
The petitioner argued that these actions, particularly by traffic police, were illegal, amounted to abuse of power and were creating fear and harassment among law-abiding citizens, including himself.
He urged the court to direct the respondents to act in accordance with the law, refrain from harassing citizens, issue the Ajrak-designed number plates free of cost and facilitate the public by extending the deadline.
The petitioner also pleaded to restrain the respondents from seizing the vehicles and imposing hefty fines upon the owners/drivers of such vehicles.

According to sources, one of the slain militants was a key TTP commander, Mehran alias Hanzala, who was involved in multiple terrorist activities in the region. Acting on credible intelligence regarding his presence, the forces launched a swift and targeted operation, effectively neutralising a major threat. 
Another terrorist reportedly sustained injuries during the operation but managed to escape. During the raid, the forces recovered two sub-machine guns, a motorcycle and other belongings of the terrorists. 
Security officials reiterated their commitment to continuing anti-terror operations until militancy is completely eradicated from the region.
