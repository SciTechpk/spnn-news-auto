Last week, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan dissolved the party’s political committee amid disagreements within the opposition party in his first move after weeks of being incommunicado.
The party’s Central Secretariat issued a notification, signed by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi.
“The secretary general, on the instruction of the party’s founding chairman and in consultation with senior colleagues in the party, hereby reconstitutes the Political Committee of the Party/Alliance,” the notification said.







The newly formed committee, which will come into effect immediately, will serve as the ‘apex decision-making body of the party with respect to all decisions/ functioning, its wings and other committees.’ It will convene at least once a week, and its decisions will be implemented through the Central Secretariat and relevant party structures across the country.
It will also lay down “policies to be followed by the parliamentary parties of PTI in the National Assembly, the Senate and the provincial assemblies, including the assemblies of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu Kashmir.”
“Sub-Committees shall be formed with individuals having relevant experience, including office-bearers of the party’s wings, invited to serve on the sub-committees,” it said.
Members of the Political Committee include PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan; PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja; PTI Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi; PTI Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi; Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas; proposed Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mahmood Khan Achakzai; former Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub; former Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz; Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Moeen-ud-Din Riaz Qureshi; former Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar; Secretary Overseas (International Chapter) Sajjad Burki; Provincial Presidents/Chief Organisers Aliya Hamza, Junaid Akbar, Haleem Adil and Dawood Kakar; Special Regions (AJK and GB) representatives Khalid Khursheed and Sardar Qayyum Niazi; Secretary General Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan Asad Qaiser; Chief Whip in the NA Amir Dogar; Coordinator for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Fawzia Arshad; President Women’s Wing Kanwal Shauzab; and President Minorities’ Wing Dr Lal Chand Malhi.
The notification further said, “Sub-Committees shall be formed with individuals having relevant experience, including office-bearers of the party’s wings.”
It is worth mentioning that Qaiser had said the proposal for the dissolution of the political committee had been floated many a time by the members. One of the reasons for the dissolution of the previous committee was that the decisions were being leaked, he said, adding that the timing of the announcement did not matter since the proposal was under consideration for some time.
Earlier, an internal memo aimed to centralise control in the office of the secretary general was issued. The move had come under fire, as party insiders said it seemed to be an attempt to “end democracy and silence dissent” in the PTI.
A PTI leader, wishing not to be named, said there were around 40 members in the dissolved political committee due to which decisions were being leaked. “There was a need to include [opposition alliance members] Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mahmood Khan Achakzai in the committee,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-13 03:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/122213012ec7640.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960718/tallal-chaudhry-hopes-ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameeds-fate-will-deter-future-interference' target='_blank'><strong>Tallal Chaudhry hopes ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed’s fate will deter future ‘interference’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry on Friday expressed hope that, following the sentencing of former spymaster Faiz Hameed, there would be less “interference” in politics in the future.
The former head of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by a military court on four charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister noted that if such a high-profile official in the armed forces had been court-martialled, it could also happen to others.
“The institution has set a new example and standards in the wake of this case,” he said.
“There will be less interference. People will remember that if you can be punished while in service and even after retirement, then anyone who commits wrongdoing while in service will think about what will happen to them. I believe this will make a significant difference.”
Chaudhry claimed that decisions made by former prime minister Imran Khan “revolved around Faiz Hameed’s recommendations”.
“There are chances that multiple decisions from before, during and after his tenure revolved around Faiz’s recommendations,” the minister said.
“Faisal Vawda and other representatives have given evidence of this before. As a political worker, I have seen this happen.”
Chaudhry further said that the matter is being investigated by “an institution which has set a new standard for transparency in Pakistan” and discouraged speculating about future steps until it is complete.
“We are hopeful that they (investigators) will uncover the truth after performing an investigation on its merits,” he said. “Instead of speculating, we should wait for the investigation.”
The state minister elaborated that the former spymaster was jailed because he “crossed a legal red line” and further said that crossing red lines instead of participating in politics “would come to an end”.
“Any action against whoever has broken the law and damaged Pakistan, its army and its perception, to prevent them from doing it in the future, is the right choice,” he stated.
Hameed, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody in August 2024, as the military announced the initiation of Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings against him.
The move was prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society and had shattered the long-standing perception that spy chiefs were untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence.
In December 2024, a military court indicted Hameed on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority. The indictment marked the start of the trial of the former intelligence chief before an FGCM.
At the time, the ISPR had said that “events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents, including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests” were also being investigated.</p><small>2025-12-13 03:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130818091008059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960720/un-expert-decries-imrans-detention-calls-on-authorities-to-ensure-compliance-with-international-standards' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Imran’s detention, calls on authorities to ensure compliance with international standards</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani aithorities to comply with international norms and standards.
In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.
Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.”
The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions.
“I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement.

 

“Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.”
“Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison.
Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled
Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account.
“According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool.
“You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.”







Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers.
However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach.
“The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform.
Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters.
“I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-13 03:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1308151286b4ce1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960860/syedal-vows-to-enforce-his-ruling-to-bar-criticism-of-national-heroes' target='_blank'><strong>Syedal vows to enforce his ruling to bar criticism of national heroes</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A week after barring criticism of ‘national heroes’ including political leadership in the House, Deputy Chairman of Senate, Syedaal Khan, on Friday vowed to enforce his surprising ruling.
Talking to reporters here, he made it clear that derogatory or disrespectful remarks against national heroes whether from the armed forces, politics, judiciary, or any national institution cannot be tolerated within the House.
“Every member has the right to express views, but that right must be exercised within the constitutional framework, rules of procedure, and established parliamentary traditions,” he emphasised.
Mr Khan said that protecting the sanctity of the House is a collective responsibility of all lawmakers and we must uphold its dignity, rules and procedures, and constitutional mandate.
He expressed these views in an informal conversation with media persons at the Parliament House.
Mr Khan said that formal letters have al­­ready been issued to all parliamentary leaders, including those from PTI, to ensure str­ict implementation of the ruling issued by the acting chairman of Senate. Copies of the ruling have also been sent to the Leader of the House, the law ministry, and the chief whip to remove any possible ambiguity.
He claimed that the ruling regarding the suspension of members involved in obstructing the proceedings issued on December 4 would be enforced without compromise. Mr Khan said the ruling categorically states that bringing banners, placards, photographs, or any such material into the House, which undermines parliamentary decorum, is strictly prohibited.
He stressed that safeguarding the credibility and prestige of Parliament is the sha­red duty of all political actors. He paid tribute to the country’s security forces for their sacrifices in ensuring peace and security and urged all stakeholders to refrain from irresponsible statements on any forum.
He said any member speaking within the constitutional and parliamentary limits will be fully protected in their right to exp­ress themselves, but reiterated that Parlia­ment will not be allowed to become a platform for pressure tactics, intimidation or provocation. “This ruling is not against any specific party, individual, or group. It is strictly in accordance with the rules and laws governing the Senate. The sole purpose is to preserve the sanctity of the House and uphold parliamentary values,” he asserted.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the surge is driven primarily by influenza A(H3N2) and an emerging subclade known as subclade K, a drifted variant of H3N2 with multiple genetic changes from related viruses.
The WHO confirms that influenza activity has increased globally in recent months, with an early rise in flu activity being observed in several countries.
It is important to note that the current epidemiological data do not show that subclade K causes more severe disease than previous strains. However, its early spread ahead of the typical season curve is important, and vaccination remains one of the most effective public health measures to reduce severe illness and hospitalisation.
WHO emphasises that influenza remains common and continues to evolve seasonally through gradual genetic change, requiring ongoing surveillance and vaccine updates. Vaccination is still expected to offer protection against the range of circulating viruses, including drifted subclades, and is particularly important for high‑risk groups.
Situation in Pakistan
While it has increased hospitalisations in Europe, specialists note that Pakistan’s smaller elderly population and established seasonal patterns mean the local impact is likely to remain less severe, though still significant.
In Islamabad, former Punjab health minister and International Advisor for the Royal College of London, Dr Javed Akram, told Dawn that the virus has undergone mutation, which can increase risk in vulnerable groups.
“Once the flu converts into pneumonia, patients, especially children, aged persons, and those who suffer with comorbidity have more chances to be shifted to ventilators,” he said. “I suggest that people should be vaccinated against influenza before the start of winter.”
Dr Akram, who is also Chairman of the Pakistan Society of Internal Medicine, added that the vaccine, on average, reduces 70 per cent chances of influenza, suggesting that all healthcare staff should be vaccinated as they not only become more vulnerable to the illness but can also become carriers of the virus.
Dr Rana Safdar, an expert in emerging infectious diseases who led Pakistan’s Covid-19 response, said Pakistan was currently in the peak flu transmission window. He explained that while young people drive community spread, severe complications emerge primarily in older individuals and those with chronic illnesses. “Very few elderly Pakistanis get the flu vaccine, leaving them vulnerable each winter,” he said.
He confirmed that the new H3N2 subclade K — responsible for the UK surge — is also being detected in Pakistan. “Although the strain is antigenically different from what the WHO selected for the 2025–26 flu vaccine, vaccination will still reduce the risk of severe disease.”
He warned that dense fog blanketing parts of the country may worsen transmission. “Measures are very much standard with stress on masks, handwashing and distancing from persons with symptoms. When symptomatic, patients shouldn’t rush for antibiotics but take good rest and use hot liquids alongside healthy food,” he suggested.
Microbiologist Professor Javaid Usman said diagnosing flu purely on symptoms was nearly impossible due to the circulation of many respiratory viruses at this time of year, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2. “The best time to get vaccinated — as they call it the ‘Sweet Spot’ — is September to October because it takes at least two weeks to build effective immunity to protect a person,” Dr Usman said.
At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Chief of Public Health Laboratories Dr Muhammad Salman confirmed that seasonal influenza was widespread globally as well as in Pakistan. “A new vaccine is introduced every year in August, and I suggest that it should be administered to aged people and those who are immunocompromised.”
‘Sharp increase across Punjab’
In Lahore, senior medical experts are reporting a “sharp” rise in super flu cases, particularly in densely populated urban centres. Families living in multi-storey buildings, people frequenting crowded markets, and those attending weddings are among the most exposed due to close physical proximity.
Senior Principal Medical Officer and consultant Dr Masood Akhtar Sheikh said the strain was contributing to “a sharp increase in cases across major Punjab cities, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad.”
“No deaths linked to the variant have been reported in Pakistan, but the number of patients presenting with flu and chest complications has risen. Children are acting as super-spreaders within households, often transmitting the virus to elderly family members.”
Dr Sheikh noted that the current surge is compounded by routine seasonal flu, Covid-19 and RSV infections, warning that international travel may accelerate spread, as seen in the UK, where this season has been compared to the severe 2017–18 flu wave.
Senior physician Dr Mohammad Arshad, who served as the former head of the emergency department at Lahore’s Shaikh Zayed Hospital, recommended oseltamivir for high-risk patients, saying it can reduce disease duration and severity. It is, however, not needed to treat all patients.
“The patient should wear an N95 mask, practise frequent handwashing, and maintain proper ventilation of indoor rooms,” he recommended, adding that a patient should maintain good hydration and proper nutrition for early recovery.
He also emphasised that the flu vaccine remains strongly recommended for everyone over six months of age.

In a statement issued on Friday, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said that Dawn was among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation.


Translation: The Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) has strongly condemned the suspension of advertisements for Dawn TV and Dawn Radio, following the earlier suspension for Dawn Media Group’s newspapers. CPNE stated that Dawn is among Pakistan’s most reputable media outlets, and imposing a ban on government advertisements is tantamount to economically weakening it.In this regard, the CPNE President and Secretary General said in a joint statement that Dawn Media Group has provided impartial reporting in Pakistan since its inception. Initially, its newspapers were subjected to a ban on advertisements, and now the government has also deprived Dawn Media Group’s electronic platforms of government advertisements. They demanded that the government immediately lift the ban on Dawn Media Group’s advertisements.

The statement, attributed to the council’s president and secretary general, recalled that the Dawn Media Group had been providing unbiased information since the creation of Pakistan.
Initially, the release of advertisements to the group’s flagship newspaper was stopped, and now its electronic platforms had also been deprived of ads.







Govt ads should not be used to strangle dissenting voices: APNS
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also condemned the stoppage of government ads to Dawn Media Group outlets, saying it was “dismayed”.
“The APNS stated that for the last 13 months, Daily Dawn was suffering from [the] curtailment of government advertising, but now the news channel and radio [channel] owned by Dawn Media has also been subjected to denial of government advertising, which is not only unjust but also [an] attack on freedom of expression,” a press release from the body read.
As per the press release, the APNS observed that the step had been taken to “force the media group to change its editorial policy” and opined that since these advertisements are paid for through the treasury, they “should not be used as [a] tool to strangle the dissenting voices”.
“The APNS expresses its solidarity with [the] Dawn Media Group in this hour of financial stifling and urges … the federal and provincial governments to review their unconstitutional decision and restore government advertising to Dawn Media Group,” the press release concluded.
Broadcasters’ body urges govt to withdraw ad ban
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA), according to a press release, condemned the ban on advertisements in a statement and said it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”.
“In an age when fake news on social media is widespread, the role of traditional media becomes even more critical,” the press release read.
“The statement urged the government to immediately withdraw the advertising ban on Dawn Media Group in the interest of free and responsible journalism”.
Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”.
The Sindh government, too, has periodically withheld its ads for arbitrary reasons.
This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn’s reporting – after the so-called ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas, on the orders of certain individuals.</p><small>2025-12-13 02:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1307311113d10bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960828/petroleum-prices-likely-to-see-up-to-rs12-per-litre-dip' target='_blank'><strong>Petroleum prices likely to see up to Rs12 per litre dip</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The prices of all petroleum products are estimated to go down by up to Rs12 per litre on Monday for the next fortnight ending Dec 31 in view of variation in the international market.
Based on existing tax rates, the informed sources said the ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) has been estimated to drop by about Rs11.80 per litre (over 4pc) depending on final calculations, while petrol rate may be kept unchanged as the estimated reduction was less than a rupee per litre.
The government may also build about Rs1.28 per litre additional cost to the prices to accommodate 61 paise and 67 paise per litre higher margins to oil companies and their dealers, respectively, as approved earlier this week by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet.
The ex-depot prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Rs11.50 (6pc) and Rs10 per litre (6pc), respectively. The kerosene and LDO rates currently stand at Rs192.86 and Rs173.77 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs263.45 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class. The ex-depot price of HSD stands at Rs279.65 per litre which may drop to Rs268 per litre on Dec 15.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares on the basis of about Rs27 per litre increase between May and August and have not reversed despite Rs9 per litre cut. The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs96 per litre on diesel.
Although, general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL)

WASHINGTON: International troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as next month to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force, two US officials told Reuters, but it remains unclear how Hamas will be disarmed.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) would not fight Hamas. They said lots of countries had expressed interest in contributing and US officials are currently working out the size of the ISF, composition, housing, training and rules of engagement.
An American two-star general is being considered to lead the ISF but no decisions have been made, the officials said.

 

Deployment of the force is a key part of the next phase of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan. Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year war began on October 10 and Ham­as has released hostages and Israel has freed detained Palestinians.
“There is a lot of quiet planning that’s going on behind the scenes right now for phase two of the peace deal,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told rep­o­r­ters on Thursday. “We want to ens­ure an enduring and lasting peace.”
Indonesia has said it is prepared to deploy up to 20,000 troops to take on health and construction-related tasks in Gaza.
“It is still in the planning and preparation stages,” said Rico Sirait, spokesperson of Indonesian Defence Ministry. “We are now preparing the organisational structure of the forces to be deployed.”
Demilitarising Gaza
The Security Council authorised the ISF to work alongside newly trained and vetted Palestinian police to stabilise security “by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” However, it remains unclear exactly how that would work.
US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz noted on Thursday that the ISF was authorised by the Security Council to demilitarise Gaza by all means necessary - which means use of force. “Obviously that’ll be a conversation with each country,” he told Israel’s Channel 12, adding that discussions on rules of engagement were under way.
Hamas has said the issue of disarmament has not been discussed with them formally by the mediators - the US, Egypt and Qatar - and the group’s stance remains that it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established.
Support for UNRWA
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of eight Muslim and Arab countries issued a statement of support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees on Friday.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar affirmed “the indispensable role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in protecting the rights of Palestinian refugees and caring for their affairs”.







The statement follows a report by Reuters that the Trump administration has discussed slapping a terror designation on UNRWA.

ISLAMABAD: Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed Ankara’s readiness to contribute to a mechanism established to maintain stability amid ‘extended ceasefire’ between Pakistan and Afghanistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at an international forum on Friday urged the global community to press the Afghan Taliban to honour their international obligations and curb terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
President Erdogan made the offer during a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the international forum held in Turkmenistan, where the premier also held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon and Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov.







Addressing the event dedicated to the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality and the anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality, PM Shehbaz said peaceful dispute resolution was “a cornerstone” of Pakistan’s foreign policy. In this regard, he also cited Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and its subsequent endorsement by the UN Security Council.
Pakistan began the year by taking its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Cou­ncil, where it was working to uphold global peace and security, he said.
“While we persevere in this quest for peace, the scourge of terrorism is, however, raising its head yet again, and this time, unfortunately, from Afghan soil,” he said, urging the international community to press the Taliban government to fulfil its commitments and rein in terrorist elements operating from its territory.
PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Isla­mabad and Kabul. He noted that the ceasefire still stood though it remained ‘fragile’. He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to ‘peaceful dispute resolution’.
He also referred to the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2788 earlier this year as an endorsement of Pakistan’s approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes.
The premier said he hoped ongoing peace efforts in the Middle East would help protect Palestinian lives, ensure a lasting ceasefire, enable the flow of humanitarian assistance and support reconstruction in Gaza. He reiterated Pakistan’s support for the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine and Kashmir.
Stressing that lasting peace was intrinsically linked to sustainable development, PM Shehbaz said the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provided a blueprint for a more peaceful world and described socio-economic development as a key government priority. He said Pakistan had made progress in areas including financial inclusion and greater economic participation for women and marginalised groups.
He said Pakistan’s pursuit of sustainable development faced headwinds from climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations, adding that access to advanced technologies, particularly digital technologies, must be equitable and non-discriminatory.
He urged global leaders to treat the forum as a call for urgent action and a new paradigm in international relations, calling for investment in connectivity as “bridges for people, ideas and prosperity”. Earlier, the prime minister congratulated Turkmenistan on the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality and on the UN’s designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
The premier also joined other leaders at the Neutrality Monument, where they attended a wreath-laying ceremony before addressing the forum.
PM meets Iran president
PM Shehbaz later held a bilateral meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the forum, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Both leaders appreciated the support the neighbouring countries provided to each other when they faced external aggression earlier this year, according to the statement.
Referring to the 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission, PM Shehbaz emphasised the need to strengthen bilateral cooperation to expand trade, operationalise border markets, enhance border security and improve connectivity, including through the Isla­mabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network.







He also reiterated the need to urge the Afghan Taliban to take meaningful action to address Pakistan’s security concerns related to terrorism. The two leaders discussed Gaza as well, the PM Office said.
President Pezeshkian expressed a desire to further strengthen ties with Pakistan, and both sides agreed to maintain regular high-level engagement. Mr Sharif conveyed his regards to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
In his interaction with President Erdogan, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the significance of bilateral ties and discussed cooperation in areas including energy, the economy, defence and investment. He welcomed Turkish interest and investment in petroleum, energy and minerals and underscored the importance of regional connectivity including the revival of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail link.
President Erdogan thanked the prime minister and expressed a desire to work together to strengthen relations.

• Single Secondary School Certificate proposal still under review                  
ISLAMABAD: The Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) on Friday notified a new policy allowing students with an arts background in matric to enroll in pre-medical and pre-engineering groups (FSc) at the intermediate level.
The notification, issued by the IBCC, which is the main coordinator for all education boards, stated that arts students could register in these groups starting from the first annual examinations of 2026.
“Consequent upon the recommendation of the Sub-Committee and response received from Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PM&DC), Higher Education Commission (HEC), National Curriculum Council (NCC) and Provincial Curriculum Authorities, the IBCC Forum [meeting of all boards] in its 183rd meeting held on Dec 4-5, 2025 has unanimously resolved that the students who have passed the SSC (Arts Group) may be allowed to register for HSSC pre-medical and pre-engineering groups, effective from the [H]SSC 1st annual examination 2026 onwards,” read the notification. 
It added that the forum also recommended that “[the] concerned institutions may take appropriate measures, such as setting minimum marks/merit, threshold, conducting placement or aptitude tests, etc, in order to maintain uniformity across all boards”.
However, it continued that the final decisions for this purpose — related to aptitude test, etc — “shall be taken at the respective board level, subject to obtaining the requisite approval from their boards of governors and other competent forum, where applicable”. 
The notification has been shared with all education boards of the country. 
The meeting also approved a major shift for O/A level students. Those who pass two major subjects in O/A level will now receive equivalence in the science group rather than humanities.
SSC proposal 
The forum further discussed the abolishing of separate science and arts groups at the matriculation level and replacing them with a single Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with flexible elective subject choices. However, this proposal will be further debated in the upcoming meetings before reaching any final decision.
When contacted, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah elaborated that the change was made by all boards of the country and other stakeholders to serve the wider interests of the students.
He argued that “rigid and narrowed” policies limited opportunities and that any student capable of clearing the FSc (pre-medical and pre-engineering) curriculum should be allowed to sit in the exam. “This is a great decision to open new avenues for students,” he added. 
Asked about notification issued on Friday, he clarified that although it specifically mentioned pre-medical and pre-engineering, arts students could now also opt for any group, including ICS and I.Com. “Actually, the main issue was pre-medical and engineering and that’s why these groups are reflected in the notification.”

Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh issued the ruling on a petition filed by Jameel Ahmad seeking the quashing of an FIR registered at Police Station City Liaqatpur under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes punishment for rape. 
The complainant had alleged that the petitioner lured her into cohabitation and later married her on April 22, 2024. She claimed she later discovered he was already married and, upon her protest, he divorced her on Oct 14, 2024. 
According to the FIR, three days later — on Oct 17 — the petitioner and a co-suspect allegedly entered her home at night, where the petitioner raped her at gunpoint. 
The petitioner, however, denied the allegation of a live-in relationship and contended that the FIR was fabricated as retaliation for the divorce. He admitted issuing a written Talaq deed but argued that he had revoked the divorce on Dec 23, 2024, within the 90-day statutory reconciliation period. 

Court quashes FIR registered against petitioner 

He further submitted that he had filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, which remained pending. 
In his judgement, announced at the court’s Bahawalpur bench, Justice Sheikh noted that the central question before the court was whether Talaq had legally taken effect by Oct 17, 2024 — the date of the alleged offence. 
The judge undertook a survey of Islamic jurisprudence as well as statutory requirements under Section 7 of the MFLO, observing that although Islamic law recognises multiple forms of Talaq, Pakistani law mandates a specific legal mechanism. 
Section 7 requires a notice of Talaq to be provided to the chairman of the relevant union council, and mandates a 90-day reconciliation period. Talaq does not become effective unless this period expires without revocation. 
The judge noted that the petitioner had dispatched notice of Talaq to the union council but had subsequently revoked it before the expiry of the statutory period. 
Citing Supreme Court precedents, Justice Sheikh reiterated that failure to comply with statutory requirements renders the divorce legally ineffective, even where a Talaqnama exists under Islamic law. 
The judge observed that under Section 7(3) of MFLO, the parties remain husband and wife until either the 90-day period expires or the husband explicitly revokes Talaq, whichever comes first.  
He concluded that on Oct 17, 2024, the date of the alleged incident, the marriage had not dissolved in the eyes of the law. 
Under Shariah, the judge noted, a crime is an act prohibited by divine injunction and punishable by Hadd or Ta’zir penalties. 
In the present case, Justice Sheikh maintained, the marital bond between the parties continued to exist legally at the time of the alleged occurrence. He said the petitioner’s conduct may be considered immoral or inappropriate under religious or social norms, but prosecution under Section 376 of PPC could not be sustained as the essential ingredients of the offence were not made out on the FIR’s own assertions. 
With these observations, the judge allowed the petition and quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner.

Railways Minister Muhammad Hanif Abbasi briefed the committee on the rationale behind the initiative, saying that it would benefit the Reko Diq mining project by improving logistics.
The committee, headed by Senator Jam Saifullah Khan, was told that provincial governments were also interested in investing in Pakistan Railways, and these amendments would enable them to contribute to the railway infrastructure.

Move to attract investment through track access, benefit Reko Diq project

The amended bill provides track access for operating rolling stock on the Pakistan Railways network to improve efficiency, facilitate competition, boost revenue, strengthen safety planning, and support investment in freight and passenger services using operators’ own locomotives and rolling stock.
Proposed railway board
Senator Rubina Khalid pointed out the absence of the minister, as a public representative, from the proposed railway board.
The committee chairman asked the railways minister to address the issue at the earliest. He directed the inclusion of the federal railways minister on the board to ensure stronger oversight and accountability.
The committee also proposed several measures for improvement within Pakistan Railways, and advised the ministry to approach the chambers of commerce to attract investment and expand public-private partnerships.
The chairman directed the ministry to extend the ongoing improvements, such as the installation of LEDs at major stations to smaller ones as well.
He also instructed the ministry to step up public awareness efforts on safety near railway tracks.
The committee reviewed an issue raised by Senator Shahadat Awan, who voiced concern about the possible impact on serving employees. The panel urged the minister to safeguard the interests of the serving staff.
The chairman directed the ministry to present a comprehensive briefing at the next meeting on outsourcing in railways, new hiring, its effects on the serving employees, manpower planning, budget implications, and revenue trends before and after outsourcing.

The view above contrasted smoothly with the expanse of the deep blue of the astroturf of the venue, located in the midst of the sprawling Gulshan-e-Iqbal.
As buses honked relentlessly at the ever-bustling Nipa after having swished dust off the perpetually under-construction University Road, hockey took centre stage on the other side of the wall.
It was the day when the gold medal winners for the national sport at the National Games were to be decided.

There were no surprises; it were heavyweights Wapda and Army who added to their already stacked medals table to take the honours in the women’s and men’s finals respectively.
Each achievement was celebrated with maximum zeal, as the announcer shouted his heart out even for the silver medal winners Punjab and Navy.
The screams got louder as Wapda and Army received their gold medals.It was a second gold for Wapda’s talisman Sidra Mateen, who scored both their goals in their 2-1 victory over Punjab.

She had already won a gold medal as a basketball player earlier.
“I started with cricket as most girls do but then stayed where my financial needs were met,” Sidra told Dawn after the final.
The 28-year-old lost the hockey final of the previous edition of the National Games in 2023, as a Punjab player was roped in by Wapda later on.
“As a young athlete, you just want to play anything you can, it’s all about passion,” she said. “But when you grow up, survival is the focus and a job with the department really helps.”
After the women’s final ended and the prizes distributed, the announcer requested the players on the field to “hurry up” off it.
“We have to conduct another match,” he would say, and the Navy and Army players would take on to the turf to warm up.
In no time, the whistle was blown, and the big match got underway. As a sparse crowd of spectators and dignitaries looked on, both sides stayed compact and took a counterattacking approach when the chances arrived.

It was hectic for three of the four quarters in both dugouts as coaches shouted instructions in thick Punjabi accents.
The drought was finally broken when Army scored via their third penalty corner through Mohammad Owais. Navy equalised minutes later from open play, thanks to Samad Habib but their dream for gold was shattered when Owais scored the winner in the dying minutes of the game.
As the Army players chanted, sang and danced, the Navy faces were flat and hanging down with disappointment and sadness.
The announcer was back in action, and the medals were distributed.As the sun set, it left behind stunning hues of blue and orange in the sky.
The turf below, was now empty. But it had witnessed being part of the coming together of 11,000 athletes from all over the country in this city — the hustle of which continued as buses still honked and dust still rose at the Nipa stop.

Wapda’s Hanzala made each lift look effortless as a delighted crowd mostly comprised of team-mates and enthusiasts of the sport looked on at the YMCA Scouts Auditorium.
He lifted 157kg in the snatch and 193kg in the clean and jerk to post a massive 350kg total in the men’s 110kg category.
The 23-year-old is already eyeing next year’s Commonwealth Games, where his older brother Nooh Dastigir Butt clinched the +109kg title in record-breaking fashion at the 2022 edition.
“I take inspiration from him that one day I’ll also win a medal for Pakistan at that stage, and set a new record,” Hanzala told Dawn.
Hanzala’s gold was one of four on the men’s side in addition to one silver and bronze medal each to clinch the trophy.

“Our win makes me really happy,” team coach Ali Aslam said in a moment reminiscent of his days as a weightlifter, his journey cut short by injury after spending nearly two decades in the sport.
“But all our athletes here are fantastic; Army, HEC. It’s a huge deal that they were runner up, it’s been ages since I saw them have such a solid team,” Ali said of the higher education commission, who won two gold, as many silver and one bronze medal.
Coach Ali credits the team’s triumphs to the athletes’ dedication and a 52-day training camp ahead of the Games.
The appreciation was reciprocated by athletes alike, especially three-time national games athlete Nadia Maqsood, whose eight-year-old son looked at her in awe as she spoke to the media about her accolades.
She won gold in the women’s 86kg and clinched the masters weightlifting title and award for best lifter at an international meet.
Olympian Mahoor, on the other hand, was still getting a hang of juggling motherhood and training; being a multiple-time national champion was a piece of cake for her.
“My daughter is only 18 months now,” Mahoor told Dawn after claiming the women’s singles title. “Even at the international level, players take almost two years off as a maternity break. I made my comeback a bit quicker.”
Mahoor, the event’s poster athlete, fought back from a game down to defeat Army’s Alja Tariq and secure her third National Games gold.
The men’s singles final was an all-Wapda, contentious affair. Irfan Saeed staged a remarkable comeback from behind to down M. Ali Larosh 21-12, 21-19, sealing the match with a controversial line call.
“I think I was destined to win today,“ the 33-year-old Irfan told Dawn, who credited a month-long pre-event camp for his victory and now eyes qualification for the LA 2028 Olympics.
However, Army wrested control in the team events.
The duo of Raja Hasnain and Raja Zulqarnain broke Wapda’s streak to win the men’s doubles gold 21-15, 13-21, 21-15.
Army’s dominance continued as Ammarah Ishtiaq and Alja downed Wapda’s pair of Ghazala Siddique and Mahoor 21-12, 21-13 for the women’s doubles gold.
The mixed doubles title was also secured by Army, with Hasnain and Ammarah giving Larosh his third loss of the day.
The Army duo emerged victorious against Pakistan’s no 2 Larosh and Ghazala 21-19, 21-16.
Elsewhere at the games, Army extended their dominance in table tennis, baseball and men’s hockey, while Wapda shone in women’s events.
Army clinched the overall trophy in table tennis after commanding performances in the singles events.
Hoor Fawad outplayed team-mate and national champion Haiqa Hasan 3-0 in the women’s singles final, dropping just 25 points across the match (12-10, 11-8, 11-7).
In the men’s final, Ahmad Sajid edged past Shah Khan 3-2 after a tense, seesaw battle (8-11, 11-8, 9-11, 11-3, 12-10).
Punjab earned their share of glory when Owais and Kulsoom secured the mixed doubles gold with a 3-1 win over Wapda’s Asim Qureshi and Sadia.
Army and Pakistan Navy split honours in the shooting events. Navy’s Aqib Latif topped the podium in the men’s 50m 3P rifle individual event, but Army responded strongly by claiming the team gold through the trio of Mohammad Uzman, Din Muhammad and Sarfraz Gul.
Army continued their surge as Umer Farooq captured the 25m centre fire pistol individual title, though Navy hit back with Maqbool Hussain, Abdul Quddus and Zafar Iqbal taking the team gold in the same discipline.
Army’s Farrukh Nadeem secured the double trap individual crown before pairing with Amir and Junaid to seal the team gold as well.
Army further consolidated their medal haul by defeating Wapda 9-7 in the baseball final at NED University.
In a high-scoring contest, Army held their nerve in the closing stages to complete yet another successful campaign.
Clinching the men’s hockey title widened their tally after a tense 2-1 win over Navy at the KHA Hockey Stadium.
Mohammad Owais scored both goals for Army — first converting a penalty corner in the 45th minute before netting the decisive field goal in the 58th, shortly after Navy had equalised through Essa Khan.
PAF found glory at the KPT Stadium in the football final, with Samad Khan’s goal separating them and Pakistan Army.
The tournament’s top-scorer netted the winner in the second half, getting on the end of a long ball that he let bounce before leaping highest to meet it with a header with the loop taking it over the goalkeeper and the despairing dive of an Army defender.
“I hope my performances here and the National Games gold pave the way for national team reckoning,” he told Dawn after PAF’s 1-0 victory.
As the competitions came to an end, with the closing ceremony on Saturday, Pakistan’s Olympic chief said the National Games were “one of a kind”.
“Nothing is bigger than the National Games for the sporting fraternity of Pakistan,” Pakistan Olympic Association president Arif Saeed told Dawn at the KHA Complex.
“We had 11,000 athletes participating in the games — maybe five athletes of them will go to the Olympics, if God wills then hopefully 10,15. An event of this scale, that brings the whole country together, is one of a kind.”</p><small>2025-12-12 19:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1300002879c14c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960722/mahoor-shahzad-leads-wapda-charge-as-army-snatches-doubles-glory-at-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Mahoor Shahzad leads Wapda charge as Army snatches doubles glory at National Games</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s badminton queen, Mahoor Shahzad, lived up to her star billing with a gritty comeback victory to claim her third National Games gold on Friday, headlining a day of intense finals at the Nazimabad Sports Club, Karachi, that saw Wapda’s dominance challenged and a dramatic men’s singles decided by a contentious call.
The sparse crowd inside the complex was treated to high drama, beginning with the marquee women’s singles where the event’s poster girl, Wapda’s Mahoor, faced a stern test from Army’s left-handed dynamo, Alja Tariq.
Mahoor, initially off-rhythm, trailed 7-3 in the first game before her veteran composure surfaced.
Forcing errors and winning a breathtaking rally to level at 9-9, she edged a tight opener.
The second game was a fiercer battle. Alja, pumped and precise with her drops and smashes, surged to a 9-4 lead and held an 11-8 advantage at the mid-game break.
Facing a possible decider, the champion shifted gears.
She methodically reeled in the deficit, drawing level at 14-14 before racing ahead. From 18-17, she unleashed her signature weapon — a blistering smash deemed unreturnable — to secure match point and sealed the victory in similar fashion, raising a triumphant fist.
The victory, however, prompted the 28-year-old champion to reflect on the broader challenges facing Pakistani badminton.
“She [Alja] played a really good game but thankfully I powered through,” Mahoor told Dawn. “I’m very happy to win my third National Games gold.”
“We lack a bit in skills,” said Mahoor, whose favorite player is former Chinese Taipei star Tai Tzu-ying. “If our training techniques get better and we are given the same tools as international players, we can definitely compete with the best around the globe.”
She identified systemic gaps as the core hurdle.
“The infrastructure of sports is not at the top level in Pakistan. That’s the biggest hurdle,” the Karachi-born player stated. “We have to find courts and coaches on our own. The government should support us and make proper training facilities so we can prepare better.”
Balancing elite sport with motherhood, she added, is its own battle.
“My daughter is only 18 months now. Even at the international level, players take almost two years off as a maternity break. I made my comeback a bit quicker,” said Mahoor, who holds a post-graduate degree in Sports Management.
Her next targets are the South Asian Games and Asian Games, where she hopes to “win a gold medal for Pakistan.”
Offering advice to the next generation, she emphasised resilience and smart training.
“Winning and losing is part of this game and life. The important thing is you should learn from them and come out a better person,” she said. “Young players shouldn’t dwell all their time on the courts but focus on their body. Do more running and fitness, spend some time in the gym.”
The drama had kicked off earlier with an all-Wapda men’s singles final that turned contentious. Irfan Saeed faced M. Ali Larosh in a match where line calls were repeatedly contested.
Irfan took the first game comfortably 21-12, capitalising on Larosh’s unforced errors.
The second game saw a momentum swing as a frustrated Larosh found his range, building an 11-5 lead.
However, Irfan staged a remarkable comeback, clawing back from 18-15 down to level at 19-19.
At match point, he fired a shot towards the corner that Larosh insisted was out, but the line judge awarded the point to Irfan. The controversial call sealed a 21-19 victory for Irfan, who roared in celebration before performing a prostration.
Speaking to Dawn after the win, the 33-year-old champion reflected on the tense battle.
“It was a really good match but I think I was destined to win today,” Irfan said. “When Larosh had the lead in the second set, I thought I would have to play the next game. I don’t know why, but he made a lot of fouls on the short serves. It was to my advantage and gave me a chance for a comeback.”
He credited Wapda’s systematic preparation for his victory.
“Wapda setting up a camp one month prior to the championship gave me time to acclimatise and prepare better. I am practicing here for a month so my court adjustment and settlement was very good. That’s why I performed well,” said Irfan, who had defeated Pakistan’s No. 1 Murad Ali in the semi-final.
Now a three-time National Games champion and an 18th-grade officer with Wapda — a permanent job that allows him to focus wholly on his sport — Irfan has set his sights on a loftier goal.
“I really want to represent the country in the next Olympics,” said the Lahore-born shuttler, who idolises Malaysian great Lee Chong Wei.
However, he acknowledges the hurdle ahead.
“I need to participate more in international events to get a shot at the Olympics. That’s a battle that we have to deal with on our own,” he admitted, “as the federation is low on funds.”
The day’s narrative of Wapda’s ascendancy was disrupted in the men’s doubles final, where the Army duo of Raja Hasnain and Raja Zulqarnain broke through to claim gold.
They faced Wapda’s pair of Larosh — fresh from his singles defeat — and Awais Zahid.
Army claimed the first game, but Wapda fought back to take the second 21-13 and force a decider.
The final game was a tense affair, with Army maintaining a narrow lead throughout. Each of their points was celebrated with a roar, and with the crowd echoing every smash with a collective “ooh,” they closed out the victory.
The defeated Wapda pair threw their rackets skyward in a sportsmanlike acknowledgment before the Army champions raised their hands to a warm ovation.
the Army pair of Ammarah Ishtiaq and Alja continued Army’s charge in the women’s doubles final.
Alja got her lick back in the doubles as Army dominated the decider, defeating Wapda’s duo of Mahoor and Ghazala Siddique 21-12, 21-13.
Army completed a doubles golden treble in the mixed event, with Hasnain and Ammarah Ishtiaq overcoming Larosh and Ghazala 21-19, 21-16.</p><small>2025-12-12 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121644488e3bc04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960705/death-toll-from-river-jhelum-accident-rises-to-6-after-2-more-bodies-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from river Jhelum accident rises to 6 after 2 more bodies recovered</strong></a><br><p>Rescue services recovered two more bodies from the river Jhelum near the Garari Bridge in Rawalpindi on Friday after a hi-ace van plunged into the river a day earlier, taking the death toll from the incident to 6.
District Emergency Officer 1122 Rawalpindi Sighbatullah, however, expressed fear that the death toll may rise to nine as three occupants of the ill-fated vehicle are still missing after two days of search efforts.
On Thursday, a van carrying around 12 passengers was coming from Hajera in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) when it plunged into the river while navigating a turn near Garari Bridge in the Kahuta area of Rawalpindi. Four bodies were recovered in yesterday’s operation, which had to be halted later in the day due to low light conditions.
A day earlier, low-light conditions did not allow divers to search for the missing. Rescue officials had expressed fear that the river’s current may have carried away the missing passengers.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Rawalpindi, Engineer Amir Khattak, had directed all relevant authorities, including health, Rescue 1122, traffic police and tehsil administration to launch a coordinated operation for the rescue of the passengers.
On August 24 last year, a fatal accident at the same Garari bridge claimed 24 lives after a bus plunged into the river, while in another accident over 14 passengers were seriously injured in a bus accident in the area on the Kahuta- Hajera AJK road in October 2024.
Vehicle fitness regime being enforced: RTA official
The victims’ heirs and other local residents raised questions about the fitness of vehicles and the condition of crash barriers along the road facing the Jhelum River.
Zahid Khan, a commuter who regularly uses this road, said that public vehicles being recklessly driven were a common cause of accidents, while Abdul Wahid Khan said that crash barriers were either missing or fragile at dangerous points, raising the risk of vehicles plunging into the river.
Rawalpindi Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Syed Abbas Shirazi told Dawn that, as per records, the fitness certificate of the vehicle was valid up to February 4, 2026, and that the route permit was valid until April 28, 2026.
“The RTA is conducting enforcement operations on a daily basis against unfit vehicles and vehicles plying without valid fitness certificates,” he added.
“During the last two months, 151 vehicles were challaned, 124 vehicles were impounded, and fines amounting to Rs753,000 were imposed,” the secretary claimed. “Such enforcement drives are being continued regularly to ensure compliance with the route fitness regime and improve road safety.”
The RTA secretary added, “Yes, it has been reported that the driver fell asleep.”
Asif Raza, the Executive Engineer at the Punjab Highways Department (Rawalpindi–Kahuta), emphasised to Dawn that crash barriers were present along the road.
When asked about allegations of fragile and substandard barriers, the official said that these were checked during the last two fatal accidents.Raza assured that he would re-examine the condition of the barriers and take action accordingly.
The victims’ heirs and locals urged the Punjab chief minister to take serious notice of the frequent accidents and implement foolproof measures to curb the loss of life.

Five-year tenure
The GB Assembly elections were held on Nov 15, 2020, across 24 constituencies. The PTI formed the government, and Khalid Khurshid was elected chief minister.
However, in July 2023, the GB Chief Court disqualified Khurshid. Subsequently, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI disgruntled group, the PPP, and the PML-Nawaz, which elected Haji Gulbar Khan as the new chief minister of the region.
According to Abbas Ali, deputy director of information for the house, the assembly adopted 63 Acts during its five-year tenure, including one pertaining to land reforms as well as six federal ones.
The GB Assembly passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare Gilgit-Baltistan a provisional province of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-12 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12185220e457d15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960711/travel-discover-the-tranquil-mangrove-forest-of-koh-rong-marine-national-park' target='_blank'><strong>Travel: Discover the tranquil mangrove forest of Koh Rong Marine National Park</strong></a><br><p>Hidden behind the mountainous backdrop of Cambodia’s Koh Rong Island lies a serene mangrove forest within the Koh Rong Marine National Park. Within the forest, an eco-tourism community offers a unique blend of natural beauty and leisure. 
This tranquil retreat, managed by the Prek Kongkang Koh Rong Ecotourism Community, provides visitors with unforgettable experiences while preserving the island’s delicate ecosystem.
Established in April 2021, it spans 40 hectares of lush mangrove forests. 
Founded through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Environmental Conservation Association and the National Council for Sustainable Development, the initiative aims to bolster local livelihoods, generate income and create employment opportunities.
“Our community not only enhances tourism in Koh Rong and Sihanoukville but also plays a vital role in conserving mangrove forests and biodiversity on the island,” explained community chief Sok Sreng.
With nearly 4,000 residents on Koh Rong, the project also strengthens the relationship between conservation and economic sustainability.

For just 40,000 riel (approximately $10), visitors can paddle along a 1,300-metre stretch of the Prek River, where the mangroves meet the turquoise waters of the sea.
This picturesque route offers stunning views of nature’s artistry, culminating in a visit to the luxurious Koh Song Saa Island.
Complementing the mangrove adventures is the Wild Orchid Flower Garden, a vibrant haven of colourful blooms nestled within the forest. 
Visitors can enjoy the harmonious blend of lush greenery and floral beauty, making it a perfect escape for nature enthusiasts.
“The community has steadily grown in popularity, welcoming 70 to 100 visitors on weekdays and even more on weekends and holidays,” Sreng told The Post.

Local food offerings, including freshly prepared islander specialities like papaya salad, crabs and mangrove coffee, provide an authentic taste of Koh Rong. 

Plans are also underway to expand accommodations with eco-friendly guest houses, catering to those who wish to stay longer and immerse themselves in the serene environment.

Once a quiet fishing community, Koh Rong has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, supported by major infrastructure projects.
Nuon Bunthol, governor of Koh Rong City, highlighted how tourism has reshaped the island’s economy. 
“Many villagers now provide tourism-related services, creating sustainable livelihoods while showcasing the island’s beauty to the world,” he said.
The mangrove forest is more than a scenic escape; it is a hub for promoting sustainable tourism.

In December 2024, Mang Sineth, governor of Preah Sihanouk province, along with international and local officials, planted 1,000 mangrove seedlings and released fish and crabs to enrich the ecosystem. 
This commitment to biodiversity underlines the importance of preserving Koh Rong’s natural heritage for future generations.
“We want to develop the area not just as a tourist attraction but as a model for sustainability,” said Sineth. 
Promotional signage and infrastructure improvements, such as roads and electricity grids, have further enhanced Koh Rong’s accessibility and appeal.

The mangrove forest of Koh Rong is not just a testament to the island’s natural charm but also a call to action for investors and developers. 
Long Dimanche, deputy provincial governor, emphasised the need for luxury resorts to elevate Koh Rong’s status on the global tourism map. 
Drawing inspiration from Bali, Indonesia, Dimanche said, “With well-designed resorts and extended stays, we can attract millions of visitors annually”.

As visitors glide through the waterways of the mangrove forest or relax under the shade of its towering trees, they contribute to the vision of a sustainable Koh Rong – where nature and tourism thrive hand in hand. 
Whether it’s kayaking, enjoying local delicacies or exploring vibrant gardens, the mangroves of Koh Rong offer a journey of discovery and tranquillity.
For those seeking an unspoiled corner of Cambodia, the mangrove forest in Koh Rong Marine National Park is a must-visit destination.

Tokenisation is the process of creating a digital version of an asset.
Separately, Pakistan also gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX, a digital-asset platform, to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said.
The ministry said the agreement paved the way to explore a potential collaboration aimed at enabling the tokenisation and blockchain-based distribution of real-world assets, including sovereign bonds, treasury bills, commodity reserves such as oil, gas, metals or other raw materials owned by the government.
“Under the proposed arrangement, Binance and/or its affiliates may provide technical expertise, advisory support, training and capacity building to enable Pakistan to assess modern, compliant blockchain infrastructure,” the ministry said in a press release.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the agreement was a very strong message to both Pakistan and the entire world.
“What we have signed today reflects a long-term partnership. From where we started to moving towards operationalisation, this progress could not have happened without active guidance and leadership,” Aurangzeb was quoted as saying.
“The next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality.”







The move comes as other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, Japan and parts of the European Union, expand formal licensing rules for crypto exchanges amid broader global regulatory tightening.
The ministry also said the initiative could involve assets of up to $2bn, subject to approvals, to improve liquidity, transparency and international market access.
Binance founder Changpeng Zhao said the agreement was “a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan”, saying it marked the beginning of a move toward full deployment of the tokenisation initiative.
“This is the beginning … now we can move towards full deployment and execution. We are honoured to work with Pakistan’s leadership and are confident this collaboration will deliver positive and lasting outcomes for the economy,” he was quoted as saying.
Initial clearances for Binance, HTX
The PVARA said it had issued early approvals to Binance and HTX after reviewing their governance and compliance controls. The clearances allow them to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib said the clearances kick off Pakistan’s phased licensing process and signalled that compliance strength will determine which exchanges move ahead.
Broader digital-asset initiatives
The initiative comes as Pakistan speeds up a major digital-finance overhaul in just a few months, creating the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and establishing the PVARA, while drafting a formal licensing regime.
Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest crypto market by retail activity, Saqib said at Binance Blockchain Week Dubai 2025 earlier this week.
A central bank digital currency pilot and a Virtual Assets Act are also planned for 2025.
The PCC signed a letter of intent with US-based World Liberty Financial to explore stablecoin use, tokenisation and other digital-asset infrastructure, the finance ministry said in April.</p><small>2025-12-12 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121759459726274.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960709/azad-kashmir-gilgit-baltistan-must-receive-funding-under-the-nfc-award-nawaz' target='_blank'><strong>Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan must receive funding under the NFC award: Nawaz</strong></a><br><p>PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday asked his brother, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to give funds to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in accordance with the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
Nawaz’s suggestion on including AJK and GB’s share in the NFC is significant, as smaller provinces have previously rejected this federal plea several times. The proposal was formally initiated when NFC talks started under then-prime minister Imran Khan, while current Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also suggested the same in the past to reduce the financial burden on the Centre.
“Funds should be given to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan under the NFC award. I will speak to PM Shehbaz Sharif in this regard,“ the PML-N supremo said while talking to party leaders in Lahore.
“A certain amount every year must be given to both provinces — Azad Kashmir and GB. This is very important,” he said, adding that these two provinces must have the capacity to spend this money.



He recalled how both provinces could not properly utilise the funding they received from the federal government in the past.
“They need to know how to spend that money. The way I want such funds utilised did not happen,” he stated.
Nawaz also sought applications for elections in both provinces by December 31.
“We decide who will be awarded the tickets on merit in both provinces, as we do in other provinces,” he announced. “We will not tolerate infighting on tickets. Anyone involved in this will be excluded from the process.”
He added that when the PML-N received applications, he would visit both provinces and meet candidates to listen to their perspectives and reach a better understanding in awarding tickets.
The PML-N supremo also praised his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, for her performance as the province’s chief executive. He specifically praised initiatives such as building cancer hospitals, model villages and introducing the metro bus system.
During the NFC meeting last week, the federal government proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than 5 per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting, which also sought legal opinion on whether federal expenditure priorities bind provinces.
Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
However, AJK went through a period of political instability between September and November, with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee’s (JKJAAC) calling a strike over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, including the abolition of 12 seats allocated for refugees in the territory’s legislative assembly.
The strikes turned violent after the administration imposed a communications blackout and rival groups marred the largely peaceful demonstrations with violence, leaving at least 10 dead. Two rounds of talks were held with the federal government — one in September and another in October, where an agreement was reached. The terms included additional funding for the province, a reduction in the cabinet size and a probe into those killed during the protests.
Later, then-prime minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq faced a no-confidence vote in November, with PPP leader Faisal Rathore nominated as his successor. Haq was voted out on November 17, with Rathore being sworn in the next day.</p><small>2025-12-12 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12164644eac738e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960706/senator-alleges-corruption-of-billions-of-rupees-in-attestation-of-documents-at-foreign-office' target='_blank'><strong>Senator alleges ‘corruption of billions of rupees’ in attestation of documents at Foreign Office</strong></a><br><p>After Senator Rana Mahmoodul Hassan alleged on Friday that “corruption of billions of rupees” was being committed daily at the foreign affairs ministry in the attestation of documents, a Senate body decided to raise the matter with the Foreign Office (FO).
Dawn has reached out to the FO for a comment.
The attestation of documents, such as educational and marriage certificates, by the foreign affairs ministry is typically required for recognition by international and foreign entities.
The matter came up during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, where Senator Hassan of the PPP alleged corruption in the process and remarked: “Overseas Pakistanis are either running from post to pillar for a single signature or paying money for corruption.”
He said that people had been complaining about having to spend nights on pavements to get their documents attested.
The attestation process should either be digitised or union councils and deputy commissioners should be authorised to attest documents, he stressed.
Senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar also raised the question of why the process was not being digitised. “Is there a lack of resources?” he said, adding that there should be an app for the FO.
He further stated that the FO should be asked why the issue was not being resolved.
“The higher-up in the Foreign Office does not want to let go of control, and the subordinate is running a shop,” he commented without taking any names and elaborating further. “What is the job of the Foreign Office?” he added.
PML-N Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani claimed during the meeting that a commander of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) had travelled for Haj and Umrah on a Pakistani passport.
At that, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman asked, “Who allowed the TTP to enter [the country]?”
Senator Kakar responded to that, saying, “We, too, were with those who gave the permission.” He also mentioned that when TTP’s Mullah Mansour died, a Pakistani passport was also found in his possession.
As the Senate standing committee expressed reservations over the attestation process, it decided to raise the matter with the FO.
Earlier in the meeting, Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani was elected to chairperson of the standing committee.
The body was previously headed by PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away on November 10.</p><small>2025-12-12 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121528246f199d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960699/rainfall-snow-expected-in-kp-gb-and-balochistan-over-weekend' target='_blank'><strong>Rainfall, snow expected in KP, GB, and Balochistan over weekend</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meterological Department (PMD) on Friday forecasted rain-thunderstorm and snowfall in the western and northern parts of the country over the weekend.
“A shallow western disturbance is likely to approach western parts of the country on 12 December night,” it stated in its latest weather update, posted on X.







Under the influence of the weather system, light to moderate rain-thunderstorm with snowfall over the hills is expected in several areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, including “Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir from December 13th to 15th, with occasional gaps,” the statement said.
“Partly cloudy conditions with light rain/storm is expected in Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Waziristan, Quetta, Ziarat, Zhob, Sherani, Chaman, Pishin, Qilla Abdullah, Qilla Saifullah, and Noshki on December 14th or 15.”
It also forecasted drizzle in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Potohar region and light rain or snow in Murree and Galliyat over the weekend.
Moderate or dense foggy conditions are likely to develop over plain areas of Punjab, KP and upper Sindh from night of December 12th to 16th.
The Met Office predicted that “another western disturbance is likely to influence western and upper parts of the country from December 19th”.
In October a report on Pakistan’s monsoon floods, compiled by the Intersector Coordination Group in collaboration with other partners, stated the country is likely to face one of its coldest winter this year in decades due to the La Nina climate pattern.
A La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cool abnormally, triggering extreme weather shifts worldwide.
This could lead to colder-than-usual winter conditions, further stretching the coping mechanisms of households affected by the floods, particularly in the mountainous regions of KP and GB.</p><small>2025-12-12 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12140349725ecd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960696/bilawal-responds-to-punjab-cm-maryams-warm-welcome-thanks-her-for-positive-gesture' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal responds to Punjab CM Maryam’s ‘warm welcome’, thanks her for ‘positive gesture’</strong></a><br><p>Setting aside their political differences, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz have exchanged greetings on social media platform X, with the former thanking the latter for the “positive gesture”.
On Thursday, Maryam, in a post on X, had extended a “warm welcome” to Bilawal, who is currently visiting the province.
“Punjab is your home, and you will always find a place of respect here,” she said.
“Thank you for your gracious remarks. You have my heartfelt good wishes and prayers,” she added.
Although Maryam did not specifically mention which comments she was referring to, Bilawal, during a media talk in Lahore this week, had said he would be very happy if the Punjab chief minister chose to contest polls from Sindh.







In response, Bilawal on Friday said, “Thank you, madam chief minister for the warm welcome and positive gesture.”







The PPP and PML-N, who are allies in the Centre, engaged in a war of words in September and October. The bad blood had escalated to the point that leaders from both sides were holding daily press conferences to take potshots at the other side until tensions defused.

 

More recently, another instance of a rift between the two parties was witnessed on Wednesday when the PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings after presiding officer for the day, Ali Zahid, ended the session early. The move came as PTI’s Iqbal Afridi pointed out a “lack of quorum” ahead of an agenda item regarding the renaming of Islamabad International Airport.
Meanwhile, Bilawal has had an interesting visit to Punjab thus far. During his visit to Lahore, a woman had interrupted his talk in the city’s Baghbanpura area, shouting from the rooftop of her home, “Don’t talk about politics.”
Bilawal had taken the interruption in stride, smiling up at the woman and breaking into laughter.
“Tell me what I should talk about,” he asked the lady, who then asked about how he was doing.
“I am good, thank you,” he responded.

A statement released by the spokesperson for the regional police officer, Kashif Nawaz, said Fitna al Khawarij terrorists attacked the post late on Thursday night.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement said that police personnel showed courage, bravery and acted in a timely manner, managing to repel the attack.
“As a result of the effective and vigorous retaliatory fire by the police, the terrorists suffered heavy casualties,” the statement said. It said that the exchange of fire continued for three hours, adding that reports suggested that several terrorists had been killed and injured.
It added that armed tribesmen and members of the peace committee backed police personnel in the gunfight with the terrorists.
It added that during this process, five cops sustained “minor injuries” and were taken to the hospital for medical treatment.
The statement said that on the instructions of Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan, additional personnel reached the scene and surrounded the area.
It said that the Bannu DIG and District Police Office (DPO) Yasir Afridi praised the efforts of the police, and the courage and bravery of the people in the area.
The statement went on to say that the Bannu DPO later visited the injured cops at the hospital.
“Bannu police have once again proven that it stands as a strong wall in front of the enemies of peace. The war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The development came as the situation remained tense in the area on Thursday after at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground during a football match.
Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
In October, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12123317ee5a2af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960691/japan-lifts-tsunami-warning-after-67-magnitude-earthquake' target='_blank'><strong>Japan lifts tsunami warning after 6.7-magnitude earthquake</strong></a><br><p>A powerful earthquake struck off the coast of northern Japan on Friday, the weather office said, days after an even larger tremor shook the region and injured at least 50.
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded Friday’s quake to magnitude 6.7 and warned that tsunami waves of up to one metre (three feet) could hit the northern Pacific coastline.
In the end, waves of up to 20 centimetres were recorded on the main northern island of Hokkaido and in the Aomori region, the JMA said, before the tsunami advisory was lifted.
Broadcaster NHK said there was no obvious change at either of the ports where the waves hit.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) also said that the quake measured 6.7 and was 130 kilometres (81 miles) off the city of Kuji in Iwate prefecture on the main island of Honshu.
NHK said that the level of shaking was less than the bigger 7.5 tremor late on Monday, which knocked items off shelves, tore apart roads, smashed windows and triggered tsunami waves of up to 70 centimetres.
In the wake of that quake, an evacuation order was issued on Thursday for residents living near a damaged 70-metre-high steel tower in Aomori, local media said, with authorities citing the risk of collapse.
The Nuclear Regulation Authority said on Friday there were no immediate signs of abnormalities at the region’s nuclear facilities.
Following Monday’s tremor, the JMA published a rare special advisory warning that another quake of similar or greater size was possible for another week.
The advisory covered the Sanriku area on the northeastern tip of Japan’s main island of Honshu and the northern island of Hokkaido, facing the Pacific.
The region is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake in 2011, which triggered a tsunami that killed around 18,500 people.
In August 2024, the JMA issued its first special advisory, for the southern half of Japan’s Pacific coast warning of a possible “megaquake” along the Nankai Trough.
The 800-kilometre undersea trench is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is “subducting” — or slowly slipping — underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
The government has said a quake in the Nankai Trough and subsequent tsunami could kill as many as 298,000 people and cause up to $2 trillion in damages.
The JMA lifted last year’s advisory after a week but it led to panic-buying of staples like rice and prompted holidaymakers to cancel hotel reservations.
Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is one of the world’s most seismically active countries.
The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year.
The vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and depth below the Earth’s surface.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1211363435cb08b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960687/absence-of-political-trust-between-india-and-us-highlighted-at-congress-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Absence of political trust between India and US highlighted at Congress hearing</strong></a><br><p>A US congressional hearing this week noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly described Pakistan as a “key regional partner” even as his administration seeks to further strengthen ties with India.
The hearing — held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia — also exposed sharp disagreements among lawmakers and analysts over the direction of Washington’s India policy. Witnesses warned during the hearing that tariff battles, visa restrictions and political mistrust had pushed the relationship into what several described as a “political standstill”.
Jeff Smith of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, long considered sympathetic to New Delhi, acknowledged that the partnership had entered “choppy waters”, attributing the downturn to Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between India and Pakistan.
The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire.
Smith noted that the Trump administration’s messaging during the ceasefire between India and Pakistan had placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a “difficult position at home”, with critics accusing him of “bending to the will of the US”.
Republican scepticism
Republican scepticism — usually muted when it comes to India — was unusually sharp. Congressman Mike Baumgartner of Washington state questioned whether India was genuinely committed to deepening defence cooperation with the United States. He recounted browsing a book on the Indian Army during a recent visit to India and finding a full-page photograph of Indian troops training with Russians while US-India exercises appeared only as a small boxed image. “The next time I go to India,” he said, “I’d like to see those pages reversed.”
His comments reflected a wider concern in Washington that despite two decades of US outreach, India continues to hedge strategically — maintaining close ties with Russia and participating actively in China-led forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
Committee Chairman Bill Huizenga opened the session by calling India a “defining partner for the 21st century”, praising its expanding naval posture in the Indo-Pacific, its role in the Quad, and cooperation in technology, counter-terrorism and energy. Yet he also acknowledged “understandable concerns” over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to New Delhi and India’s involvement in multilateral platforms shaped by China. Huizenga accused Beijing of pursuing a “string of pearls” strategy to militarise ports across the Indian Ocean.
‘Frozen high-level engagement’
Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove issued the strongest warning, cautioning that Trump risked becoming “the president who lost India” because of escalating disputes over trade and immigration. She revealed that a US-India trade agreement had been on track for signature in July but was abruptly withdrawn by the White House. Instead, India was hit with 50pc tariffs — among the steepest applied to any US partner — and a 25pc tariff on India-linked Russian oil imports.
She criticised the newly announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee, noting that Indians hold nearly 70pc of such visas and form a crucial segment of the US technology and medical workforce. The combined effect of these decisions, she said, had frozen high-level engagement and forced the postponement of the Quad Leaders Summit.
Yet the hearing also underscored a growing divergence between congressional rhetoric and Trump’s own public posture. While several lawmakers focused sharply on allegations of militancy in occupied Kashmir and criticised Pakistan, others noted that Trump had maintained a strikingly different tone throughout the year. He has issued more than 30 public statements praising Pakistan for its cooperation, calling Islamabad a “key regional partner”, and emphasising the need for balanced engagement with both South Asian nuclear powers.
Following the India-Pakistan May conflict, Trump declined to assign blame and instead praised Pakistan’s role in helping defuse tensions.
Analysts at the hearing indirectly acknowledged that such statements had complicated New Delhi’s domestic political narrative.
In multiple statements, Trump has reaffirmed that eight jets were downed during the military escalation. For its part, Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.
Initially, New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Later in October, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class”.
‘Second-most significant challenge’
Dhruva Jaishankar of the Observer Research Foundation America told lawmakers that India viewed recent US engagement with Pakistan’s military leadership as “unsettling”, particularly after India’s air strikes inside Pakistan in May. Repeating India’s longstanding allegation of Pakistani support for terrorism — a claim Pakistan rejects — he warned that unresolved tariffs would increasingly be perceived in India as “acts of political hostility”.
Jaishankar, who is son of the Indian external affairs minister, described Washington’s growing relationship with Pakistan as the “second-most significant challenge” to India-US ties, after trade and tariff disputes. Responding to Trump’s assertion that he personally negotiated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Jaishankar said: “India’s experience is that third-party mediation has often contributed to Pakistan’s adventurism.”
He argued that the United States had long pursued a policy of “de-hyphenation”, engaging both India and Pakistan while avoiding involvement in their disputes, and urged Washington to maintain that approach. He noted that “considerable progress” in the relationship remained possible if disagreements over trade and Pakistan were managed.
At the same time, he acknowledged that defence cooperation continues to expand — including through a new 10-year Defence Framework Agreement, joint production initiatives, the impending launch of the NISAR satellite, and ongoing US support for India’s human spaceflight programme.
Sameer Lalwani of the German Marshall Fund said India remained “poised to become a pole in the international system”, but stressed that New Delhi seeks autonomy, not alignment — a reminder that US expectations often exceed India’s willingness to commit.
Jeff Smith also noted that Washington’s outreach to Pakistan’s military leadership — particularly meetings with Chief of Defence Forces and Cheif of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir — had generated political unease in India, contributing to the perception that the United States was recalibrating its regional priorities.
The overarching message from the hearing was clear: political trust — the element that has long held the US-India partnership together — is now under visible strain. And as Washington reassesses its strategic options in South Asia, Pakistan’s role as a stabilising partner is once again part of the conversation, even if not always acknowledged openly.</p><small>2025-12-12 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12080636ae47f30.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960625/govt-agrees-to-new-imf-targets-after-missing-about-a-dozen' target='_blank'><strong>Govt agrees to new IMF targets after missing about a dozen</strong></a><br><p>• Additional taxes, spending cuts planned to offset revenue shortfalls• Govt commits to raising federal excise duty on fertilisers, pesticides• FED to be introduced on sugary items; goods to be shifted to 18pc GST• Expenditure cuts pledged if National Tariff Policy leads to revenue losses
ISLAMABAD: Having missed a total of 11 performance indicators under its IMF programme, the government has agreed to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
Commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn, reveal fresh documents released by the Fund on Thursday.
The government confirmed at the outset that it estimated a shortfall from the underperformance of the captive power levy of Rs104bn, which it said would be covered by a reduction in power subsidies made possible through lower circular debt accumulation relative to budget estimates.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has already missed its collection target by about Rs430bn in the first five months of FY26.
“Should FBR’s revenues continue to fall short of expectations in the second quarter of FY26 (end of current month), and if other tax revenues are insufficient to bridge the gap, we will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the 8th GST schedule to the general GST regime,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb assured the Fund, implying full 18pc GST on those items.
He further committed that “if by the end of the second quarter of FY26 there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26”.
Pakistan has also sought waivers for already missed targets in terms of performance criteria, str­u­ctural benchmarks and indicators. The documents confirm that publication of a governance and corruption assessment report was set as a “prior action” for the latest $1.2bn disbursement to the State Bank of Pakistan, while an­­other prior action related to recapitalisation measures for a weak bank.
In all, the authorities missed one out of six qualitative performance criteria, five structural benchmarks and four indicative targets — some of which were subsequently met after the original deadlines or extended.
The waivers pertain to non-ob­servance of the end-June quantitative performance criterion (QPC) on Benazir Income Support Prog­r­amme (BISP) spending, and a mo­­dification of three end-December QPCs: the ceiling on the general government primary budget deficit, the floor on the number of new tax returns (to account for seasonality) in line with the agreed FY26 primary surplus, and the BISP floor on targeted cash transfers.
Under the roadmap agreed with the Fund, the FBR will complete all actions required to fully implement at least three priority areas by the end of March 2026, including any necessary subordinate legislation, staff hiring and allocation, and initial KPI reporting.
The government has also committed to publish an initial study by the end of June 2026 assessing the fiscal costs and effectiveness of incentives for all existing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and to phase out all such incentives by 2035.
A Tax Policy Office has been created and will now handle all tax policy functions, including the development and publication of a medium-term tax reform strategy by the end of December 2026. The new strategy is intended to reduce reliance on ad hoc revenue measures and ensure revenue-neutral reforms that deliver sustained growth in tax receipts over the medium term.
Provinces have pledged to realise the full potential of agriculture income tax by fully operationalising information-sharing between the FBR and provincial tax auth­o­rities, and by ensuring that all services — except for a limited list of exemptions — are subject to GST.
The authorities will also conduct a comprehensive study of bottlenecks in the local currency bond market and publish an action plan to address identified weaknesses by the end of September 2026. They have further undertak­­en to strengthen efforts to make formal channels more attractive than the hawala market, without resorting to fiscal incentives. To this end, the SBP plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of remittance costs by the end of May 2026 to improve cross-border payments.
At the same time, the authorities will seek to deepen the foreign exchange market, including through greater reliance on interbank trading and exchange rate flexibility, to support external sustainability.
On the power sector, the government has promised to complete the bidding process for the first round of privatisation of three distribution companies (Dis­c­­os) early in 2026 and to move ahead with the rest.
It has committed to completing the preconditions for the privatisation of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) by the end of December 2026. The authorities also plan to advance the privatisation of public generation companies, finalise transmission network restructuring and launch a wholesale electricity market.
Following amendments to the asset declaration framework, pre­p­­arations are underway to publish, by the end of December 2026, the asset declarations of high-lev­­el federal civil servants on a government website. The framework will also extend to high-level provincial officials and allow banks full access to their declarations.
Based on an institutional-level risk assessment, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) will lead and coordinate action plans to mitigate vulnerabilities in the 10 agencies identified as having the highest risks by the end of October 2026.
Amendments to most of the nine statutory state-owned enterprise (SOE) laws are expected to be submitted to the National Asse­mbly before the end of August 2026. In parallel, the government is moving to amend the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) law by the end of March 2026 to clarify its mandate, ensure transparent and competitive divestment and procurement procedures, introduce fiscal safeguards, and subject SWF-owned SOEs to the SOE law. Operationalisation of the SWF will remain on hold until these amendments are adopted.
