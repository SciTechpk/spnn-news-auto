Officials, citing lab findings, said the boys were lured and kidnapped between 2000 and 2025, and subjected to criminal assault, mostly in the Malir Nadi (riverbed) area.
East Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Investigation Muhammad Usman Sadozai told Dawn that the police had received a laboratory report on “seven or eight cases of sodomy involving boys” that occurred between 2000 and 2025.
The medical reports confirmed that the same person was involved in these cases, as his DNA matched the samples, the SSP said.
“The story of all sodomy cases was the same,” said SSP Sadozai.
He explained that the suspect used to kidnap minors aged between 10 and 14 years from different parts of Karachi between 6pm. and 12am.
The suspect would then take the boy on a motorcycle and subject him to criminal assault in Malir Nadi, before dropping him back at the same location where he was picked up, the SSP elaborated.
“We are all working on this case.”
In a statement issued by his office, Sindh IG Javed Akhtar Odho ordered that the held suspects be interrogated and all perpetrators involved be brought to justice.
Karachi Additional IG Azad Khan, in a statement, termed the protection of children as the top priority and vowed the “strictest punishment under the law for the elements involved in such a heinous act”.
The officer also announced appreciation certificates and a cash reward for the police team that made the arrest.
Registered FIRs
The seven first information reports (FIRs) probed as of yet had been registered at the Sharafi Goth, Zaman Town, Korangi Industrial Area, Mehmoodabad and Defence police stations.
All of them invoked Section 377 (unnatural offences against any man, woman or animal) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and were filed over the past five years, according to an order for the formation of the probe team dated January 6.
One FIR each from the Defence (2025), Korangi Industrial Area (2024) and Zaman Town (2024) police stations only mentioned Section 377, while a 2020 case filed at Sharafi Goth also invoked Section 506-B (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the PPC.
A 2022 FIR registered in Defence was filed under Sections 337-A(i) (punishment of causing injury on head or face), 337-F(i) (punishment of causing skin to rupture and bleed), 337-F(vi) (punishment of fracturing and dislocating a bone), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 377 of the PPC.
Another one filed with the Defence police in 2025 invoked Sections 364 and 377, while an FIR registered last year at Mehmoodabad police station mentioned Sections 377 and 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences) of the PPC.
Investigation team
Meanwhile, Karachi Additional IG Azad Khan set up an investigation team under the supervision of Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Deputy IG Muqaddus Haider for further investigation into the assault cases.
Other members of the probe team include SSP Sadozai, Malir Investigation SSP Asif Raza, Korangi Investigation SSP Qais Khan and South Investigation SSP Syed Ali Hassan.
The probe team was directed to ensure that concrete efforts are made to identify and arrest the suspects involved in the incidents and to complete the investigation in all aspects with convincing evidence.
The team can also co-opt any officer from within the Karachi range to assist in the probe as per the city police order. The team was instructed to submit a progress report on a daily basis.
Child abuse unacceptable: CM Murad
In a statement issued on the matter, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah warned that he would not tolerate any child abuse cases.
Hailing the police efforts in arresting the suspect involved “in the abuse of over 100 children”, CM Murad termed it a “major success”.
“Only seven victims have come forward so far. The police should locate the rest of the victims as well,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The Sindh CM directed the AIG to take the case to court based on evidence and also sought progress reports on a daily basis.
“Abuse against children is unacceptable for the Sindh government,” he stated.
Asserting that the provincial government had taken “many steps” to protect children, CM Murad said there was “no space for any beast in the city”.







In September 2025, a judicial magistrate in Karachi recorded the confessional statement of a suspected serial rapist in six cases pertaining to sexual assaults of underage girls.
The prosecution said the suspect was arrested from Qayyumabad on September 11, when the matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect and took it to a video shop.
The shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
Later the same month, two men in Karachi confessed before magistrates to raping a seven-year-old boy and murdering him.</p><small>2026-01-17 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17102133ca71516.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967477/24-dead-over-20-injured-in-separate-road-accidents-in-punjab-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>24 dead, over 20 injured in separate road accidents in Punjab, Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>At least 24 people were killed and over 20 were injured in two separate accidents on Saturday, as a truck fell into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district and a coach overturned near Balochistan’s Ormara tehsil.
In Sargodha, six children were among 14 dead, while nine others were injured in the early hours of Saturday when a truck carrying cargo and passengers fell into a canal from the Galapur Bangla bridge due to fog, said Rescue 1122.
According to Punjab Rescue 1122 officials, the truck was travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad with 23 people on board for a funeral when the unfortunate incident took place.
“Due to heavy fog, the motorway was closed, so the vehicle took a local route. In the area of Kot Momin tehsil, the truck fell from the Galapur bridge into the canal,” said a statement from Rescue 1122, adding that the truck “lost control because of poor visibility”.
The Rescue 1122 statement added that the canal was dry, but passengers were stuck beneath the truck when it overturned.
The injured were provided first aid on site and were then taken to Civil Hospital Kot Momin, along with the bodies. Three of the injured were later shifted to Kot Momin Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
“The incident was reported at 1:48am on January 17, 2026, after which rescue operations were launched immediately,” said the statement.
Dense fog often paralyses traffic on Punjab’s motorways and major thoroughfares during the winter months.
Earlier today, different sections of motorways, including the M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4 and M-11 were closed due to dense fog, according to the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP).







On Tuesday, 10 people died and 21 were injured in multiple fog-related accidents across Punjab.
Four lost their lives in a collision between a bus, a car and a motorcycle in Toba Tek Singh; three were killed when a car and a truck collided near Bhaban on the Indus Highway; three died in two separate accidents in Okara; and seven were critically injured in a multi-vehicle accident in Gujrat.
In early December, reduced visibility due to fog resulted in the collision of six trailer trucks on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5), leaving seven people injured.
10 dead, over dozen injured in Makran Coastal Highway accident
Separately, 10 people died and over a dozen were injured when a speeding passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway at Hudd Goth near Gwadar’s Ormara tehsil.
In an update, the Edhi rescue service said 10 individuals, including a girl, had died in the accident.
It added that an Edhi mobile morgue had been sent to Ormara to bring the bodies to Karachi.
The coach was heading to Jiwani from Karachi, according to Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police (SP) Aslam Bangulzai. Earlier in the day, the officer had said nine people died and 14 others were wounded in the accident.
He added that the deceased hailed from various parts of Sindh and were going to Jiwani for labour.
SP Bangulzai said the bodies and the injured were initially taken to PNS Darman Jah Hospital in Ormara.



Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
Earlier this month, five passengers lost their lives while 24 others sustained injuries after a bus plunged into a ravine in Punjab’s Talagang district when the driver opted for an alternative route.
On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus carrying players of a university and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road near the Adda Faqeer Di Kulli area.
According to Rescue 1122, the police and the district administration, the accident occurred due to speeding by both vehicles when one was overtaking while the other was crossing a sugarcane-laden tractor trolley.
Following the incident, four officials of the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) were suspended for failing to stop the overspeeding vehicles.</p><small>2026-01-17 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17122900170576e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967481/police-submit-report-on-basant-security-plan-in-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Police submit report on Basant security plan in LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police on Saturday submitted a report in the Lahore High Court (LHC) detailing the security plan for the upcoming three-day Basant festival.
Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, that ended a suspension of the festival after almost two decades.
The report identified areas of concern for the 2026 festival, based on data from the last decade, and urged full implementation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
It stated that registration of every kite and spool of string is mandatory through a QR code and there would be zero tolerance for glass, chemical-coated, or metallic wire.
According to the report, Lahore has been divided into red, yellow, and green zones, while officials will continuously monitor kite-flying activities through drones, social media, and control rooms.
It also warned that strict action will be taken against aerial firing, drinking, and illegal activities on rooftops.
The report stated that it would be mandatory for motorcycle riders to wear a helmet and prohibited their entry into red zones without a safety antenna installed.
On January 6, the LHC sought reports from the Inspector General of Police and the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) regarding security and safety arrangements being taken for the festival.
Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel (JAP) through Advocate Azhar Siddique questioning the alleged failure of the government and the police to make security arrangements for Basant under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171259198d1e77c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967483/nobel-prize-inseparable-from-winner-but-medal-can-be-given-away-award-body-says' target='_blank'><strong>Nobel Prize inseparable from winner but medal can be given away, award body says</strong></a><br><p>The Nobel Peace Prize remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation that won it, though the medal can be given away, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday, a day after last year’s winner gave her medal to US President Donald Trump.
Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her medal on Thursday to Trump, who thanked her for it. The White House released a photo of Trump and Machado, with Trump holding up a gold-coloured frame displaying it, and a White House official said Trump intends to keep it.
Machado’s award also consists of a diploma and 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.19 million).
“Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,” the award body said in a statement.







“There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items,” it added.
‘Inseparably linked’
The medal and the diploma are physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the prize, said the five-strong award committee.
“The prize itself the honour and recognition remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee,” it said.
The committee, which did not refer to Trump and Machado by name in its statement, said it does not comment on a laureate’s statements, decisions or actions after the prize is announced.
It was not the first time a Nobel laureate has given away the medal. In 1943 Nobel literature laureate Knut Hamsun gave his to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
In 2022, Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov sold his medal for $100 million to raise money for the UN children’s fund UNICEF to help Ukrainian refugee children.
In 2024, the widow of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan donated his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma to the UN office in Geneva.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17125156a904b38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967482/un-biodiversity-treaty-enters-into-force-aims-to-protect-30pc-of-oceans-by-2030' target='_blank'><strong>UN biodiversity treaty enters into force, aims to protect 30pc of oceans by 2030</strong></a><br><p>A landmark global treaty to safeguard biodiversity in the high seas came into effect on Saturday, providing countries with a legally binding framework to tackle threats such as overfishing and meet a target to protect 30 per cent of the ocean environment by 2030.
The United Nations treaty, also known as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), was finalised in March 2023 after 15 years of negotiations, and will allow the creation of a global network of “marine protected areas” in vast and previously unregulated ocean ecosystems lying in international waters.
“It’s two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it’s half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime,” said Adam McCarthy, first assistant secretary at the Australian foreign ministry and a co-chair of the treaty’s preparatory committee, speaking at a media briefing.
The treaty reached the threshold of 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, meaning that it would go formally into operation within 120 days. The number of ratifications has since risen to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan adding their names to the list.
Others, including Britain and Australia, are expected to follow soon. The United States signed the treaty during the previous administration but has not yet ratified it.

 

“Whilst we only needed 60 for it to enter into force, obviously it’s really critical for its implementation and for it to be as effective as possible for us to achieve global or universal ratification of the treaty,” said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups.
“We’re really aiming for all UN member states to ratify the treaty.”
Under the treaty, countries must conduct environmental assessments of activities that have an impact on ocean ecology. It will also create mechanisms allowing nations to share the spoils of the “blue economy”, including “marine genetic resources” used in industries such as biotechnology.
Environmentalists say more than 190,000 protected areas would need to be established in order to meet the “30 by 30” target to bring 30pc of the oceans under formal protection by 2030. Currently, only about 8pc — or 29 million square kilometres — is protected.
But the treaty will have little impact on what some conservationists identify as one of the greatest threats facing the marine environment — the clamour to extract mineral resources from the ocean bed.
“BBNJ is very ambitious but there are certain defined limits,” McCarthy said.
“The question of mining in the substrate or in the seabed simply belongs to the ISA (International Seabed Authority). It’s not something where the BBNJ gets a role.”</p><small>2026-01-17 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171150056266a8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967480/dar-expresses-hope-for-peace-stability-in-iran-in-phone-call-with-araghchi-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Dar expresses hope for peace, stability in Iran in phone call with Araghchi: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
According to a post by the FO on X, Dar spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a phone call in which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region.
Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added.







On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country.
Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran.
Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.</p><small>2026-01-17 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17082011ea4305b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967434/number-of-special-economic-zones-surges-to-44-under-cpec-20' target='_blank'><strong>Number of special economic zones surges to 44 under CPEC 2.0</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The number of approved special economic zones has surged dramatically from seven to 44 in the second phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), including notification of 37 new SEZs through coordinated efforts led by the Board of Investment (BoI).
The increase in approval rate was revealed on Friday during a briefing on Pakistan’s engagement with China under the second phase of CPEC, with particular focus on SEZ-led industrialisation and Pakistan-China business-to-business (B2B) cooperation, which form the backbone of the upgraded CPEC framework.
The BoI serves as the lead Pakistani agency for the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Industrial Cooperation, with China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) as the counterpart lead agency. Since its inception, Project Management Unit of the CPEC-Industrial Cooperation Development Project (PMU CPEC-ICDP) has played a pivotal role in revitalising Pakistan’s SEZ framework.
Minister for Board of Investment, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, visited to the Project Management Unit of the CPEC Industrial Cooperation Development Project (PMU CPEC-ICDP) at the Board of Investment, Islamabad, to review progress on industrial cooperation and the development of SEZs under CPEC Phase-II.
Key achievements highlighted during the briefing included progress on the Karachi Industrial Park (KIP), development initiatives for the Gilgit-Baltistan SEZ, and the approval of the Land Lease Policy for Bin Qasim Industrial Park (BQIP), which has addressed a longstanding structural bottleneck for investors.
The minister was also informed of BoI’s facilitation in ensuring the provision of utilities to SEZs, enabling their transition from planning stages to operational readiness.
It was explained during the briefing that the long-term plan for CPEC Industrial Cooperation has been finalised and it is being implemented through a structured Action Plan aligned with the transition towards CPEC, dubbed ‘CPEC Phase 2.0’, emphasising industry-led growth, export-oriented manufacturing, technology transfer, and value addition, with SEZs serving as anchor platforms.
The alignment of CPEC Industrial Cooperation with the government’s “Uraan Pakistan” 5Es Framework was also highlighted, particularly in advancing exports, enhancing competitiveness, and promoting sustainable economic development through joint-venture-based industrialisation.
Mr Sheikh was further informed that 2026 will mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, and that PMU CPEC-ICDP has planned a series of commemorative and investment-focused initiatives during the year to further deepen bilateral industrial cooperation.
The BOI reaffirmed its strong commitment to proactive investor facilitation, policy coordination, and effective implementation of the second phase of CPEC industrial cooperation initiatives, and it will continue to work closely with all federal and provincial stakeholders to ensure a predictable, transparent, and investor-friendly environment for domestic and foreign investors.
The briefing underscored BOI’s structured approach to investment promotion and investor outreach, particularly with Chinese enterprises.

In a social media post, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said that the high-profile ‘Board of Peace’ unveiled on Friday was a move “from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”.







Witkoff said the initiative marks a decisive move toward stabilising the war-ravaged territory, declaring: “Today, on behalf of President Trump, we are announcing the launch of Phase Two… moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction.”
He said the plan will establish “a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza,” and begin “the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel.”
Warning Hamas of consequences for non-compliance, Witkoff added: “The United States expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage… Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.”
Witkoff said the initial stage had produced significant results, noting that “Phase One delivered historic humanitarian aid, maintained the ceasefire, returned all living hostages and the remains of twenty-seven of the twenty-eight deceased hostages.”
He also expressed gratitude to regional mediators, saying Egypt, Turkey and Qatar played “indispensable” roles in advancing the agreement.
‘Board of Peace’ unveiled
Earlier Friday, the White House said it has formed an executive panel tasked with implementing the plan, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff, Jared Kushner, World Bank President Ajay Banga and former British prime minister Tony Blair, among others.
The panel will supervise portfolios ranging from governance and regional diplomacy to reconstruction financing and investment mobilisation.
According to the White House statement, the broader ‘Board of Peace’ will provide strategic oversight, coordinate international resources, and ensure accountability during Gaza’s transition from conflict to development.
The US also plans to deploy an international stabilisation force and appoint a high representative to coordinate governance, security and reconstruction efforts in Gaza under the transitional framework.
The announcement comes amid continuing tensions on the ground, with Hamas still refusing to disarm and yet to return the remains of the final hostage — a key requirement of the first phase.
Although the ceasefire achieved in October has reduced large-scale hostilities, it has been punctuated by sporadic clashes and airstrikes, leaving the outlook for lasting peace uncertain.
President Trump described the newly formed board as “the greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled,” according to a social media post announcing the initiative.
Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.</p><small>2026-01-17 06:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17083136c58af00.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967425/arrest-detention-of-afghans-increased-18pc-in-jan-un-iom' target='_blank'><strong>Arrest, detention of Afghans increased 18pc in Jan: UN-IOM</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The arrest and detention of Afghan nationals have increased by 18 per cent so far in January as compared to the previous week. The top three districts for arrest and detention between Jan 1 and 10 were Chaghi, Pishin and Islamabad Capital Territory.
The latest ‘Flash Update’ jointly released by UN refugee agency, UNHCR, and UN Migration office, IOM, says from January 4 to 10, 73 per cent of the total reported arrests and detentions took place in Balochistan and 16 per cent in Islamabad Capital Territory.
Of all arrests and detentions of Afghan nationals during the period, Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders and undocumented Afghans represented 87 per cent of the total arrest and detentions while Proof of Reg­istration (PoR) card holders represented 13 per cent.
The data released by UNHCR and IOM shows that a total of 130,999 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained from September 15 to January 10, 2026. Most arrests took place in Balochistan with 68 per cent arrests, followed by Islamabad (19pc), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (6pc), Punjab (4 per cent) and Sindh (3 per cent). Data on the number of arrests by provinces shows the highest number of arrests were made in Balochistan (1489) followed by Islamabad (423), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (127), Punjab (86), and Sindh (75).

Report says 130,999 Afghans arrested, detained from Sept 15 to Jan 10

In 2025, the government issued several directives impacting Afghan nationals, and in January 2025, it announced that Afghan nationals should relocate from Islamabad Capital Territory and Rawalpindi, or face deportation.
In April, further announcements indicated the implementation of the second phase of the “Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan”, targeting ACC holders, in addition to undocumented Afghans.
In July, the government issued a Statutory Regulation Order (SRO) directing the repatriation/deportation of PoR card holders following the expiry of PoR card validity on June 30.
The government later issued a deadline of September 1 for PoR holders to leave Pakistan, before the start of the repatriation and deportation process.
A report of IOM on ‘Returnee Inflow from Pakistan’ says returnee inflows decreased from Pakistan by 17pc from December 21 to January 3, averaging 2683 individuals per day.
Despite the overall decrease in returnees from Pakistan, Afghans’ return through the Torkham border crossing point increased by 8pc compared to the last reporting period.

 

A situation analysis by International Federation of Red Crescent (IFRC) says since the beginning of 2025 until the end of November, Afghanistan has witnessed the return of over 5.2 million refugees (deportees and returnees) from Iran and Pakistan, an unprecedented movement, that has further strained a country already grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis.
More than 3.6 million Afghans have returned from Iran alone, of which 1.2 million were deported. The bulk of returns began after April 1, highlighting the intensity of recent developments in both host countries.
According to Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) data, the highest daily influx was recorded in November 2025. Most Afghan returnees cross through the official crossing points of Torkham (Nangarhar) and Spin Boldak (Kandahar), with smaller flows obse­rved at Angur Ada (Paktika) and via unofficial routes in Helmand.

Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s late shah, however, said he was confident the Islamic republic would fall and called for intervention, though the threat of new military action by the United States against Iran has appeared to have receded for the time being.
In posts to social media on Friday, Pahlavi announced a fresh coordinated demonstration, calling for Iranians to “raise your voices in anger and protest with our national slogans” on the weekend.
Protests sparked by economic grievances started with a shutdown in the Tehran bazaar on December 28 but turned into a mass movement demanding the removal of the clerical system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution.
People started pouring into the streets in big cities from January 8 but authorities immediately enforced a shutdown of the internet that has lasted over a week and activists say is aimed at masking the scale of the crackdown.
The “brutal” repression has “likely suppressed the protest movement for now”, said the US-based Institute for the Study of War, which has monitored the protest activity.
But it added: “The regime’s widespread mobilisation of security forces is unsustainable, however, which makes it possible that protests could resume.”
Pahlavi also told a news conference in Washington on Friday that “The Islamic republic will fall – not if, but when.” “I will return to Iran,” he said.
‘Give Iran a chance’
Monitor Netblocks said that the “total internet blackout” in Iran had now lasted over 180 hours, longer than a similar measure that was imposed during 2019 protests.







Amnesty International said this was being backed up by the use of heavily armed patrols and checkpoints to crush “the nationwide popular uprising in Iran” with security forces visible in the streets.
Trump, who backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, had not ruled out new military action against Tehran and made clear he was keeping a close eye on if any protesters were executed.
But a senior Saudi official told AFP on Thursday that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman led “a long, frantic, diplomatic last-minute effort to convince President Trump to give Iran a chance to show good intention”.
While Washington appeared to have stepped back, the White House said Thursday that “all options remain on the table for the president”.







Attention had focused on the fate of Erfan Soltani, a 26-year-old protestor who rights activists and Washington said was set to be executed as early as Wednesday.
The Iranian judiciary confirmed Soltani was under arrest but said he had not been sentenced to death and his charges meant he did not risk capital punishment.Rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been arrested.
Security officials cited by the Tasnim news agency on Friday said around 3,000 people were arrested.
‘All Iranians united’
The US Treasury on Thursday announced new sanctions targeting Iranian officials including Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme Council for National Security.
Russian President Vladimir Putin meanwhile held telephone talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in what the Kremlin described as “efforts to facilitate de-escalation”.
Despite the internet shutdown, new videos from the height of the protests, with locations verified by AFP, showed bodies lined up in the Kahrizak morgue south of Tehran, as distraught relatives searched for loved ones.
At the UN Security Council in New York, Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, invited to address the body by Washington, said “all Iranians are united” against the clerical system in Iran.
Iran’s representative at the meeting, Gholamhossein Darzi, accused Washington of “exploitation of peaceful protests for geopolitical purposes. “</p><small>2026-01-17 05:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1704033734a074b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967404/white-america' target='_blank'><strong>White America</strong></a><br><p>A CENTRAL tenet of President Donald Trump’s administration is to transform the US into a white Christian nation. Towards this end, fully armed Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are harassing everyone who is not white. Refusing to adhere to any constitutional constraints, they are dragging out black and brown children from high schools, employees from stores and travellers from airports and taking them to detention centres even if they are US citizens. In Minneapolis, where a white woman Renee Good was killed as a result of this frenzy, ICE agents were going into Somali-American neighbourhoods and pulling out entire families for detention.
It is no surprise then that this week, the State Department tweeted that it would “pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates. The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people”. Following this, the list of countries was released, with the implicit allegation that those applying for immigration from these states were dependent on public benefits after arriving in the US, i.e., they were using Medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance and other programmes designed for indigent Americans. No statistical evidence was provided to substantiate the claim that immigrants from these countries were more likely than others to use public benefits.
In fact, the administration doesn’t have to provide proof. The first Trump administration (2017-2021) weaponised the ‘public charge’ rule to scrutinise the likelihood of arriving immigrants using public benefits, making it hard for applicants to obtain Green Cards — in line with the Trumpian stance that immigrants were a general scourge. However, the following Biden administration restored the rule to what it had been before 2016.
Last November, the administration again proposed a new draft of the rule which states: “The 2022 regulations are not the best implementation of the statute, inconsistent with congressional intent, unduly restrictive, and hamper DHS’s [Department of Homeland Security] ability to make accurate, precise and reliable determinations of whether certain aliens are likely at any time to become a public charge”. Rescinding the rule would give immigration officers a freer hand to decide on immigrants’ use of public benefits in line with the government’s position that these should not encourage immigration.

The agony over visas does not matter to Trump’s administration.

The State Department is tasked with enforcing this new understanding of the public charge rule and the 75 countries now face an indefinite pause in the processing of applications. Given that the Trump project is so inherently tied up with Christian nationalism and white supremacy, this shouldn’t be a surprise. In effect, it’s a moratorium on brown and black people immigrating because of family ties. Even spousal visas, which have historically been exceptions, are included in the pause.
Those applying for non-immigrant visas are exempt, which means that people applying for B tourist visas, F student visas, J exchange visitor visas and H and L employment-based visas will have their applications processed and visas issued. However, these categories are subject to other hindrances (such as the high fee for H-1B visas). A number of countries are also subject to a travel ban, which means their citizens cannot obtain a US visa un­­der any circumstances.

 

Undoub­te­d­­ly, this pause is going to pro­ve a significa­­nt obstacle to those who have been seeking US immigrant visas. Those who have rec­ently married a US citizen and are waiting for their visas to be processed, or parents who are awaiting Green Cards, face uncertainty. With many cases filed, people are left in limbo.
None of this international agony matters to the Trump administration. If anything, the stricter the rules it imposes on non-white immigrants, the happier it imagines its white supremacist MAGA base will be. Trump’s inability to revive the economy or create jobs, both of which were core promises of his poll campaign, mean that he has to take harsh actions involving immigrants in the hope that it will satisfy his increasingly annoyed voter base. And, midterm elections are coming up this year, with early indications that a strong anti-Trump sentiment will cause the Republican to lose the House and Senate and end the carte blanche that Trump now enjoys. Until then, any brown or black person wanting to come to America is likely to face extreme challenges.

In fact, the Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act bill has also been tabled. Nato members are struggling to find the right words to respond to the US and to President Trump who seems not to care even if Nato members ask him to remove bases and nuclear warheads from their territories. The intervention spree is spreading well beyond the Monroe Doctrine, although this doctrine should have been discarded after the 1945 UN Charter as it was contradicting politically what was being committed legally.
The direction where US policies were heading was correctly read by Russia and China a decade ago well before Trump’s first tenure when in a surprise move both the states in 2016 came out with a Joint Declaration on International Law against unilateralism.
More recently, the biggest operational signalling was made when the US Department of Defence was renamed the Department of War through Executive Order 14347. Anyone with an interest in international law would have rightly conjectured that the Trump administration’s legal team was preparing internally and externally for something unusual. The UN Charter had established a new norm against war, declaring it illegal, and replacing the word with the legal term ‘use of force’, which, too, is allowed only in self-defence. Thus the erstwhile Department of War became the Department of Defence in 1947 to comply with the Charter’s prohibition, also indicating that from then on, force would only be used in defence — even if anticipatory defence.
Thus the Trump administration’s decision to rename it last year was deliberate — a warning of sorts about what was to come in the days ahead — in open defiance of the Charter’s prohibition of acts of aggression or attempts to occupy a foreign land through a declared war. That has regrettably happened in the case of Venezuela, and is happening in the case of Greenland. It is likely to happen in Iran, and Canada has been threatened as well. Hence Greenlanders, Danes, Europeans and the rest of the leaders are at a loss and trying to figure out how they should respond to a violation of a norm that each of the 195 world states willingly and voluntarily agreed to, implemented, acted upon, relied upon and fully believed in for over seven decades. It had been so fundamental and central to global peace and security that no state dare construe it otherwise.
As if this weren’t enough, President Trump’s memorandum dated Jan 7, 2026, directs the executive branch to start taking steps to withdraw from 66 international bodies. Global governance institutions are not passive or symbolic arenas; they are places where deliberations take place, where norms are shaped, which are gradually transformed into binding frameworks. When the US withdraws, it does not remove itself from the effects of global rules; instead, it removes itself from the leadership of the process by which those rules are written and interpreted. The most immediate consequence of the US withdrawal is the creation of a strategic vacuum. China, Russia and other important developing countries have shown a sustained preference for remaining inside multilateral institutions.

When the US exits, it allows alternative visions of the global order to gain legitimacy.

From the perspective of US competitors then, the American withdrawal is not a setback but an opportunity. When the US exits, it effectively hands over agenda-setting power, reduces contestation, and allows alternative visions of the international order to gain legitimacy. Here, it opens up no less a serious opportunity for coordinated developing countries’ blocs, such as the G77 or the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, that can increase their influence when a major agenda-setter withdraws. These legal platforms offer opportunities to developing countries to come together and steer these bodies perhaps even better.
Those who keep a track of international politics and law recall how despite US reservations, developing countries negotiated the well-known 1982 Law of the Sea Convention that regulated the traditional freedom of the high seas. Mining control over minerals, platinum, rare earths, and other material in the deep seabed, despite objections from the US, was conferred on the International Seabed Authority by the developing countries.

 

Another example where developing states found their way was the establishment of the International Criminal Court through the Rome Statute. It is still openly opposed by the US. Yet it is established, has handed down 11 convictions after lengthy trials, issued around 60 arrest warrants, and there are 12 investigations ongoing. Apart from that, there are numerous examples of how several international treaties and frameworks have been finalised and continue to function despite reservations from the US.
The long-term costs of withdrawal from international bodies are cumulative and may be invisible in the short term to the Trump administration. By withdrawing, the US does not shield itself from these developments; it merely loses the ability to shape them at an early stage. Historically, American influence has rested not only on material power but also on its capacity to convene allies, bridge divides between developed and developing states, and steer multilateral outcomes. Re-entry, when it occurs, rarely restores previous influence automatically; it often requires concessions and a rebuilding of credibility.
Speaking to the BBC last week, I had stated that the norm of non-intervention is actually being solidified even more despite its breach by the Trump administration at present. Notice how the entire world, all regions, all states representing diverse civilisations have stood up in protest. The norm against war, against non-intervention is not merely a law laid down in 1945; it represents a multi-civilisational maturity achieved after thousands of years of bloodshed and infighting for territorial gains. It’s not regional hegemony at stake only but a civilisational loss that every state raising voice against the Trump administration’s actions is trying to prevent.

On Friday, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq formally declared veteran politician Mehmood Khan Achakzai as Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly. Regardless of how long the appointment was delayed by that point, it reflects positively on both the government and the opposition that it was finally done.
Just about a month and a half ago, Mr Sadiq had curtly interrupted PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan when the latter referred to Mr Achakzai as “the opposition leader” during a heated debate in the House over remarks made by Mr Achakzai that Mr Sadiq had taken umbrage to. “I do not recognise him in that capacity,”
Mr Sadiq was reported to have shot back, reminding the House that though Mr Achakzai may be the opposition’s joint nominee, he still needed the Speaker’s blessing to be recognised as such. Clearly, much has changed since then. And, it seems, for the better.
Mr Achakzai, chief of the ambitiously named Tehreek Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan and the PkMAP political party, is an old hand in Pakistani politics. He has a long and storied history of uniting pro-democracy forces, and was previously allied with both Nawaz Sharif and the late Benazir Bhutto in their respective struggles for democracy in Pakistan. It was, no doubt, quite a surprise when jailed former prime minister Imran Khan ‘nominated’ him as opposition leader on behalf of his party.

 

The PTI often comes across as a party that regards no one as even equal to, let alone better than, its own leaders. That Mr Khan still chose to place and reiterate, on multiple occasions, his trust in Mr Achakzai is a testament to a view of Mr Achakzai’s politics as unimpeachable. It also reflects an admission that none of Mr Khan’s lieutenants were considered capable of the kind of principled oppositional politics Mr Achakzai is known for.
Regardless, this is a positive development in Pakistani politics, and it is hoped that wisdom will continue to prevail. Mr Achakzai is known for taking a more traditional approach to politics. He understands the need for negotiations, as reflected in recent moves by the TTAP to restart dialogue between the government and the opposition.
Of late, he has been vocal in defending the Constitution, demanding the release of political prisoners and criticising undemocratic practices. His political oeuvre indicates that his politics are consistent and non-opportunistic. He has hardly been known to compromise on his core principles even under pressure.
It is a relief that the mantle has passed to a leader of his calibre. It is hoped that he can break the political deadlock. Respected on both sides of the aisle, he may be one of the few who can still make it happen.

According to a statement issued by the US Central Command (Centcom), American and Pakistani troops this week concluded joint training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center in Pabbi.
“This week, US and Pakistan Army Soldiers completed training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center during Exercise Inspired Gambit, which focused on combined infantry skills and tactics, and counterterrorism operations. Training exercises like this between the US and Pakistan strengthen our long-standing defense ties,” the statement said.







The exercise comes amid broader signs of re-engagement between the two defence establishments. In December, the United States approved the sale of advanced technology and upgrade packages for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter aircraft, a deal valued at approximately $686 million. The approval followed regional tensions after Pakistan and India fought a brief but intense five-day conflict in May 2025.
Pakistan is believed to operate 70 to 80 F-16s, including upgraded Block-15 aircraft, former Jordanian jets, and newer Block-52+ models. US officials have long described the F-16 programme as a cornerstone of bilateral military cooperation.
Political signaling from Washington has also drawn attention. President Trump has repeatedly praised Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, referring to him publicly as his “favourite field marshal”.
In a year-end news briefing on December 31, Trump said that Pakistani leaders had credited him with preventing a wider catastrophe following the India-Pakistan conflict.
“The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more,” Trump said.
During the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit on the Middle East in October 2025. Trump also acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was standing behind him, before again referring to Munir.
These remarks marked at least the tenth instance since June that Trump, who returned to the White House in January for a second term, publicly praised Pakistan’s army chief.
In June 2025, Trump hosted Field Marshal Munir at the White House for a lunch meeting — the first time a sitting US president formally received the head of Pakistan’s army. The meeting took place amid worsening disagreement with India over Trump’s repeated claim that he personally halted the May conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Analysts say Washington’s renewed focus on the Middle East, particularly Gaza and Iran, combined with the performance of Pakistan’s air force during the May conflict with India, encouraged the United States to improve its ties with Pakistan’s defence establishment.
Pakistan has also signalled its willingness to participate in a US-led international stabilisation force for Gaza, a controversial proposal advanced by Trump, further underlining Islamabad’s interest in closer security cooperation.
Pakistan was once a key US ally and was designated a major non-NATO ally following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Relations frayed in subsequent years, as US officials accused Islamabad of duplicity during the US-led war on terror.
But early in his second term, Trump struck a markedly different tone. Addressing a joint session of Congress in March, he publicly thanked Pakistan for arresting one of the alleged perpetrators of the Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport in August 2021, which killed 13 US service members.
Recent military exercises, arms sales and high-level engagement suggest that defence ties between Washington and Islamabad are entering a new, more pragmatic phase.</p><small>2026-01-17 03:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17081506e294c2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967432/imaan-hadi-challenge-arrest-orders-after-judge-demands-their-production' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan, Hadi challenge arrest orders after judge demands their production</strong></a><br><p>• Petition argues trial court unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued warrants without meeting mandatory legal requirements• Additional district & sessions judge orders FIA, police officials to arrest them ‘within 24 hours’
ISLAMABAD: Lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, on Friday challenged their arrest orders in a case linked to controversial social media posts.
In a petition filed before the Islamabad High Court, they argued that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production.
The petition challenged the trial court’s January 15 order as legally unsustainable and requested the IHC to declare the arrest warrants null and void and restrain the authorities from arresting the petitioners.
Earlier in the day, a district and sessions court once again ordered their arrest within 24 hours in the same case.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, who was hearing the matter, warned of contempt proceedings in case of non-compliance.
The court also expressed strong displeasure over the failure of the police and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to execute earlier arrest warrants.
During the hearing, an NCCIA prosecutor appeared before the court. Judge Majoka repeatedly questioned the authorities over the non-appearance of the accused, asking why Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha had not been arrested and produced before the court. “Where are the accused and why were they not produced?” the judge remarked, summoning the DIG Islamabad Police and FIA officials to explain the delay.
The public prosecutor submitted replies under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code on behalf of the accused during the proceedings.
After a brief recess, DIG Islamabad Police Jawad Tariq appeared before the court. Expressing anger, Judge Majoka questioned the credibility of law enforcement agencies, stating that the non-execution of warrants in Islamabad raised serious concerns. He directed the DIG to arrest the accused “from anywhere — whether in Pakistan, India or Afghanistan,” adding that they could be “at sea or in the air” but must be apprehended within 24 hours.
The DIG assured the court that the war­­rants would be executed. The judge stated that the warrants would be handed over by 10am and warned that failure to comply would result in contempt of court proceedings.
Later, the NCCIA director also appeared before the court and informed it that a four-member team had been formed to arrest the accused, but they were not found at their stated addresses and were allegedly deliberately hiding. Judge Majoka questioned how arrests could not be made in Islamabad if the accused were present in the city and ordered that a senior officer ensure execution of the warrants.
The court directed that no police officer below the rank of SP and no NCCIA official below the rank of deputy director be assigned the task. Fresh arrest warrants were issued, with orders to arrest the accused and produce them before the court via video link. The hearing was adjourned till Saturday (today).
In a written order issued later, the court observed that the accused had deliberately absconded to evade arrest and granted law enforcement authorities 24 hours to comply with its directions.

MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday moved to mediate the escalating crisis involving Iran on Friday, holding separate telephone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in an effort to “quickly de-escalate tensions”.
The Kremlin stated that Putin during both phone calls expressed Moscow’s willingness to “continue its mediation efforts and to promote constructive dialogue with the participation of all interested states”.
Pezeshkian briefed Putin on Tehran’s efforts to stabilise the situation, blaming the US and Israel for fomenting unrest.
The two men confirmed their commitment to a 20-year strategic partnership agreement signed last year, which includes joint economic projects, it added.
Meanwhile, fears of an immediate US attack have retreated slightly since President Donald Trump noted killings were easing, however, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted the president was keeping “all of his options on the table”.
The US has redirected an aircraft carrier and its strike group toward Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln is carrying fighter jets, guided missile destroyers and at least one attack submarine. The Israeli spy chief was also expected to meet White House envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday.
On the ground in Iran, a deadly state crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests for now. While state media reported more arrests on Friday, residents in Tehran noted the capital had been quiet since Sunday.
Munich conference scraps invite
Amid the crackdown, the Munich Security Conference withdrew its invitation to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi for its upcoming forum.
“In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations,” organisers said in a statement. Diplomatic reactions varied globally. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) condemned external interference and blamed Western economic pressure for the instability.
On the other hand, Pakistan urged the UN Security Council to uphold international law regarding non-interference. Ambassador Asim Ahmad, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, warned that unilateral actions would only deepen the crisis. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure,” Ahmad said, calling Iran a “brotherly country” and urging all parties to resolve differences through peaceful means.
Starlink behind the scenes
Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service has emerged as a primary tool for Iranian dissidents to bypass state-imposed internet blackouts following a violent crackdown on protests, according to activists and researchers.
The network, which uses thousands of low-orbit satellites to beam internet to terminals the size of a pizza box, has become a crucial lifeline for demonstrators.
Digital rights groups estimate 50,000 terminals have been smuggled into Iran, defying a law that bans the unlicensed technology. As Iran attributes the country’s tensions to foreign involvement, the extensive scale of this Starlink network implies that it may be receiving sophisticated external support.
Given the difficulty of transporting large quantities of restricted hardware across Iran’s tightly controlled borders, the logistics mirror the capabilities of foreign intelligence services; however, no official link has been con­fi­rmed.

Canadian PM Mark Carney shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the People’s Great Hall in Beijing.—Reuters

BEIJING: Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a raft of measures from trade to tourism on Friday at the first meeting between the countries’ leaders in Beijing in eight years.
The Canadian premier hailed a “landmark deal” under a “new strategic partnership” with China, turning the page on years of diplomatic spats, retaliatory arrests of each other’s citizens and tariff disputes.
Carney has sought to reduce his country’s reliance on the United States, its key economic partner and traditional ally, as President Donald Trump has aggressively raised tariffs on Canadian products.
“Canada and China have reached a preliminary but landmark trade agreement to remove trade barriers and reduce tariffs,” Carney told a news conference after meeting with Xi.
Under the deal, China — which used to be Canada’s largest market for canola seed — is expected to reduce tariffs on canola products by March 1 to around 15 per cent, down from the current 84pc.
China will also allow Canadian visitors to enter the country visa-free.
In turn, Canada will import 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) under new, preferential tariffs of 6.1pc.
“This is a return to the levels that existed prior to recent trade frictions,” Carney said of the EV deal.
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government’s decision to allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a low tariff rate is “problematic” and said Canada may come to regret the decision. “I think it’s problematic for Canada,” Greer told CNBC on Thursday.
Welcoming Carney in the Great Hall of the People, Xi said China-Canada relations reached a turning point at their last meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in October. “It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,” Xi told the Canadian leader.
“The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations serves the common interests of our two countries,” he said, adding he was “glad” to see discussions over the last few months to restore cooperation.
Ties between the two nations withered in 2018 over Canada’s arrest of the daughter of Huawei’s founder on a US warrant, and China’s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.
The two countries imposed tariffs on each other’s exports in the years that ensued, with China also accused of interfering in Canada’s elections.
But Carney has sought a pivot, and Beijing has also said it is willing to get relations back on “the right track”.
Canada, traditionally a staunch US ally, has been hit especially hard by Trump’s steep tariffs on steel, aluminium, vehicles and lumber.
Washington’s moves have prompted Canada to seek business elsewhere.

ISLAMABAD: Senators on Fri­day called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under 18, with the chair proposing a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries.
The issue was raised through a calling-attention notice moved by Senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan.
Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee comprising representatives of the ministries of information technology, interior, education and law, along with parliamentary parties and provincial governments. She said the final decision would rest with Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani.
Speaking on the notice, Senator Naz said most platforms were designed for adults and warned that children’s exposure to inappropriate content could make them vulnerable to online harassment, exploitation and dangerous trends.
She referred to last year’s killing of Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old TikToker, and said such incidents underscored the risks of unmonitored social media use for minors.
She called for a comprehensive legal framework and urged the government to introduce mandatory age verification, parental supervision and other protective measures.
She also demanded restrictions on the use of TikTok, Instagram, VPNs and similar tools by children below 18. “The matter is serious in nature and immediate and serious steps should be taken to prevent children from further dangers of social media,” she said, seeking a briefing from the IT ministry on existing laws and a future action plan.
Senator Fawzia Arshad said social media had become a serious concern for parents and required a collective response. She stressed the need for counselling in educational institutions to guide children and discourage harmful online behaviour.
“The age between 16 and 18 is very vulnerable and fragile,” she said, adding that the problem could worsen without proper guidance. She also said civics and moral development were insufficiently covered in the curriculum.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry described the matter as a national issue and said it should be referred to the relevant standing committee.
He said the issue was not limited to the IT ministry and involved the ministries of education and interior as well. He called for coordination among stakeholders to propose curriculum changes and appropriate restrictions for underage users in line with international practices. “This is not a challenge for Pakistan but an international issue,” he said.
The minister said law enforcement and cybercrime institutions, including the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should be engaged in efforts to address the issue.
“There is a need for a national debate to find a solution to save the underage children from the dangers (of social media),” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman noted that Australia had introduced legislation to restrict social media use for children under 16, but said she was not in favour of blanket bans. Describing social media as an educational tool as well, she said the Senate should consider all aspects and proceed “judiciously”.
PTI protest
Separately, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers criticised what they described as a continued ban on meetings with the party’s founder Imran Khan, alleging violations of court orders.
Speaking on a point of order, PTI parliamentary leader Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been kept in solitary confinement for the past two months, calling it the “worst form of torture” prohibited under the Constitution, domestic laws and international human rights conventions.
He alleged that the jail authorities were effectively punishing the couple without trial, arguing that prolonged detention under harsh prison conditions amounted to punishment in itself. The cases against them were being used as political tools, he said.
Senator Zafar rejected the government’s assertion that meetings were not allowed because visitors made political statements, saying this could not justify the denial of fundamental rights. “Legal rights cannot be suspended on political grounds,” he said.
He told the House that, despite being legal counsel for Mr Khan, he was not being allowed to meet his client, describing this as a violation of the sanctity of the lawyer-client relationship and a denial of the right to legal defence.
PTI Senator Falak Naz also said Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and that no one had been allowed to meet him for the past two months.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the jail superintendent had the authority to schedule meetings based on conduct. He pointed out that Adiala Jail fell under the jurisdiction of the Punjab government and that the federal government had no authority to issue directions in this regard.
The minister rejected the opposition’s claim that Mr Khan was being kept in solitary confinement.
Separately, the House also discussed reports of tree cutting in Chitral, with Senator Naz alleging that the timber mafia continued illegal felling. Senator Sherry Rehman said Chitral had “turned brown from green” over the past two decades, adding that the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change would take up the issue in its next meeting.
Senator Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said forestry was a provincial subject but noted that the federal government could write to the provincial authorities.

Members highlighted the problem of fake driving challans, as well as fraudulent messages from educational institutions, banks, mobile phone companies and other entities. It was also informed that in some cases people responded to such fake messages and later faced charges of blasphemy and anti-state activities, resulting in imprisonment.
On the other hand, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry claimed that necessary steps were being taken to introduce reforms in the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in order to effectively tackle cybercrimes.
PTI leader Sheryar Afridi informed the House that a large number of young people were facing cases and imprisonment after being declared guilty of committing blasphemy and anti-state activities.

House told NCCIA received over 150,000 cybercrime complaints in a year

“A number of people told me outside Adiala jail that they and their family members are facing cases after responding to some fake messages on the internet from people posing as representatives of educational institutions, banks and other organisations,” he added.
PPP legislator Shazia Marri drew the attention of the assembly to fake traffic challans (fines) sent by fraudsters and hackers. She said a large number of people had been cheated through such messages, as they believed them to be genuine and paid fines to the perpetrators.
In response, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said he had also received such messages claiming that he had committed traffic violations and was liable to pay fines.
Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhry said the NCCIA had received over 150,000 complaints last year. He said the best officers had been appointed to the agency and that efforts were under way to enhance its capacity.
He said over 81,000 of these complaints were related to financial crimes, and that 1,095 accused persons had been arrested. He added that cellular companies had been directed to enhance their security features for the issuance of SIMs.
Responding to a question, Mr Chaud­hry said the air quality of Islamabad had improved compared to a year ago. He said measures such as vehicle emission certification were among the steps taken to improve the environment.
To another question, the minister expressed the government’s commitment to purging Islamabad of all kinds of encroachments.
Responding to a calling attention notice, he said Vision 2027 would be announced this month for the development of the federal capital territory.
Privatisation
Later, State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani told the House that PIA had been privatised in the most transparent manner in accordance with the law and the Constitution. He clarified that only the core operations of the airline had been privatised, while PIA-owned hotels were not part of the transaction.
Expressing confidence in the move, Bilal Kayani said the privatisation would improve service delivery and strengthen the airline’s financial position.
Responding to a calling attention notice, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan said interventions had been made to achieve the target of $6bn in exports.
Bills introduced
Meanwhile, several bills were laid before the House. These included the Export Development Fund Amendment Bill, 2026; the National Tariff Commis­sion Amendment Bill, 2026; the Export-Import Bank of Pakistan Amendment Bill, 2026; the Pakistan Telecommu­ni­cation Reorganisation Amendment Bill; the Life Insurance Nationalisation Ame­n­dment Bill; the Federal Board of Inter­mediate and Secondary Education Amen­dment Bill; the Islamabad Capital Territory Condominium (Ownership and Management) Bill; and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Amendment Bill, 2026.

The employee earns these benefits through long, continuous, faithful and unblemished service, observed Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui in a six-page judgement that upheld the right of a former civil servant to receive pension benefits despite the fact that he had applied for pension 13 years after his resignation.

 

Justice Siddiqui was a member of a three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, which also comprised Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.
The bench had taken up an appeal filed by Muhammad Usman against the July 3, 2024 rejection of his plea by the Federal Service Tribunal (FST).

Sets aside ruling of service tribunal on plea by ex-auditor

The appellant was a former senior auditor (BS-11) in the office of the Military Accountant General, Rawalpindi. He was held disentitled to pension benefits on the grounds that he had tendered resignation from public service and applied belatedly for the release of pensionary benefits, notwithstanding the fact that the requisite length of service — i.e. 20 years — had already been completed by the employee.
Earlier, his department dismissed the application on the grounds that the qualifying length of service for pension benefits was 25 years. Likewise, his subsequent application for condonation of the shortfall period was also declined on Oct 27, 2020.
The SC noted that since the resignation was tendered in September 2007, the petitioner, for the purposes of pension benefits, was required to have served for a period of 20 years, as the relevant clause (i) to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, had been amended through Ordinance No XXXIV of 2001 on Aug 4, 2001, whereby the qualifying service was reduced from 25 to 20 years.
During the hearing, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rashideen Nawaz Qasoori did not object to the fact that, at the relevant time when the resignation was tendered, the petitioner had completed the requisite period of 20 years.
However, the AAG opposed the grant of pension benefits to the petitioner on two counts: first, that the petitioner had belatedly applied for the pension claim; and second, that since he had tendered resignation on his own from public service, Regulation 418 of the Civil Service Regulations would disentitle him from such a claim.
The petitioner had moved the department for the first time to claim pension benefits in the year 2020, i.e. after a lapse of 13 years from the date of tendering resignation, which was later accepted. This delay was considered sufficient by the relevant department to disentitle the petitioner from claiming pensionary benefits, the judgement noted.
However, treating CSR as an independent provision to oust a civil servant from claiming pension benefits after successful completion of the requisite length of service was misconceived and legally untenable, the SC ruled.
The apex court further held that both the FST and the concerned departmental authority had failed to understand the true spirit of Regulation 418 of the CSR, and that a belated application to claim pension benefits did not, by itself, constitute a ground for disentitlement.
While concluding, the SC set aside the FST order as unsustainable and converted the petition into an appeal, holding that the appellant was entitled to his pension benefits in accordance with law.

This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship ‘State of the Industry Report 2025’, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.
It said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.
It said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, “overall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development”.

Nepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt

It pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, many go­­vernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com­me­rcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie­ncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con­tribute to the circular debt problem.
It said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. “Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector’s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth”, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector’s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.
The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.
It appreciated the government’s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. “Consequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs’ tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms”.
On top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal. 
Reduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.
A notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.
The regulator put on record that “KE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators”.
Operational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.
It said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.
As if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement drive had “been diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions”. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement efforts.

“I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,” Trump said at a health roundtable at the White House. “I may do that,” added Trump.
Trump compared the possible Greenland tariffs to those that he threatened on France and Germany last year over the price of pharmaceutical products.
The threat is the latest pressure tactic by Republican Trump as he steps up his bid to acquire the autonomous Arctic island, a goal that he has threatened to achieve by military means if necessary.
Trump claims the United States needs mineral-rich Greenland and has accused Greenland of not doing enough to ensure its security against rivals Russia and China.
European nations have in recent days shown their support for North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (Nato) ally Denmark and Greenland over Trump’s escalating threats, including by sending troops to the strategic territory.
The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland visited the White House on Wednesday for talks to defuse the issue, but said afterwards that they remained in “fundamental disagreement” with Trump.
But the United States, Denmark and Greenland had agreed to set up a working group to continue talks every two to three weeks on the issue, the White House said on Thursday.
US congress members visit Denmark to support Greenland
A bipartisan US Congress delegation began a visit to Copenhagen on Friday to voice support for Denmark and Greenland after Trump threatened to take over the Arctic island, an autonomous Danish territory.
The two-day visit comes alongside a European show of support in the form of a military reconnaissance mission to Greenland.
The 11 congressmen and women were to hold talks with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen.
The group arrived at the Danish employers’ association Dansk Industri around midday for discussions with business leaders.
They were due later to meet members of the Danish parliament, over which the Greenlandic flag was raised on Friday in a show of unity.
“We are showing bipartisan solidarity with the people of this country and with Greenland. They’ve been our friends and allies for decades,” Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told reporters.
“We want them to know we appreciate that very much. And the statements being made by the president do not reflect what the American people feel,” he added of Trump.
An AFP reporter in Copenhagen saw a large black van leave Frederiksen’s office shortly before noon on Friday, but her office declined to confirm whether the meeting had taken place.
The delegation’s visit follows a meeting in Washington on Wednesday at which Danish representatives said Copenhagen and Washington were in “fundamental disagreement” over the future of Greenland.
In Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, residents welcomed the show of support.
“(US) Congress would never approve of a military action in Greenland. It’s just one idiot speaking,” a 39-year-old union representative told AFP.
“If he does it, he’ll get impeached or kicked out. If people in Congress want to save their own democracy, they have to step up,” said the union rep, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Trump claims the United States needs mineral-rich Greenland and has criticised Denmark for, he says, not doing enough to ensure its security.
The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland — as part of Denmark — being covered by NATO’s security umbrella.
Military personnel were more visible in Nuuk on Friday, according to an AFP journalist, days after Denmark said it was beefing up its defence on the island.
“I don’t think troops in Europe impact the president’s decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.
Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen retorted that a US acquisition of Greenland was “out of the question”.
The European troop deployment in Greenland for a military exercise is aimed at “sending a signal” to “everyone”, including the United States, that European countries are determined to “defend (their) sovereignty”, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said.
Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced the deployment of small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic.
“A first team of French service members is already on site and will be reinforced in the coming days with land, air and maritime assets,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.
Large demonstrations are planned across Denmark and Greenland on Saturday to protest against Trump’s territorial ambitions.
Thousands of people have taken to social networks to say they intend to take part in the protests organised by Greenlandic associations in Nuuk and Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense.
In addition to Durbin, the US delegation included Democratic senators Chris Coons, Jeanne Shaheen and Peter Welch, as well as Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Thom Tillis.
Democrats from the House of Representatives in the delegation are Madeleine Dean, Steny Hoyer, Sara Jacobs, Sarah McBride and Gregory Meeks.</p><small>2026-01-16 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16220125384405d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967324/pti-leaders-want-dialogue-but-imran-not-in-favour-of-it-rana-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders want dialogue but Imran not in favour of it: Rana Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government, but jailed party founder Imran Khan opposed the move even as the party remained firm on its call for protests on February 8.
In December, the PTI had denied dialogue with the government until “ensuring a level-playing field” was provided to the party through its ongoing “street movement” — an agitation campaign against the government.
Speaking during Geo News’s programme Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal, Sanaullah said that the government had been in contact with PTI leaders for dialogue, stating that “several of them are in favour of negotiations with the government.”
“Whenever politicians come to the table for talks, problems get solved, and a way gets paved,” he said.
Sanaullah reiterated that many PTI leaders were in favour of dialogue, but  “whenever they meet us, they say that the PTI founder is not in favour of any sort of dialogue with the government,” he added.
He further said that PTI’s arrangement, speeches, and mobilisation efforts for the upcoming protest on Feb 8 indicated that they were “standing firm on their decision and wouldn’t step back as per the government’s assessment”.
“However,” he added, “the PTI leaders think that if they get to meet Imran, they could convince him to postpone the protest and initiate dialogue with the government.”
When asked about the meeting of PTI leaders with Imran, Sanaullah said: “They have gone too far now; any initiation of dialogues or meeting with Imran Khan can be possible only after Feb 8.”
“They are preparing for the protest at full throttle, so meeting them before that would not be possible,” he said.
The former interior minister also implied that the government would deal with the protests “administratively”, and PTI would emerge “unsuccessful”.
He advised the PTI to “play its role” in the parliamentary processes and return to the committee proceedings from which they had abstained.
Earlier, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran.
It further maintained that it would not engage in negotiations with the government, as the stance it followed was in line with the directions passed on by Imran.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16221734bc594ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967325/india-liquidates-chabahar-stakes-over-trumps-tariff-threat' target='_blank'><strong>India liquidates Chabahar stakes over Trump’s tariff threat</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI:  Responding to renewed US sanctions, India transferred approximately $120 million to Iran to fully liquidate its financial commitment for developing Chabahar port, a key gateway to landlocked Afghanistan, The Economic Times said on Friday.
A government source stated that India now has “no liability” in its commitment and that Iran is free to use the funds independently.
In October last year, India was granted a six-month exemption from US sanctions on the port. New Delhi and Tehran signed a contract to develop and equip the long-stalled Chabahar project in 2024, giving India 10 years of access.
Following the reimposition of sanctions, the state-owned entity India Ports Global Ltd (IPGL) effectively exited the project.
Government directors resigned en masse, and its website was taken down to “insulate everybody associated with the port from potential sanctions”. A government source concluded, “India has no choice but to exit the Chabahar port”.
The collapse followed US President Donald Trump’s January 12, 2026, warning that any country doing business with Iran would face a 25 per cent tariff on all business with the United States.
The decision, say officials, was driven by a stark cost-benefit analysis under immense US pressure. Combined with existing punitive tariffs, this could have raised total duties on Indian exports to the US to as high as 75pc.
The value of protecting Chabahar (with bilateral India-Iran trade at about $1.68 billion) paled in comparison to the risk of losing access to the US market.
The US had already crippled the project by reimposing sanctions on the port effective September 29, 2025. India’s transfer of funds and operational wind-down were designed to secure a temporary six-month sanctions exemption from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This was a tactical move to avoid secondary sanctions on Indian entities.
Indian officials sought to downplay the direct trade impact, noting that Iran is not among India’s top 50 trading partners, accounting for only about 0.15pc of India’s overall trade.
This made the strategic project easier to sacrifice in the face of a broader US trade confrontation.
Sources said that with the Taliban’s rise in Afghanistan diminishing Chabahar’s primary utility as a gateway, and with Iran facing internal unrest, the project’s strategic returns appeared increasingly uncertain.
The decision reflects a pragmatic, if reluctant, prioritisation of immediate economic security with the US over long-term regional connectivity goals.
With the surrender, India loses a critical gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia that allowed it to bypass Pakistan, undermining years of diplomatic and financial investment aimed at expanding regional influence.
The episode also starkly reveals the limits of India’s “multi-alignment” policy. When confronted with a direct clash between US demands and its partnership with Iran, India chose to capitulate to Washington, potentially damaging its credibility as a reliable, independent strategic partner, analysts say.
There’s a view that India’s withdrawal creates a vacuum in Chabahar’s development that China, with its deeper pockets and greater willingness to defy US sanctions, is well-positioned to fill. This could further expand China’s influence in the Indian Ocean region.
While the overall trade volume with Iran is small, specific sectors like basmati rice exports (where Iran is India’s largest market) face immediate disruption due to payment delays and shipment uncertainties, reports said.
India’s business sources say the apparent “flip-flop” on Chabahar is not a capricious policy change but a forced retreat.
It underscores a painful reality: when confronted with a binary choice between safeguarding its vital economic ties with the United States and preserving a strategically important but economically secondary project with Iran, New Delhi will prioritise the former.
The move secures short-term economic relief but at the cost of a long-term strategic vision, highlighting the persistent vulnerability of middle powers in an increasingly polarised world order.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16202455c97935a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967321/pause-on-immigrant-visas-until-vetting-meets-maximum-degree-of-eligibility-says-us-mission-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pause on immigrant visas until vetting meets ‘maximum degree’ of eligibility, says US mission in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The US government has said that it decided to pause immigrant visa processing until it ensures new applicants are “vetted to the maximum degree to ensure their eligibility”, according to a Friday statement shared by the US Embassy in Islamabad on the X platform.
On Wednesday, the US announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, along with 74 other countries, effective from January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.
“The Trump Administration is focused on protecting the American people by upholding the highest standards of screening and vetting of visa applicants,” the statement said.







“Effective January 21,” the statement added, “the Department of State is pausing issuance to all immigrant visa applicants from selected countries, including Pakistan.”
The statement said that US State Secretary Marco Rubio had instituted this pause until his government could “ensure that new immigrants have been vetted to the maximum degree to ensure their eligibility for a US visa”, including that they would “not use public assistance”.
However, the statement clarified that the action would apply to the issuance of immigrant visas “only”.
“It does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, students, athletes, skilled workers, and their families,” the statement added.
Earlier, the State Department had said, “The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”







Pakistan was among more than 75 countries whose nationals will be affected under the new measure, which the State Department said is part of a comprehensive review ordered by President Donald Trump to ensure that immigrants are “financially self-sufficient and not a financial burden to Americans.”
“President Trump has made clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,” the department said, adding that all policies, regulations and guidance are being reviewed to prevent immigrants from becoming a public charge.</p><small>2026-01-16 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16212454ed38352.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967323/security-forces-kill-12-terrorists-thwart-hostage-attempt-in-balochistans-kharan-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 12 terrorists, thwart hostage attempt in Balochistan’s Kharan district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 12 terrorists and effectively thwarted their attempt to create a hostage situation in Balochistan’s Kharan district during multiple operations, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR),  on January 15, “approximately fifteen to twenty Indian-sponsored terrorists of Fitna Al Hindustan carried out multiple terrorist activities in Kharan City, District Kharan.”
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
It said that during the operations, “terrorists attacked [the] City Police Station, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited.” They also looted Rs3.4 million from the banks.
“Security forces effectively responded and engaged the terrorists, prompting them to retreat. During the ensuing clearance operation, twelve terrorists were sent to hell in three different engagements,” the ISPR said.
“Terrorists’ design to create a hostage situation at the police station was also effectively thwarted.”
It added that a sanitisation operation is underway in the surrounding areas of Kharan to eliminate any other terrorists.
“A relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm-e-Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
On January 6, ISPR Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared during a press conference that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.
Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan.
He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.
On January 13, the ISPR said four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.

Afridi visited Karachi and other cities of Sindh last week as part of the PTI’s renewed anti-government agitation campaign called the “street movement”. The chief minister decried the treatment meted out to him by the Sindh government during his visit, alleging that the police tried to stop his motorcade and PTI supporters from staging a peaceful protest at Mazar-i-Quaid. The Sindh government denied the allegations, stating that the Jinnah Ground was under the control of the Centre, so it was not entitled to issue a no-objection certificate to the party.
Speaking to reporters in Karachi, Governor Tessori said that the PTI had “turned the whole country upside down, but the agitation was confined to social media and had no value on the ground.”
Referring to KP CM’s Karachi visit, Tessori said, “You must come here, we will welcome you again, but come with positive work to do”.
He suggested that CM Afridi should meet with traders and industrialists and ask them to invest in his province instead of mobilising people to take to the streets.
“If you talk about establishing new industries, expanding inter-provincial trade, the future of people, giving health and educational opportunities, people will definitely welcome you,” Tessori said.
“However, incendiary political narrative, incitement to vandalism, blockades, causing trouble to people — these things will not be welcomed.”
The governor added that putting this city to a halt caused losses worth billions of rupees, because “Karachi is the financial and economic hub of Pakistan,” he stated.
“For God’s sake, don’t do this,” Tessori pleaded.
He reminded the chief minister that Pakistan was now at the centre of the “global lens”, making progress through diplomatic efforts.
“Why don’t you understand that we are a triumphant nation and the time has come to pull ourselves out of the problems we have been facing for the last 70 years,” he said.
He said that repeating the incidents of May 9  — when PTI supporters staged violent nationwide protests, vandalising state-owned institutions and military installations following Imran Khan’s arrest — at this stage would be “equivalent to a foreign conspiracy and a foreign agenda.”
“We have to provide educational opportunities because I believe that ignorance is the biggest reason for terrorism,” the governor said.
Speaking in favour of the armed forces and calling the chief minister out for criticising them, Tessori said that politicians might disappoint the nation, but the army would never do that.
“Didn’t we see what happened on May 10?” he questioned.
Tessori added that the world was praising the Pakistani Army and acknowledging the country’s defence capabilities, but the PTI was doing the opposite. “Rather than lauding your army, you started abusing it.”
“Is there any country or leader in the world who talks against his own army?”
He was referring to Imran’s recent social media comments against the leadership of the armed forces on the X platform, in response to which the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations had called him a “national security threat”.
“There are countries where presidents can be picked up, and their armies can’t do anything”, Tessori said, “but India couldn’t even seize an inch of land of Pakistan because of our army.”
“Politicians may disappoint you, but not your army.”
He accepted that the country was facing economic difficulties, though the world was handing orders to Pakistan’s defence industries to manufacture aircraft. “Our economy will improve by this,” he stated.
Further criticising the PTI, Governor Tessori said that Karachi city gave the PTI a president, Arif Alvi, who was a citizen of this city. “Tell me how many projects he gave to Karachi,” he asked.
“Karachi gave the MNA seat to Imran Khan, but he hadn’t even spent a night in this city.”
“Tell us what your performance was?” he asked. “How many industries had he [Imran] inaugurated in Karachi?”
“What have you done for Pashtuns, Balochs, Sindhis, Urdu-speaking, and other communities in this city?” he questioned. “But you made speeches to incite violence like May 9.”
“Name a single project,” he challenged. “Even if some time is given to you now, you still can’t do anything.”
Governor Tessori added that PTI could only incite innocent people on social media and sold them a narrative that had neither rendered them any favour nor could it now.
“We have to choose whether we want to strengthen our country economically and educationally, or go after the people who would just make you chant slogans and hold flags,” he stated.</p><small>2026-01-16 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16191841f0895d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967317/russia-pakistan-relations-genuinely-mutually-beneficial-says-president-putin' target='_blank'><strong>Russia-Pakistan relations ‘genuinely mutually beneficial’, says President Putin</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that his country’s relations with Pakistan are “genuinely mutually beneficial” and that Moscow maintains close relations with Islamabad.
“We maintain close cooperation with Pakistan, a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the largest regional organisation in terms of economic, technological, and human potential. Russia-Pakistan relations are genuinely mutually beneficial,” the Embassy of Russia in Pakistan quoted President Putin as saying on X.







The statement came as Pakistan’s Ambassador to Russia, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, formally presented his credentials to President Putin during a ceremony held on Thursday at Moscow’s Grand Kremlin Palace, according to the Pakistani Embassy in Russia.
In recent years, Pakistan and Russia have significantly strengthened their economic ties, driven by mutual necessity. Following Western sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict, Moscow turned toward new energy outlets, while Islamabad simultaneously sought more affordable fuel sources to reduce national import expenses.
This diplomatic shift culminated in 2023, when Pakistan officially integrated Russian crude oil into its energy portfolio.
Last month, Finance Mini­ster Muhammad Aur­a­ngzeb said Islamabad and Moscow were in talks regarding a new potential oil-sector agreement.
Pakistan, which imports 70 per cent of its crude oil, is mainly dependent on Russian crude exports. Despite this, Pakis­tan has enjoyed lower tariffs from Washington and close relations with its current administration, even as India recently saw a punitive 25pc tariff impo­sed on its goods.
In November last year — as Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev visited Islamabad to participate in the 10th Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission — the two countries reaffirmed their resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation in diversified trade, energy, business-to-business engagements and social sectors like health and education.</p><small>2026-01-16 14:23</small></div><hr>
