<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28182236807eee4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963737/party-would-move-towards-dialogue-after-ensuring-level-playing-field-provided-through-street-movement-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Party would move towards dialogue after ensuring level-playing field provided through street movement: PTI</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Sunday denied opting to engage in dialogue with the government as an underdog but said that it will do so “after ensuring a level-playing field is provided to it through street movements“, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and the PTI Secretary-General, Salman Akram Raja.
CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, was in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. He left for the motorway at about 6:40pm.
In a discussion with senior journalists at a private residence in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority earlier in the day, Afridi asserted that reconciliation was impossible without resistance.
“We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.
Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without yielding any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.“
Secretary-General Raja said no political party could go into a blind alley.
“We are seeing that the government want the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”
Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed – otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.
Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi visited the residences of party leaders Mirza Afridi, but was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassan Niazi.
The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”
“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.
“I have been asking to go to the party leaders’ residences in the cantonment but was told that I was not permitted,” he said and demanded that he be given a reason “in writing” as to why he was stopped.
“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had offered talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
‘Street movement failed to attract public’: Azma
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister, Azma Bokhari, ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”







In a statement on X, Bokhari remarked that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, Bokhari said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead.She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28184610fa24602.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963740/security-forces-neutralise-4-terrorists-in-balochistans-kalat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces neutralise 4 terrorists in Balochistan’s Kalat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan‘s Kalat district, killing four terrorists, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Saturday’s IBO took place on the reports that terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan were present.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in the statement.
It added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who had been actively involved in terrorist activity in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored terrorist found in the area. [The] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm-i-Istehkam” (as approved by [the] Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated.

Yesterday, the ISPR said in a statement that four terrorists had been killed in an IBO in Balochistan’s Panjgur district.
The IBO, launched on Friday, saw security forces engage terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khawarij, a term designating members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored khawarij were sent to hell”.
Following the skirmish, a sanitisation operation was initiated in the area to “eliminate any other Indian sponsored Khawarij present in the area”.
Earlier this month, 12 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Balochistan’s Kalat.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/281758100cde236.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963739/sikh-activists-clash-with-hindu-protesters-outside-bangladeshi-high-commission-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Sikh activists clash with Hindu protesters outside Bangladeshi High Commission in London</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: A demonstration outside the Bangladeshi High Commission in London on Saturday briefly turned tense when pro-Khalistan Sikh activists and a small group of Hindu protesters confronted each other, prompting police intervention.
The Khalistan Movement wants an independent Sikh state carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947, when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries.
The protest was held in connection with reports of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. During the gathering, Paramjeet Singh Pamma, identified by organisers as a coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign, was involved in a brief scuffle with an Indian Hindu protester.
Metropolitan Police officers on duty intervened quickly, separating the individuals and dispersing the groups from close proximity to the mission building. No injuries were reported.







Following the incident, pro-Khalistan Sikh protesters formed a cordon near the embassy entrance and continued their demonstration.
They raised political slogans, accusing the Indian government of involvement in the killings of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others. Police maintained a presence to prevent further confrontation and said the situation was brought under control.
India has designated Pamma as a “most wanted terrorist” — a charge he and his supporters reject. He currently resides in the United Kingdom. UK authorities have not announced any charges against him, and previous Indian requests related to his extradition have not resulted in court action.
The Metropolitan Police did not issue any immediate statement on arrests or further action.
Nijjar was shot dead at the age of 45 by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. His murder in June 2023 near his home in Vancouver sparked a diplomatic storm between India and Canada.
Similarly, in November 2023, US authorities thwarted a plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the Financial Times (FT) reported.
In October 2024, an Indian intelligence official and an Indian national indicted for their role in the plot to kill Pannun, according to the US Justice Department.
Meanwhile, in March this year, India asked the US to list Sikhs For Justice, a separatist group, as a terrorist organisation — a point that came up during talks between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and visiting US national intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28175045bf28fcb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738/pcb-to-take-over-owner-less-multan-sultans-for-next-psl-season' target='_blank'><strong>PCB to take over owner-less Multan Sultans for next PSL season</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Multan Sultans will be operated by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) itself during the upcoming 11th edition of the tournament, the board’s chairman Mohsin Naqvi announced on Sunday.
The decision comes amid a protracted dispute between the board and the franchise’s former owner, Ali Khan Tareen, whose agreement was not renewed after he was deemed non-compliant due to public criticism of the league’s management.
Multan Sultans, introduced as the sixth team in 2018 and historically the most valuable franchise — acquired initially for a significantly higher fee than others — won the PSL title in 2021 and reached multiple finals.
However, tensions escalated over the past year as Tareen repeatedly voiced concerns over transparency, governance and communication within the PSL setup.
The PCB responded with legal notices, accusing him of breaching contractual obligations, while Tareen threatened counter-legal action and ultimately decided against renewing ownership, citing principles.
Speaking at a press conference at Gaddafi Stadium, Naqvi said: “This year, the PCB will operate Multan Sultans itself. After the end of the next PSL season, God-willing, we will hand it over to its next owners after an auction process.”
He added that an “acting head” for the franchise would be appointed within the next eight to 10 days, preferably a professional cricketer to ensure smooth operations.
The development coincides with the PSL’s expansion to eight teams for its 2026 edition — the league’s first major restructuring since Multan Sultans joined seven years ago.
The auction for the two new franchises is scheduled for January 8 in Islamabad, following the shortlisting of 10 technically qualified bidders from domestic and international investors.
Five existing franchises renewed their agreements earlier this year under revised valuations, but Multan Sultans will not go under the hammer ahead of the upcoming season to maintain continuity.
The 11th PSL is set to run from March 26 to May 3, overlapping once again with the Indian Premier League in a bid to attract top overseas talent through enhanced player salaries and prize money.
Naqvi, however, said that deliberations are ongoing with the league’s stakeholders over preponing the starting date to March 23 in order for the tournament’s opening to coincide with the Pakistan Day.
Meanwhile, Naqvi announced that former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has been appointed as the PSL’s brand ambassador and the bowling great will take on the post formally on January 1.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28111926c1e8946.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725/blatant-disregard-for-international-law-pakistan-20-other-nations-reject-israels-recognition-of-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>‘Blatant disregard for international law’: Pakistan, 20 other nations reject Israel’s recognition of Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”.
The joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.







Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.
Israel’s decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession.
The Foreign Office (FO) released the joint statement by 21 nations, including Pakistan, and the OIC on Sunday, underscoring their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
The statement said that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The 21 nations and the OIC condemned the measure in the strongest terms, saying that it “constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which explicitly stipulates the imperative of protecting the sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity, and reflects Israel’s expansionist” policy.
They underscored their full support of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and the unequivocal rejection of any measures that undermine the unity of Somalia, its territorial integrity or its sovereignty over its entire territory.
“The recognition of parts of states constitutes a serious precedent and threatens international peace and security, and violates the cardinal principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” their joint statement read.
They registered their “full rejection of any potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land, which is unequivocally rejected in any form as a matter of principle”.
In a separate statement on Saturday, the FO termed Israel’s recognition of Somaliland an attempt to undermine Somalia’s sovereignty.
“Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the FO said in a statement.
Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”.
Meanwhile, in a call with Somali Foreign Minister Abdisalam Abdi Ali, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia’s sovereignty and condemned actions undermining it, the FO said in a post on X.
“The Somali Foreign Minister thanked the DPM/FM (Dar) for standing by Somalia and for Pakistan’s continued and sustained support,” the post read. “He also sought Pakistan’s assistance in raising Somalia’s concerns at the UNSC.”
The FO said that Dar affirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia at the UN and other multilateral fora.







Similarly, in another call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty, Dar discussed regional and global developments, with Somalia and Yemen in particular, the FO said in another social media post.







For its part, Somalia has declared the Israeli decision a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty.
Meanwhile, the African Union has warned the move risks “setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent”.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on the social media platform X on Saturday that Israel had previously identified Somaliland “as a destination for the forced displacement of our Palestinian people, particularly from the Gaza Strip”. It warned against any “complicity” with such plans.







While several other nations, as well as the European Union, have called for respecting Somalia’s sovereignty, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterised the recognition as a continuation of the “spirit of the Abraham Accords”.
However, the United States signalled it would not follow Israel’s lead. When asked by the New York Post whether the US planned to recognise Somaliland, President Trump said, “No.”
“Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump said, distancing Washington from the move.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28170953636fb9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963736/thais-cambodians-fear-returning-home-despite-border-truce' target='_blank'><strong>Thais, Cambodians fear returning home despite border truce</strong></a><br><p>At a Thai university-turned-shelter for displaced people, Kanlaya Somjettana is reluctant to go home even after a truce halted weeks of border clashes with Cambodia, fearing the violence may not be over.
She said some people forced to flee the fighting began returning home on Sunday, a day after the ceasefire was announced, but many evacuees on both sides of the border preferred waiting for an official word that it was safe.
Some cited a lack of trust that the neighbouring country would respect the truce, after previous ones had been broken.
“I really hope this ceasefire will last long and we can return home,” 21-year-old homemaker Kanlaya told AFP from the university campus in Thailand’s Surin city.
“But I will not go back home as long as authorities do not confirm that it is safe,” she said, adding that the evacuation centre was now less crowded, although hundreds remained there.
On the Cambodian side, 35-year-old So Choeun said she expected to give birth within days and hoped to then take her baby home, about one kilometre (0.6 miles) from the border.
But not yet, said the woman sheltering with family under makeshift tents at a Buddhist pagoda in Banteay Meanchey province.
“Despite the ceasefire, we dare not return home yet. We are still frightened,” she told AFP.
“We will wait to see the situation for a few days, if it will stay calm.” Officials on both sides said the day-old ceasefire was holding on Sunday, but for most areas, there has been no all-clear notice just yet.
The truce follows three weeks of renewed cross-border fighting that killed at least 47 people and displaced more than a million on both sides.
A previous round in the decades-old conflict — five days of fighting in July — killed dozens before a truce was brokered, and then broken.
Many of those displaced by the latest violence had evacuated in July, too.
‘Good sign’
Rice and cassava farmer Saichon Wongpitak said she could not afford to wait any longer, planning to return to her home in Thailand’s Sisaket province on Sunday afternoon.
“I talked to our neighbour who said there was no gunfire since yesterday,” Saichon, 38, told AFP, adding that her family would evacuate again if necessary.
“We have fear… but we have jobs to do at home, we have cattle at home, we have our farm,” she said.
Saichon said she was glad to hear of the truce, but did not expect it to last long “before Cambodia starts a new round of fighting”.
“I live on the border, and what I have learned is not to trust Cambodia,” she said.
Under the truce, the two countries agreed to cease fire, freeze troop movements and allow civilians living in border areas to return home as soon as possible, while Thailand was to return 18 Cambodian soldiers captured in July within 72 hours.
Kot Ngik, 43, from another camp for displaced people in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey, said she was thankful for the truce since it may allow children to soon return to school.
But “we don’t trust the Thai military yet”, she said.
“At this point, we are not sure about the situation. They can fight again at any time.” While many evacuees, including Kot Ngik, were still too fearful to leave shelters, So Choeun said the ceasefire at least offered some hope.
“Yesterday morning, I could hear loud bangs, but I have not heard it since 12pm yesterday,” she said.
“This is a good sign.”</p><small>2025-12-28 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28155346a922711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963729/bilawal-highlights-significance-of-politics-of-reconciliation-calls-for-opposition-to-play-responsible-role' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal highlights significance of politics of reconciliation, calls for opposition to play ‘responsible’ role</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari highlighted on Sunday the significance of the politics of reconciliation, urging the opposition to play a “responsible” role and also called for the ruling party and its allies to take the necessary steps in this regard.
Bilawal expressed these views while speaking to the media at the inauguration ceremony of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology in Larkana.

         View this post on Instagram            

He recalled that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto had given the message of “truth and reconciliation” and “reconciliation in politics”.
Linking it with the country’s progress and economic prosperity, he said the ruling party and its allies would have to play their part for this while the opposition would also have to play a “responsible role”.
“If stringent [measures] are taken in response to the politics of extremism, then there should be no complaints,” he remarked, quoting the English idiom “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”.
He added, “If you (the PTI) attack a national institution just because of a small NAB (National Accountability Bureau) case against your leader and because of a small arrest, then don’t complain. Action will be taken against you in accordance with the law and Constitution.“
Bilawal maintained that if the PPP had been in PTI’s place, it would have faced more severe consequences.
He advised the PTI to let go of the “politics of extremism”, saying that it would not benefit the party itself and its workers, but it would also have a positive impact on the country’s politics.
The PPP chairperson then went on to say that while Benazir’s philosophy was that of the politics of reconciliation, President Asif Ali Zardari had played the “biggest role” in its implementation.
“From the first day after the election till yesterday in my speech, and even within the party, my stance has been that President Zardari will have to play his role.
“President Zardari not just has a [track record] but also the people’s confidence that he is capable of playing a role for reconciliation in politics,” Bilawal said.
However, he pointed out there was a “unique dynamic” that had to be considered in current circumstances.
“The situation on frontiers with India and Afghanistan is before you, and internally terrorism is increasing,” he said, adding that in this situation, the role of opposition parties was of most importance.
“If they have to operate like an extremist party, then the state’s response would be in accordance with that […] But if they adopt a political attitude, [other] parties may get some political space to play a role in reducing the political division and polarisation in the country.”
He said political reconciliation was the way forward and an environment conducive to that would have to be created, else the people and the country would face the consequent loss.
In response to a question about Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently demanded fresh elections across the country, Bilawal said all political parties should play their role to ensure that free and fair elections were held, whenever they were to be held.
“And if any amendments, any changes in the law are required for that, we will have to increase people’s trust in the Election Commission.
“There is no point in holding elections if allegations of rigging are to be made again. So, now that there is time and the writing on the wall is that elections will not be held early, serious political parties should try to bring electoral reforms aimed at increasing the trust of people, as well as the political parties in the election commission,” Bilawal said.
Referring to the complaints regarding recent by-elections, he said he wouldn’t want polls, be it by-polls or general elections, to be held in such a situation and become a cause of “more political instability”.
Again highlighting the need for the opposition to work towards reconciliation, Bilawal said that the government would also have to take some measures.
“Parliament should be made functional. The [platform] of Parliament should be used — politicians and political workers will have to take several measures for us to be able to create space for tolerance in politics,” he added.
Earlier in the media talk, Bilawal said that while the government had been claiming that the economy was improving and economic indicators on paper seemed to be improving, there was a “crisis of affordability” in the country.
He also said that the PPP’s views on privatisation were that a successful model in this area was that of public-private partnership.
In response to a question, he again stressed that political parties should find political means to resolve issues.
“Long-term solutions to our issues, economic difficulties and questions of national security lie in genuine political stability and in the lasting innings of one political party,” he asserted.
“And all political forces and our senior politicians should think about what measures need to be taken to establish genuine political stability.“</p><small>2025-12-28 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28164804052036d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734/bangladesh-police-say-student-leaders-killers-fled-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh police say student leader’s killers fled to India</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh police on Sunday said the alleged killers of popular student leader Sharif Osman Hadi had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with its neighbour.
Hadi, a vocal India critic who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was shot by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.
His death set off violent protests with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.
With protests being held across the country almost daily, pressure has been growing on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year.
“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference.
He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border with India shortly after attacking Hadi on December 12.
“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.”
Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.
“We are communicating with Meghalaya police, who have confirmed the arrest of two Indian nationals,” he added.
Two senior Meghalaya police officers, however, did not comment when contacted by AFP.
The Indian foreign ministry had earlier said it rejects “false narratives” about New Delhi’s involvement in Hadi’s killing.
Ties between the neighbours have deteriorated since ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the pro-democracy uprising and sought refuge in India.
India says it is still considering Dhaka’s requests to extradite Hasina, who was sentenced to death in absentia for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.
The lynching of a Hindu garment worker by a mob on December 18 has also hit ties.
Amid the deteriorating security situation in the Muslim-majority country, Khuda Baksh Chowdhury, special assistant to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, overseeing the home department, stepped down on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-12-28 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/281632016cd0a5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963732/french-legend-brigitte-bardot-dead-at-91' target='_blank'><strong>French ‘legend’ Brigitte Bardot dead at 91</strong></a><br><p>French film icon Brigitte Bardot, a symbol of sexual liberation of the 1950s and sixties who turned her back on cinema to devote herself to protecting animals, has died aged 91, her foundation said Sunday.
Bardot was hospitalised in October and, in November, released a statement denying rumours that she had died. The foundation did not say when or where she died, however.
“The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation,” it said in a statement sent to AFP.
Tributes were immediately paid to the star who became known as “BB” in her home country.
Born on September 28, 1934, in Paris, Bardot was raised in a well-off, traditional Catholic household. Married four times, she had one child, Nicolas, with her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.
Bardot became a global star after appearing in “And God Created Woman” in 1956, and went on to appear in about 50 more movies before giving up acting in 1973.
She turned her back on celebrity to look after abandoned animals, saying she was “sick of being beautiful every day”.
President Emmanuel Macron called Bardot a “legend” of the 20th century.







“With her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials (BB), her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, and her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,” he wrote on X, referring to the female symbol of the French Republic.
“We mourn a legend of the century.”
Protecting animals
Bardot withdrew to her home in the Riviera resort of Saint-Tropez, where she devoted herself to fighting for animals.
Her calling apparently came when she encountered a goat on the set of her final film, “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot”.To save it from being killed, she bought the animal and kept it in her hotel room.
Bardot went on to found the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986, which now has 70,000 donors and around 300 employees, according to its website.
“I’m very proud of the first chapter of my life,” she told AFP in a 2024 interview ahead of her 90th birthday.
“It gave me fame, and that fame allows me to protect animals — the only cause that truly matters to me.” She added that she lived in “silent solitude” in her home, “La Madrague”, surrounded by nature and content to be “fleeing humanity”.
Hate speech
Unlike other beloved French New Wave stars, Bardot was a divisive figure who alienated many fans with her political views.
She was convicted five times for hate speech, mostly about Muslims, but also the inhabitants of the French island of Reunion, whom she described as “savages.”
A supporter of far-right politician Marine Le Pen, Bardot declared herself “against the Islamisation of France” in a 2003 book, citing “our ancestors, our grandfathers, our fathers have for centuries given their lives to push out successive invaders.”
Jordan Bardella, the head of Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, was among the first to pay homage.
“Today the French people have lost the Marianne they so loved, whose beauty astonished the world,” he wrote on X.
In her final book, Mon BBcedaire ( “My BB Alphabet “), published weeks before her death, she fired barbs at what she described as a “dull, sad, submissive” France and at her hometown of Saint-Tropez, now packed with the wealthy tourists she helped attract.

A statement issued by Sohrab Goth police said a crime scene unit had visited the site and further investigation was under way.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of the incident and sought details of the case from the East senior superintendent of police (SSP), a statement by the minister’s office said.
According to the statement, he directed the official to investigate the case from all angles.
The reasons behind the crime should be identified and suspects should be dealt with in accordance with the law, Lanjar was quoted as saying.
He added the suspects should be identified and arrested at the earliest.
Moreover, justice for the affected family and a transparent investigation into the matter should be ensured, he said.
The statement also quoted the East SSP as saying that in the initial stages, the case was being deemed to be that of suicide, but facts would become clear only after further assessment of evidence.
“Facts will be established soon in light of the post-mortem report, forensic report and other evidence,” he said.
Earlier this month, three women were found dead in an apartment in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal.

“The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Adil Farooq Raja has been demonstrating his sustained involvement in activities posing a serious threat to the security, integrity, and public order of Pakistan.
“He has consistently misused online platforms to promote, facilitate, and amplify anti-state narratives and propaganda associated with proscribed terrorist organisations, thereby acting in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and defence of Pakistan,” read the notification declaring the YouTuber a proscribed person.
The notification was issued by the interior ministry and is dated December 27.
It said, “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 11ee of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, the federal government is pleased to direct to list Mr Adil Farooq Raja in the Fourth Schedule to the said Act as a proscribed person for the purposes of the said Act.”
The notification was issued after the federal cabinet approved the summary for Raja‘s proscription, the summary for which had been submitted by the interior ministry on December 23.
The development came roughly 20 days after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi handed over the extradition papers for Raja — who has positioned himself as a whistleblower — former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar to UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott.
Prior to that, Naqvi had announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions.
Raja had reacted to the development in a post on X, saying: “They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing.”
On December 10, Raja had also been ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference.
In 2023, Raja was handed 14 years of jail sentence following his Field General Court Martial for “inciting sedition” and stripped of his military rank.
While the military’s media affairs wing did not directly link the convictions to the events of May 9, Raja and Mehdi had been accused by the Islamabad police of playing a significant role in fomenting rebellion and inciting attacks on military installations during widespread protests that followed PTI leader Imran Khan’s arrest on that day.</p><small>2025-12-28 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2813470560b2cf1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963728/zelensky-to-meet-trump-in-florida-for-talks-on-ukraine-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Zelensky to meet Trump in Florida for talks on Ukraine peace plan</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to hammer out a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face major differences on crucial issues and provocations from Russian air attacks.
Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelensky called it Russia’s response to the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts.
Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump’s Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.
The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X.
“Good evening, Florida!” Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the US president’s surname on the fuselage.







Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce.
The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.
Axios said US officials viewed Zelensky’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.
Zelensky’s in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1pm (11pm PKT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.
Sticking points over territory
Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.
While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.
The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.
Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km of its territory per day in 2025.
Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12pc of its territory, including about 90pc of Donbas, 75pc of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.
Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato.
Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members.
The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan, which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.
Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.
Canada, European allies rally behind Kyiv
Saturday’s air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelensky said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.
In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia”.
“The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83bn) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelensky along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained “a just and lasting peace” that preserved Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defence capabilities.

This global surge of democratic transitions was part of a framework postulated by the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. He categorised the global spread of democracy into three distinct historical periods: an initial wave beginning in the mid-1800s that stalled due to the rising tide of authoritarianism in the 1920s/30s; a second wave triggered by the end of World War II and lasting till the early 1960s; and a third wave beginning in the 1990s but one that prompted the hybrid classification, because many transitioning states remained suspended in a grey zone between full democracy and autocracy.
By the mid-2000s, a democratic recession marked by significant backsliding became evident, as many emerging democracies failed to consolidate and, instead, adopted hybrid models. While Western scholars often interpret this as a symptom of decline, an alternative perspective suggests the model acts as a vital deterrence against outright authoritarianism.
In Pakistan, the hybrid model’s legacy dates back to the late 1950s, when Gen Ayub Khan abrogated the Constitution and imposed the country’s first martial law. Gen Ayub transitioned from overt martial law to a ‘controlled democracy’ in 1962. Cornered by a powerful pro-democracy movement, Ayub was forced to resign in 1969, even though, the fact is, he only really did so after losing the institutional backing of his own institution — the military. As Stephen Cohen notes, this period deeply embedded militarism into Pakistan’s political fabric.

Pakistan’s hybrid regime has hardened into a lasting political order, where political parties and civilian leaders exist within carefully managed limits

Following the end of Gen Ziaul Haq’s military rule in 1988, this militarism evolved from direct intervention towards informal systemic control. This strategy was then refined after the 2008 collapse of Gen Pervez Musharraf’s military regime. The military establishment (ME) started to seek compatible civilian partners to formulate a sturdy hybrid system.
However, the refined model faced immediate challenges in the form of a struggling economy, Islamist militancy, and the resurgence of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). These two had a history of strained relations with the ME. After the 2008 elections, these parties successfully ousted Gen Musharraf, leading to heightened civil-military tensions.
Consequently, by 2010, the ME began cultivating Imran Khan as a ‘third alternative’, designed to be the centrepiece of a more manageable hybrid arrangement. Despite the PML-N’s landslide victory in 2013, the ME bolstered Khan’s populist street agitation by aligning the judiciary, media and wealthy donors behind his ‘cause’. The objective was to neutralise the PPP and PML-N with a ‘popular’ civilian frontman who would be easier to manage. This project reached its zenith in 2018, when Khan became prime minister.
But the project quickly unravelled, due to Khan’s lack of administrative experience and his inability to transition out of movement mode and mindset. He eventually became so enamoured with the state-sponsored narrative of his own popularity that he viewed himself as indestructible, even as governance declined. He began being seen as a liability by the ME, before being ousted in 2022 through an act of parliament.
So why did the ME persist with the hybrid model after the collapse of the Khan regime?



For the new ME leadership under Gen Asim Munir, the failure was one of personnel, not policy. The consensus seemed to be that many of Khan’s backers in the ME had been seduced by his populist appeal, neglecting the practicalities of governance and international relations. In the eyes of the new ME, the model was sound but had been poorly implemented by a civilian agent and his handlers, who were unable to manage the complexities of power.
Refining its approach, the new ME sought to recalibrate the hybrid model. It is likely that, by examining ‘successful’ hybrid systems in countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Russia, the ME opted to repair its fractured relationships with PML-N and the PPP. The goal was to replace the volatile populism of the previous hybrid model with a more pragmatic outlook, and action.

 

Due to their inherent adaptability, the durability of ‘successful’ hybrid regimes often surpasses that of rigid authoritarianism. By maintaining a degree of institutional flexibility, such as permitting elections or limited press freedom, hybrid regimes allow social frustrations to be vented without jeopardising their core authority.
Furthermore, the inclusion of opposition parties within parliamentary structures serves as a strategic tool for co-optation, effectively neutralising dissent by integrating potential dissenters into the state framework. Iranian political scientist Vida Yaghouti argues that, by incorporating elements of democratic participation, hybrid regimes diffuse social friction and effectively manage violent uprisings against the regime.
This strategic flexibility is bolstered by the preservation of established bureaucratic and security apparatuses, which function as stabilising anchors during bouts of economic instability or civil unrest. The centralisation of executive and legislative authority in hybrid regimes enables rapid policy formulation. By bypassing the deliberative processes inherent in traditional democracies, hybrid regimes can enact legislation and address national emergencies with greater expediency.
By projecting an image of institutional stability and decisive strength, hybrid regimes often present a more compelling profile to international partners than either dictatorships or fledgling, volatile democracies. Advocates of the hybrid model argue that, amidst global democratic backsliding and geopolitical instability, this model is indispensable for navigating complex transitions and sustaining fragile power balances between political and economic elites.
However, there is a counter-argument that posits that the hybrid model is no longer merely transitional. Far from a ‘stop-gap’, intended to guide fledgling democracies toward maturity, the model appears to be solidifying. As international and domestic pressures intensify, the hybrid regime is increasingly becoming a permanent, hardened fixture of the political landscape.
In the contemporary Pakistani landscape, the hybrid model has solidified into an entrenched, centrist-pragmatic and anti-populist apparatus. Within this framework, the ME functions as the primary engine, while civilian leaders are integrated based on their alignment with the system’s strategic goals.
Given current political and economic trajectories, this arrangement is poised to remain the country’s dominant political reality for the foreseeable future.

KARACHI: Seawater along Pakistan’s coast, especially Gwadar, Pasni, Jiwani and Ormara in Balochistan, has turned green by an algal bloom, marine experts reported on Saturday.
However, they declared that the bloom posed no toxic threat.
“Strong winds and ocean currents have pushed large quantities of algae toward near shores, also amassing rotting seaweeds, which has stunk up the beaches,” said Abdul Rahim, Deputy Director at the Gwadar Development Authority, adding the bloom was caused by a single-celled marine organism Noctiluca.
Algal blooms, he explained were rapid growths or gathering of algae in water bodies and they could cause red, brown, green or blue pigmentation in the water, depending on the type of algae.
According to the GDA official, the intensity of these blooms has increased over a decade along Balochistan’s coast.
Earlier, he pointed out, there was one bloom in one or two years but now the region was seeing two to three blooms in a year.
“This is happening all over the world and researchers have linked this change to the rapid warming of oceans, which is providing them with favourable conditions to grow.”
Muhammad Moazzam Khan, Technical Adviser at the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan, said the Noclituca bloom has also spread to neighbouring Iran. “This year, the bloom has started in Pakistani waters in November and spread along the Karachi coast. Currently, it exists in patches along the entire Pakistan coast, especially along the area between Pasni and Jiwani, where it’s dense.”
The occurrence of green blooms, he pointed out, along the coast of Pakistan wasn’t unusual.
“The organisation has been monitoring Noctiluca bloom since 2012 and reported its occurrence every year in winter (between November and February); however, in some years, such blooms are extensive and spread in vast areas along the coast of Pakistan,” he added.
“The winter bloom is a characteristic of the north Arabian Sea. There have been studies conducted by WWF-Pakistan, which indicate that the bloom is triggered by the spread of cold water from upwelling in some part of the Arabian Sea and its spread under the influence of eddy formation during this period,” Mr Khan said, adding: “Linking this bloom with Eutrophication is not scientifically substantiated. Noctiluca scintillans is a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.”
He added: “The current bloom poses no toxic threat, and no associated fish mortality has been reported along the coast. Regular observations since 2012 show that nearly all Noctiluca blooms along the Sindh and Balochistan coasts have been non-toxic.”
In 2017, the Noctiluca bloom was so intense that it covered the entire Arabian Sea, including Iran, Pakistan, India, Oman, and the Persian Gulf, he added.
While the current Noctiluca bloom is being misinterpreted in some reports and wrongly linked to pollution, WWF-Pakistan clarifies that this bloom is a naturally occurring oceanographic phenomenon and is not caused by pollution.
Along Pakistan’s coast, blooms are most often green or orange and can spread extensively depending on seasonal conditions.
Although the organism itself is not green, the colour comes from its internal symbiont, Protoeuglena noctilucae, which enables it to photosynthesize and grow rapidly. Because Noctiluca is naturally bioluminescent, its presence creates the glittering glow reported at night.

The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who enjoyed a heavy workload in the format this year, featuring in a record 34 T20Is — the most by any Pakistan player in a calendar year.
Shadab, 27, last played a T20I for Pakistan in June before undergoing shoulder surgery earlier this year. After completing a successful rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy, the leg-spinning all-rounder is currently in action in Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL), a factor that appears to have aided his return to international contention.
While Babar and Shaheen’s omission is notable, both players are also currently featuring in the BBL, and their absence is understood to be part of a broader rotation policy rather than a permanent exclusion. With the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup approaching, the selectors appear keen to assess different combinations and expand the pool of players available for the global event.
Another notable inclusion is uncapped wicketkeeper-batter Khawaja Nafay. The 23-year-old, who has been part of the Pakistan Shaheens set-up, has played 32 T20 matches and scored at a strike rate of 132.81, earning his first senior call-up.
Pakistan are scheduled to depart for Sri Lanka in the first week of January, with all three T20Is to be played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium in Dambulla on January 7, 9 and 11.
The series forms part of Pakistan’s preparations for the T20 World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8. Pakistan are set to play all their World Cup fixtures in Colombo.

Tajikistan announced on Thursday that three members of a “terrorist” group had crossed into the Central Asian country “illegally” at Khatlon province, which borders Afghanistan.
Tajik security forces killed the trio, but two border guards also died in the clash, the Tajik national security committee said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said on Saturday that “we have started serious investigations into” the recent “incidents” on Tajik soil.
“I spoke to the foreign minister of Tajikistan and we are working together to prevent such incidents,” he told an event in Kabul.
“We are worried that some malicious circles want to destroy the relations between two neighbouring countries,” the minister added, without elaborating.
Tajikistan shares a mountainous border of about 1,350 kilometres with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities, who returned to power in 2021.
Unlike other Central Asian leaders, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, who has been in power since 1992, has criticised the Taliban and urged them to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan.
At least five Chinese nationals were killed and several wounded in two separate attacks along the border with Afghanistan in late November and early December, according to Tajik authorities.
According to a UN report in December, the jihadist group Jamaat Ansarullah “has fighters spread across different regions of Afghanistan” with a primary goal “to destabilise the situation in Tajikistan”.

The statements came a day after reported Saudi air strikes on separatist positions in Yemen’s Hadramawt province — and after Washington called for restraint in the rapidly escalating conflict.
General Turki al-Malki, the spokesman for the coalition, said they would act “directly and at the appropriate moment… to protect civilian life”, according to the Saudi news agency SPA.
Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman posted on X that troops from the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) should “peacefully hand over” two regional governorates to the government.

Rubio calls for restraint, diplomatic efforts on Yemen

“It’s time,” he posted, “at this sensitive moment, to let reason prevail by withdrawing from the two provinces and doing so peacefully.”







The STC had warned on Friday that they were undeterred after strikes blamed on Saudi Arabia hit their positions, in the latest escalation since they seized large swathes of territory in the Hadramawt and Mahrah provinces.
There were no immediate reports of casualties in the strikes. In recent weeks, separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates and seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen have made territorial gains.
On Saturday, hundreds of Yemeni tribesmen gathered in Aden to ask the STC’s leaders to announce the independence of South Yemen, according to the separatist-affiliated Aden Independent Channel.
The channel aired footage of a large crowd marching and waving the South Yemen independence flag alongside the UAE’s flag.
Experts say their successes have embarrassed regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, the main backer of the internationally-recognised Yemeni government.
Farea al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House think tank in London, said that the STC had crossed Riyadh’s “red lines” and that the situation could quickly get worse.
“It is one bad thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia. And it is another much worse thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia publicly. And that’s exactly what they did,” he said.
US urges restraint
In Washington, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “We urge restraint and continued diplomacy, with a view to reaching a lasting solution.”
Following Friday’s raids, Yemen’s government urged the Saudi-led coalition to support its forces in Hadramawt, after separatists seized most of the country’s largest province.
The government asked the coalition to “take all necessary military measures to protect innocent Yemeni civilians in Hadramawt province and support the armed forces”, the official Yemeni news agency said.
A Yemeni military official said that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were amassed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.
The areas where they were deployed are located at the edges of territory seized in recent weeks by the UAE-backed STC.
“We have not received military instructions to move towards the two provinces,” the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Separatist advances have added pressure on ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which support rival groups within Yemen’s government.

In absolute terms, the trade gap with the Middle East widened to $5.948 billion in July-November from $5.514bn in the same period last year, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
In FY25, the deficit with the region increased 7.37pc to $13.974bn from $13.014bn in the preceding year. The swelling trade deficit is a cause for concern among policymakers, primarily due to the rising influx of petroleum products from the region.
The increase was noted in imports from the region, reflecting higher oil imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), followed by Saudi Arabia and other countries.
Exports to the Middle East fell 9.85pc to $1.217bn in 5MFY26 from $1.350bn over the corresponding months of last year. In FY25, exports to the Middle East fell 1.52pc to $3.107bn from $3.155bn over the same period last year.
At the same time, Pakistan’s imports from the Middle East saw an increase of 4.39pc to $7.166bn in 5MFY26 from $6.864bn over the corresponding months of last year. In FY25, imports surged 5.64pc to $17.081bn from $16.169bn over the same period last year.
Pakistan has recently signed a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to minimise its trade imbalance with the region. Demand for Pakistani products in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) declined during the period under review.
Exports to Saudi Arabia fell 10.41pc to $272.232m in July-November FY26 from $303.858m over the same months last year. The imports from the kingdom saw an increase of 6.66pc to $1.596bn against $1.496bn in the same period last year.
Exports to the UAE declined 9.99pc to $833.365m in 5MFY26 from $925.940m over the last year. Pakistan’s top export products to the UAE include rice, bovine carcasses, men’s and boys’ cotton ensembles, guavas and mangoes.

The unexpected move by the Evacuee Property Trust Board (EPTB) to take over the KCE premises has forced the closure of an institution that had remained operational for 52 years, affecting around 320 registered cotton brokers.
Brokers say they are incurring losses running into billions of rupees due to the complete halt in trading, while the textile industry, particularly spinning mills, is struggling to obtain working capital from banks because cotton rates are unavailable.
No cotton spot rates have been issued since the EPTB took possession of the building on Dec 12. The cotton and cotton-based textile sector contributes about 60 per cent to the country’s export earnings and provides up to 70 per cent of direct and indirect employment nationwide.
“I do not understand why the federal government and the finance minister have not intervened to resolve this issue,” said a senior broker, requesting anonymity.
Brokers warned that if the KCE closure persists, it could trigger a crisis across the textile sector, severely undermining export targets and overall GDP growth.
“It is incomprehensible why policymakers allowed such a drastic action, the confiscation of the building, and have shown no urgency in resolving an issue that is fast turning into a crisis,” the broker said.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Karachi Cotton Association could not be reached for comment. He has neither responded to calls nor publicly spoken against the takeover of the KCE premises.

On Saturday, the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates hit a new all time high of Rs407,803 and Rs475,662, up by Rs1,972 and Rs2,300 from Friday, respectively.
As per data rates issued by All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, domestic prices had risen as a result of continuous rally in world gold price which rose by $23 to $4,533 per ounce.
The country’s gold jewellery export had plunged into crisis owing to the abrupt suspension of SRO760 on May 6. After hectic efforts by the stakeholders, the Ministry of Commerce on Nov 21, 2025 had issued an SRO 2198 (I) 2025 by allowing import of gold and jewellery exports after a lapse of over six months.

The SRO said the period of suspension so far under SRO760 was “accordingly condoned”, thereby enabling exporters to avail the mandatory entitlement period of 120 days under the entrustment scheme.
Despite allowing import/export of gold and jewellery, the data of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) pointed out nil import of gold in November while jewellery exports had been struggling to pick up pace. From July to November 2025, jewellery exports during 5MFY26 fell by 97pc to only $113,000 from $8.2m in the same period last fiscal.
Former chairman Pakistan Gems and Jewellery Traders and Exporters Association, Habib ur Rahman told Dawn on Saturday that gold imports have resumed from December with the arrival of 15kg while jewellery exports in December stood at around 50kg. Jewellery exports are being made to the USA, the UK and Dubai.
On January 1, 2025, the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates were Rs234,568 and Rs273,600 based on the global gold rate of $2,624 per ounce. Till to date, the price of 10-gram and one-tola have surged by Rs177,235 and Rs202,062, respectively, while international price swelled by $1,909 per ounce.
According to Topline Securities, gold delivered an exceptional higher return of almost 74pc in 2025 as compared to other select asset classes.
The KSE 100 index recorded the second largest increase among various select asset classes, rising by 48pc (Jan 1 to Dec 24) with four trading sessions left in 2025. The gain is inclusive of dividends received during this period.
Historically, real estate has been one of the preferred investment option in Pakistan. Commercial and residential plot prices of DHA Karachi and DHA Lahore on average increased by 18pc and 15pc, respectively, according to Zameen.com, while houses prices in DHA Karachi and DHA Lahore on an average rose by eight per cent.
Topline said Naya Pakistan Pak Rupee Certificates under the Roashan Digital Account generated a return of 22pc in 2025. Rates were revised later in March to 13pc while Naya Pakistan US dollar certificate earned a return of 10pc.
Wthin fixed income market, average bank saving rates remained 9pc while 3-year Special Saving Certificate provided 12pc gain. PIBs delivered a 14pc and T-bill yielded 12pc in 2025.

KARACHI: The first half of the current fiscal year saw the rupee post a net gain against the US dollar of Rs5.066, or 1.8 per cent, although it remains weaker than its level at the beginning of 2025.
The dollar closed at Rs280.13 in the interbank market on Friday compared to Rs285.22 on July 2, 2025. However, the rupee is still below its level on Jan 3, 2025, when the dollar traded at Rs278.56.
Currency market participants said the exchange rate remained “managed” but noted that the recent appreciation had helped stabilise the market and provided greater confidence for exporters and importers.
In a report issued on Saturday, Tresmark CEO Faisal Mamsa said the rupee’s behaviour often defies traditional valuation models because it moves in “regime shifts”, not smooth cycles.
“This history explains why models such as PPP, BEER or even simplified REER frameworks struggle with PKR. They assume stable policy regimes, political stability and continuous calibration. But PKR operates in regime shifts, not smooth cycles,” he wrote.
PPP refers to Purchasing Power Parity, which compares price levels to estimate a fair exchange rate, while BEER (the Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate) uses economic fundamentals such as productivity and interest-rate differentials to gauge a currency’s value.
“Valuation matters in normal times. But at moments that define PKR’s trajectory, sentiment and policy dominate valuation. That is when these models offer false comfort,” Mr Mamsa said.
Reviewing major episodes in 2008, 2018 and 2022, he said past crises were typically triggered by factors outside the foreign exchange market, including political instability and policy paralysis, oil price spikes and inflation surges, geopolitical shocks and IMF programme disruptions.
“In each case, the initial trigger came from outside the FX (foreign exchange) market. The rupee was not the cause, it became the transmission channel,” he said.
Several currency analysts expect renewed dollar strength in calendar year 2026 despite higher foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan, arguing that reserves alone may not offset widening trade and current account pressures, which have already started showing spikes in FY26.

 

They noted that import compression in November helped deliver a current account surplus but warned that further cuts could weigh on economic growth. Weak GDP growth has become a challenge for a government seeking to attract both foreign and domestic investment, they said.
“Further import cuts could bring another year of poor growth, around 2 per cent, increasing poverty without addressing the serious problem of joblessness,” said Atif Ahmed, a banker and currency expert in the interbank market.
Mr Mamsa said the rupee’s trajectory in 2026 would be driven less by valuation gaps and more by a set of structural forces, including inflation and interest-rate differentials, political continuity and policy credibility, external financing capacity and fiscal discipline, reserve accumulation behaviour, oil prices and export competitiveness, and geopolitical developments and global recession risks.
“These factors do not point to a single number. They determine the path the rupee takes, how volatile it becomes and whether deviations are absorbed or allowed to compound. For Pakistan, crises have never been about the endpoint alone, but more about how the path was managed,” he said.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on Saturday went beyond mere condemnation of the recently promulgated Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, cautioning the Punjab government against implementing what it described as the “unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.
Presided over by Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, the outgoing PBC cabinet unanimously demanded that the Punjab government immediately recall the law and tender an apology to the Lahore High Court (LHC) for what it termed “insulting remarks and a rude attitude”.
The PBC — the apex body regulating the legal fraternity — reiterated that lawyers stand firmly with the LHC and will not allow anyone to compromise the integrity of the judiciary.
The council warned that if corrective measures were not taken within a few days, the lawyer’s community would be compelled to launch a movement on the issue.
On December 22, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspended the operation of the law and announced that the matter would be heard and decided by a full bench of the court.
The controversy surrounding the newly enacted law further intensified on Dece­mber 24, when various lawyers’ associations — irrespective of political affiliation — endorsed the Lahore High Court’s intervention to suspend its implementation.
During its 247th meeting, held at the Supreme Court Building in Islamabad on Saturday, the PBC passed a resolution on the issue in addition to conducting other agenda items.
The unanimous resolution rejected and disapproved the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
The resolution also condemned the Punjab government for passing the Act, stating that it was unconstitutional, unlawful, and in conflict with the provisions of the Qanoon-i-Shahadat, Civil Procedure Code (CPC), Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), Evidence Act, Illegal Dispossession Act, and other relevant laws, thereby rendering their provisions redundant. The council noted that the matter had been challenged and that the LHC had rightly suspended its implementation.
The council commended and appreciated the LHC chief justice for passing a timely order, observing that the newly enactment compromised established and settled legal principles governing property matters.
The resolution expressed concern that the law had created a parallel system of jurisprudence whereby property disputes would be resolved by deputy commissioners, district police officers, revenue officers, and other government officials instead of courts — a practice it termed wholly unlawful.

 

The PBC further observed that the new law dismantled the civil judicial system, civil rights, and judicial supremacy, as it allowed a revenue officer to hand over possession of property even when the matter was pending before a civil court, suggesting an attempt by certain elements to concentrate all powers, including judicial authority.
The resolution regretted that the Pun­jab government had allegedly resorted to trolling and propaganda against the LHC chief justice and the judiciary. As a result, the council condemned what it described as an onslaught against the LHC following the suspension of the Act.
The council also expressed grave concern over the conduct of the Punjab government, regretting that the province’s chief executive appeared to be surrounded by aides protecting the interests of land mafias and grabbers, alleging that the Act was passed to safeguard those interests.
The resolution emphasised that it was incumbent upon the judiciary to curb and address such unlawful practices in the interest of justice, transparency, and equity, as reflected in the LHC’s order.
It further stated that the judiciary has the constitutional mandate to interpret laws, and that the LHC chief justice had rightly suspended an enactment that undermined judicial authority.

• Pact halts troop movement, promises return of captured soldiers• UN, China welcome step following breakdown of October ceasefire
BANGKOK: Thailand and Cambodia agreed to an “immediate” ceasefire on Saturday, pledging in a joint statement to end heavy border clashes that have killed at least 47 people and displaced more than a million.
The truce took effect after a declaration signed by the neighbours’ defense ministers at a border checkpoint on the Thai side. The agreement applies to “all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas”.
The three weeks of fighting, which utilised artillery, tanks, drones and jets, had spread to nearly every border province. The violence shattered a previous truce brokered in October, for which US President Donald Trump had taken credit.
Thai Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit described the initial three-day window as an “observation period to confirm that the ceasefire is real”.
“A door to a peaceful resolution,” Nattaphon called the agreement in a speech on Saturday.
Under the terms of the deal, both sides agreed to freeze troop movements and allow civilians in border areas to return home. The nations also pledged to cooperate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime. Additionally, Thailand agreed to return 18 captured Cambodian soldiers within 72 hours.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the announcement “as a positive step towards alleviating the suffering of civilians … and creating an environment conducive to achieving lasting peace,” according to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
The conflict is rooted in a long-standing territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of the 800-kilometre border, where both nations claim ancient temples based on a vague 1907 French map.
Official tallies indicate at least 25 Thai soldiers and one Thai civilian were killed in the recent hostilities.
Cambodia, facing a military with superior firepower, reported 21 civilian deaths. Phnom Penh has reported no military deaths, though an official Facebook post showed first lady Pich Chanmony atte­nding a funeral for troops.

 

This ceasefire follows three days of talks convened after a crisis meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
International powers also pressed for a resolution. In Beijing, the foreign ministry stated that the ceasefire “demonstrates that dialogue and consultations are a realistic and effective way of resolving complex disputes”.
China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, is scheduled to host the Cambodian and Thai foreign ministers for talks in Yunnan province on Jan 28-29.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk said he hoped the ceasefire “will pave the way for confidence building and peace”.
Despite the halt in combat, the countries still must resolve the border demarcation. An earlier agreement in October, witnessed by Trump, broke down within months as each side accused the other of instigating fresh violence.

THE year 2025 will be remembered in Islamabad and Was­hington as a period of surprising warmth in bilateral ties, marked by high-level engagement, strategic recalibrations, and complex regional developments.
After years of drift, Pakistan-US relations saw a notable thaw, but beneath the optimism lies a layered and complex reality shaped by history, personalities, and shifting global alignments — prompting analysts to urge restraint in reading the moment as a lasting reset.
The year’s diplomacy pivoted with an unprecedented White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, widely viewed as a game-changer. The meeting set the tone for renewed engagement and discussions on trade, security, and regional diplomacy.
Sherry Rehman, federal minister and former ambassador to Washington, described the shift as personality-driven but consequential.
“In both countries, particularly in Washington, leading personalities have swung the pendulum back toward a warming of ties,” she said.
She noted that the “Trump-Munir bromance” was a key ingredient in reshaping the dynamic, while other strategic plays had also tilted the graph to an upward trend.

 

Ms Rehman noted that the relationship would be best served by embedding it in the firm ground of strong commercial and economic ties.
She highlighted the US investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector as a potential anchor for long-term engagement.
“The scale of investments, their contractual longevity, and capacity to generate local jobs will be critical in determining the trajectory of ties.”
On broader foreign policy, she noted: “Pakistan’s interests will be best realised by maintaining a classic policy balance amid growing multipolarity and conflict in global affairs.”
She added that Islamabad should continue retaining its “bedrock friendship” with Beijing while avoiding being caught in any zero-sum competition arising between two leading global powers.
War and US’s statements
The May 2025 India-Pakistan air war injected urgency to US’s engagement with Islamabad.
In the aftermath of the ceasefire, President Trump publicly highlighted Islamabad’s role in preventing the escalation to a wider conflict.
Pakistan also recognised President Trump’s role in averting a nuclear crisis in South Asia and nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize.
Analysts noted that President Trump’s repeated public commendations — reportedly over 30 mentions of Pakistan’s performance — strengthened Islamabad’s diplomatic standing.
“A new president was more open and realised that Pakistan could play a role in furthering American strategic interests in both the economic and security domains,” said Uzair Yunus, a Washington-based South Asia analyst.
The broader context included US-India tensions over trade, tariffs, and New Delhi’s growing ties with Russia. These frictions, combined with the US’s focus on Pakistan’s stabilising role in South Asia, increased Islamabad’s leverage in Washington’s strategic calculus.
Regional diplomacy
The Trump administration also highlighted Pakistan’s potential role in the Middle East, including possible participation in a Gaza peace force and mediation in Iran-related initiatives. While the force is still being finalised, discussions underscore its emerging relevance.
Ms Rehman warned that regional volatility would test Islamabad’s diplomacy. While Pakistan’s hard power, demonstrated in the May conflict, had altered perceptions of it as a middle power, she said the real challenge lay in navigating partnerships without comp­­­romising core foreign policy values or domestic priorities.
Caution urged
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Washington, London, and the UN, urged caution against overreading recent developments.
“The recent warmth shows that a hopeful beginning has been made for a reset in Pak-US ties,” she said, “but one should avoid hastily concluding ties are on a sustainable upswing.”
She noted that the current turnaround rested heavily on a personalised relationship between Trump and Pakistan’s army chief, making it short-term.
“Durable relations are built on shared interests and convergences bet­ween countries,” she added.
“I see the hybrid government’s US policy predicated on sycophancy, sweetheart business deals, and willingness to fall in line with Trump’s Middle East agenda.”
Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, echoed the need for realism.
He noted that while the resurgence in bilateral ties was certainly one of Islamabad’s biggest surprises this year, it was important not to overstate the resurgence.
He noted that beyond a few memorandums on critical minerals and limited counterterrorism cooperation, substantive collaboration remained modest.
Looking ahead
Ms Rehman emphasised the domestic angle, stressing the importance of transparency, skills development, and social inclusion in managing international investment.
She also highlighted people-to-people ties, noting that even during downturns, travel, cultural exchanges, and diaspora links had sustained the relationship.
In the end, 2025 might not mark a full revamp of ties between the two countries, but it stands out as the year both sides found enough common ground to try again — a meaningful step for a relationship long defined by cycles of tension and rapprochement.

Strip away the action, and Avatar is about overcoming odds, keeping the family together, forgiveness and redemption, with a little bit of unexpected magic near the climax. Isn’t that exactly what a Christmas movie is all about?
In Fire and Ash, the magic comes courtesy of Eywa, the spirit of the alien planet Pandora that resides in everything and commands the wildlife. One connects to Eywa through tendril-like organic connections called “queues” at the end of Na’vi hair, which provide neural links to control animals and access the spirit realm, where souls of every dead person on Pandora reside (after their bodies are absorbed into Eywa’s soil).
A happy family reunion of glowing auras, warmth and forgiveness with those who’ve passed away occurs early and late in the movie — but a good three hours before that, writer-director-producer James Cameron lets hell loose on the Sully family… which they should have grownaccustomed to by now.
Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) was once a paraplegic marine who took on the artificial alien Na’vi body (his “Avatar”), when his identical brother passed away. Since then, Eywa has made his artificial body real.

Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film of the series,plays as an extension of the first, with a bigger, better villain, a stronger character and story arc

Married and with kids, Jake, like every dad in the universe, has his hands full. His young son Lo’ak (Britain Dalton) remains unruly and something of an irresponsible nincompoop when it comes to obeying house rules and orders. His adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) cannot connect to Eywa because of her artificial origins. Jake’s other adopted son, Spider (Jack Champion) — the human son of his enemy Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) — lives in a perpetual state of danger; since Pandora’s air is lethal to humans, he’s always one oxygen mask away from certain death. 



 
As if breathing weren’t Spider’s only concern, his adopted mother Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) still doesn’t “see” (ie acknowledge) him. In fact, she’d happily see Spider drop dead (she’s a racist who hates humans), while his actual father, Quaritch, still wants him back.
Then there are the tensions with the reef-dwelling Na’vi clan Metkayina who, despite accepting Jake and his family as refugees and acknowledging them as saviours, still consider their ways alien and hostile. 
The clan, led by Tonowari and his pregnant wife Ronal (Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet, respectively), also believe Payakan — one of the intelligent, whale-like Tulkun — is a threat to peace. As in The Way of Water, the Tulkun are hunted by humans for their brains, which produce a rare, expensive anti-ageing liquid.
Quaritch, meanwhile, finds an ally in Varang (Oona Chaplin), the fierce, vengeful and unhinged leader of the Ash tribe. Varang is a cruel, calculating villain — and one of the best things about Fire and Ash.
For the most part, the third Avatar film plays as an extension of the first, with a bigger, better villain, a stronger character and story arc, clearer motives for Jake, and expansive worldbuilding. We see new tribes, new creatures, and a plot point pushed firmly to the forefront for future instalments to exploit and derive conflict from. Everything is expertly laid out in a semi-fast-paced, three-hour-10-minute-long film that’s a feast for the eyes and — most importantly — never boring.
Cameron, who co-writes the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, positions the film as a grand spectacle, placing action at the spearhead. Every story beat leads into an action sequence, followed by solid, character-driven drama. The grand climax runs a staggering 36 minutes, yet somehow the length and quality of the big action sequence — and Fire and Ash as a whole — pale slightly when compared to The Way of Water.



 
Both films are enormous in scope but — and this may be entirely subjective — the previous instalment took its time to stop and smell the roses. Fire and Ash’s quieter moments, effective as they are, often feel like rehashes of what we’ve already seen.
One wants a little more from the story — though that may be asking too much, especially when the film is visibly chopped down in the edit to avoid a four-hour runtime (notice the many small, abrupt trimmings and jump cuts). Even so, Cameron and his technical team have somehow found a way to inject greater emotional nuance into their performance capture. Of course, the visuals are fantastic.

His death marks the passing of a particular species of politician — less ideological than instinctive, less rhetorical than tactical — who thrived in the interstices of power rather than at its commanding heights.
Wattoo was never the face of a movement, nor the author of a grand political vision. Yet, for decades, he remained relevant in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous and politically decisive province, precisely because he understood how power there actually worked. He belonged to a generation shaped by instability. 
Born in Okara district, in the fertile plains of central Punjab, Wattoo came of age in a Pakistan where democracy was episodic and political loyalty was often provisional. Coups, dissolutions of assemblies and abrupt changes of regime were not aberrations but recurring features of national life.
In such a setting, political survival required adaptability, a strong local base and a keen sense of timing. Wattoo possessed all three. Unlike dynastic politicians whose surnames opened doors, he built his career from the constituency upwards. 

Mian Manzoor Wattoo, the former Punjab chief minister who passed away December 16, had mastered the art of political endurance. His life offers a lens through which to understand how power actually works in Pakistani politics

A MASTER OF RETAIL POLITICS
Rural Punjab politics is intimate and transactional: voters expect access, mediation and tangible benefits rather than abstract promises. Wattoo excelled at this retail politics. His influence rested less on charisma than on networks — of biradari [kinship], local notables and bureaucratic intermediaries. He cultivated them patiently, and they repaid him with loyalty when it mattered most.
Wattoo’s rise to national prominence came during one of Pakistan’s most chaotic democratic interludes. The early 1990s were marked by a relentless tug-of-war between elected governments and the presidency, backed by an assertive establishment. 
Nawaz Sharif’s first government collapsed in 1993 amid institutional paralysis. It was in this vacuum that Wattoo emerged as a compromise choice for chief minister of Punjab. He did not represent a sweeping mandate; he represented feasibility. As chief minister, his style was cautious and conciliatory. Punjab’s administration, vast and deeply entrenched, often overwhelms its political masters.
Wattoo did not attempt to bend it dramatically to his will. Instead, he sought workable accommodations, keeping the machinery of government running while Islamabad convulsed. His tenure was brief and lacked headline-grabbing reforms but, in a period when paralysis was the norm, continuity itself counted as an achievement. 
That episode cemented Wattoo’s reputation as a political fixer — someone who could assemble numbers when arithmetic mattered more than ideology. Over the years, he aligned himself with multiple political platforms, most notably the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). His long association with the PPP was pragmatic rather than romantic.
OPERATING IN THE GREY ZONE
Wattoo was useful to the party in Punjab, where it often struggled against more entrenched rivals, and the party was useful to him as a national vehicle. When circumstances changed, so did his positioning. This flexibility earned him criticism. 
Detractors accused him of opportunism and of embodying the transactional politics that has long weakened Pakistan’s party system. Admirers countered that he was a realist, navigating an unforgiving landscape. In a country where elected governments have repeatedly been cut short, ideological purity can be politically suicidal. Wattoo chose endurance over martyrdom.
Wattoo was comfortable operating in the grey zone between formal party politics and informal power. He understood bureaucrats, courted electables and maintained lines of communication across political divides. Unlike flamboyant populists, he rarely courted controversy. His public persona was understated, his speeches workmanlike. Influence, for him, was something to be exercised quietly, often away from cameras. 
That discretion helped him persist while more strident figures flared and faded. Yet his career also reveals the limitations of such an approach. 
THE LIMITS OF TACTICAL BRILLIANCE
Wattoo never converted his tactical skills into a lasting institutional legacy. He did not create a durable political faction bearing his imprint, nor did he champion a transformative policy agenda for Punjab. His impact was situational rather than structural, strongest in moments of uncertainty and weakest when politics stabilised around dominant leaders. 
Still, Wattoo remained electorally resilient. Time and again, he returned to office, buoyed by his constituency connections and his reputation as a dependable intermediary. For voters in Okara and beyond, he was less a national statesman than a local patron — someone who could navigate the corridors of power on their behalf. In Pakistan’s political economy, that role is often more valued than lofty rhetoric.
In his later years, Wattoo witnessed a profound transformation in Pakistani politics. The rise of mass-mediated populism, the centrality of television studios and social media, and the sharpening of ideological polarisation left little room for his quieter style. 
Politics grew louder, faster and more absolutist. Yet, even as he receded from the foreground, his counsel was sought by younger politicians, eager to understand an older grammar of power — one based on negotiation rather than confrontation. His life offers a lens through which to view Pakistan’s democratic evolution. 
Figures like Wattoo rarely inspire hagiographies, but they perform a stabilising function in fragile systems. They absorb shocks, broker compromises and keep institutions functioning when formal rules falter. That such skills are necessary at all is itself an indictment of Pakistan’s political volatility. 
Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo was neither a hero nor a villain. He was, above all, a survivor — adept at reading the moment, adjusting his stance and remaining relevant in a shifting landscape. As Pakistan continues to debate how to strengthen its democracy and deepen its parties, his passing serves as a reminder of an era when politics was practised less as performance and more as patient brokerage.
He is survived by his family and by a political tradition he exemplified: pragmatic, unsentimental and deeply attuned to the realities of power in Punjab. Whether that tradition is fading or merely adapting remains an open question.

The Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir was assassinated in a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering.
The Sindh government announced a public holiday today to commemorate Benazir’s death anniversary. Foolproof security for the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto’s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.

 

Speaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own.
“If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights.”







“We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.”
Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.
“We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.”
Bilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.
“We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.”



On his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation. He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country’s current political crisis.
The Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon “political extremism” for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward.







He said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party’s supporters.
“Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.”
President Zardari says PPP always ready to defend Pakistan
In his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination.
He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious.







“Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.”
He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”.
‘Unity over division’
In an earlier message on his wife’s death anniversary, the president said: “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.”
He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”.
“She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said.
“On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,“ he added.







Recalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: “In a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples’ right to choose their representatives.
“Her repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,” he asserted.
“She gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,” the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir’s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife.
“Her courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,” he further said, adding that Benazir’s assassination was a “reminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity”.

 

“For the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government’s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare.







Bilawal, in a message released by the PPP yesterday, said his mother’s “supreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender”.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,” he was quoted as saying.
Reaffirming the PPP’s unwavering commitment to Benazir’s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women’s empowerment and the protection of minorities.
“We bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,” the PPP scion said.







Bilawal went on to say that Benazir’s vision of a “peaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth”.
He noted that as the premier, his mother “pursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan’s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country’s progressive and dignified image internationally”.
Benazir‘s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who paid a visit to her mother’s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: “Today we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.
“She lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.”
Aseefa further said, “In every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.”







Senator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir “never wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan”.
“Despite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,” Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari.







Govt delegation to attend gathering at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh
Meanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir’s death anniversary.
The delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership.







In a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, “Today we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan’s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.”
He said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state.
“Her sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,“ he said.</p><small>2025-12-27 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27160819f582a60.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963564/former-sbp-governor-dr-shamshad-akhtar-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Former SBP governor Dr Shamshad Akhtar passes away</strong></a><br><p>Renowned economist and former State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Dr Shamshad Akhtar, 71, passed away due to cardiac arrest on Saturday.
