They said that the attack occurred at 8am on the Saddar-Kohat Road. They said that the khawarij first carried out a suicide attack on the gate of the FC headquarters.
After the suicide blast, the khawarij tried to enter the building but were killed, they said. They added that three FC men were killed in the incident, while two others were injured.
Security forces have surrounded the area and a clearance operation is being carried out, they said.
Earlier, Peshawar Capital City Police Officer Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad had told Dawn that the headquarters was under attack and the area was being cordoned off.
Meanwhile, an emergency was declared at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar’s largest public sector hospital, and Khyber Teaching Hospital.
LRH Spokesperson Muhammad Asim said that all the injured brought to the hospital, which included six civilians, were all stable.
The civilian paramilitary force, originally called Fron­tier Constabulary, was renamed by the government in July. The headquarters of the force is located in a crowded area, close to a military cantonment.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
In September, six soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the FC Headquarters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
According to the military, the attack was carried out by Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khwarij. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.

The JI leader Engr Hafiz Naeemur Rehman announced the movement while addressing the final session of the magnificent event that hosted delegates from over 45 countries.
Speaking on the occasion, Engr Naeemur Rehman announced that under the movement rallies, marches and sit-ins will be held across the country.
 






Calling for political reforms, he said that powers should not rest with the bureaucracy but with local governments. He said empowered local governments is the need of the hour and the crucial demand of the movement.
He instructed the party’s provincial leadership in Punjab to begin a movement for local body elections, stating that this is not just Punjab’s issue but that of the entire country.
 
 

He said that in Sindh, KP, and Balochistan too, the elite class has captured all powers, and a movement is needed against this. “The local government system is the need of the time and our principal demand. The success of Jamaat-e-Islami is a need for Pakistan.”
He further announced that under the “Change the System” movement, five million new members would be added and 15,000 public committees created. He demanded constitutional protection for the local government system and instructed the Punjab leadership to prepare for a sit-in in front of the provincial assembly.
Rejecting the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments, he said: “We will strongly resist every attempt to deface the 1973 Constitution. We will not allow elections to be hijacked at any cost.”
He said the JI did not accept banning political parties; nor should TLP be banned; neither should Imran Khan be kept in jail for political reasons.

The rate of offloaded passengers from certain cities, age groups and specific destinations has seen a surge during the last couple of months. However, theheightened alertness by the immigration staff is irritating for genuine businessmen and tourists.
An official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said that the Immigration authorities had identified a group of passengers traveling by flight number FZ316 to African country Djibouti via Dubai (United Arab Emirates) from Sialkot Airport.
 
 

Adding, he said that the passengers namely Tassawar Abbas, Muhammad Siddique, Baber Hussain, Muhammad Saleem, Akhlaq Ahmed, Muqarrabul Hassan, Muhammad Talha, Imran Sikandar and Usman Ali could not satisfy the immigration officials about the purpose of their travel.
During further investigation, they revealed that they had struck a deal with human traffickers and agents in Rs 4.2million each to send them Italy via Libyan Coast on ship as they had to reach Libya after reaching Djibouti.
The offloaded passengers belonged to Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Faisalabad and Sheikhupura districts of Punjab. The passengers were later handed over to the FIA Composite Circle, Gujranwala, for further legal action.
On the other hand a number of genuine businessmen and tourists have lodged a strong protest against the `harsh policy’ to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
President of Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters by the GtCCI.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
Some overseas Pakistanis too have lodged such complaints at the Sialkot and other airports.
President of Uk-Pak Businessmen Chamber Rashid Khan, while speaking to chamber members last week, had narrated his ordeal at the hands of Sialkot Airport staff and lodged strong protest against what he termed a discouraging attitude which should be noticed by the higher authorities.
Some other expatriate Pakistanis belonging to Gujrat region have also complained about the current policy of offloading passengers.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, Gujranwala FIA zone director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.

But it did this without any input from Palestinians. Hamas rejected the resolution saying it fails to meet Palestinian rights and demands and “imposes a mechanism to achieve the [Israeli] occupation’s objectives”.
The resolution can only be implemented if Hamas signs up to it. This means complex negotiations lie ahead if the plan is to progress beyond the present ceasefire, which is being violated daily by Israeli forces, who have also been crossing the ‘yellow line’. This has taken the Palestinian death toll to almost 70,000 in the two-year genocidal war imposed by Israel.
The UNSC resolution is short on specifics and ambiguous in key areas. It ignores all previous resolutions on Palestine. It authorises the creation of a vaguely defined transitional governance body, the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump and members decided by him, to oversee a Palestinian “technocratic” committee responsible for day-to-day running of Gaza. It also authorises the BoP to establish a temporary multinational international stabilisation force (ISF) “to deploy under unified command acceptable to the BoP”.
This will not be a UN peacekeeping mission nor be overseen by the UN. Its mandate is unclear and details are lacking on its scope and structure. It is however tasked to “demilitarise the Gaza Strip” and carry out “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, including Hamas.
The original US draft made no reference to Palestinian statehood. But at the insistence of Muslim countries, the final resolution mentions a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. But this is wrapped in so many conditions that it denudes it of real meaning. Weak Arab negotiators failed to get a firm commitment to a Palestinian state in the resolution. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains firmly opposed to any Palestinian state.
The UNSC resolution was welcomed across the world as a step towards peace despite concerns of many countries and Council members, including Pakistan, about its lack of clarity in core areas. China and Russia, who abstained on the vote, both voiced concern about the vague nature of key elements, lack of Palestinian participation and absence of commitment to a two-state solution.

It would be a mistake for Pakistan to send troops for the stabilisation force in Gaza.

China’s ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, said the resolution “does not [reflect] the fundamental principle of Palestinians governing Palestine”. Russia’s UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, described the stabilisation force as “reminiscent of colonial practices”. In a scathing critique, the UN special Rapporteur for Palestine said, “Rather than charting a pathway towards ending the occupation and ensuring Palestinian protection, the resolution risks entrenching external control over Gaza’s governance, borders, security, and reconstruction. The resolution betrays the people it claims to protect.”
 
 

In Gaza itself, the UNSC resolution’s main provisions were viewed with great scepticism, according to Al Jazeera reporters on the ground. One resident told the news outlet “Our people … are able to rule ourselves. We don’t need forces from Arab or foreign countries to rule us”. The transitional governing arrangement is seen as outsiders deciding the fate of Palestinians. The international stabilisation force is viewed with deep suspicion — “not as a guarantee of protection but rather a foreign security arrangement imposed without their consent”.
Of course, it is the stance of Hamas and other Palestinian factions that is consequential for the resolution’s enforcement. Hamas still controls Gaza up to the ‘yellow line’ held by Israel. Its popularity has risen since the ceasefire, according to the latest poll by the West Bank-based Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research. Hamas has rejected the UN resolution on a number of grounds. It said the resolution “imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip”. Assigning the international force to disarm groups resisting the occupation “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation”.
Hamas has argued that any international force, if established, “must be deployed only at the borders to separate forces, monitor the ceasefire, and be fully under UN supervision”. “It must also operate exclusively in coordination with official Palestinian institutions.” “Resisting the occupation by all means is a legitimate right guaranteed by international laws and conventions.” Hamas also said disarmament is an “internal matter” linked to the end of occupation and creation of a Palestinian state.
It is possible Hamas may be prepared to disarm in exchange for total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which would end its occupation. But that can only be tested in serious negotiations that have to take place if the UN-endorsed Trump plan is not to collapse.
The expectation from the stabilisation force to demilitarise Gaza and disarm resistance groups is likely to deter several Muslim countries from joining it. Some of them are engaged in talks to contribute to the force. Israel has to approve countries that can be part of the force. So far it has rejected Turkiye’s participation. The international force will be answerable to the BoP and is intended to work with Egypt and Israel to demilitarise the Gaza Strip. That means it can get caught in a shooting war and act like an enforcement force rather than a peacekeeping one. Its task will also be to secure the borders and train the Palestinian police.
There are at least three reasons why Pakistan should not join ISF. One, it should not be part of a force whose key task is to police Hamas, not protect Palestinians. The implications for Pakistan, for example, of any clash between its troops and Palestinians would be serious. Two, deployment would involve close cooperation with Israel and arguably lure Pakistan into a trap to recognise Israel and join the Abraham Accords. Moreover, Israel’s continuing ceasefire violations and occupation of over half of Gaza pose major obstacles to Trump’s plan. In these circumstances, Hamas will not disarm. Walking into such a quagmire would therefore be a mistake for Pakistan.
The challenges facing implementation of the Gaza peace plan are formidable. At this inflection point for the plan, it is uncertain whether it will be able to deliver peace or meet the same fate as so many failed plans for Palestine have in the past.

FAIZ Ahmed Faiz’s immensely popular poem, usually referred to as Hum Dekhenge’, (we shall see), is surrounded by a few misunderstandings. Firstly, contrary to common belief, Faiz had not composed this poem as protest against General Ziaul Haq’s martial law, albeit he was definitely against the regime and had written the poem during Zia’s martial law.
The poem pronounces that the day would come when crowns would be tossed and thrones would be knocked over, which was interpreted as a protest against martial law. But the poem was in fact inspired by Iranian revolution and Faiz had paid tribute to common people who had brought about the revolution.
Presenting Iranian revolution as a proof, he expresses his firm belief that we shall one day see the end of exploitative system and the proletariat would snatch power from the feudal lords.
Secondly, the actual title of the poem is not Hum Dekhenge, but these are the first words in the opening line. The actual title of the poem, written in 1979, is a part of the verse 27 of Quran’s chapter 55 (Surah Rahman).
The poem alluding to the Day of the Judgement intends to remind that the day would come when the justice would prevail and those who committed atrocities would be punished. What inspired Faiz to pen this poem was 1979 Iranian revolution when Iranian monarch Mohammed Reza Pahlavi had to flee the country as millions of people took to street in protest.
Dr Sajid Siddiq Nizami, while explaining the poem in an article, has given the backdrop against which this poem was created. He says that Agha Nasir has mentioned that when he visited Faiz in London in 1979, Faiz handed him over two hand-written poems and asked him to distribute these poems among the friends in Pakistan. Faiz said one of the poems is on Iranian revolution, which had occurred a few months ago.
Agha said the Iranian revolution was an Islamic revolution and how could you write a poem on it (since Faiz was a leftist). Faiz replied a revolution is a revolution, not Islamic or un-Islamic.
When people take to street it becomes a mass revolution. On another occasion, says Dr Nizami, Faiz had commented that after the French revolution the Iranian evolution was the greatest one as it was brought about by general public.
In addition to revolution in Iran, Faiz must have had in his mind, adds Nizami, the situation in Pakistan where an elected government was toppled and the former prime minister was likely to be hanged. The poem became immensely popular when in 1986 Iqbal Bano sang it in a gathering at Lahore. Ever since the poem is considered the voice of the downtrodden and politically oppressed. So much so, that even in India it was recited to voice protest over the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019.
The poem was included in Mere Dil Mere Musafir (1981), a collection of Faiz’s poetry. Iftikhar Arif had the original manuscript of the book, written in hand by Faiz. It was also part of Faiz’s collected works Saare Sukhan Hamaare (London, 1982), but was not included in Nuskha Hai Vafaa (1984), complete poetic works of Faiz.
Perhaps it was a precautionary measure taken by the publisher. Later on, it was included in it but a few lines were abrogated. Dr Nizami’s article analyses the poem and explains that Faiz has used certain Islamic symbols and Sufi motifs to convey the theme.
Nizami’s article is included in an anthology tilted Ghaazaa-i-Rukhsaar-i-Sahar. Published by Lahore’s Collage Publications and compiled by Ghulam Ali — a Lahore-based young scholar — the book proffers 34 articles by renowned critics from India and Pakistan.
Some of the veterans whose article have made it to the anthology include Meera Jee, Syed Sajjad Zaheer, Fateh Muhammad Malik, Ashfaq Husain, Tabassum Kashmiri, Sarvarul Huda, Jabir Ali Syed, Qamar Raees, Ahmed Mehfooz, Aftab Ahmed, Ziaul Hasan, Nasir Abbas Nayyar and some others.
The book is, as mentioned by Nasir Abbas Nayyar in his blurb, a study known as Close Reading, or the in-depth analysis based on linguistic and structural features for deeper understanding.
Faiz died in Lahore on November 20, 1984.

The NDMA has issued an earlier-than-usual monsoon warning, saying that Pakistan could face 22-26pc above-normal rainfall next year. The advisory reminds us how the country faces escalating climate extremes, where each year brings a new ‘record’ of loss and disruption.
After the devastation of 2022, caused by glacial melt and record monsoon rains, and the deadly 2024 floods, driven by stalled monsoon systems that unleashed days of downpour, the prospect of an even harsher season should trigger an immediate shift from reaction to readiness. The NDMA’s disclosure that 3.1m people had to be relocated to safety this year alone speaks to both the scale of the threat and the fragility of Pakistan’s disaster-management architecture.
 
 

Early warnings issued six to eight months in advance will hold little meaning if riverine encroachments still stand, drains stay clogged, and provincial administrations lack the capacity or will to enforce evacuation plans. Tourism restrictions in June and July signal prudence but they are by no means a substitute for resilient infrastructure, local-level preparedness, and coordination across the federation.
The prime minister’s directive to begin early preparations and immediately implement the Ministry of Climate Change’s short-term plan is welcome, but political urgency must be matched by administrative discipline. Pakistan has long suffered from a pattern in which plans are drafted, alerts are issued, meetings are convened and yet the same communities drown each year because enforcement collapses at the provincial and district levels. That pattern must break.
 
 

The proposed meeting of the National Water Council must be more than symbolic. It needs to address the questions of land use, river management, water governance, and resource allocation that successive governments have avoided. With climate-driven hazards intensifying, the margin for complacency has evaporated. We must act now to strengthen embankments before the rivers swell, pre-position relief supplies before roads wash out, and empower local disaster committees before the first cloudburst.
Urban centres too must prepare. Cities like Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar can no longer afford dysfunctional drainage, unchecked construction, and seasonal firefighting. The early warnings for 2026 offer the country an unusual gift: time. Squandering this opportunity would be unforgivable.

• Accuses PPP of using Section 144 to curb political gatherings
• Adil Sheikh terms amendment against judicial independence
KARACHI: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday announced a three-day public mobilisation campaign during the first week of December, beginning from Kamo Shaheed in Ghotki and culminating in Karachi as part of its ongoing “struggle” across the country against the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
A key meeting of TTAP was held under the chairmanship of Syed Zain Shah, the vice chairman of alliance’s Sindh chapter.
Senior leaders including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s (MWM) Allama Sadiq Jaffery, Sindh United Party’s (SUP) Munir Naich, PkMAP’s Sarbaz Abdul Rab, Bashir Khan Tareen and others attended the session.
The forum reviewed the country’s prevailing political and constitutional situation and approved several decisions.
A statement issued after the meeting said that opposition leaders resolved that the TTAP would launch a three-day public mobilisation campaign during the first week of December, beginning from Kamo Shaheed in Ghotki and culminating in Karachi. Key leaders of the TTAP would address the public along the route.
 
 

“The participants of the meeting lauded the people of Sindh for observing Black Day on November 21 and appreciated the ongoing struggle of lawyers across the country against the 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, TTAP vice chairman and SUP Chief Syed Zain Shah said the three-day rally would travel through multiple cities before reaching Karachi on the third day.
 
 

He said the public had grown weary of the current system, which had been marred by unemployment, economic hardship and rising inflation.
“The 27th Amendment has undermined the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” he added.
He accused the PPP of repeatedly enforcing Section 144 across Sindh to avoid facing the public’s reaction.
“After TTAP announced a public rally in Hyderabad, the sudden imposition of Section 144 throughout the province has proved that the PPP has lost its popular support in Sindh,” he said.
He added that the nationwide movement had now entered a decisive phase and attempts to “suppress public opinion or impose governments on the basis of a fabricated mandate would no longer be tolerated.”
Mr Sheikh of PTI said the 27th Cons­titutional Amendment had “stripped the judiciary of its independence” and that only a people’s struggle could dismantle the system established through a “stolen mandate”.
He said the government was introducing “anti-people” amendments while keeping PTI founder Imran Khan in “unjust imprisonment”.
“These measures will not be accepted under any circumstances,” he said.
Large public gatherings, he said, would be held in several cities during the December campaign.

In a statement, Hamas said it reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in its meeting with Egypt’s intelligence chief, but accused Israel of continued violations that it said threatened to undermine the deal.
The delegation, which included exiled Hamas Gaza chief Khalil Al-Hayya, called for a “clear and defined mechanism” under the supervision of mediators to document and halt any breaches of the deal.
The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a local Hamas commander Alaa Al-Hadidi in Gaza, the head of supply in Hamas’ production headquarters. It said he was killed in one of the attacks across the Gaza Strip.
Hamas did not release a statement on the commander’s reported killing.
FO slams attacks
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office denounced Israel’s continued strikes on Gaza, calling Saturday’s attack that killed at least 21 people a grave breach of international law and a serious blow to ongoing peace efforts.
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks by Israeli occupying forces across Gaza.” It added that the strikes had resulted in the deaths of several Palestinian civilians and left many others wounded.
 






“Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international law, relevant UN resolutions, and the recently concluded peace agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh,” the FO said.
The statement added that these attacks also undermine international efforts aimed at achieving “lasting peace and stability” in the region.

There have been two types of additions: net-metered and behind-the-meter. Net-metered additions are connected to the grid, in which the grid buys electricity from such customers at a price well above the prevailing marginal cost. Meanwhile, behind-the-meter refers to adding solar without grid connectivity. The emergence of both types has led to more than 25 GW of solar capacity available in the country, and this is expected to increase further.
Due to such additions, Pakistan’s load curve has started to look very different from what our tariff design assumes, which is still stuck in the last century. As the sun rises, solar capacity kicks in from 7am to 3pm, reducing grid demand. It is during this same interval that the grid buys surplus electricity from net-metered customers, while the marginal price is at its lowest.
Surplus supply during daylight hours reduces the marginal price of electricity. But due to a rigid and impractical tariff regime, the benefits cannot be captured, and a lower marginal price can not be passed on to consumers.

Changing the tariff structure could allow an equilibrium price that mimics the actual demand-supply situation rather than one assumed in a silo somewhere

Behind-the-meter solar and batteries are eating into daytime demand, and the existing cost-plus tariff is not designed to address it. The current tariff structure effectively divides all variable and fixed electricity costs across an assumed number of demand levels. This may have worked when there was no decentralised electricity generation, only till a few years back, but it does not work for an environment where decentralised generation continues to increase its share of the generation pie.
 
 

It is important to pivot quickly to a subscription-style pricing model, where customers pay primarily for capacity and network, not just for units consumed, in the absence of which the system will keep raising tariffs for a shrinking base of kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales.
Such sales will continue to contract as the share of decentralised generation increases, making the grid less tenable for all consumers and further accelerating migration from the grid. That is a recipe for faster grid defection, more behind-the-meter investment, and a larger circular debt stock.
The grid is increasingly full at night and in the evening, but hollowed out in the middle of the day. That valley during the middle of the day is a classic “duck curve”, which entails high demand at the shoulders of the day, a pronounced dip when solar is strongest, and then a steep evening ramp when solar output collapses and everyone turns lights, motors and air conditioners back on. The system is paying for capacity it cannot use in the middle of the day, and then scrambling to recover fixed costs from fewer units sold.
On the storage side, lithium-battery import data suggests that by mid-2025, Pakistan will already be sitting on roughly 18 GWh of stationary energy storage. As battery prices continue to decline, battery storage is expected to reach more than 75 GWh by 2028, further risking defection from the grid.
Consumers do not need to completely move away from the grid; every minute or kWh they use either decentralised generation or a battery is a minute or kWh taken away from the grid, which means lower grid utilisation and, inadvertently, higher prices for everyone else. It is important to look at things at the margin here, to identify the inflection point, rather than using a simple average that masks distortions.
Based on current trends, we will soon have the technical ability to mobilise 7–15 GW of flexible, distributed capacity for two hours during peak times, if even a fraction of these batteries are aggregated and dispatched as part of micro-grids or virtual power plants.
If tariff design does not respond, the load curve will become more extreme, resulting in deeper midday troughs, sharper evening ramps, and progressively lower utilisation of grid-supplied energy per rupee of fixed cost locked into the system.
 
 

The existing tariff philosophy still behaves as if fixed and variable costs are recovered primarily through per-kWh charges. Total power payments are estimated at Rs3.5 trillion, of which the power purchase price is about Rs3.1tr. Within this, capacity charges alone are roughly Rs1.8tr, just over half of the entire system’s revenue requirement. These are obligations Pakistan must pay, whether grid sales are 120 terawatt-hour (TWh) or 90 TWh.
Dividing this over a lower denominator spells disaster for all consumers, or even taxpayers in the process, since any policy disaster is eventually funded by the taxpayer, either through higher taxes, or by the population, through higher inflation.
Instead of recovering capacity, network and social-policy costs inside an opaque energy rate, the tariff must be unbundled into three transparent components.
Firstly, a capacity subscription (CS), which refers to a fixed rupee-per-kWh monthly charge that recovers generation capacity costs. Secondly, a network charge (NC), which can be a fixed rupee-per-kWh per month that recovers transmission and distribution costs. And lastly, an energy charge, which can be a rupee-per-kWh rate that tracks the system’s shortrun marginal cost (SRMC) and varies by time of day.
Moving to a marginal cost regime will eventually lead to an equilibrium price that mimics the actual demand-supply situation rather than one assumed in a silo somewhere.
The economic logic is straightforward: CS and NC are billed on the higher of the sanctioned load or the measured maximum demand. This anchors fixed-cost recovery in kilowatts of subscribed capacity, not in how many kilowatt hours a user happens to import in a given month.
The energy charge is allowed to fall toward the real midday marginal cost of generation, which recent data puts at low-teens per kWh, about half the evening SRMC.
This encourages industry to move energy-intensive processes into the daytime, soaking up surplus hydel, nuclear, and solar. This is exactly how most of us already buy broadband: we pay a monthly fee for a 50 Mbps pipe, not for the exact number of packets we consume. The provider’s revenues depend largely on subscribed capacity, not on whether we streamed brainrot for 10 hours or two.
Pakistan’s duck curve is not going away. The only question is whether we let it keep eroding the financial foundations of the power system, or whether we redesign tariffs to live with, and benefit from, a future where solar and batteries sit on every feeder and further strengthens the viability of the system, rather than being a threat.

US and Indian officials have signalled that the agreement is expected to be concluded by the end of November, clearing the way for their bilateral trade to reach an intended $500 billion by 2030.
“Pakistan and other South Asian nations are hoping the agreement will also encourage the United States to expand trade with the rest of the region,” one diplomatic source said. “They are looking for even-handed treatment for all.”
According to sources, these regional considerations are among the factors delaying the announcement of a joint US-Pakistan statement on bilateral trade. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan’s talks with the office of the US Trade Representative are ongoing, as both sides work to finalise various points.
Pakistani officials are keen to understand how they could benefit from provisions like reduce tariffs on goods produced with raw materials sourced from the United States, such as fabrics made from US cotton.

Pakistan closely watching implications of the impending agreement

“But now, Pakistanis are no longer pushing for an immediate announcement. Instead, they are waiting for the US-India deal to be finalised,” one source said.
When Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb last visited Washington in October to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, Pakistani officials told reporters that the statement would be announced “in weeks, if not days”.
The US-Pakistan trade deal, agreed in principle in July 2025, came into effect on Aug 7. It features reciprocal tariff reductions, particularly benefiting Pakistani exports such as textiles, leather goods, surgical instruments, and agricultural products, while Pakistan rolled back its digital services tax.
Earlier, on Aug 1, Pakistan announced that the US had imposed a 19 per cent tariff on its exports — a reduction from the 29pc rate announced by President Donald Trump in April.
The revised rate was described by Islamabad as a “balanced and forward-looking step” aimed at enhancing Pakistan’s competitiveness in the American market.
In contrast, India initially faced a 26pc “reciprocal” tariff on April 9, which was later raised to 50pc by an executive order on Aug 6, effective since Aug 27, citing India’s purchases of Russian oil.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in Washington cautions that the 2025 reciprocal tariffs may reduce both US and global economic growth while boosting inflation in affected economies. The tariffs disproportionately penalise countries relying on global value chains, as duties are applied to gross export value, including imported inputs.
Another Washington think-tank, CSIS, notes that the “reciprocal” label is misleading: the rates are calculated via a formula based on the US trade deficit with each country, resulting in rates as high as 50pc, far exceeding simple tit-for-tat adjustments.

As imports continue to fast outpace stagnant exports significantly, the pressure is mounting on the home currency.
The State Bank appears cognisant of the situation and has tightened restrictions on individual dollar purchases from the open market. Yet, the widening imbalance — in spite of robust remittances keeping the market liquid — has strengthened market expectations that the rupee would eventually have to adjust, the central bank’s efforts to maintain stability through administrative and monetary measures notwithstanding.
In this context, the sharp slide of the Indian rupee in recent months is proving to be an important external anchor, sharpening focus on regional competitiveness and heightening worries that Pakistan’s currency may be becoming overvalued.
India’s rupee has struggled for three months since high US tariffs — among the steepest on any Asian nation — on Indian exports took effect in late August. Even as the country’s economic fundamentals remain resilient and equity markets hover near record highs, the tariffs have pushed India’s merchandise trade deficit to a record level, with exports to the US down nine per cent year-on-year.

‘It took us 15–20 years to build a competitive interbank market, which we have destroyed by managing the exchange rate’

The Indian currency is down by 4.3pc versus the dollar this year, sliding by 0.9pc on Friday to a lifetime low of 89.48, surpassing the previous record low of 88.8 in September, as the Reserve Bank of India pulled back its support for the currency.
Pakistani exporters are now increasingly anxious about currency devaluation, arguing that it is necessary to maintain their competitiveness in international markets. To support their argument for currency devaluation, many insist that they risk losing market share unless the rupee also finds a lower equilibrium, with India allowing its currency to weaken.
Pakistan’s current account deficit has widened to $733 million in the first four months of the current financial year, nearly 3.5 times higher than the $206m deficit recorded in the same period last year, according to the latest balance of payments data from the SBP. The pressure on the current account is coming directly from rising imports as the central bank relaxed curbs under the International Monetary Fund directives and growth quickens. Exports continue to stagnate because of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to what exporters term a “managed exchange rate”.

The Indian currency is down by 4.3pc versus the dollar this year, sliding by 0.9pc on Friday to a lifetime low of 89.48

Imports have surged 10 per cent to $24.92 billion in 4MFY26 from $22.65bn in 4MFY25, while exports increased 4.8pc to $13.66bn compared to $13.04bn a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit in goods and services has expanded to $11.26bn from $9.61bn a year ago.
That the current account gap continues to widen in spite of robust growth in workers’ remittances, which increased 9.3pc to $12.96bn in 4MFY26 from $11.85bn during the same period last year, underscores that this trend could intensify going forward unless imports are restricted and exports pushed. A further deterioration in the fragile external sector would bring more pressure on the rupee.
More curbs on imports are likely to fetch severe public criticism, as the government is already blamed for failing to boost economic growth over the last three years. Many argue that the government has deliberately cut GDP growth to keep the current account under control. The government achieved a surplus of $1.9bn last year, but growth stagnated at 3pc.
The recent trajectory of the current account underscores how vulnerable Pakistan’s external position remains to swings in global commodity prices, which inflate the import bill, and to the performance of workers’ remittances, the country’s most reliable source of foreign exchange. In FY22, a steep widening of the deficit depleted foreign exchange reserves, triggered a balance-of-payments crisis and forced renewed engagement with the International Monetary Fund.
The subsequent reduction of the deficit in FY23 and the modest gap in FY24 were largely the result of policy-driven measures, most notably stringent import controls that helped compress demand but also dampened economic growth and killed industrial activity. Last year’s surplus was primarily due to record-high remittance inflows, controlled imports and stronger information technology and telecom exports, which together offset the persistent deficit in goods trade.
Analysts argue that the core problem is structural: Pakistan consumes far more than it produces. “Pakistan’s structural weaknesses, primarily its heavy dependence on imports and a chronically weak export base, have historically kept the current account in deficit,” a banker noted. “The growing deficit mirrors a deeper vulnerability: we are a country trapped in a debt cycle, where we borrow to finance consumption and then borrow again to repay those loans.”
 
 

Textile exporters share this view. “The way forward requires a decisive shift toward a productivity-led, export-oriented growth model. That means redirecting incentives toward production and exports. Pakistan needs a productivity revolution to build a competitive, export-driven economy,” said an exporter from Faisalabad. But he added that such a transformation requires consistent policies sustained over several years. “While we move in this direction, we must align our exchange rate with our industrial competitiveness to protect our existing exports for now.”
Another major textile exporter was sharply critical of the government and the SBP for “artificially managing the exchange rate”. He lamented, “It took us 15–20 years to build a competitive interbank market, which we have destroyed by managing the exchange rate. How come all banks quote the same rate unless the exchange rate is being managed?”
He rejected the claim that the exchange rate has little bearing on export competitiveness. “Undoubtedly, a sudden major spurt of devaluation after a period of managed exchange rate does not help; rather, it hurts the economy, as we have seen since the early 2000s. Each period of managed exchange was followed by rounds of major devaluations, leading to hyperinflation and expensive raw material imports, and all this happened after our exporters had already lost market share internationally. Currency devaluation works only if it follows a gradual and natural course.”
According to him, the government has limited options if it intends to keep the rupee “stable” at its present level without eroding export competitiveness further: interest rates would need to be slashed to 5–6pc from the current 11pc, and energy prices for exporters would have to fall substantially.
“The government and the central bank can manage the current account and the exchange rate as long as remittances keep growing. But they cannot protect goods and services exports by maintaining a lid on the exchange rate. The sooner this lid is lifted, the better, because the exchange rate has to adjust sooner or later. The longer it takes, the more damaging it will be for the economy and exports both.”

The first tranche of deals will include projects in Pakistan, Egypt and Europe, the organisation’s chair John Jovanovic told the Financial Times in an interview on Sunday. He added that the West was over-reliant on supplies that “are no longer fair”.
 
 

“We can’t do anything else that we’re trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning,” Jovanovic was quoted saying.
Jovanovic told FT that the bank has $100bn left to deploy of the $135bn autho­rised by Congress. He said the bank’s early deals would also include a credit insurance guarantee for $4bn of natural gas being delivered to Egypt by New York-based commodities group Hartree Partners.

The ongoing tug-of-war over who gets control of the Constitution Ave­nue premises is increasingly starting to resemble a joint family squeezed into an old ancestral home, where every member complains about inadequate space and competing needs.
Last week, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded that the FCC be moved out of its temporary location within the IHC building, asserting that the new court must eventually operate from the FSC premises.
The bar leadership also warned that any attempt to relocate the IHC itself would be met with determined legal and democratic resistance.

Islamabad judiciary wary as newly formed Federal Constitutional Court could potentially usurp its coveted Constitution Avenue location

The establishment of the FCC has exposed what many observers describe as a lack of planning on the part of policymakers. The FCC — initially part of the 26th Constitutional Amendment package, but removed shortly before its passage — was reintroduced in the 27th Amendment.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building for the FCC days before the amendment was tabled in parliament.
However, the decision to convert the FSC building into the FCC’s permanent home was taken unilaterally, without consulting Shariat Court judges. Under the plan, four FSC judges and a backlog of only 56 pending petitions were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was instructed to urgently prepare four new courtrooms.
 
 

Simultaneously, the CDA was tasked with renovating FSC courtrooms for FCC judges. But when CDA teams arrived to take possession of the Shariat Court premises, the administration strongly resisted, even preventing their entry.
FSC Chief Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rehman, along with other judges, subsequently met Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and conveyed their reservations over what they termed a unilateral and abrupt order, requiring them to vacate their purpose-built premises within a week.
A senior lawyer remarked that the situation was ironic: “A tenant is normally granted at least a month to vacate a rented property, yet the FSC judges were expected to leave within a week from a building acquired specifically for the Shariat Court”.
Cramped space
After the 27th Amendment was passed and received presidential assent, the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC Chief Justice was held at the Presidency, attended by the top civil, military and legal leadership.
But with the FSC building still not handed over to the FCC, the oath-taking for the judges had to be held at the Islamabad High Court.
The initial oath ceremony for three judges took place on November 14 at an open space at the IHC, where IHCBA office-bearers and senior lawyers warmly greeted the newly-appointed judges.
The following day, Justice K.K. Agha was administered the oath in a cramped conference room, which could accommodate barely 25-30 people. On November 17, the oaths of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah were also conducted in the same congested room.
The IHC administration arranged seven courtrooms to enable the FCC to function temporarily until its permanent premises were finalised. But once senior staff of the FCC — many of them brought in from the Supreme Court — assumed their roles, the shortage of space became even more pronounced.
The allocation of courtrooms also caused unease. The FCC chief justice was assigned Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani for his own judicial work.
Senior officials within the high court expressed the apprehension that since the FCC is the highest constitutional forum, its chief justice could potentially assume control of the IHC building if he so desired.
Bar divided
At Friday’s press conference, IHCBA President Wajid Ali Gilani emphasised that the FCC’s use of IHC premises must remain temporary.
“The FCC must first be moved to the Supreme Court building, and permanently to the FSC, where the caseload is lower and infrastructure already exists,” he said. “No institution will be allowed to impose itself on the site of the high court.”
“Any administrative decision taken without consultation with the legal community is unacceptable and will be vigorously resisted,” he warned.
Mr Gilani recalled that Islamabad’s judicial framework had evolved from a single court functioning in Melody Market in 1960, to a full-fledged system with more than a hundred judges.
He said buildings constructed through public funds must operate according to constitutional norms rather than administrative convenience.
IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said rumours of the IHC’s relocation stemmed from a private TV report with “no legal or administrative standing”. He warned: “If anyone tries to wall off the High Court, there will be a strong protest. This community will not allow the judiciary’s independence to be compromised.” In stark contrast to the high court bar’s position, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) — commonly known as the District Bar — welcomed the proposal to shift the high court back to its old premises in Sector G-10.
After a cabinet meeting on Friday, IBA President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar said the proposal would alleviate difficulties faced by lawyers and litigants. “Shifting the high court back to G-10 is a practical and long-awaited step. It will facilitate the legal community and improve access to justice,” he said.

Opening the conversation at the panel titled ‘Power women of Pakistan: her story, our future’, classical dancer, social activist and founder of the cultural action group Tehrik-i-Niswan, Sheema Kermani read out loud a poem by famed feminist poet Fahmida Riaz, ‘Ek ladki se’, which recounts the tale of a “captive princess”.
The panel also included MNA Sharmila Faruqui, TCS Group President Saira Awan Malik and was moderated by journalist Zarrar Khuhro.
Female rage
As Kermani finished reciting Riaz’s work, Khuhro asked, “There is as much hope in these words as there is anger. Would you be here today if you did not have this rage?”
Kermani responded that she would not be here if it were not for the rage she felt against the world.
“We women have a lot of rage, but we also have the desire to change that rage into positive action,” she said. For Kermani, the rage, she believed, was a driving factor in her work and activism.
“One can only take action when they are enraged,” she said. However, Kermani went on to add that, “women are also full of love, and it manifests itself in everything we do”.
Kermani, referencing Naheed’s poem, which the poet watched herself from the audience, recalled that, “’Hum gunahghar aurtain’ was an expression of anger as well —  how dare you call us sinful? Who are you to say what we do is sinful?”
Awan, however, offered a different perspective on the driving force behind her work and life. For her, empowerment came not from a place of anger, but from ambition and encouragement.
“My internal ingredient has always been a deep sense of purpose and focus,” she said, crediting her role models and the familial support she received growing up.
Echoing Kermani’s words, Faruqui recounted how she has always turned her rage into fuel, as she talked about the struggles she faced as a female politician and the recent bill she introduced in the National Assembly against domestic violence, which was passed on November 13.
Faruqui began by describing the ordeal of being a woman in politics, calling it “brutal and beautiful.”
“You are judged, underestimated, harassed, you are either too loud or too ambitious,” she lamented.
Shifting her attention back to the bill, she described her work as a part of her personal journey and hoped that people would acknowledge the “effort and long struggle that goes into working towards such legislation”.
Faruqui characterised the experience of getting the bill passed as “demeaning, humiliating, and yet somehow uplifting”. She recalled that the men in the assembly had told her that she was trying to break up marriages.
“The bill was returned to me at least six times, there were provisions removed, it was ridiculed, and made fun of, and there were moments where I felt completely alone,” she said, recalling the resistance she faced from both men and women alike. 
At this point, Kermani interjected and asked: “How many women are there in the assembly?”
Thirty replied Faruqui. When asked how many men there were, she said 300.
“There you go,” Kermani said, matter-of-factly, as she called for increased female participation in politics.
On corporate success
On being asked if women in workplaces should have to check their womanhood at the door, Awan said that women had innate characteristics which work well in corporate settings.
“They are natural problem solvers, more empathetic, not ego-driven. They are always looking to build organisational culture,” she explained.
Citing her experiences, Awan said, “Women in leadership often bring care, longevity in their roles.”
Khuhro chimed in, adding, “So inclusivity is not a buzzword; it is also good for business.”
Speaking about women’s participation in the workforce, Awan noted that in Pakistan, the number for female participation stood at 23 per cent.
She acknowledged that while there were societal barriers, there was also a greater need to address universal barriers that stopped women from entering the workforce.
“We need to put in place protective measures for women entering the corporate sector,” she said.</p><small>2025-11-24 02:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6923b5860e6a2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957019/pml-n-largely-sweeps-lacklustre-by-elections' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N largely sweeps lacklustre by-elections</strong></a><br><p>• Ruling party bags NA seats in Lahore, D.G.

• ECP chief downplays low participation, says voters not interested due to low stakes
• PTI alleges rigging in Lahore and Haripur; boycotts all other contests
LAHORE / HARIPUR / ISLAMABAD: After polls closed in by-elections across 13 constituencies — for six national and seven provincial assembly seats — in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the ruling PML-N bagged almost all seats, except for one in Muzzafargarh, which was secured by the PPP, unofficial results showed in the early hours of Monday morning.
The PML-N was also leading the polls in three other constituencies: two national and provincial seats in Faisalabad and one NA seat in Haripur, where the unofficial results had not been announced till the filing of this report.
The six NA constituencies where polling was conducted included NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore), NA-143 (Sahiwal) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan). The seven Punjab Assembly constituencies up for grabs included PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-98, PP-115, PP-116 (Faisalabad), PP-203 (Sahiwal), and PP-269 (Muzaffargarh).
Amid an opposition boycott and low voter turnout, the by-polls were held in response to the disqualification of a number of PTI lawmakers following their conviction in May 9 violence cases. The main opposition PTI, however, stayed away from the electoral exercise, save for two National Assembly constituencies in Lahore and Haripur. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except in Muzaffargarh, and the PPP contested on two NA and one Punjab seat.
By Sunday night, the PML-N was in a position to win all the Punjab seats, except for PP-269, where the ruling party had not fielded a candidate against PPP’s Alamdar Qureshi.
According to Form-47 issued after midnight, PML-N candidate Mahmood Qadir Khan defeated PPP’s Dost Mohammad Khosa by securing 82,419 votes against his rival’s 49,226 votes in NA-185. In Lahore’s NA-129, Mohammad Nauman of the PML-N emerged victorious with 63,441 votes while independent Arslan Ahmad got 29,099 votes.
The ruling party also bagged the Sahiwal NA-143 seat, as its candidate secured 119,334 votes as per the unofficial results. Even before the Form-47 was issued, PM Shehbaz Sharif had congratulated Tufail Jutt, saying, “Undoubtedly, with the victory in NA-143, the public has expressed its trust in the spirit of public service of the PML-N.” In a tweet, he also congratulated the Lahore and Sahiwal provincial assembly candidates.
In NA-104, PML-N’s Danyal Ahmad bagged 52,791 votes against independent candidate Rana Adnan Javed’s 19,262 votes.
In NA-96, PML-N’s Mohammad Bilal Badar secured 61,808 votes while independent candidate Nawab Sher Waseer secured 29,805 votes, according to results from 247 out of 345 polling stations.
On the other hand, the PTI claimed to have secured a lead in Haripur, citing results from 341 polling stations. PTI insiders claimed that their candidates bagged 102,136 against Babar Nawaz’s tally of 78,066 votes, citing results from 341 polling stations.
However, by the time this report went to press, results from 292 out of 602 polling stations had been shared by the ECP on its media dashboard, showing PML-N candidate Babar Nawaz ahead with 81,655 votes against Shehrnaz Ayub’s 56,981 votes.

Punjab Assembly seats
PML-N candidate Muhammad Hanif secured 45,073 votes against independent nominee Falak Sher’s 10,670 in PP-203. In PP-87, PML-N’s Ali Haider Noor Khan Niazi bagged 67,986 votes while runner-up Mohammad Ayaz Niazi got 6,371 votes. In PP-115, PML-N candidate Tahir Pervaiz got 49,046 votes while his rival could not secure more than 2,000 votes. In PP-116, PML-N candidate Ahmad Shehryar received 48,824 votes while Asghar Ali got 11,429 votes, as per Form-47. In PP-73, PML-N’s Sultan Ali Ranjha got 71,770 votes and emerged victorious.
In PP-269, PPP nominee Alamdar Abbas Qureshi secured 55,868 votes while Iqbal Khan bagged 46,510 votes.
In PP-98, PML-N’s Azad Ali Tabassum secured 29,227 votes while his rival Muhammad Ajmal got 20,472 votes, according to results received from 104 out of 171 polling stations.
‘Robust turnout’
Earlier while speaking to journalists in Islamabad on Sunday evening, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar was confident that the PML-N would secure a clear lead in the by-elections, evident by the “robust turnout”.
Mr Tarar said the PML-N candidate enjoyed a strong position in Lahore, with party teams actively involved throughout the polling process. He said voter turnout for the party had been highly encouraging across Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal and Dera Ghazi Khan.
He said the PTI’s decision to boycott the exercise would have political repercussions for the opposition party. “Political boycotts carry inevitable cost as there is no room for such decisions in democratic practice,” he said in reference to the opposition party. He claimed that by-elections witnessed a robust voter turnout, with citizens from across social and economic divides stepping forward to exercise their democratic right.
“In Lahore, unusually large crowds gathered at polling camps, while Dera Ghazi Khan reported a steady flow of voters throughout the day. Elderly citizens, young people and women turned out in significant numbers, reflecting broad public participation in the electoral process,” he said.
Low turnout
In most constituencies, however, the voter turnout remained quite low.
The disinterest could be gauged from the fact that one polling station in NA-96 (Faisalabad) did not see a single voter for hours after polling opened. Meanwhile, announcements were made through the loudspeakers of local mosques both in Faisalabad and Sahiwal, urging people to come out of their homes and exercise their right to franchise as a national duty.
Similarly, a video clip of Faisalabad City Police Officer Bilal Omer’s visit to multiple polling stations also showed barely any voters present, with cops filling the venue instead. Similarly, workers at the camps of PML-N’s Tabbasum and independent candidates Wasim Akram Chattha and Haji Ajmal Cheema at a government school polling station reported “almost no voters” at around 12pm in PP-98.
Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, however, justified the low turnout, saying these elections were not supposed to change the “number game” in parliament, which was the reason for the lack of enthusiasm.
Speaking to reporters at the ECP monitoring room in Islamabad, he said the election remained peaceful in both provinces and thanked the provincial governments for their cooperation. “This election was not supposed to change the numbers game in parliament. This is the reason why the turnout was low in today’s elections,” he added.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob posted on social media platform X that if the ruling PML-N managed to win five NA seats in these by-polls, “it will not need PPP votes for a simple majority in [the] NA in future, or in other words, PML-N can stay in power without PPP’s support!”
 






Rigging allegations
Earlier, PTI leader Hammad Azhar alleged that ballot books are being received by the presiding officers less than the number of books issued to them in the by-polls for NA-129 (Lahore-XIII).
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he shared Form-36 (packing invoice containing the quantity of ballot paper books) of polling station No. 330 in NA-129, which said that 18 ballot paper books, from serial No.5179 to 7194 and each containing 100 ballots, had been issued. But the presiding officer encircled the number 18 and wrote with her pen the number 15 and signed the form.
 






The ballot books were meant for a female polling station for 1,716 voters.
The spokesperson for the ECP declined to comment, while an official attributed the discrepancy to a typographic error as the number of ballot books issued to the polling station (330) was 15 as confirmed by the serial number — from 5179-5194 — mentioned in the next column of the Form-36.
Separately, Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi accused the authorities of “uprooting almost 99 per cent” of the PTI’s camps outside polling stations in Lahore. Mr Qureshi pointed out the low voter turnout and claimed that the PML-N attempted to “sabotage the by-polls by distributing more than half of the polling stations’ lists” in other areas, resulting in voters heading to the wrong polling stations. The PTI also claimed that Central Punjab Youth Wing President Mian Hassan Shakeel and others were injured by PML-N workers at a polling station in NA-129.
Similarly, former KP minister Yusuf Ayub accused the ECP of being biased against their candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub. “The election commission’s biased approach is evident from the posting of presiding officers, other polling staff, and changing our election symbol,” he said. He acknowledged that the voter turnout remained low but expressed the hope that, despite all the bias, the PTI candidate would win the election with a margin of 100,000 votes.
PTI’s Faisalabad president Adil Pervez Gujjar also served a show cause notice on Deputy Coordinator Women Wing Azra Parveen for contesting the by-polls from NA-96 against party policy.

But the concentration of power at the cost of actual democracy denies citizens the choice and opportunity to improve their livelihoods, making existing problems more difficult to resolve.
Repeated calls from powerful quarters, including the International Monetary Fund, the armed forces, and the finance ministry, to rebalance the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources for the provinces under the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) Award to the centre have gone unheeded, according to an analyst.
In multi-ethnic states, participatory democratic federalism works best to reduce disparities in economic development across provinces and regions, which is vital for ensuring economic and political stability and national security.
After the 26th and 27th amendments, if further changes were required, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry says, “The government, along with its coalition partners, would proceed responsibly, ensuring the dignity of parliament is preserved.”
Political stability primarily depends on shared values and principles among the people’s representatives elected in free and fair elections. And the three tiers of the federation need to be empowered with rights and responsibilities according to their capabilities at each level.
Informed sources reportedly said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wanted to set the ball rolling at the political level on key centre-provincial matters before opening the debate on financial arrangements at the technically constituted NFC forum.

The centre must implement the provisions of the 18th Constitutional Amendment while upgrading the NFC resource distribution formula according to the changing economic environment

In principle, the prime minister has adopted the right approach. Critics, however, argue that he has no official role in the NFC engagements after the president constitutes it. Nevertheless, the prime minister has been hinting at continuing the dialogue with the PPP on the issue.
 
 

The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22, and its first meeting was called on August 27. After further delays, it was expected to meet in late November; it has been delayed once again to December 4.

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal recently said the population-based share should be gradually reduced so that resource allocation is linked to population decline

The five-year 7th NFC Award (2010) was a major step towards financial federalism as part of the evolving participatory federal democracy envisioned by the 18th Amendment and grant of administrative, political and legislative autonomy to the federating units. Now it is time to build upon what has been achieved so far.
The Sindh budget documents claim that the 7th NFC Award was historical because it broke the status quo of the revenue-sharing formula among the provinces that was based solely on population. All four provinces agreed on a multi-criteria-based formula involving population (82 per cent), poverty (10.3pc) inverse population density (2.7pc) and revenue generation collection (5pc), with an additional 1pc share for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) for the war against terrorism.
Furthermore, the sales tax on services was devolved to the provinces. Federal tax collection charges were reduced from 5pc to 1pc.
In view of the sharp rise in poverty levels both between provinces and within each province, it becomes imperative to raise the allocation for poverty proportionately. The proposals being discussed at the official level include increasing the weightage of revenue collection from the present 5pc, which could provide more fiscal space to address uneven regional economic development.
The fiscal space provided by the reduction in population weightage could also create room, for instance, to raise the allocation to inverse population density, now at 2.7pc. That is how underdeveloped Balochistan can be helped to catch up with relatively more developed Sindh and Punjab.
The weightage should not be higher than 40pc for any one criterion to make five-year adjustments easier, says a Business Recorder editorial, adding: the adjustments would not generate resistance from any one province, as the country’s economy as well as that of each federating unit evolves.
Only the population alone is allocated 82pc of the total NFC pool resources. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal recently said the population-based share should be gradually reduced so that resource allocation is linked to population decline. The federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, he stated, is formulating a comprehensive action plan in this regard.
Then the issue of earmarking NFC funds sought by PTI for Federally Administered Tribal Areas merged with KP has to be settled amicably.
Harmonious relationships among the provinces would, in turn, strengthen the federation. The centre also needs to faithfully implement all provisions and stipulations of the 18th Constitutional Amendment while upgrading the NFC pool resource distribution formula to reflect the changing economic environment.
The 18th Amendment provided constitutional protection to the share of the federating units, stipulating that a sub-federation’s share in any future award must not be less than its share in the previous award.
In the current political situation, particularly the sharp divergence of views between the two major coalition partners, the PPP and PML-N, any constitutional amendment to reduce provincial shares seems impossible.

• Questions why auditor general’s office remains attached to federal secretariat
• Audit process bogged down by over 6,000 reports a year, minimal PAC follow-up
ISLAMABAD: The Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concern over the absence of an internal audit mechanism and weak constitutional and parliamentary audit supervision in Pakistan, warning that these gaps pose major fiduciary risks to public funds estimated at about Rs40 trillion at the federal level and even higher in the provinces.
It has called for a fully independent Office of the Auditor Gen­eral of Pakistan (AGP) to ensure better value for taxpayers’ money.
 
 

In a detailed section in its Governance & Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA), the IMF has identified a series of weaknesses in Pakistan’s internal financial controls, internal and external audit systems and practical subservience of the AGP to the executive despite its constitutional autonomy, besides insufficient capacity and role of the parliamentary oversight through the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
It is therefore unsurprising that cases of financial irregularities, embezzlement and corruption running into trillions of rupees continue to surface year after year.
The Fund said an effective internal control system was essential for creating an environment that ensured appropriate decision-making regarding the use of public resources, with clear accountability for such decisions, including via administrative structures, as well as external oversight by a supreme audit institution and the legislature.
“Both internal and external audits are vital in maintaining the integrity of an organisation’s operations and financial reporting, thereby reducing the risk of corruption,” the Fund observed and highlighted a series of weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
Saying that internal audit was weak in Pakistan, the report noted that the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act 2019 required the creation of a Chief Internal Auditor (CIA) in each division to work directly with principal accounting officers no later than 2020.
“Despite this provision, there has been no implementation and appointment of CIAs,” the IMF said.
It said that 25 chief finance and accounts officers (CFAOs) were working in ministries for financial management — a distinct role — but CIAs have not been posted in all ministries and divisions and CFAOs are also missing in 15 ministries and divisions. The full implementation of the PFM Act 2019 still remains a dream after six years.
“In addition, ministries and divisions with CFAOs lack consistency, interest, and follow-up on the findings of internal audit reports,” it said. The Fund also questioned why the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was still operating as an attached institution of the Federal Secretariat, which resulted in a lack of full independence.
According to Article 171 of the Constitution and Article 7 of the Pakistan Audit Ordinance, 2001, the AGP has to attest the Appropriation accounts and financial statements of federal, provincial and local governments’ entities and the certified accounts and financial statements of the federal and provincial/local governments are submitted to the president and the governors of provinces, respectively.
“Due to its status as an attached institution, the Auditor General does not report directly to the parliament but instead through the Federal Secretariat, the prime minister, and the president. This indirect reporting structure can potentially compromise the independence and objectivity of the audit process,” it said.
In addition, as an attached institution, the OAG has to obtain approval from the federal Public Service Commission to hire auditors. The OAG complained to the IMF that they faced a significant staffing shortage — a deficit of 1,500 staff members — mainly due to fiscal constraints preventing necessary government approvals for hiring.
Despite the fact that the budget of the Auditor General is classified as charged expenditure, which means it is not subject to a parliamentary vote, the OAG still needs to adhere to budget execution rules. Consequently, they are subject to budget releases by the Finance Division, subject to cash availability.
“This dependency on the Federal Secretariat for budget releases further limits the OAG’s operational independence”, critically important for Supreme Audit Institutions to perform their tasks as needed and required, it said.
As if that was not enough, the effectiveness of the audit process was further being undermined by the excessively long reports that contain repetitive recommendations and the lack of timely review by the PAC.
The Office of the Auditor General produced over 6,000 reports each year, but there was minimal or no follow-up from the Public Account Committee and the ministries and divisions. “As a result, 75 per cent of the 34,000 recommendations made by the Supreme Audit Institution are still pending discussion in the PAC.
Moreover, it pointed out that the audit reports were often too lengthy, with some reaching up to thousands of pages that included repetitive recommendations for years since these irregularities identified in the reports are not addressed by the executive agencies. For instance, the Federal Government Compliance Audit Report for FY2023-24 is 4,000 pages long.
On top of that, there are no systems in place for monitoring the response to or compliance with audit findings and recommendations, which further diminishes the impact and effectiveness of the audit process.
The IMF demanded the development of a system that could make executive authority responsible and accountable in case of non-compliance with audit recommendations as well as PAC directions.
For this, the lender suggested making appropriate amendments to the PAC regulations and AGP Act to empower these institutions to ensure compliance with their directives.
Going forward, the IMF also demanded streamlining audit reports by including concise recommendations for the most critical issues and organising findings by their impact and urgency, using visual tools like traffic light systems to indicate the severity of issues.
In addition, the Fund also demanded strengthening of the parliamentary oversight by mandating the PAC to review audit reports promptly, supported by a tracking system on implementation progress through a centralised secretariat for monitoring and improved transparency and accountability.

In a final that swung wildly in the space of 40 minutes, Pakistan were bowled out for 125 after yet another top-order meltdown, only for their spinners to rip through Bangladesh ‘A’ and leave them reeling at 53 for 7.
A gritty 43-run eighth-wicket stand between Rakibul Hasan and SM Meherob threatened the unthinkable, before three huge sixes in the 19th over from Abdul Gaffar Saqlain took the game to a Super Over.
Ahmed Daniyal lean-bowled both batters in the first four balls of the Super Over to restrict Bangladesh to just six.
Ripon Mondol, Bangladesh’s hero with the ball in the main game, started superbly with two yorkers but Saad Masood’s flicked four off the third legitimate delivery sealed a famous victory for Pakistan Shaheens.
Earlier, Shaheens’ batting woes resurfaced on a tricky two-paced surface. They lost Yasir Khan to a run-out off the very first ball when Gaffar’s brilliant direct hit caught the opener short.
Two balls later, Mohammad Faiq was castled by left-arm spinner Meherob and when Ghazi Ghori played down the wrong line to Rakibul, Pakistan were 25 for 3 in the powerplay.
Maaz Sadaqat counter-attacked briefly with a 23-ball 23, but once he chopped on against part-time off-spinner Jishan Alam, the innings fell away.
Only Arafat Minhas (25) and a fighting 38 from 26 balls by Saad — the only batter to strike at above 100 after the powerplay — offered resistance.
Bangladesh’s spinners strangled the middle overs, Rakibul finishing with 2-16 and Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby a miserly 0-17 from his four.
Mondol then blew away the lower order with a devastating 19th over that yielded three wickets for just two runs, including two pinpoint yorkers.
Chasing 126, Bangladesh looked well set at 36 for 1 after four overs, Habibur Rahman Sohan having launched Ubaid Shah for a huge six. But the introduction of spin turned the game on its head.
Arafat Minhas struck with his third ball, trapping Jishan lbw, and in his next over removed Mahidul Islam Ankon in identical fashion.
Saad then produced a rank long-hop that Sohan spooned to midwicket, and when Sufiyan Muqeem skidded one through Akbar Ali’s gate, Bangladesh had lost four wickets for eight runs.
Sufiyan, the outstanding bowler of the tournament, was unplayable at times, finishing with 3-11 from four overs including two googlies that crashed into the stumps.
At 53 for 7, Pakistan appeared home and dry, only for Rakibul (24) and Meherob (19) to add 37 crucial runs and keep Bangladesh hopes flickering.
The drama peaked in the final two overs; Shahid Aziz was hammered for three sixes in the 19th as Saqlain took 20 runs off it.
Needing seven off the last over, Daniyal kept his nerve, conceding just three runs and two byes off the first five balls before a leg-bye off the final delivery forced the tie.</p><small>2025-11-23 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23230114eea3292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956894/fo-denounces-indian-defence-ministers-delusional-dangerously-revisionist-remarks-about-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>FO denounces Indian defence minister’s ‘delusional, dangerously revisionist’ remarks about Sindh</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) issued a strong condemnation on Sunday, denouncing Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s “delusional and dangerously revisionist remarks” about Sindh.
The FO’s rebuke came after the Indian media quoted Singh as saying: “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”
According to Indian media outlets, Singh maintained while speaking at an event in Delhi that Sindhi Hindus from his generation never fully accepted the accession of the province to Pakistan.
Sindh has occasionally featured in Indian rhetoric on Pakistan, most often during heightened tensions or significant developments inside India.
Singh’s remarks at Sindhi Samaj Sammelan, an event of the Sindhi community, could have possibly been made to bolster political support by invoking historical and cultural claims.
The FO said in its response to the remarks that such statements revealed an “expansionist Hindutva mindset that seeks to challenge established realities and stands in clear violation of international law, the inviolability of recognised borders, and the sovereignty of states”.
“We urge Mr Rajnath Singh and other Indian leaders to refrain from provocative rhetoric that threatens regional peace and stability. It would be far more constructive for the Government of India to focus on ensuring the security of its own citizens, particularly vulnerable minority communities.
“It should hold accountable those who incite or perpetrate violence against them and address discrimination rooted in faith-based prejudice and historical distortions,” the FO statement read.
It added that India would also “do well to address the persistent grievances of the peoples in its northeast, many of whom continue to face systematic marginalisation, identity-based persecution, and cycles of state-enabled violence”.
“We call on India to take credible steps toward the genuine resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people under occupation.
“Pakistan remains committed to [a] peaceful resolution of all disputes with India on the basis of justice, equity and established international legal norms. At the same time, as in the past, Pakistan is firmly resolved to safeguard its security, national independence and sovereignty,” the FO statement said.
Ties between Pakistan and India have worsened since a four-day military conflict between the two neighbours in May.
The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.
New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Since then, military and political leaders on both sides have issued strongly worded statements and warnings.
In early October, the Pakistani military had warned that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and Islamabad would respond “resolutely, without any qualms or restraints”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had come in the wake of provocative remarks by the top Indian civil-military leadership.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,” it said.
In his remarks, Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must “stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wants to retain its place on the map”.
Meanwhile, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
For his part, Singh said during a speech: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”</p><small>2025-11-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/232233049d13bd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956891/israel-claims-to-have-killed-hezbollah-military-leader-in-beirut-strike' target='_blank'><strong>Israel claims to have killed Hezbollah military leader in Beirut strike</strong></a><br><p>Israel claimed to have killed Hezbollah’s top military official in an airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Sunday, despite a US-brokered truce a year ago.
The strike, the first on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital in months, targeted Hezbollah’s acting chief of staff, Ali Tabtabai, the military claimed in a statement.
There was no immediate confirmation of his killing from Hezbollah, although senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qmati confirmed a central figure from the group had been targeted.
Speaking near the bombed-out building in the Haret Hreik suburb, he said Israel’s strike crossed a “red line”. Qmati said Hezbollah’s leadership would decide on whether and how the group would respond.
Five dead in strike
The United States imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016, identifying him as a key Hezbollah leader and offering a reward of up to $5 million for information on him.
The Israeli military statement claimed Tabtabai “commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked hard to restore them to readiness for war with Israel”.
Lebanon’s health ministry said the strike killed five people and wounded 28 more. It hit a multi-storey building, sending debris crashing into cars on the main road below.
People rushed out of their apartment buildings out of fear of further bombardment, a Reuters reporter said.
Following the strike, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun urged the international community to intervene to halt Israeli attacks.
In a statement, Aoun said Lebanon “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”.
The strike came a week before Pope Leo is set to land in Lebanon on his first foreign trip, with many Lebanese hoping the visit could signal the country was heading towards better days.
The November 2024 ceasefire was meant to end a year of fighting between Hezbollah and the Israeli military, triggered by Hezbollah’s rocket fire on Israeli posts a day after the October 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian ally Hamas.
But Israel has kept up near-daily strikes on Lebanon since the truce, targeting what it says are Hezbollah arms depots, fighters and efforts by the group to rebuild. It has ratcheted up those strikes in recent weeks.
“We will not allow Hezbollah, the terror organisation, to recover and rebuild its strength and threaten Israel from anywhere inside of Lebanon,” Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters after the strike.
Asked if Israel had notified the US before carrying out the strike, Bedrosian said Israel makes decisions independently.
Earlier, a senior US official said Israel did not notify the United States in advance about its strike, an Axios reporter said on Sunday in a post on X.
The official said the administration was informed immediately after the strike and a second senior US official said Washington knew for days that Israel was planning to escalate strikes in Lebanon, the post read.
 






Israel already killed much of Hezbollah’s leadership
Israel eliminated much of the group’s leadership during the year-long war, including its then-leader Hassan Nasrallah.
Tel Aviv and Beirut have traded blame over ceasefire violations since 2024. Lebanon says Israel’s continuing strikes and occupation of five southern posts in Lebanese territories are major breaches. Aoun says he is open to negotiations but has not received a positive response from Israeli officials.
Israel accuses Hezbollah of trying to regroup in the south, and is pressuring Lebanon to be more aggressive in confiscating all unauthorised arms across the country, including Hezbollah’s.
Hezbollah has not fired on Israel since the ceasefire started and says it is abiding by it.</p><small>2025-11-23 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23214834ba59b00.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956892/5-member-fcc-bench-to-take-up-pti-leader-salman-akram-rajas-election-tribunal-plea-on-tuesday' target='_blank'><strong>5-member FCC bench to take up PTI leader Salman Akram Raja’s election tribunal plea on Tuesday</strong></a><br><p>A larger bench of the newly established Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) is scheduled to take up on Tuesday a petition filed by PTI’s Salman Akram Raja, who has sought the reversal of a court order on elections tribunals, which were formed to settle disputes of last year’s general elections.
According to a supplementary cause list on the FCC’s website, Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan has constituted a five-member bench comprising Justices Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah to hear the petition that was originally filed in the Supreme Court (SC) on July 22, 2024.
However, the review petition has now been fixed before the FCC, which was established under the 27th Amendment, on November 24.
In his petition, Raja requested the SC to revisit its earlier order suspending the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) notification of constituting eight election tribunals in Punjab.
He pleaded before the court that its order on July 4, 2024 had exposed the entire process of adjudication of election disputes in Punjab to the whims and arbitrary desires of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
On July 4, 2024, a five-judge SC bench, headed by then-chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, had also ordered a meaningful consultation between LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja for the formation of the tribunals.
The review petition pleaded that without providing any guidance with respect to the meaning and scope of the term “consultation” as used in Section 140(3) of the Elections Act, 2017, the LHC chief justice was directed by the SC to engage in consultation with the ECP.
The scope of the word “consultation” had been elaborately defined by the SC in the 1996 Al-Jehad Trust case and the same interpretation had been consistently followed in all matters pertaining to judicial appointments, it argued.
The petition contended that the view of the high court CJ with respect to the suitability of a particular person’s appoi­nt­m­ent as judge of any court should be granted the highest regard and consideration.
It said the LHC judgement had correctly held that the names of judges of the high court provided by the chief justice through a letter on April 4, 2024 may not be departed by the ECP as a matter of right or arbitrary discretion.
The view adopted by the ECP that it was entitled to disregard any name provided by the LHC chief justice without assigning any reasons had been held to be without any lawful basis, the review petition said.
Raja argued that during the hearing before the Supreme Court, two of the members on the bench were very clear in their rejection of the ECP’s claim that it was entitled to receive panels of names from the LHC chief justice for it to choose judges for appointment to the election tribunals in its discretion.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had clearly asked the ECP counsel to identify the basis in the text of the Elections Act or anywhere else in the law or in the Constitution for the contention that the ECP was to be provided panels of judges for each election tribunal to be appointed so that the commission could choose one of the judges for appointment.
“No answer to this query could be provided by the counsel for ECP,” the petition said, adding that in the law, there was no basis for the ECP demanding a panel of judges for each election tribunal so that it might reject some or all contained in the panel provided by the high court chief justice.

The win sealed for Pakistan a spot in the November 29 final.
Chasing a formidable 196, Zimbabwe were skittled for a paltry 126 in 19 overs, collapsing from 60 for 4 to 60 for 7 in the space of just five deliveries during a mesmerising 10th over from the 25-year-old Usman.
The Rawalpindi crowd erupted as the unorthodox spinner became only the fourth Pakistani to take a T20I hat-trick.
Zimbabwe never recovered from the early blows delivered by Pakistan’s pace battery.
Naseem Shah struck with his sixth ball when Tadiwanashe Marumani (four) chipped tamely to cover point, and Mohammad Wasim Jr clean-bowled the dangerous Brian Bennett (nine) with a sharp inswinger to reduce the visitors to 14 for 2.
Brendan Taylor looked scratchy and fell for eight, spooning a simple catch to Babar Azam at cover off Faheem Ashraf.
Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe’s captain and biggest hope, counter-attacked with 23 off 18 balls, launching Faheem for a huge six over deep midwicket. But once he picked out the same fielder off Mohammad Nawaz in the eighth over, the innings fell apart spectacularly.
Ryan Burl waged a lone battle, stroking an elegant unbeaten 67 from 49 balls (eight fours, two sixes) with exquisite timing and placement.
His fifty came off 32 deliveries and featured a 101-metre slog-sweep off Nawaz — the biggest six of the night — but he received no support whatsoever.
The defining moment arrived in the 10th over. Tony Munyonga top-edged a sweep to short fine leg, Tashinga Musekiwa played too early and was bowled off his pads, and Wellington Masakadza skied a slog-sweep straight to long-on to complete Usman’s hat-trick.
Usman returned later to castle Tinotenda Maposa and finish with career-best figures.
Burl continued to fight, adding 44 runs for the last wicket with Richard Ngarava (five), who was eventually run out off the final ball. But the result had long been sealed.
Earlier, a sensational late assault from Fakhar Zaman, who blazed an unbeaten 27 off just 10 balls with three sixes and a four, lifted Pakistan to a formidable 195 for 5.
Coming in at number seven, Fakhar turned the final two overs into a personal highlight reel.
He smoked Brad Evans for 25 runs in the last over, including two towering sixes and a deftly placed four, while also benefiting from a crucial no-ball that reprieved him on the final delivery.
In all, Pakistan plundered 69 runs from the last five overs after a more measured start.
Earlier, Babar Azam and Sahibzada Farhan had laid a solid platform with a classy 103-run second-wicket partnership.
Sahibzada, continuing his rich vein of form, struck a brisk 63 off 41 balls (four fours and three sixes) before falling in the 16th over to Raza’s skiddy arm-ball.
Babar, who had looked scratchy in the powerplay, grew into his innings beautifully, reaching 74 off 52 deliveries (seven fours and two sixes) before holing out to deep midwicket off Raza in the 18th over.
Pakistan’s innings began cautiously after they were asked to bat first. Saim Ayub threatened fireworks with two early sixes but perished for 13, pulling Evans to deep square leg.
Farhan and Babar then rebuilt steadily; the former racing to a 32-ball fifty with elegant drives and pulls, while Babar, after a slow start, found his timing in the second half of the innings, bringing up his fifty in 43 balls before accelerating.
A middle-order wobble — Faheem run out for three, Babar and Mohammad Nawaz falling in quick succession — briefly pegged Pakistan back to 167 for 5 with less than two overs remaining.
But Fakhar’s pyrotechnics ensured the hosts posted what appears a challenging total on a surface that offered occasional low bounce and grip for the spinners.</p><small>2025-11-23 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231933500ebe63c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956888/lifetime-immunity-for-public-office-holders-has-concentrated-unchecked-power-in-hands-of-a-few-hrcp' target='_blank'><strong>Lifetime immunity for public office holders has concentrated ‘unchecked power in hands of a few’: HRCP</strong></a><br><p>In a statement issued on Sunday after its 39th annual general meeting, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concern over the 27th Constitutional Amendment, noting that lifetime immunity for public 0ffice holders had “concentrated unchecked power in the hands of a few”.
The contentious tweak was passed by Parliament on November 13 after days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, and received the president’s assent the same day.
 
 

The amendment made significant changes to the judicial system and the military’s chain of command, and granted sweeping immunities to government officials. Under the Amendment, lifetime immunity from arrest and all criminal and civil proceedings has been granted to the president and anyone holding the ranks of Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet and Marshal of the Air Force.
Referring to the Amendment, the HRCP drew attention to “escalating threats to constitutional democracy, civic freedoms, and the safety of vulnerable communities across the country”.
The HRCP said it “is deeply concerned over the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which undermines judicial independence by expanding executive control over matters that should remain free from executive interference”.
“The amendment further weakens essential checks and balances at a time when public trust in state institutions is fragile. Lifetime immunity for holders of public office has concentrated unchecked power in the hands of a few, eroding parliamentary supremacy,” the commission’s statement read.
The human rights body also stressed that empowered and elected local governments were critical for deepening democracy and strengthening citizens’ participation in governance.
It underlined that efforts to curb militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan “must protect fundamental freedoms and the right to dissent”.
“Blanket internet shutdowns in Balochistan and other parts of the country have disrupted education, livelihoods, and democratic participation and must end immediately.
 
 

“[The] HRCP urges the federal and provincial governments to implement rights-respecting security measures, conduct impartial investigations into abuses by state actors, and engage meaningfully with local communities. This includes ending enforced disappearances and the use of interment centres without due process.”
“The use of the Fourth Schedule to muzzle dissent must cease,” the statement said.
 
 

The Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 (ATA) is a list of individuals placed under observation by the government on suspicion of their involvement in terrorism or sectarianism.
The statement added that the HRCP “notes with alarm the ongoing harassment, detention, and forced repatriation of Afghan refugees, many facing credible threats of persecution, family separation, and severe humanitarian distress”.
“The government must suspend deportations, ensure due process, and uphold international protection standards. Pakistan should ratify the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol and protect the right to citizenship by birth and naturalisation,” the HRCP emphasised.
It further stated that custodial torture and extrajudicial killings, “particularly involving Crime Control Department and Counter-Terrorism Department personnel”, demanded urgent independent inquiries and accountability.
“Such violations perpetuate impunity and threaten citizens’ right to life and dignity.”
Moreover, the HRCP noted that religious minorities, especially Ahmadis, continued to face mob violence, attacks on their sites or worship and desecration of graves.
 
 

The state must ensure protection, prosecute incitement, and implement the delayed commission to investigate misuse of the blasphemy law, as well as legislate against forced conversions, the HRCP statement added.
It further said that child marriage remained pervasive in the country, endangering girls’ health, education, and futures.
“[The] HRCP calls for legislative reforms to define a minor consistently across laws and declare all marriages under 18 illegal.
“Sexual harassment in educational, public and private institutions also persists; robust reporting, transparent accountability, and preventive training are essential to safeguard learning environments and workplaces.”
The HRCP also urged the government to protect climate-displaced persons, especially in Gilgit-Baltistan, with safe shelter, essential services and sustainable resettlement solutions.
The authorities must also ensure long-term support for rebuilding homes and livelihoods for those affected by the recent floods, particularly in South Punjab, the HRCP said.
Lastly, the human rights body stressed that incarcerated Indian and Pakistani fisherfolk must be repatriated to their respective countries and receive humane treatment, legal representation and protection from arbitrary detention to preserve their rights and livelihoods.</p><small>2025-11-23 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231136438f62c9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956865/tejas-crash-dampens-export-hopes-for-indian-fighter-jet' target='_blank'><strong>Tejas crash dampens export hopes for Indian fighter jet</strong></a><br><p>The crash of India’s Tejas fighter in front of global arms buyers at the Dubai Airshow is the latest blow to a key national trophy, leaving the jet reliant on Indian military orders to sustain its role as a showcase of home-built defence technology.
The cause of Friday’s crash was not immediately known but it capped a week of jockeying for influence at the event, attended by India’s arch-rival Pakistan six months after the neighbouring foes faced off in the world’s largest air battle in decades.
Such a public loss will inevitably overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts said, as India paid tribute to Wing Commander Namansh Syal who died in the crash.
Crash at showcase event in Dubai
“The imagery is brutal,” said Douglas A. Birkey, executive director of the US-based Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, referring to the history of crashes at air shows where nations and industries seek to tout major national achievements.
“A crash sends quite the opposite signal: a dramatic failure,” he said, adding, however, that while the Tejas would suffer negative publicity, it would most likely regain momentum.
Dubai is the world’s third-largest air show after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough, and accidents at such events have become increasingly rare.
In 1999, a Russian Sukhoi Su-30 crashed after touching the ground during a manoeuvre at the Paris Airshow, and a Soviet MiG-29 crashed at the same event a decade earlier. All crew ejected safely and India went on to place orders for both jets.
Fighter sales “are driven by high order political realities, which supersede a one-off incident”, said Birkey.
Powered by GE engines
The Tejas programme began in the 1980s as India sought to replace vintage Soviet-origin MiG-21s, the last of which retired as recently as September after numerous extensions due to slow Tejas deliveries by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).
The state-owned company has 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variant on order domestically but is yet to begin deliveries due to engine supply chain issues at GE Aerospace.
A former HAL executive who left the company recently said the crash in Dubai “rules out exports for now”.
Target markets included Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and HAL also opened an office in Malaysia in 2023.
“The focus for the coming years would be on boosting production of the fighter for domestic use,” the former executive said, requesting anonymity.
But the Indian Air Force is worried about its shrinking fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 29 from an approved strength of 42, with early variants of the MiG-29, Anglo-French Jaguar and French Mirage 2000 set to retire in coming years.
“The Tejas was supposed to be their replacement,” an IAF officer said. “But it is facing production issues.”
As an alternative, India is considering off-the-shelf purchases to fill immediate gaps, with options including more French Rafales, two Indian defence officials said, adding that India still plans to add to about 40 Tejas already in service.
India is also weighing competing offers from the US and Russia for 5th-generation F-35 and Su-57 fighters — two advanced models also rarely sharing a stage in Dubai this week.
‘Base’ for future programmes
India has for years been among the world’s biggest arms importers, but has increasingly projected the Tejas as an example of self-reliance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a sortie in the fighter in November 2023.
Like most fighter programmes, the Tejas has fought for attention at the intersection of technology and diplomacy.
Development was initially held up partly by sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests as well as problems in developing local engines, said Walter Ladwig, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
But the jet’s long-term significance is “likely to lie less in sales abroad than in the industrial and technological base it creates for India’s future combat-aircraft programmes,” he said.
Regional rivalry plays out
Both India and Pakistan were present in force at the show, where the Tejas performed multiple aerial displays in the presence of the rival Pakistani contingent.
Pakistan disclosed the signing of a provisional agreement with a “friendly country” to supply its JF-17 Thunder Block III fighter, co-developed with China.
On the ramp, a JF-17 was flanked by arms including PL-15E, the export variant of a family of Chinese missiles that US and Indian officials say brought down at least one French Rafale used by India during an aerial battle with Pakistan in May.
At an exhibition stand, manufacturer PAC distributed brochures touting the JF-17, one of two models deployed by Pakistan during the four-day conflict, as “battle-tested”.
India is a lot more careful with the Tejas, which was not actively used in the four-day conflict in May, Indian officials have said, without giving any reasons.
Nor did it participate in the annual January 26 Republic Day aerial display in New Delhi this year due to what officials said were safety reasons associated with single-engine aircraft.</p><small>2025-11-23 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23171623d9ab828.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956869/power-outage-at-karachi-pumping-stations-resolved-citywide-water-services-back-to-normal-kwsc-claims' target='_blank'><strong>Power outage at Karachi pumping stations resolved, citywide water services back to normal, KWSC claims</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) said in a statement on Sunday that power outages at water pumping stations had been resolved and that citywide water services were normal.
Karachi faced a severe water crisis in November as prolonged power outages across the city disrupted pumping operations.
In a statement released today, the KWSC said they maintained close coordination with K-Electric throughout the crisis to restore the water supply, and officials confirmed that “citywide water services have now returned to normal.”
“All possible steps are being taken to further strengthen the water supply system in the future,” the KWSC said.
Per the KWSC, the city experienced a total shortfall of 884 million gallons of water due to electricity disruptions.
“The Dhabeji Pumping Station was hit hardest, with 132 hours and 20 minutes of power outages leading to a shortage of 424 million gallons, while the Dumlottee Wells recorded 146 hours of outages, resulting in 111 million gallons of lost water,” the statement read, quoting the spokesperson.
It added that North East Karachi Pumping Station alone faced a deficit of 335 million gallons, while smaller stations saw comparatively lower shortages — 6 million gallons at Hub and Pipri stations and 2 million gallons at the Gharo station.
Officials at the central pumping stations said operations were halted for several hours during the month due to persistent outages, the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
“Measures should be taken to ensure a stable and uninterrupted power supply,” they added, warning that repeated cable faults had already caused significant damage to pumping machinery.
The statement said that recommendations include setting up alternative feeders, standby cables, and technical upgrades to safeguard central stations.</p><small>2025-11-23 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23164807b37698f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956881/eu-and-pakistan-urge-afghanistan-to-root-out-terror-on-its-soil-ensure-womens-rights-in-joint-statement' target='_blank'><strong>EU and Pakistan urge Afghanistan to root out terror on its soil, ensure women’s rights in joint statement</strong></a><br><p>In a joint statement shared on Sunday, Pakistan and the European Union (EU) called on Afghanistan to deal with terrorist organisations operating from its soil and to ensure the protection of human rights, especially those of women and girls.
The development came as the 7th Strategic Dialogue between Pakistan and the EU was convened in Brussels. The meeting was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the EU’s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas.
According to a joint statement shared by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar and Kallas discussed relations between Islamabad and Kabul amid cross-border tensions last month, with both top diplomats reaffirming their commitment to regional peace, stability, prosperity, and resolving issues with neighbours through dialogue.
“The two sides called on Afghanistan’s de facto authorities to play a constructive role in achieving the shared objective of rooting out terrorism from Afghan soil,” the statement read.
It added that Dar and Kallas expressed concern over Kabul’s deteriorating socioeconomic conditions and were in favour of a “peaceful, stable and self-reliant Afghanistan”.
They also hoped that Afghanistan would advocate for a “credible political process aligned with the UN-led ‘Doha process’, and in line with the commitments made by the Taliban de facto Authorities to the international community”, according to the statement.
It added that the EU appreciated Pakistan’s hosting millions of Afghan nationals for over four decades, but emphasised that any repatriation must be “safe, dignified and in line with international standards”.
“Both sides called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure protection of human rights, especially for women, girls and vulnerable communities,” the statement read.
Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-11-23 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2316265902180e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956870/rana-sanaullah-again-extends-dialogue-offer-to-pti-for-solving-political-crises' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah again extends dialogue offer to PTI for solving political crises</strong></a><br><p>PML-N Senator Rana Sanaullah on Sunday reiterated the government’s offer to the opposition PTI to hold dialogue and resolve the long-standing political crises marring the country.
Speaking to the media in Faisalabad, Sanaullah said, “We are still in favour of politicians sitting together at a table to resolve issues.”
He recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “unconditional offer“ he made in August to all political parties to become a part of the ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’ (Charter for Stability of Pakistan).
Sanaullah was speaking to reporters as by-elections were underway today in PP-116, where his son-in-law Ahmed Shaharyar is contesting as the PML-N candidate.
 
 

On the PTI’s official boycott of most of the by-elections held today, Sanaullah said, “Imran Khan sahib is not even doing politics. He has never done politics. It is this country’s and the public’s misfortune that he was brought [into power].”
Sanaullah, also the PM’s political aide, assailed Imran for “always creating a deadlock”, while “democracy progresses through dialogue”.
“A person is sitting in jail, and from there he wants to spread chaos, anarchy and fitna (evil) in the country, and there are also examples of May 9 and Nov 26 present,” he said, referring to Imran and the PTI’s protests.
Weeks of negotiations between the government and the PTI in December last year failed to achieve any tangible results on major issues back then, as both parties accused each other of derailing the negotiations.
Late last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said there were no negotiations or talks ongoing between the party and the federal government or the military establishment.
‘PML-N only party deserving of votes’
Speaking about the by-election, Sanaullah said there had been “no complaints” from anywhere in the constituency regarding the polling process, dismissing allegations of rigging and disturbances in different constituencies.
“We hope that people will vote for service, progress and solutions to their issues,” Shaharyar’s father-in-law said, adding that PML-N was the only deserving party for that.
On the low voter turnout, the senior politician contended that while general elections usually recorded a turnout of 50 to 60 per cent, by-polls only witnessed a 25 to 30pc turnout on average.
Sanaullah added: “There should be no such incident as Oct 12, 1999 or 2017/2018 when a conspiracy was done against Pakistan and a project was launched, which injected the culture of hatred [… and] enmity into politics.”
 


The senator said, “I contested seven elections in my constituency, out of which I won five. So my performance is in front of everyone. And as far as rigging is concerned, the voting process is being carried is in front of you, and the counting will take place in front of you.
“But despite that, if someone wants to cry foul,  and if someone has started crying foul since yesterday and today morning about rigging, then we have no solution for that,” he added.
“The era of development has returned in the name of Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” Sanaullah said, referring to the Punjab chief minister’s election last year.
The PML-N leader also highlighted that the party halted certain development projects in Faisalabad in line with the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) campaigning rules.
“There were projects worth Rs70 billion to be started in Faisalabad, including a metro project and a scheme to supply fresh water to the entire city. But we requested to halt it for the time being and proceed after the election so that people cannot say we only did that for the sake of elections.”</p><small>2025-11-23 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231637202cd35da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956872/pakistan-urges-urgent-grant-based-climate-finance-at-cop30' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges urgent grant-based climate finance at COP30</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for rapid, grant-based, and predictable financing for climate-vulnerable developing countries, warning that recurring climate disasters are exacerbating debt distress and undermining development gains in nations that have contributed the least to global emissions.
The appeal was made at a high-level side event titled “Operationalising Loss and Damage: Financing Resilience and Recovery in Vulnerable Countries”, organised jointly by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and Unicef at the Pakistan Pavilion during the UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil.
Secretary for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Aisha Humera Moriani, in her keynote address, stated that Pakistan was investing heavily in strengthening national resilience despite contributing less than one per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions.
She recalled the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025 that displaced millions, damaged infrastructure and caused multi-billion-dollar economic losses. “The scale and frequency of such disasters in developing countries underscore the disproportionate climate burden placed on nations that played almost no role in heating the planet,” she said.
Representatives of the newly established Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), government officials, development partners and experts attended the event to discuss ways of operationalising the global Loss and Damage mechanism.
Panellists noted that repeated climate shocks had pushed several vulnerable economies into what they described as a “debt emergency,” forcing them to borrow for reconstruction in the absence of adequate grant-based support.
They stressed that new, additional and concessional financing was essential if Loss and Damage assistance was to be transformative rather than short-lived.
Speakers also highlighted that children were bearing the greatest burden of climate stress, with Pakistan having nearly half its population under 18.
Recurring disasters, they said, were severely affecting nutrition, health, education and mental wellbeing. “Climate disasters are not only destroying infrastructure, they are also robbing a generation of its right to safety and opportunity,” Moriani added.
The discussion further underscored the need to prioritise the Barbados Implementation Modalities (BIM), which call for simplified application procedures, faster disbursement and flexible financial windows to support countries with constrained fiscal space.
Participants also emphasised the importance of financing mechanisms that can address slow-onset events such as glacial melt, desertification and sea level rise.
Ministry spokesperson Muhammad Saleem Shaikh told APP that a significant part of the dialogue focused on support for vulnerable groups, particularly children and young people.
He pointed out that non-economic losses — including trauma, cultural disruption, displacement and community breakdown — remained insufficiently recognised in global policy frameworks.
He added that Pakistan had announced its readiness to submit two proposals under the FRLD’s initial funding cycle, aimed at rebuilding critical social infrastructure and strengthening resilience in key sectors, including agriculture, community systems and water resources.
While domestic resources were being mobilised, he said, the scale of climate-related loss far exceeded national capacity.
Calling Loss and Damage financing a matter of national survival, the ministry reiterated Pakistan’s position that climate justice and the principles of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) must guide international action. “Climate justice demands immediate access. Our people cannot wait,” the ministry stated, urging developed countries and multilateral institutions to translate commitments into tangible financial delivery.
Moriani reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working with the UN, international partners and global climate finance bodies to shape an equitable framework for climate recovery.
The goal, she said, was to ensure that vulnerable countries receive the resources needed to recover, rebuild and adapt to accelerating climate impacts.</p><small>2025-11-23 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2314510197a39ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956868/after-ambani-zoo-probe-wildlife-body-reverses-call-to-curb-animal-imports-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>After Ambani zoo probe, wildlife body reverses call to curb animal imports to India</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations wildlife trade body decided on Sunday not to restrict India from importing endangered animals, after many countries supported reversing an earlier, stringent recommendation that had embroiled the private zoo run by Asia’s richest family.
Vantara, a 3,500-acre zoo in Gujarat run by the philanthropic arm of the Reliance conglomerate led by Mukesh Ambani and his family, had faced allegations from non-profit and wildlife groups of improper imports of some animals, triggering higher scrutiny by Germany and the European Union.
After visiting the facility in September, the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) issued a report this month asking India to “not issue any further import permits” as discrepancies had been found between exporter and importer trade data, and there were insufficient checks on the origin of some animals.
At the CITES meeting in Uzbekistan, live-streamed on Sunday, the recommendation was reversed after many countries, including India, the United States, Japan, and Brazil, said the measure was too premature, with some also saying there was no evidence of illegal imports into India.
“There doesn’t seem to be enough support for retaining the recommendation,” Naimah Aziz, Chair of the CITES Standing Committee, told the delegates, adding that it could consider if further regulatory measures were needed.
CITES is a global treaty that regulates trade in endangered plants and animals. India had earlier opposed the UN recommendation.
Vantara, which previously said it remains committed to transparency and legal compliance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vantara Zoo has animals from around the world
The Vantara zoo houses around 2,000 species, including exotic animals imported from South Africa, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo, such as snakes, tortoises, tigers, giraffes and spiny-tailed lizards.
While India’s delegate affirmed the country’s commitment to CITES’ compliance, Belgium and at least one conservation group, the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance, on Sunday pushed to suspend exports to India until concerns were addressed.
In September, an Indian Supreme Court-appointed investigation cleared Vantara of wrongdoing, while the facility said it complies with all laws.
European Environment Commissioner Jessika Roswall said in August that EU states “will pay particular attention to any export requests directed towards India and the facility in question”.</p><small>2025-11-23 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23132419a5d1835.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956867/fo-slams-israeli-attacks-in-gaza-as-blatant-violation-of-international-law' target='_blank'><strong>FO slams Israeli attacks in Gaza as ‘blatant violation of international law’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday strongly condemned the continued Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip as a “blatant violation of international law”.
Despite a ceasefire signed by Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israeli forces have continued to regularly bombard Gaza with airstrikes, with the latest attack on Saturday leaving at least 21 dead in the territory.
A statement issued by the FO today said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks by Israeli occupying forces across Gaza.”
It added that the attacks had reportedly resulted in the deaths of several Palestinian civilians and left many more wounded.
“Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international law, relevant UN resolutions, and the recently concluded peace agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh,” the FO said.
It said that the attacks also undermined international efforts aimed at achieving “lasting peace and stability” in the region.
“The Government of Pakistan reiterates its call upon the international community to take immediate steps to end Israeli impunity and ceasefire violations, and to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law,” the statement said.
It reaffirmed Pakistan’s principled position in favour of establishing “an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital”.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza began on October 7, 2023 and has lasted over two years, with previous attempts at a ceasefire having failed. Over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the onslaught; of these, according to the Gaza Government Media Office, around 342 were killed in the last 44 days since the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-11-23 08:45</small></div><hr>
