Since Trump joined Israel’s campaign by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday morning, Tehran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate.
But while it has continued to fire missiles at Israel, it has yet to take action against the United States itself, either by firing at US bases or by targeting the 20 per cent of global oil shipments that pass near its coast at the mouth of the Gulf.
“Mr Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,” Ebrahim Zolfaqari, spokesperson for Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters, said on Monday in English at the end of a recorded video statement.
 






Iran and Israel traded another wave of air and missile strikes on Monday as the world braced for Tehran’s response.
Trump’s administration has repeatedly said that its aim is solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear programme, not to open a wider war.
But in a social media post on Sunday, Trump openly spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 revolution.
“Its not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldnt there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!” he wrote.
 


Experts surveying commercial satellite imagery said it appeared that the US attack had severely damaged the site of Iran’s Fordow nuclear plant, built inside a mountain, and possibly destroyed it and the uranium-enriching centrifuges it housed, although there was no independent confirmation.
Trump called the strike a “Bullseye!!!”.
“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran,” he wrote. “The biggest damage took place far below ground level.”
 


More Israeli strikes
Israel’s airstrikes on Iran have met little resistance from Iranian defences since Israel launched its surprise attack on June 13, killing many of Iran’s top commanders.
The Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight. In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, it said.
Iranian news agencies reported air defences had been activated in central Tehran districts, and Israeli air strikes had hit Parchin, the location of a military complex southeast of the capital.
Iran says more than 400 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, but has released few images of the damage since the initial days of the bombing. Tehran, a city of 10 million people, has largely emptied, with residents fleeing to the countryside to escape attacks.
Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes on Israel have killed 24 people, all civilians, and injured hundreds, the first time a significant number of Iranian missiles have ever penetrated Israeli defences.
The Israeli military said a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday had been intercepted by Israeli defences. Air raid sirens blared overnight in Tel Aviv and other parts of central Israel.
Limited retaliation
Beyond those missiles, Iran’s ability to retaliate is far more limited than a few months ago, since Israel inflicted defeat on Iran’s most feared regional proxy force, Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose downfall was swiftly followed by that of Iran’s most powerful client ruler, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.
Iran’s most effective threat to hurt the West would probably be to restrict global oil flows from the Gulf. Oil prices spiked on Monday at their highest since January. But they have not yet shot up to crisis levels, indicating that traders see a path out of the conflict that avoids serious disruption.
Brent crude futures were down 0.5pc to $76.64 a barrel as of 8:30am GMT (1:30pm PKT), after briefly jumping above $80 at the opening.
Iran’s parliament has approved a move to close the Strait of Hormuz that leads into the Gulf, which would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council, a body led by an appointee of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Attempting to strangle the strait could send global oil prices skyrocketing, derail the world economy and invite conflict with the US Navy’s massive Fifth Fleet that patrols the Gulf from its base in Bahrain.
“It’s economic suicide for them if they do it. And we retain options to deal with that,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
As Tehran weighed its options, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today. The Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel.
Speaking in Istanbul yesterday, Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses and there would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated. TASS news agency later quoted him as saying Iran and Russia were coordinating their positions.</p><small>2025-06-23 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/231451590493a27.gif?r=145210' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360/pre-monsoon-rains-underway-in-various-punjab-districts' target='_blank'><strong>Pre-monsoon rains underway in various Punjab districts</strong></a><br><p>Pre-monsoon rains were recorded on Monday in various districts of Punjab in the last 24 hours, according to the its Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Last week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) predicted that pre-monsoon rains would fall across the country between June 20 and 23.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
“37 mm of rain was recorded in the Lahore Airport area, while 4 mm of rain was recorded in the rest of the city,” the PDMA Spokesperson said in a press release.
The statement added that Noorpur Thal received 29 mm of rain, Shamsabad in Rawalpindi 14 mm, Gujranwala 28 mm, Sialkot 11 mm, Mianwali 10 mm, while Hafizabad received 9 mm of rain.
5 mm of rain was recorded in Sargodha, 04 mm in Jhang, 1 mm in Joharabad, Gujrat and Kasur.
Light rain was also recorded in Faisalabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sheikhupura and Narowal, according to the PDMA.
“This series of pre-monsoon rains is likely to continue till June23 [today],” a PDMA spokesperson said.
Rain is likely to continue in Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Dera Ghazi Khan and Sahiwal, the statement said.
Punjab PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathi instructed citizens to take precautionary measures, adding that they should stay in safe places during lightning and thunder.
“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a proper distance,” the DMGA DG said.
Last Saturday, most parts of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad received heavy to light rain, bringing respite from the heatwave.
In the four days leading up to Saturday, mercury remained above 40 degrees Celsius, with the maximum 43 degrees recorded on Thursday. The rain on Saturday brought down the temperature by 3°C to 34°C in the federal capital and garrison city.</p><small>2025-06-23 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/23143937b09cc03.jpg?r=144845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919361/asia-currently-warming-nearly-twice-as-fast-as-global-average-wmo-report' target='_blank'><strong>Asia currently warming nearly twice as fast as global average: WMO report</strong></a><br><p>Asia is currently warming nearly twice as fast as the global average, fueling more extreme weather and wreaking a heavy toll on the region’s economies, ecosystems and societies, according to a report published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on the ‘State of the Climate in Asia 2024’ published on Monday.
The State of the Climate reports, which provide policy-relevant information for national and regional decision-making, have previously reported in 2024 that the impact of heatwaves in Asia was becoming more severe, with melting glaciers threatening the region’s future water security.
The new report says that 2024 was the warmest or second-warmest year on record depending on the dataset, with widespread and prolonged heatwaves. The warming trend between 1991–2024 was almost double that of the 1961–1990 period.
Asia is the continent with the largest land mass extending to the Arctic, and is warming more than twice as fast as the global average because the temperature increase over land is larger than the temperature increase over the ocean.
In 2024, heatwaves gripped a record area of the ocean. Sea surface temperatures were the highest on record, with Asia’s sea surface warming rate 0.24°C per decade – nearly double the global average.
Sea level rise on the Pacific and Indian Ocean sides of the continent exceeded the global average, heightening risks for low-lying coastal areas.
 
 

In 2024, most of the ocean area of Asia was affected by marine heatwaves of strong, severe, or extreme intensity – the largest extent since records began in 1993.  The northern Indian Ocean and in the ocean area adjacent to Japan, the Yellow and East China seas were especially affected.
During August and September 2024, nearly 15 million square kilometers of the region’s ocean was impacted – one tenth of the Earth’s entire ocean surface, about the same size as the Russian Federation and more than 1.5 times the area of China.
Large parts of the Arctic Ocean experienced significant sea ice melt, with the ice edge shifting far northward by the end of the season.
In the High-Mountain Asia (HMA) region, 23 out of 24 glaciers suffered continued mass loss during 2023-2024, intensified by reduced winter snowfall and extreme summer heat in the central Himalayas and most of the Tian Shan.
The HMA region, centered on the Tibetan Plateau, contains the largest volume of ice outside the polar regions, with glaciers covering an area of approximately 100 000 square km. It is known as the world’s Third Pole.
Over the last several decades, most glaciers in this region have been retreating.
“The melting of glaciers affects sea level, regional water cycles and the occurrence of local hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods”, the report said.
 
 

Substantial precipitation deficits in the region were observed around the Laptev Sea and the lower and middle course of the Lena River towards the Yablonoi Mountains (Russian Federation), and around the East Sayan (Russian Federation) and Khangai Mountains (Mongolia).  Parts of the Hindu Kush (Afghanistan) and western Himalayas (Pakistan) were drier than usual.
Meanwhile, severe snow melt and record-breaking rainfall in Central Asia (mainly Kazakhstan and southern Russia) led to the worst flooding in at least 70 years, forcing the evacuation of 118 000 people were evacuated.
West Asia was also hit by heavy rainfall: in the United Arab Emirates, 259.5 mm of rain fell in 24 hours – one of the most extreme precipitation events since records began in 1949.
Extreme rainfall wreaked havoc and heavy casualties in many countries in the region, and tropical cyclones left a trail of destruction, while drought caused heavy economic and agricultural losses.
“The State of the Climate in Asia report highlights the changes in key climate indicators such as surface temperature, glacier mass and sea level, which will have major repercussions for societies, economies and ecosystems in the region,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo according to a press release by the organisation.

“Extreme weather is already exacting an unacceptably high toll.”

 
 

“The work of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and their partners is more important than ever to save lives and livelihoods,” she said.
The report included a case study from Nepal, showing how strengthened early warning systems and anticipatory action enable communities to prepare for and respond to climate variability and change, thereby helping to protect lives and livelihoods.</p><small>2025-06-23 09:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/23143735ac9a50e.jpg?r=143814' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919329/either-india-shares-water-fairly-or-we-will-secure-it-from-all-6-rivers-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Either India shares water fairly or we will secure it from ‘all 6 rivers’: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday said India has the option to either share water fairly or “we will deliver water to us from all six (Indus river system) rivers”.
Delhi unilaterally suspended its participation in the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.
The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday had slammed Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s “brazen disregard” for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the IWT with Pakistan.

Speaking in the National Assembly during a session on the federal budget, Bilawal said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will deliver water to us from all six rivers.”
“The attack on Sindhu [Indus River] and India’s claim that the IWT has ended and it’s in abeyance, firstly, this is illegal, as the IWT is not in abeyance, it is binding on Pakistan and India, but the threat itself of stopping water is illegal according to the UN charter,” the former foreign minister said.
He continued that if India decides to follow through on the threat, we will have to wage war again.
 
 

He added that hopefully Pakistan won’t have to, but if it does have to, it is in the position to defeat India the same way it just did.
Bilawal further told lawamkers that peace between the two nuclear neighbours is impossible without cooperation, especially in counterterrorism efforts. “If India and Pakistan refuse to talk, and if there is no coordination on terrorism, then violence will only intensify in both countries,” he warned.
He said India was weaponising terrorism for political purposes. “India seeks to exploit terrorism as a political tool to harm Pakistan’s international standing,” he said, adding that during his diplomatic visits to the United Kingdom and European Union as foreign minister, it became evident that India had lobbied hard to reverse Pakistan’s progress on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) front.
“At a time when Pakistan had successfully moved from the FATF grey list to the white list, India made every effort to drag us back to the grey list using false narratives and diplomatic pressure,” he said. “But thanks to our Foreign Office, the prime minister, and his team, those efforts failed. Once again, Pakistan won — and India lost.”
Bilawal also urged renewed dialogue between Pakistan and India to curb regional instability. He added, “We are fighting not only for the public of Pakistan but also of India as well.”
He strongly criticised what he called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dangerous doctrine of escalation. “Under Modi’s new ‘abnormal’, any terrorist incident in India becomes an automatic pretext for launching hostilities against Pakistan,” Bilawal warned.
He questioned what would happen if Pakistan were to adopt the same policy. “We suffer from terrorist attacks ten times more than India, many of which are traced back to Indian funding or involvement. Should we then adopt a policy of automatic retaliation, too? That would mean surrendering our future to the will of terrorists.
“That might be Modi’s vision, but it is not ours. We will not let terrorists dictate regional peace,” he declared.
Last week, addressing a crowd of supporters, Bilawal had said that New Delhi must accept the IWT. Pakistan’s narrative had prevailed, not only in diplomatic circles, but also across international media, he claimed.
Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p><small>2025-06-23 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/231326450f0a7e7.jpg?r=140722' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919327/fact-check-viral-videos-do-not-show-us-attack-on-irans-nuclear-facilities' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral videos do not show US attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platforms since Sunday were sharing two videos, claiming they showed the United States’ attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. However, the videos do not show the US attacks but different instances from 2024.
A US airstrike on Sunday, codenamed “Operation Midnight Hammer”, targeted and “totally obliterated” Iran’s primary nuclear enrichment facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, President Donald Trump announced. Iran has condemned the strikes as a “barbaric violation” of international law and warned of “everlasting consequences”, including potential unilateral action such as closing the Strait of Hormuz.
On Sunday, an Indian user on X shared a video claiming it showed a US attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The footage featured a massive explosion at night, with towering flames and a large plume of smoke rising into the sky.
The caption read: “Video footage of the US attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities has emerged. The intensity and accuracy of the attack clearly shows that it was a highly planned action. Everyone is now waiting for Iran’s response. The situation has become extremely tense.”
The post garnered over 1.2 million views.
The post did not mention which of the three sites was show in the video.
The same video, with similar claims, was circulated by other users on X, with individual posts receiving over 1.5m, 200,000, and 12,000 views, respectively.
The claim was also widely shared by other users as can be seen here, here, here and here.
Similarly on Sunday, an X user shared an 8-second clip showing a massive explosion lighting up the night sky in the distance, with a bright fireball and smoke rising above a landscape.
The post’s caption said, “Major escalation: The US has launched airstrikes on Iran’s top nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. This marks a turning point in the regional conflict, with the US directly targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure for the first time.”
The post received over 493,000 views.
The same clip was shared by several other X users, as seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here collectively accumulating over 200,000 views.
The above posts mainly claimed that the video was from the attack on the Fordow nuclear site.
The same clip was found on Instagram which can be seen here, here and here.
Similarly, the clip was widely shared on Facebook too as can be seen here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claims due to their high virality and keen public interest in the US involvement in the the Iran-Israel conflict.
A reverse image search led to a news report published by US news outlet CNN on September 18, 2024, titled “Ukraine claims to have destroyed large Russian ammunition depot in overnight drone attack”.
The report included a video featuring identical visuals to those seen in the viral clip.
 


According to the news report, a Ukrainian drone strike targeted a major Russian weapons depot in the city of Toropets, located in the Tver region. The depot, reportedly used to store Iskander and Tochka-U missile systems along with other ammunition, was operated by Russia’s defence ministry. The overnight attack caused a massive explosion and fire, prompting evacuations and raising concerns about Russia’s missile capabilities. Ukraine described the strike as part of a deliberate effort to reduce Russia’s military strength.
The same video was also featured in a news report by British outlet Metro on September 19, 2024, titled: “Putin’s ‘impenetrable’ arms depot taken out in huge mushroom cloud blast”.
For the second video clip, a reverse image search yielded an X post from December 16, 2024, featuring the same video.
It was captioned: “Breaking: Israeli airstrike on Tartus, Syria.”
 






A keyword search for “Israel” and “Tartus, Syria” led to multiple news reports about Israel’s aggression in Syria in December 2024.
According to the reports, Israel launched airstrikes on Tartus in northwestern Syria, triggering massive explosions that were so powerful they registered as a 3.0 magnitude earthquake on nearby seismic sensors. The Israeli military stated that these strikes were aimed at preventing military infrastructure and equipment that were formerly under the control of the Assad regime from falling into the hands of rebel groups following the regime’s collapse.
The viral clip was also featured in a news bulletin from German state broadcaster DW News titled “Reports: Israel strikes missile storage sites in Syria’s Tartus region,” aired on December 16, 2024.
 


The viral clip appears at the 2:09-minute mark in the broadcast. Sky News Australia also aired the same footage.
 


Therefore, the fact-checks determined that the claims that two viral videos show attacks by the US on Iran’s nuclear facilities are false. The videos are not recent and date back to September 2024, when a Ukrainian drone strike destroyed an ammunition depot in Russia, and December 2024, when Israel conducted attacks in Syria’s Tartus region.

These fact checks were originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.</p><small>2025-06-23 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/231115063dc0730.jpg?r=133728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919320/indian-activists-seek-to-save-child-brides' target='_blank'><strong>Indian activists seek to save child brides</strong></a><br><p>When wedding season comes in India, the phone of child rights activist Tatwashil Kamble never stops ringing with appeals to stop girls from being married off due to poverty.
Kamble said he has helped stop thousands of illegal marriages in India, where nuptials before the age of 18 are banned.
“The elders of the village think: ‘How dare we come to stop a marriage in their village!’” said Kamble, who has been campaigning for more than a decade in western Maharashtra state.
Many families are motivated by poverty to marry off their daughters, so that the girls can start earning their own living.
When activists have sought to stop marriages, “it has led to physical altercations,” according to Kamble.
Sometimes they are able to stop the nuptials from taking place, or, if they arrive too late, then the bride is taken to a shelter and supported in deciding on her own future.
India accounts for one in three of the world’s child brides, according to the UN children’s agency, with at least 1.5 million girls getting married each year.
Kamble said he is driven by the bitter memory of seeing a teenager die of blood loss during labour.
“That’s when I thought: so many young girls are getting married and, even after their death, it’s not being called child marriage. They are saying ‘the mother has died’” without acknowledging she was a girl.

Wedding hotline
Kamble works in the Beed district of Maharashtra, an area dominated by sprawling sugarcane fields hit hard by years of drought.
Workers said they have little choice but to marry their daughters off young — arguing they do it to protect the girl, not harm her.
“It is not like we don’t like the idea of education,” said Manisha Barde, a sugarcane cutter who was a child bride herself.
“We want her to become a doctor.”
Barde, however, arranged for her teenage daughter to be married only to be stopped by authorities.
She did so because they were poor and, if they had “better jobs, we wouldn’t have thought of her marriage”.
Farm labourers said that when their children are little, relatives look after them or they come to the fields.
But when the girls become teenagers, their parents begin to worry —  either that they could start a relationship before marriage, or be subjected to sexual violence.
“There are very few girls who stay unmarried until 18,” said Ashok Tangde, district chief of the child welfare committee. “I have seen girls who have never seen a school,” he said.
Families worry for “the girl’s safety,” Tangde said, and even those opposed to child marriage can end up organising a wedding.
Tangde said his team received 321 calls from across the district about child marriages that were taking place, or about to happen, in the first five months of this year.
During peak wedding season, which runs from October to March, Tangde said he gets around 10 to 15 calls daily, which prompt his team and other activists to raid ceremonies.

‘Do the right thing’
Tangde has a dedicated network of activists and other informants who help in villages across the district, sending photographs of weddings.
“There are some people who want to do the right thing,” he said.
Sometimes the bride calls directly. Other times, a guest rings and makes the authorities listen to the wedding music.
“Disrupting a wedding… there is a lot of drama,” said Tangde. “People get ready to beat up those who go to stop such marriages.”
Jyoti Thorat was 16 when her parents married her off to a 20-year-old man, ending her hopes of continuing school and joining the police.
“My parents fixed it, and I wasn’t happy,” Thorat said, a decade later and a mother of two schoolboys.
Her older sisters had also been married off before they turned 18, with her parents prioritising getting their only son educated.
Thorat recalled with despair how work cutting cane beckoned soon after her wedding, a fate that awaits other girls.
“They have to start working as sugarcane workers that same year,” she said. “A machete is ready for them. “

As investigators attempt to piece together what went wrong and come up with a reasonable explanation for why the plane would have crashed soon after takeoff, one can only hope that commercial interests, and pressure from Boeing, the plane manufacturer, will not hinder an independent investigation. This is essential to restore passenger confidence and ensure flight safety in the future.
To put this in context, ever since Boeing “shifted from an engineering culture to a sales culture,” there have been serious concerns about quality control even as extensive flight tests prior to certification have been reduced.
Unsafe surroundings
The Air India flight AI 171, bound for London, crashed within 36 seconds of takeoff from Ahmedabad, after attaining a height of 625 feet, just 1.5 kilometres from the airfield. It crashed into a concrete building, the latter constructed in what should have been a sterile 10km radius around the aerodrome, free of waste and rubbish, especially along the takeoff or approach path.

It is an unfortunate reality that almost every civilian airport in the subcontinent  — India, Pakistan and Bangladesh — is surrounded by concrete structures, both residential and commercial. This is a gross irregularity, committed with the connivance of the respective regulator in each country. We experienced a similar situation in Karachi in 2020 when a PIA passenger plane travelling from Lahore crashed into a residential area a few hundred metres from the airport.
Where there is housing, there is also food waste, which provides the perfect breeding ground for big birds. These can cause major structural damage to the plane’s fuselage or engine and can also lead to a fatal accident if the foreign object damage (FOD) occurs within what is considered as the sensitive takeoff or approach phase.
The Ahmedabad Airport recorded 319 bird and wildlife strikes between January 2018 and October 2023. This is typical of many civil airports in the Subcontinent.
Here in Pakistan, politicised appointments in the Civil Aviation Authority are a major factor in compromising safety. It must be understood that there is a world of difference between commercial civil aviation, which is a highly regulated industry, and military aviation that works on a “Command and Control” structure. In all likelihood, if this concrete structure did not exist in the takeoff/ approach path of the Ahmedabad Airport, the chances of a crash landing, with relatively fewer fatalities was possible.

Faulty aircraft or pilot error?
Flight AI 117 was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel on a hot summer day. The right-wing GEnx-1B engine, manufactured by General Electric, and equipped with FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) was new, installed in March 2025, while the left-wing engine was due for servicing in December.
Air India has a fleet comprising 33 B787-8s. Certain components of this GEnx-1B engine have a fixed lifespan, which ranges between 15,000 to 20,000 cycles [A cycle is counted each time the engine is fired up, regardless of whether it is for five minutes or several hours].
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also has an EAFR (Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder) capable of withstanding extreme crash forces. It has two flight recorders, the Forward and Aft Recorders, each capable of storing 25 hours of crucial flight and engine parameters, besides two hours of cockpit voice and Air Traffic Control communication. According to media reports, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered on June 13 and the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) on June 16.
According to media reports, the recorders on Flight AI 117 are believed to be “too damaged to be processed locally” and would have to be sent to the US. The Indian government has, however, said that it has yet to decide where the recorders would be sent to be analysed. It is hoped that the recorders would provide substantive clues as to exactly what went wrong on that fateful flight.
One theory doing the rounds is that the crash may have been caused by a pilot error. According to Air India, “the flight was led by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, a highly experienced pilot and trainer with over 10,000 hours flying widebody aircraft.” It added that First Officer Clive Kunder, “had over 3,400 hours of flying experience.”
Analysts have pointed out that the landing gear on flight AI 117 was visible despite the fact that the plane had gained considerable height. It is standard operating procedure to retract the landing gear on the first indication of a positive climb, which occurs within a maximum of 6 seconds after rotation. The only reason for a delayed landing gear retraction is if the brakes are hot due to some malfunction.
Another theory being posited is that the aircraft lost one or both of its engines. However, the loss of a single engine is not a major emergency, because modern aircraft performance is based on One-Engine out — meaning it can function adequately on a single engine.
The loss of both engines, on a two-engine jet, is high unlikely. It can, however, be caused by bird congestion, simultaneous fuel starvation, or severe fuel contamination. One other cause of fuel starvation is a malfunctioning FADEC, the brain of the engine.
Another reason for the loss of both engines can be pilot error, when a live engine is cut off by mistake, instead of the failed engine. Such pilot errors, though highly unlikely, have occurred. It is part of pilot training to carry out this procedure from memory. In such a scenario, the pilot flying the aircraft brings the throttle to idle, while the pilot not flying cuts off the start lever, which effectively shuts fuel supply to the faulty engine.
In cases of emergency, a Ram Air Turbine (RAT) is also available on the aircraft to maintain essential flight systems in the event of a complete loss of power. In fact, investigators believe the system was likely operating when the aircraft crashed. Moreover, in the event that the engine catches fire, the pilot must pull the fire handle and activate the fire extinguisher.
All commercial airlines regularly conduct simulator checks every six months or earlier, which are monitored by the regulator. This is mandatory for pilot license renewal. The civil aviation regulator is required to ensure that such periodical checks are carried. It is also essential that the CAA/ regulator employ the services of an independent qualified pilot inspector, with experience on the particular type of aircraft and who should have no conflicts of interest.
Boeing’s troubles
Over the last several years, Boeing has witnessed its fair share of turmoil regarding the safety, or lack thereof, of some of its aircraft. On October 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, operated by B737 Max plunged into the Java Sea within minutes of takeoff, killing 189 people, while pilots struggled for control over an automated signal which pushed the nose down, sensing an impending stall. Indonesian investigators later blamed Boeing for a combination of aircraft design flaws, inadequate training and maintenance problems, adding that pilots were never told how to quickly respond to malfunctions of the aircraft’s automated flight-control system.

Around six months later on March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed after takeoff, killing 157 people. Within days of the second crash, Boeing tried to pin the blame on the pilots, but later accepted full responsibility for the crash, having “produced an airplane that had an unsafe condition”. This came after investigators found faults in the sensors and new flight control software that had not been explained to pilots.
Last year, yet another incident involving a 737 Max shattered confidence in the aircraft manufacturer when the door plug of Alaska flight 1282 blew out mid-flight, leaving a neat, refrigerator-sized, rectangular hole in the plane. The aircraft was subsequently able to land safely, with no injuries reported. Boeing later paid $160 million to Alaska Airlines as compensation for the incident.

In the recent past, conscientious whistleblowers, motivated by concerns for flight safety, have been persecuted by Boeing, while the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), under the influence of powerful members of the Congress, preferred to look the other way. Design and manufacturing faults, involving the Boeing 737MAX were ignored, including concerns about the flight control system, and no information was provided to pilots about any malfunctions. The aircraft itself was rolled out in haste, within a year of undergoing flight tests in August 2015. Previously, exhaustive tests, carried over a period of two to three years were essential for certification.
This is precisely what happens when powerful aircraft manufacturers, in collusion with regulators and unethical elements within government, are motivated by commercial profits alone, ignoring passenger safety concerns.
For now, both Boeing and General Electric — the manufacturer of the engine — have said they are prepared to support the investigators. The Air India B787-8 Dreamliner crash is the first major fatal crash of this aircraft. In January 2013, all B787s were grounded for nearly three weeks, following incidents of fire and smoke of Lithium-Ion batteries.
On April 17, 2024, The New York Times carried a report that a whistleblower Boeing Engineer, Sam Salehpour, appeared before the US Congress, pointing out safety concerns and irregularities in production shortcuts when sections of the Dreamliner were fastened together, which could “eventually lead to a crash if they continued unchecked”. He warned that lightweight composite materials, “improperly fastened together could break apart mid-flight after thousands of hours”. He was accompanied by another whistleblower, Ed Pierson, a former senior manager, who had previously testified before Congress about the B737MAX, along with an engineer Joe Jacobsen and a former airline pilot, identified as Shawn Pruchnicki.
Here too, however, commercial interests prevailed. Salehpour was punished by his superiors. As of now, it is too early to tell what really caused Air India’s worst aviation disaster in a decade. As investigators move to ascertain the facts, however, one thing is clear: whether this was a pilot error or a malfunction in the aircraft, this accident could have been avoided.

The meeting focused on the availability of food supplies, fuel provision and safe return of pilgrims and students from Iran, and the overall security and administrative conditions in these areas.
The meeting was briefed by authorities concerned on the current management strategies and future plans.
 
 

“At present there is no food shortage in the border areas,” officials concerned claimed at the meeting. However, reports reaching here say that the situation is not normal and the people are facing food and fuel shortages in these areas.
The chief minister ordered authorities concerned to ensure uninterrupted food and fuel supplies in these regions to prevent any public inconvenience. He also instructed the departments concerned to maintain electricity and LPG supply by implementing alternative solutions where necessary.
Mr Bugti said that coordination of the provincial government with the federal government is under way to improve the fuel and food items’ situation in Pak-Iran border areas of the province, and efforts are being made to secure fuel supplies for the border areas through the federal ministry of petroleum to prevent local shortages.
He stressed the importance of timely and coordinated actions to protect the people living in border areas from any potential food and fuel shortages.
He directed the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to keep an updated contingency plan ready to respond swiftly to any emergencies.

Talking to a private news channel, he said that Pakistan condemned the attacks carried out by Israel and is gravely concerned about the potential for further escalation in the region.
The threat of a wider war in the Middle East is real, he warned, calling for an immediate end to the hostilities. He said the recent crisis has revitalized Pakistan-Iran relations, with brotherly ties growing stronger.
Offering his analysis on the situation, he said, Israels existence poses a continuous threat to regional peace. The concept of peace with Israel is inherently contradictory.
He asserted that Israels so-called invincibility has been badly exposed. The spirits of the people of Gaza remains unshaken like rock solid.
He emphasized that Israel must abandon the illusion that bombing Muslim populations will crush their willpower. That is not going to happen, he said.
On Indias stance, he noted that India believed its international influence was substantial, but its rejection of US mediation reflects a weakness in global diplomacy.

The bridges had to be removed to construct the infrastructure for the BRT (bus rapid transit) system.
The situation has been causing a lot of trouble especially to female students of higher education institutions, located along the University Road since the footbridges were dismantled about three months ago.
In the absence of the bridges, the people attempting to cross the road have to put their lives at risk as the road remains packed with speeding vehicles.
Many accidents have taken place along the road. The victims included female students of the University of Karachi and the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology.
The issue has also led to increased travel cost for many students as they now have to take a cab or some other public transport means to get to the other side of the road, only to avoid getting hit by a vehicle.
 
 

This has left people feeling helpless and frustrated. Narrating her ordeal to Dawn, a KU student said: “It used to be a fast and cheap travel for me to get to the university. But ever since the pedestrian bridge there has been removed, it has become dangerous to cross the road, especially during morning rush hours when everyone is found rushing to work or an educational institution.”
“Now my brother and I have no choice but to take a rickshaw every day and our monthly travel cost has jumped from Rs1,200 to around Rs5,000,” she lamented.
Another student said: “It’s a major problem for both students and teachers. Until a few months back, we used to cross the road easily and reach the university directly but now we have to risk our lives crossing the main road struggling against fast-moving vehicles. Several accidents have already happened. On top of that, this issue adds both cost and time. For students already confronting traffic jams, it’s a serious issue that also affects their academic performance.”
Another student explained that the pedestrian bridge had some steps broken due to which a female student had slipped and suffered injuries. “I was concerned about its repair but suddenly the bridge was removed,” she said.
A resident of Gulistan-i-Jauhar said people are facing inconvenience due to the removal of the pedestrian bridges. “There’s no footbridge now along the .road and we have to cross the road making hectic efforts to avoid mishaps as hazardous construction material and ditches are also there,” he said.
It may be mentioned here that work on the Red Line BRT has been underway along the University Road since 2022 and the construction, being carried out at a snail’s pace, has led to multiple issues such as air pollution, traffic congestion and hazardous living conditions, besides tattered roads and pathways.

• Maintenance charges also make timeline to recover initial investment on hybrids longer
KARACHI: Despite lower taxes compared to gasoline vehicles, the adoption of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in Pakistan has been slow, largely due to the higher up-front cost that prolongs the recovery period.
The general sales tax (GST) on hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is 8.5 per cent compared to 12.5 to 25pc on various categories of locally assembled fossil fuel vehicles.
The GST on fossil fuel vehicles below 850cc is 12.5pc, below 1,400cc, 18pc, and above 1,400cc, 25pc, according to Syed Asif Ahmed, the general manager of MG Pakistan.
On locally made HEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) below 1,800cc, the GST is 8.5pc, while the rate on 1,801 to 2,500cc is 12.75pc.
Yet, a hybrid compact SUV vehicle costs up to Rs 12 million, while similar variants of petrol cars cost Rs 8m, leaving a price difference of approximately Rs 4m.
Globally, hybrid vehicles deliver financial value when their purchase price does not exceed more than 10pc of the cost of an equivalent petrol vehicle.
However, according to Mr Ahmed, this benchmark is not followed in Pakistan, where the price gap between hybrids and their petrol counterparts is significantly wider, averaging around 45pc.
Longer recovery period
HEV sales in Pakistan have more than doubled in 2024, according to Reuters.
Last year, over 35,000 SUVs, priced over Rs8m were sold in Pakistan with around half of them being hybrids.
HEVs employ an internal combustion engine and can run on fuel as well as battery power. However, unlike PHEVs, they cannot be charged directly with electricity and instead rely on their engines to produce electric power.
For most buyers, the incentive to purchase a hybrid vehicle is to save on fuel costs which would eventually offset the higher up-front cost over the years.
However, the massive difference in the upfront costs and periodic maintenance charges prolong the recovery period, even beyond a typical car ownership cycle.
According to Mr Ahmed of MG Pakistan, hybrids generally offer a fuel economy advantage of 8 to 10 km per litre compared to petrol vehicles, which equates to Rs 35/km operational cost saving.
To recover the additional Rs4m, a consumer would need to drive the hybrid for approximately 115,000km, Mr Ahmed explained.
Assuming an average annual drive of 15,000km, this payback period extends to over 7.5 years, he elaborated.
Given this timeline, the first owner of the vehicle is generally unlikely to fully recoup the higher upfront investment during their typical ownership cycle.
This raises critical questions about the cost-effectiveness of hybrids in Pakistan.
In terms of technology, hybrid vehicles are only efficient if used in stop-and-go driving in cities as a hybrid system only engages at low speeds, around 40 to 60km per hour.
At high speed, the fuel efficiency drops to the same level as a gasoline car.
Mr Ahmed added the price difference can vary but it is common for HEVs to cost 15 to 25pc more upfront than gasoline cars.
He said in the USA, HEVs have a higher initial purchase price than gasoline-powered vehicles but offer potentially long-term savings through fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs.
The periodic maintenance requirements of hybrid cars are the same as petrol ones, making their total cost of ownership higher than petrol due to the steep acquisition cost.
In Pakistan, duties and taxes on automobile parts also make maintenance costlier.
The customs duty on the import of non-localised parts for the assembly of fossil fuel-driven vehicles and HEVs is 30pc along with 2pc additional customs duty. For new entrants, these duties are 10pc both versions of vehicles.
A hybrid car is only viable if the fuel saving offsets the high purchase price in less than three years.
A better option for buyers in Pakistan is a pure electric vehicle or EV which requires maintenance after 15 months, making it the most efficient mobility option available.
However, EVs’ adoption suffer from a different set of challenges like high acquisition cost and lack of charging infrastructure.

PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a sharply-worded statement issued on Sunday, expressed alarm that the regional situation was fast changing and the government’s approach could prove disastrous.
He said the government’s current policy of burying heads in the sand, hoping the storm will pass is futile, as flames of war have already reached Pakistan’s doorstep.
Mr Akram underlined that Pakistan can undoubtedly weather the storm, just as it did against India, but the ruling elite must take the nation into confidence and forge a consensus-driven approach because Pakistan is currently caught between a rock and a hard place.

Flames of war have reached Pakistan’s doorstep, says PTI leader Sheikh Waqqas

In the light of the escalating crisis, the PTI leader demanded immediate release of PTI leader Imran Khan and his inclusion in the strategic decision-making regarding the situation arising from the Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran and the subsequent Washington strikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites.
Mr Akram praised the jailed PTI leader’s foresight, noting that a week earlier, he had sent a message through his sisters to postpone the protest for two weeks due to the Iran-Israel conflict.
He also criticised the US president’s deceptive policy towards Iran and said the US President Donald Trump recently claimed the US would not be involved in the Iran-Israel war for the next two weeks, but the US launched the attack within a couple of days later and the US president himself announced the attack.
Mr Akram said the jailed PTI leader Khan’s famous quote, “No one understands the West better than me” has proved to be true.
The PTI leader said that the US has not only violated Iran’s sovereignty, but it has also breached the UN Charter — an act that may have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences at both regional and international levels.
He said the excuse for the Israeli attack on Iran was even more absurd than India’s recent strike on Pakistan under the pretext of the Pahalgam attack. He said the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have adopted a blatantly contradictory and biased approach towards the Muslim world as far as the nuclear issue is concerned as they have been conspicuously silent about Israel’s widely acknowledged nuclear arsenal.
He said the UN and OIC must demand the IAEA to inspect Israel’s nuclear sites and it must work towards a nuclear-free Middle East. Mr Waqas said that Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear programme is intended solely for peaceful purposes.

The speculations have gained traction after a video went viral online showing Mr Tareen seated alongside PPPP South Punjab president Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood.
Responding to a question regarding his potential return to politics, Mr Tareen remarked that if he were to resume politics, he would “stand with the PPP.”
While there has been no formal announcement of Mr Tareen’s affiliation with PPP, the comment has stoked a flurry of rumours.
Unconfirmed reports suggest President Asif Zardari, the co-chairman of PPP, may meet Mr Tareen on Wednesday to seal the deal.
However, senior PPPP leader Khawaja Rizwan Alam has dismissed the reports.
He said due to President Zardari’s parliamentary obligations, no such meeting was possible this month.
Mr Tareen has been away from the political scene since his defeats in last year’s general election from Multan and Lodhran.
A source in Mr Tareen’s close circle told Dawn the veteran politician has denied the rumours of him joining PPP. Commenting on the video, the source said Mr Tareen had met Mr Mahmood for business purposes.
Political maverick
Mr Tareen’s political career started during the reign of former dictator Pervez Musharraf.
He started out as a member of PML-Q but joined PTI in 2012.
He was considered a close confidant of PTI leader Imran Khan. Mr Tareen was disqualified before the 2018 election but was instrumental in ensuring that the PTI had enough numbers to form the federal government in 2018.
He brought independent candidates into PTI’s fold to achieve the requisite simple majority in the National Assembly.
Mr Tareen was given important positions in the PTI government but later developed differences with the PTI leadership and was sidelined.
He played a vital role in bringing the no-confidence motion against then prime minister Khan.
Later, he and other members of PTI who had defected from the party formed the IPP before the 2024 general election. After losing the election, Mr Tareen quit politics.

Ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) “condemn firmly the aggression of Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, stress the urgent need to stop Israeli attacks and their great concern regarding this dangerous escalation”, said a statement, issued after the end of a summit in Istanbul this weekend.
It made no direct reference to the US bombardment of Iran’s key nuclear facilities early on Sunday, after President Donald Trump decided to join Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear programme.
But the OIC did denounce the “destabilisation policies of Israel in the region and its recent attacks on Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, constituting a flagrant violation of sovereignty and security of these countries and international law”.

Omits mention of US strikes on nuclear facilities; Dar wants Israel held accountable, says it has become a threat to the region

Attending the OIC meeting, Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday morning that the United States and Israel had “breached a major red line”.
Tehran would hit back at the American attack “by all means necessary”, he added.
Founded in 1969, the 57-member OIC sees its role as protecting the interests of the Muslim world and increasing Muslim solidarity.
Syed Irfan Raza adds from Islamabad: Speaking at the OIC meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar urged the international community to hold Israel accountable for its reckless aggression against Iran, saying that Tel Aviv has become a threat to the entire region.
“I hope that our meeting today will not only express our unwavering solidarity with the brotherly country of Iran, but will also send a clear message that Israel must be held accountable, and that its reckless aggression cannot be allowed to jeopardise the peace of the entire region,” Mr Dar said.
 






Pakistan, he said, reiterated its condemnation, in the strongest possible terms, of the unjustified and illegitimate aggression committed by Israel against Iran.
“We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Iran, and offer our deepest condolences at the loss of numerous lives as a result of targeting of civilian areas by Israel,” Mr Dar said.
He said that Israeli aggression took place at a time when the IAEA was continuing its verification activities in Iran.
“Israel has thus violated the international law, IAEA Statute and several IAEA resolutions by attacking the IAEA safeguarded facilities,” he added.
These attacks, he said, had risked setting a dangerous precedent and posed a grave threat to the safety of populations in the region and around the globe.
He said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, in response to the blatant and unprovoked Israeli aggression.
The deputy prime minister said that double standards were on full display when it comes to Israel.
“There is no talk of the rule of law, the rules-based international order or consequences for illegal actions. This impunity must end,” he added.
He said Israeli aggression against Iran was not an isolated event, adding that, it was part of a dangerous and consistent pattern of militarism that Israel has demonstrated across the Middle East.

• IAEA chief says such attacks may result in radioactive releases with great consequences
• Guterres calls US bombing ‘perilous turn’
UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan joined China and Russia in circulating a draft resolution at the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians and a return to diplomacy following US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
The strikes, which targeted Iran’s Fordow — where uranium is enriched to 60 per cent — and two other facilities have been described as a dangerous escalation with potential global ramifications.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency session of the Council: “Pakistan has condemned the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which come on the heels of a series of brazen attacks by Israel.”
He added that specific targeting of nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards constitutes a clear breach of international law and poses a “grave threat to the safety and security of populations across the region — and indeed, the world”.
 
 

He urged the Council to act “urgently and decisively” to reject and condemn the attacks, reaffirm protection of civilians and support a diplomatic settlement to the Iranian nuclear issue.
IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the Council that craters were visible at the site, indicating the use of ground-penetrating munitions in the early Sunday attacks.
“At this time, no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow,” Mr Grossi said, while warning: “Armed attacks on nuclear facilities should never take place and could result in radioactive releases with great consequences within and beyond the boundaries of the State which has been attacked.”
UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the bombing “a perilous turn” and called for “an immediate ceasefire and a return to serious, sustained negotiations.”
He cautioned, “The people of the region cannot endure another cycle of destruction. And yet, we now risk descending into a rathole of retaliation after retaliation. To avoid it, diplomacy must prevail. Civilians must be protected. Safe maritime navigation must be guaranteed.”
Mr Guterres emphasised that peace efforts must not be abandoned: “We cannot and must not give up on peace.” He urged member states to take “immediate, decisive action to end fighting” and to commit to meaningful dialogue.
The emergency session was convened at Iran’s request and backed by Pakistan, which described its initiative as “a principled stand to uphold international law and protect regional stability”.
Draft resolution
Against this backdrop, Pakistan, China and Russia have tabled a draft resolution calling for de-escalation and protection of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Although the draft was not scheduled for vote during Sunday’s emergency session, it lays the groundwork for a broader diplomatic push.
Reaffirming the UN Charter and the prohibition on the use of force, the draft “condemns in the strongest terms the attacks against peaceful nuclear sites and facilities under IAEA safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran” and warns such strikes “represent a grave threat to international peace and security”.
The resolution further calls for “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” and urges all parties to “refrain from further escalation”. It places particular emphasis on the “urgent protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure,” reminding all parties of their obligations under international law.
Significantly, the draft urges the resumption of diplomatic negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme, pushing for an agreement that ensures the programme remains “exclusively peaceful”. In exchange, it demands the “complete lifting of all sanctions — both multilateral and unilateral — a clause that aligns with Iran’s longstanding demands and is expected to face resistance from Western members of the Council.
Calls for urgent diplomacy
Briefing the Council, Miroslav Jena, UN’s Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, said: “The world will also not be spared from the ramifications of this dangerous conflict … This latest development must be viewed with the utmost seriousness. It marks a dangerous escalation in a conflict that has already devastated many lives in both countries, in a region on the edge.”

The reaction in Middle East stock markets, which trade on Sunday, suggested investors were assuming a benign outcome, even as Iran intensified its missile attacks on Israel in response to the sudden, deep US involvement in the conflict.
Investors said they expected US involvement would cause a stock market selloff and a possible bid for the dollar and other safe-haven assets when major markets reopen, but also said much uncertainty remained.
“I think the markets are going to be initially alarmed, and I think oil will open higher,” said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital.

Economists warn dramatic rise in oil prices may damage global economy

“We don’t have any damage assessment and that will take some time. Even though (Trump) has described this as ‘done’, we’re engaged,” Spindel said.
“I think the uncertainty is going to blanket the markets, as now Americans everywhere are going to be exposed. It’s going to raise uncertainty and volatility, particularly in oil,” he added.
One indicator of how markets will react in the coming week was the price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency and a gauge of retail investor sentiment. Ether was down 8.5 per cent on Sunday, taking losses since the first Israeli strikes on Iran on June 13 to 13pc.
Most Gulf stock markets, however, seemed unconcerned by the early morning attacks, with the main indexes in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait up slightly or flat. Israel’s Tel Aviv main index was at an all-time high.
Oil prices, inflation
A key concern for markets centres around the potential impact of Middle East developments on oil prices and thus on inflation. Rising inflation could dampen consumer confidence and lessen the chance of near-term interest rate cuts.
Saul Kavonic, a senior energy analyst at equity research firm MST Marquee in Sydney, said Iran could respond by targeting American interests in the Middle East, including Gulf oil infrastructure in places such as Iraq or harassing ship passages through the Strait of Hormuz.
The Strait of Hormuz lies between Oman and Iran and is the primary export route for oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait.
“Much depends on how Iran responds in the coming hours and days, but this could set us on a path towards $100 oil if Iran responds as they have previously threatened to,” Kavonic said.
While global benchmark Brent crude futures have risen as much as 18pc since June 10, hitting a near five-month high of $79.04 on Thursday, the S&P 500 has been little changed, following an initial drop when Israel launched its attacks on Iran on June 13.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari, also a former foreign minister, said that on the final day of last month’s deadly clashes, India deployed a dual-use cruise missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, forcing Pakistan to make a split-second decision on whether it was under nuclear attack.
“In that atmosphere you’ve got only a few seconds to decide looking at an image: is this missile going to be used within the nuclear connotation or not? And in those split seconds, decisions are made,” he told The Sunday Times during a visit to London.
“We’ve achieved a ceasefire, but we haven’t achieved peace. And that’s problematic because following this recent conflict, we have lowered the threshold for full-blown military conflict to the lowest it has ever been, to what I believe are dangerously low levels,” he added.
 






Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s warning came as the United States entered Israel’s war with Iran while managing another potential conflict in South Asia.
Last Wednesday, Mr Trump hosted Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for a closed-door lunch at the White House — the first time a US president has hosted a Pakistani military chief who was not also head of state.
“The reason I had him (COAS) here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India],” said Mr Trump. “And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago.”
Pakistan has said that although outright war between the two nuclear-armed rivals was narrowly averted by US intervention last month — after the deadliest fighting in decades — the conflict is far from resolved.
The PPP chairman arrived in London at the head of a nine-member parliamentary delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to “pitch for peace” and push for international talks to resolve the Kashmir dispute.
He said Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire because it was promised such a summit, which has yet to take place.
“At a time where the Pakistani army believes that we had a military upper hand in the conflict, we agreed to a ceasefire because we believed there was a commitment from the United States that we’d go on to have a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points,” he said.
“Now that isn’t happening. We don’t want the international community to get a false sense of ease as a result of the ceasefire. There’s still a very real threat,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also insisted Pakistan had no role in the Pahalgam attack, which was initially claimed — then retracted — by a little-known group, the Resistance Front, which India claims is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. “To this day, they [the Indian government] haven’t provided the Indian public, their allies, or us, or the media, with names of the individuals involved in this attack,” he said.
He admitted Pakistan has “a credibility problem” but argued things have changed. “This credibility and perception problem is rooted in deep biases, tainted by Islamophobia, and obfuscates our actual effort to combat terrorism,” he said.
He also accused the West of worsening Pakistan’s security situation by abandoning Afghanistan and “leaving a vacuum” there.
“The rest of the world may have moved on from Afghanistan and exited Kabul, but we’re fighting terrorism from there,” he said. “The single largest number of terrorist attacks anywhere in the world is in Pakistan.”

Officials said that during the last 24 hours, armed men had attacked a Levies post and taken personnel hostage after a heavy exchange of fire in the Kirdgab area. They also took away official weapons from the post.
The attackers also set fire to the offices of Nadra, judicial magistrate and assistant commissioner.
Officials added that the armed men blocked the highway and conducted strict checking of passing vehicles.
“They checked the national identity cards of the people traveling in the vehicles in Khadkocha and Kirdgab areas,” an eyewitness said, adding that in Khadkocha they remained on the highway for around one-and-a-half hour and also burst the tyres of a truck.

The meeting was jointly organised by National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) Baloc­histan, the Social Welfare Department, Unicef and other partners. Advocate Abdul Hayee, NCRC member from Balochistan, along with representatives from Unicef, UNFPA and civil society attended the meeting. 
The bill, which seeks to set the minimum marriage age at 18 in line with national and international commitments, has remained stalled since 2013, despite cabinet approval. Participants of the meeting expressed frustration over the delay and urged provincial lawmakers to immediately table and pass the bill.
They acknowledged the PPP’s historic role in passing the Sindh’s Child Marriage Law in 2014 and praised President Asif Ali Zardari and Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for pushing child protection legislation at the federal level.
The participants urged Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti to fulfill his commitment made in 2018 to support the bill’s passage. They stressed that child marriage is not only a human rights violation but a serious public health concern, contributing to life-threatening conditions like obstetric fistula.
On the occasion, the civil society members vowed to intensify advocacy to ensure swift legislative action.

It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was toppled by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.
Syria’s interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. “He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest,” a ministry statement added.
A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.
Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad’s fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source told Reuters.
Syria’s state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.
A livestream from the site by Syria’s civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities.
“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.
“We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”
Islamic State had previously targeted religious minorities, including a major attack on Shia pilgrims in Sayeda Zainab in 2016 — one of the most notorious bombings during Assad’s rule.
The latest assault underscores the group’s continued ability to exploit security gaps despite the collapse of its territorial control and years of counterterrorism efforts.</p><small>2025-06-22 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/222157307bbe0ec.jpg?r=222234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919128/fazl-others-urge-govt-to-review-decision-to-nominate-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl, others urge govt to review decision to nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani politicians on Sunday raised their concerns over the government’s decision to recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Iran.
The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s Pak-India conflict, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with US mediation.
In a statement, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.
However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined Pakistani citizens in voicing their reservations.
Veteran politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who heads his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), demanded that the government rescind its decision.
“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree today, according to a JUI-F statement.
 






He said that Trump’s recent meeting and lunch with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “pleased Pakistani rulers so much” that they recommended nominating the US president for the Nobel prize.
The JUI-F chief noted that Trump won the presidential election with the slogan of peace but was “proven false in his claim”.
Fazl said that when Pakistan “destroyed India’s defence force”, President Trump intervened and said he had declared a ceasefire.
“[But] Trump has supported the Israeli attacks on Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iran. How can this be a sign of peace?” Fazl questioned. “With the blood of Afghans and Palestinians on America’s hands, how can he claim to be a proponent of peace?”
Trump campaigned for office as a “peacemaker” who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.
The US has several times vetoed resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council, the latest earlier this month.
 
 

Fazl said his party was in favour of friendship with the US but not of its “slavery”.
“National sovereignty, the right of the people to govern themselves, and economic freedom should be maintained in relations with America,” the JUI-F chief asserted.
Fazl further said that in the last three months, a US delegation has visited him three times, after which he attended their diplomatic ceremony in Islamabad.
He also expressed his view that the attacks on Iran were an attempt to stop China’s economic growth in the Middle East. China is the largest importer of Iranian oil.
“Pakistan’s economic strength in the region has been affected the most. The economic balance is shifting towards Asia instead of Europe, which is a good omen for Asia,” he said.
‘Trump no longer a potential peacemaker’
Calls to reconsider the government’s decision also came from other politicians.
Former senator Mushahid Hussain wrote on X: “Since Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!”
He said Trump had been “trapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency”.
“Trump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!”
 






Trump “engaged in deception and betrayed his own promise not to start new wars”, Mushahid said in another post, strongly condemning the US attacks on Iran.
Hussain, former chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence, had previously said that if the nomination “panders to Trump’s ego, so be it”.
PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan wrote “reconsider” in all caps on his X account, highlighting the “US attack on Iran and continuous US support of Israeli killings in Gaza”.
 






In a separate post, the opposition PTI condemned the “unprovoked” US strikes and voiced “total support” for Iran’s sovereignty.
Raoof Hasan, head of PTI’s political think-tank, said the government’s decision was now a “cause of unmitigated shame and embarrassment for those who were instrumental in making the choice”.
“That’s why it is said that legitimacy can neither be bought nor gifted,” said Hasan, as he took a jibe at the government. He also denounced the US’s “total disregard for international covenants” through the attacks on Iran.
 






Former senator Afrasiab Khattak said, “The sycophancy adopted by [the] Pakistani ruling elite in nominating President Trump for Nobel Peace Prize is not part of normative conduct in international diplomacy.”
“It was most embarrassing to announce the nomination hours before Trump ordered to bomb Iranian nuclear sites,” the veteran politician noted.
 






Jamaat-i-Islami chief Naeemur Rehman has said the decision “undermines our national dignity and grace”.
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, has termed the move “unfortunate” and said it did not reflect the public’s views.
 






Among other notable individuals was senior journalist Mariana Baabar, who wrote on X that “today Pakistan does not look too good either”, sharing the government’s post announcing its intention to nominate Trump for the Nobel.
 






Author and activist Fatima Bhutto asked: “Will Pakistan withdraw its nomination for him to receive the Nobel Peace Prize?”
 






Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.
He has openly expressed his frustration over missing out on the prestigious award, most recently mentioning it during a February Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Former US president Barack Obama won the prize soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour.</p><small>2025-06-22 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2218545478f41c4.jpg?r=202015' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919099/sarfraz-bugti-condemns-murder-of-ex-balochistan-cms-son-in-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>Sarfraz Bugti condemns murder of ex-Balochistan CM’s son in Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday condemned the murder of Mir Attaur Rehman Mengal, the son of former Balochistan chief minister Naseer Mengal, in an armed clash when gunmen opened fire in district Khuzdar’s Wadh.
Atta Mengal was the brother of Mir Shafiqur Rehman Mengal, a prominent tribal leader and head of the Jhalawan Awami Panel, a political party.
Dawn.com has reached out to the police for a comment on the alleged murder.
Bugti condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed his heartfelt grief and sorrow over the killing of the younger Mengal.
“He prayed for the bereaved family and expressed his best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured grandson,” a statement from his office read.
Bugti assured that the provincial government will conduct a thorough investigation into the incident and vowed that the terrorists will be brought to justice.
“The people and government of Balochistan stand in solidarity against terrorism,” he added.
Atta Mengal was killed while his son Mir Matiur Rehman Mengal was injured, after an ambush by terrorists allegedly belonging to the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), said a statement by Jhalawan Awami Panel spokesperson Nadeemur Rehman Baloch.
The spokesperson said Naseer Mengal’s family had “made countless sacrifices for the survival of Pakistan”.
In March, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district, according to officials.
The JUI-F leaders, Wa­­dera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah, were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.

US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
The US operation, called Midnight Hammer, was described by Gen Caine as the “largest B-2 operational strike in US history”, which inflicted “extremely severe damage and destruction” to the targets, US outlet CBS News reported.
 
 

“This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,” Gen Caine said, adding that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flew east from their base in Missouri to participate in the mission in Iran.
“At midnight, Friday into Saturday, a large B-2 strike package, comprised of bombers, launched from the continental United States. As part of a plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy,” he stated.
“Throughout its 18-hour flight, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight refuellings. Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East in a complex, tightly timed manoeuvre requiring exact synchronisation across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace.” Caine explained, adding that this was done with minimal communication.

Speaking while displaying a map tracing the flight path and timelines of the US bombers, the chairman said: “At about 5pm Eastern Time (ET) [on] Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a US submarine in the Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan.
“As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the US deployed several deception tactics, including decoys, as fourth and fifth-generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats.”

Gen Caine outlined that US Strategic Command, Transportation Command, Cyber Command, Space Command and the Space Force and US European Command all provided support during the strikes.
“We are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,” he said.
Outlining the bombing raid, Gen Caine said that at about 6:40pm ET (2:10am in Iran) the lead B-2 “dropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) weapons on the first of several aimpoints at Fordow”.
“As the president stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6:40pm and 7:05pm ET … with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Isfahan to ensure that we retained the element of surprise throughout the operation.
 


“Following weapons release, the Midnight Hammer strike package exited Iranian airspace and began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package on the way out,” he added. “Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears Iran’s surface-to-air missile systems did not see us.”
According to Gen Caine, the US employed 75 “precision-guided weapons” during Operation Midnight Hammer, including the MOPs, marking their first operational use by the US military.
“More than 125 US aircraft participated in this mission, including B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth-generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air refuelling tankers … and a full array of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational professionals,” Gen Caine said.
The chairman warned that the US is prepared for any retaliatory attack by Iran, stating that any such attack would be an “incredibly poor choice”.
“We will defend ourselves; the safety of our service members and civilians is the highest priority. Many assets are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed.”</p><small>2025-06-22 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2213520985406c7.jpg?r=142516' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Iran’s key nuclear facilities ‘obliterated’ by US airstrikes</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.

US strikes Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites
Pentagon chief says US operation not aimed at regime change
Top US general details weapons used in “Operation Midnight Hammer”
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’, says US betrayed diplomacy
Pakistan condemns attacks, voices support for Tehran’s right to defend
Democrats criticise decision ‘without Congress approval’


The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top commanders, scientists and hundreds others. Both countries have traded wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.
In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.
 


The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.
“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.
“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.
 






Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told AFP.
Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.
Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.
Iranian media confirmed that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, were attacked.
The US strikes push the Middle East to the brink of a major new conflagration in a region already aflame for more than 20 months with devastating conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as a toppled ruler in Syria.
Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.
‘US operation not aimed at regime change’
US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth hailed the strikes an “incredible and overwhelming success”, adding that the operation was intended at a regime change in Iran.
“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it is worth noting that the operation did not target the Iranian troops or people,” Hegseth told a press conference at the Pentagon.
The secretary reiterated Trump’s claims that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, stating that by employing the president’s policy of “peace through strength”, Iran’s nuclear ambitions were “obliterated”.
 


Nevertheless, Hegseth said the strikes were not a preamble to plans for regime change in Iran, adding that private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate.
“This mission was not and has not been about regime change,” Hegseth stated. “The president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme.”
“The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back,” Hegseth added. “When this president speaks, the world should listen.”
 






Hegseth also read a statement from Trump, warning that any retaliation by Iran “will be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight”.
“Iran would be smart to heed these words,” the defence secretary warned, adding that US forces were postured to defend themselves, and take action if needed.
Hegseth said that the operation took months of preparation and required “a great deal of precision […] misdirection and highest of operational security”.
Describing the complex operation, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said the “main strike package comprised” of seven B-2 stealth bombers flying 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran with multiple aerial refuellings.
The US strikes included 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft, the top general added.
 






Trump had earlier told Fox News’ Sean Hannity show that five to six “bunker-buster” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.
Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites sustained “extremely severe damage and destruction”, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.
“Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran’s surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,” Caine added.
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’; Pakistan condemns attacks
Denouncing the US attacks as “lawless and criminal”, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country has a right to defend its sovereignty.
“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences,” he posted on X.
“Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.”
 






In a statement issued by its foreign ministry, Iran strongly condemned the “United States’ brutal military aggression against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities”.
It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.
“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.
 






Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.
It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.
It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s Resolution 2231 from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.
“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.
Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.
“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a statement by the Foreign Office said.
 






“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.
It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.
“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.
Trump warns Iran against ‘any retaliation’
Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “within two weeks” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.
But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.
Flanked by JD Vance, Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.
“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.
Trump, however, made no mention of regime change, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “easy target”.
The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, CBS News reported.
Trump said earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors”.
 


“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.
In another post, the US president called it a “historic moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world”. “Iran must now agree to end this war,” he wrote.
 


Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.
However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a report from CNN released on Tuesday said.
Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.
Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.
 






After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.
However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that “suicide drones” had been launched against “strategic targets” across Israel.
Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.
Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.
MAGA split adds to Democrats’ criticism
The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.
Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune voiced their support for Trump’s decision.
 
 

However, the issue has opened a split in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.
Trump’s first 2016 election victory in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”
Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: “This is not our fight.”
“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said.
 






Democrats also assailed him, with several accusing him of bypassing Congress to launch a new war.
Jim Himes, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, highlighted that Trump’s decision “without Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution”.
“We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East,” he said in a statement.
 






Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also noted there was no authorisation from Congress and termed it a “disastrous decision”.
“He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,” she asserted.
 






Leading US Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said Trump risked US “entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East”. He added that the US president had “failed to deliver” on his promise of bringing peace to the Middle East.
