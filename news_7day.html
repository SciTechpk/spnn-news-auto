After an attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
In response to India’s aggressive moves against the country, Pakistan had announced retaliatory measures that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace and ports to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.
Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Hekmatullah Zaland, the deputy director of the Afghan foreign ministry’s Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS), said: “Since Pakistan and India are located in our neighbourhood, if this tension spreads, it will have a direct negative impact on the region and Afghanistan.”
The CSS deputy director added, “We are currently interacting with both countries in the light of our balanced policy.”
Zaland was speaking during a roundtable discussion at an academic conference titled “Tensions in Pakistan-India relations and their impact on the region”. The conference was organised by the CSS, according to a foreign ministry statement posted online.
During the discussion, officials pointed out the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, emphasising that the decision would affect Afghan traders.
On April 23, India had announced the closure of the Attari checkpost, alongside other measures. The next day, Pakistan responded by shutting the Wagah Border for any trade with India, including to or from a third country.
 
 

However, despite Pakistan allowing 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, India has not permitted them to cross into its territory, leaving truckers from Afghanistan in a mess.
According to the central leader of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Pakistan has also not permitted vehicles carrying items imported from India to enter Afghanistan.
Afghan traders said up to 2,000 containers carrying goods have arrived at Karachi ports from India under the transit agreement with Pakistan. But these vehicles are stranded in Pakistan, with some waiting at Torkham and Chaman to enter Afghanistan.
CSS Director Waliullah Shaheen discussed the historical background of the tense relations between Pakistan and India, stating that the two nuclear-armed countries would not enter into war and would find a solution to the problem.
 
 

Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor, the first political director of the Afghan foreign ministry, delivered a keynote speech at the roundtable discussions, the ministry said.
Discussing the factors behind the recent escalation of the conflict between Pakistan and India, he noted that the Pahalgam attack had exacerbated the long-standing tension. As a result, he added, both countries took measures, such as the closure of the Wagah-Attari border, that have affected the region, especially Afghanistan.
According to Noor, due to the border closures, Afghanistan’s commercial goods were practically stuck, causing significant damage to the Afghan trade sector. “Therefore, the Islamic Emirate [of Afghanistan] needs to prepare for potential incidents in advance,” the official stressed.
Noting that Afghanistan had “commonalities and positive interactions” with both Pakistan and India, Noor stated his country did not want a war between the two arch-rivals.
 
 

“Rather, in light of the Islamic Emirate’s balanced and economy-oriented policy, and because regional stability and security are important to the Islamic Emirate, we will strive to resolve this conflict peacefully,” he said.
Dr Hafiz Ikramuddin Kamil, another official, spoke about the legal aspect of India’s potential threat to disrupt flow of water after it suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.
Kamil observed that blocking the river for a long time seemed technically difficult and also had various legal aspects according to international law. “But for now, this issue has also emerged as a significant consequence of the tension in relations,” he added.
Dozens of foreign ministry employees participated in the discussion, where they shared their opinions and analyses on various aspects of the issue.
Dar chairs follow-up meeting on Kabul trip
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar presided over a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) in Islamabad today to follow up on the outcomes of his recent visit to Kabul.
 
 

Dar’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19 marked the high point of a renewed re-engagement process between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban administration after months of diplomatic deadlock, border clashes and mounting security concerns.
During his trip there, Afghan­istan’s acting prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, had assured Pakistan that the Afghan territory would not be used for hostile activities against any country.
In the meeting led by Dar today, officials from Mofa and relevant ministries were briefed on the progress in implementation of earlier decisions, according to the Foreign Office.
Dar, also the foreign minister, reaffirmed “Pakistan’s vision for a peaceful neighbourhood, enhanced trade and connectivity, sustainable development, and prosperity”.
The meeting was attended by Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq and senior officials from various ministries.

In a statement on Telegram, the Kremlin said that Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries’ strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of documents.
“During the talks, the main issues of further development of relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic interaction, as well as current issues on the international and regional agenda will be discussed,” the Kremlin said.
The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War II but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Hitler died by suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945.
Several other national leaders are expected at the celebrations, including the presidents of Brazil and Serbia, and the prime minister of Slovakia.
Putin has proposed a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine around the May 9 celebration, one of the most important in the Russian calendar.
Responding to Moscow’s offer of the three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was ready as long as the ceasefire would be 30 days in length, something Putin had already ruled out in the near term, saying he wants a long-term settlement, not a brief pause.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine, given the continued war with Russia, could not guarantee the safety of any foreign dignitaries who came to Moscow for the traditional May 9 victory parade.</p><small>2025-05-04 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04141552325105b.jpg?r=141833' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908388/pmd-says-chances-of-rain-in-karachi-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PMD says chances of rain in Karachi tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi could experience isolated dust and thunderstorms accompanied by rain on Monday evening, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Sunday.
The PMD has predicted that a westerly wave is affecting the upper and central parts of the country.
Weather was expected to remain “hot and humid with chances of isolated dust-thunderstorm and rain on [Monday] evening,” in Karachi, according to the PMD’s forecast.
It added that there were chances of thunderstorms and rain in the outskirts of Karachi in the evening.
Dust storms and thunderstorm-related rain are likely at isolated places in Jamshoro,  Tando Mohammad Khan, Badin, Hyderabad, Mitiari,  Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Nosheroferoz, Sanghar, Khairpur, Ghotki, Umerkot, Tharparker, Badin, Shikarpur and Kashmore districts today, the PMD said.
Its advisory said that windstorms, thunderstorms, hailstorms, and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels.
“Farmers are advised to manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well,” the PMD added.
Earlier today, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) warned of potential landslides in Murree and Galiyat due to forecasted heavy rain, urging citizens to take necessary precautions, reported Associated Press of Pakistan.
Heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds and hailstorms lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Friday, turning the weather chilly.
The PDMA had issued a rain alert earlier this week, warning of strong storms and heavy rainfall until May 4, with a forecast indicating a high likelihood of lightning strikes.
“Tourists visiting Murree have been advised to take caution and monitor weather conditions,” a PDMA Punjab spokesperson said while talking to a private news channel, said the report.
He further asked them to avoid unnecessary travel during the unpredictable weather.
“Tourists [should] strictly adhere to safety guidelines and follow instructions from the local authorities. Residents have been advised to avoid being in open areas to minimise risks,” the report read.
“The PDMA recommends that citizens follow disaster management plans and guidelines. Citizens are encouraged to stay alert and follow PDMA’s advisories to stay safe.”
On Friday, the PDMA announced that two people had died and 24 others were injured due to windstorms and rain in different cities of Punjab.
In the event of a disaster, citizens have been advised to call 1129 for assistance.</p><small>2025-05-04 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/041511299fc0a52.png?r=151237' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908387/info-minister-dg-ispr-to-brief-all-political-parties-on-pakistan-india-situation-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister, DG ISPR to brief all political parties on Pakistan-India situation: state media</strong></a><br><p>The federal information minister and the military’s spokesperson are set to brief the top leadership of all political parties today on the prevailing national security situation amid sky-high tensions with India, state media reported.
An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
State-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported that Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar would jointly brief the top leaders of “all political parties” on the situation with India today.
 
 

The reports did not specify a time or venue for the briefing.
According to Radio Pakistan, the high-level background briefing will focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the “implications of recent developments”.
“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.
PTV News highlighted that in the current circumstances, the briefing was a “great example of national unity, solidarity and consensus”.
Without investigation, India had accu­s­ed “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers and escalated tensions with Pak­­i­s­tan through military and diplomatic actions.
India cancelled visas of Pak­istani travellers, held the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance, initiated ski­rmi­shes along the Line of Control (LoC) and hinted at potential airstrikes.
Pakistan denied involvement and issued retaliatory steps.
 
 

The standoff, marked by exchange of fire on the LoC and tit-for-tat actions, has raised fears of broader conflict, prompting international calls for restraint and renewed dialogue.
In the latest show of strength, Pakistan yesterday successfully tested an improved version of its nuclear-capable Abdali missile, significantly increasing its range to 450 kilometres.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a “swift, resolute and notch-up response”. The next day, the army’s top brass also warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war.
 
 

To prepare itself for any military action by India, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the LoC.
It is increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months and relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones.

Samsung becomes the second major foreign company in recent months to challenge an Indian tax demand.
Volkswagen has sued Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in court for a record demand of $1.4 billion for misclassifying its component imports.
In the Samsung case, tax authorities in January asked Samsung to pay $520m for evading the 10-20 per cent tariffs by misclassifying imports of a key mobile tower equipment, which it then sold to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom giant, Reliance Jio, from 2018 to 2021.
In its 281-page challenge at the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal in Mumbai, Samsung criticises Indian authorities for being “fully aware” of the business model as Reliance had a “long-established practice” of importing the same equipment without any tariff payments for three years until 2017.
Samsung’s India unit says it discovered during an Indian tax investigation that Reliance had been warned about the practice way back in 2017, but Reliance did not inform the South Korean company about it and tax officials never questioned Samsung.
“The classification adopted by the appellant (Samsung) was known to the authorities, however the same was never questioned … Department was fully aware,” Samsung says in its April 17 filing, which is not public but was seen by Reuters.
“Reliance Jio officials did not inform” Samsung about the tax warning of 2017, it adds.
Samsung and India’s tax authority did not respond to Reuters queries.
Further details of Reliance’s 2017 warning from tax authorities are not public and were not disclosed in the Samsung filing. Reliance didn’t respond to Reuters queries.
Other than $520m demand Samsung faces, Indian authorities have also imposed an $81m fine on seven of its employees, taking the total tax demand to $601m. It’s not clear if Samsung employees are separately challenging the fines.
The tax demand represents a substantial chunk of last year’s net profit of $955m for Samsung in India, where it is one of the largest players in the consumer electronics and smartphones market.
In defending its tariff declarations, Samsung also argues in its filing that the tax authority passed the order in January “in a hurry” and it was not provided “a fair opportunity” to present its case, despite the “huge stakes” involved.
The Samsung case concerns imports of a component called “Remote Radio Head”, a radio-frequency circuit enclosed in a small outdoor module, that tax officials say is “one of the most important” parts of 4G telecoms systems.
The case against Samsung alleges it misclassified the component’s imports worth $784m from Korea and Vietnam between 2018 to 2021, to maximise profits.
Investigators found that Samsung “transgressed all business ethics and industry practices or standards in order to achieve their sole motive of maximising their profit by defrauding the government exchequer”, the January order stated.</p><small>2025-05-04 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04131110495eac4.jpg?r=131623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908386/two-more-bodies-of-libya-boat-tragedy-victims-arrive-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Two more bodies of Libya boat tragedy victims arrive in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>Two more bodies of Pakistan nationals who lost their lives in a tragic boat accident off the eastern coast of Libya, arrived at Lahore Airport on Sunday, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
The incident occurred during the night between April 12 and 13, when a migrant boat capsized near Libya’s eastern shoreline.
The accident was the latest in a series of mishaps over the past few years in which hundreds of Pakistanis were killed in the Medi­ter­ranean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean while trying to reach Europe from Africa.
The victims were identified as Sufyan and Nadeem Ahmed, residents of Gujranwala, APP reported.
State Minister for Public Affairs Rana Mubashir Hussain and Member Punjab Assembly Mian Imran Javed received the bodies at the Lahore Airport cargo department. Later, the bodies were handed over to the grieving families. Prayers were also offered for the departed souls.
Speaking on the occasion, Hussain expressed deep sorrow and grief and expressed solidarity with the bereaved families.
He said, “We are making strict laws against those who play with the lives of people. Some culprits had been arrested while the rest have yet to be caught.”
Last month, the bodies of six people who died in the boat tragedy arrived in three districts of the Gujranwala division. The victims whose bodies arrived included a couple belonging to Sialkot.
The Federal Investigation Agency, Gujranwala Zone, also launched at least three different inquiries into the death of the Pakistani nationals in the boat capsizing.</p><small>2025-05-04 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0412535243e9c9e.jpg?r=125359' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908382/madrassah-teacher-arrested-for-allegedly-raping-minor-student-in-muzaffargarh' target='_blank'><strong>Madrassah teacher arrested for allegedly raping minor student in Muzaffargarh</strong></a><br><p>A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh district of Punjab was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary, it emerged on Sunday.
Last year, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data revealed that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.
“A case has been registered against a madrassa teacher at the Mirhazar police station,” a police spokesperson said.
The spokesperson continued that the police took immediate action and arrested the suspect.
The first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 376(iii) (rape of a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The teacher took the student to his residential room in the madrassa and raped the student twice, according to the FIR.
“A case was registered on the statement of the child’s mother,” the police spokesperson added.
Last month a 17-year-old girl died by suicide after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, police had said.
Last month, police had also arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh, according to an official statement.</p><small>2025-05-04 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/04120146f6f7ff2.jpg?r=120206' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908212/can-india-still-go-to-war-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>CAN INDIA STILL GO TO WAR WITH PAKISTAN?</strong></a><br><p>PROLOGUE
India has become infuriatingly formulaic when it comes to Pakistan. Here’s how the script goes. There’s an attack in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. India blames Pakistan.
The Indian media — mainstream and social — start beating war drums. Retired Indian military officers and other analysts are invited by the Studio Corps who declare, wage and win a war against Pakistan. The hysteria has reached fever-pitch since the arrival on the scene of a Hindutva-driven Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Narendra Modi, and of social media platforms.
In bashing Pakistan, some even calling for its dismemberment, there’s no real difference between the right and the left in India or the many shades in between. Once again, after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, we are at that stage; once again there’s talk in India of punishing Pakistan. Even the negligible few who caution against rashness nonetheless muse about how to punish Pakistan without starting an Armageddon. There are almost no voices challenging India’s occupation of Kashmir.
 
 

Others dish out operational recipes about strikes that range from “limited” to a full-blown war, from keeping the conflict controlled through dominating escalation to fantastic scenarios of a “final solution”, with nary a thought to the genocidal underpinnings of that term. On such occasions, irony goes to die in India.
It should be obvious, given the obvious, that there should be a serious discussion on these goings-on, because the irresponsibility and false bravado that inheres in this balderdash impacts not just the citizens of Pakistan and India but, by geographic default, other countries that make up the defunct grouping called Saarc.
This article is therefore structured to (a) discuss what war means, whether full-scale or limited and (b) why do Pakistan and India keep getting into these cycles. The “b” also necessarily brings us to India’s denial to the Kashmiris of their right to self-determination.
To clarify, this is not an attempt to predict what India would or could do if it chose to launch a limited strike. Or what platforms it might use for that or how it could choose the nodal points for any strikes. The argument is that limited cannot assuredly remain limited. Which doesn’t mean that India cannot miscalculate. Wars have often started because of miscalculations.

As tensions between India and Pakistan mounted in the wake of the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, war drums were once again beaten with great ferocity in India. Why do India and Pakistan keep returning to this state of brinkmanship? Can India actually conduct a military strike against a nuclear Pakistan? And what is the risk of its miscalculation?

CLAUSEWITZ’S ‘ZWECK UND ZIEL’
The Prussian soldier and war theoretician Carl von Clausewitz understood that war’s political objective was not just its highest level but the most important. The primitive violence of people, managing that violence and harnessing it to an aim must be subordinate to the political objective of war. But all the three levels have to be taken together, since that is what constitutes the triple nature of war as well as its grammar.
He used the terms Zweck und Ziel, the first referring to “purpose”, the second to “aim”. The Zweck denotes the political objective for which a war is being fought; the Ziel relates to the actual conduct and aim of battles, of which many may be fought to achieve the political end. The Ziel, in the Clausewitzian framework, must add up to the Zweck and be subordinate to it.
Clausewitz was, of course, writing before the advent of nuclear weapons and within his own geopolitical context. But what is clear is the connection between fighting and a political objective. Obvious also is the fact that victory will be determined not on the basis of winning a battle or battles but achieving the objective for which the battles are being fought. To put it another way, “there is no necessary correspondence between victory in battle and success in achieving the objective.”
Take the example of India’s chest-beating. Let’s assume that India decides to punish Pakistan and, in fact, does manage to do that. We are not concerned about what such punishment might look like but we can argue, given the nuclear overhang, that it would be limited by the very nature of India’s compulsion to keep the conflict controlled. Let’s also assume that, at that point, Pakistan determines that it cannot retaliate. Would that “battle” constitute victory for India? Yes, if it achieves the political objective; no, if it doesn’t.
It is logical at this point to ask what would be India’s political objective (it’s not domestic). What is the Zweck for India’s Ziel, assuming that getting into a fight for the heck of it means nothing. Even when it might satiate some base instincts or win elections, it can’t be policy, much less an objective in a Clausewitzian sense. That objective would be to establish deterrence against Pakistan — to ensure that Pakistan does not (or cannot) do anything that India considers to be inimical to its interests and security.
If India manages to punish Pakistan but fails to deter it from undertaking actions in the future that it considers damaging to its interests and security, then, in our hypothetical scenario, India has failed to achieve its political objective.

After all, India is not planning a limited nuclear strike. It only wants a limited conventional strike or maybe a few simultaneous limited strikes and it plans, presumably, to control escalation to avoid Pakistan going to a nuclear level.

It amuses me that so many former Indian generals (even diplomats) should wittingly or unwittingly ignore this central tenet of any armed violence. Remember what American diplomat Henry Kissinger said about Vietnam? “We would not have recognised victory if it were staring us in the face, because we did not know what our objectives were.”
A good example of the terrible difficulty in achieving the political objective through battles is the headache Israel has faced (and continues to) vis-a-vis Hezbollah in Lebanon. Without going into the details of that trajectory, Israel finally tried to resolve it through the Dahiya doctrine — the strategy to bomb and destroy civilian infrastructure and kill civilians — with limited effect. And this in a scenario where Israel has complete air supremacy, something that just does not exist for India against Pakistan.
In fact, if statements by the current Indian air chief are anything to go by, as also informed analyses in the Indian media itself, “the IAF is struggling to maintain its operational edge, making it imperative to fast-track acquisitions and plug the equipment shortfall.”
LET’S BRING IN THE NUKES NOW
Nuclear weapons further complicate India’s calculus. This is not because Pakistan is likely to use that capability first and early in a conflict, but because the capability exists and the aggressor has to factor it in. A further complication is that Pakistan manages risk through deliberate ambiguity — what and where exactly are the red lines? In other words, the aggressor must push the conflict envelope at every stage at great escalation risk.
 
 

To simplify this, nuclear weapons are capable of immense destruction. Far from their actual use, their very presence (the threat) ensures, as British academic Philip Windsor noted, that “survival, instead of being a condition for the articulation of value, [becomes] itself the ultimate value.”
Even so, just as India has been trying to evolve a doctrine of proactive operations since the Twin Peaks crisis (2001-02), there was much talk during the Cold War of how to avoid the nuclear big bang and still be able to fight wars. This brought in the idea of ‘limited war’, a conflict which could be controlled in ways that would prevent escalation to an all-out nuclear war.
In other words, how to avoid a strategic nuclear exchange while resorting to what can be described as Louis XIV’s ultima ratio regum [final argument of kings]. Much thinking was invested in (a) creating a distinction between an all-out and a limited war and (b) how such a war could be won while avoiding the risks of escalation.
In essence, limited war became two different wars. Wars fought on the periphery — not direct confrontations between the two superpowers but mainly in the Global South — through proxies (that actually happened) and wars conjured up in tabletop crisis games that theorised about limited nuclear employment, much short of strategic exchanges that would surely evaporate millions of people on all sides.

The first destabilised the periphery but held the quiet at the centre (the centre being Central Europe) and gave us the term “stability-instability paradox.” The second was defenestrated after US Defence Secretary Casper Weinberger arranged a top-secret war game codenamed Proud Prophet, to test the hypotheses about limited nuclear exchanges.
The game, led by Thomas Schelling, put paid to the idea that limited would remain limited. Standard crisis actions led to a major nuclear war that killed half a billion people and left about the same number exposed to radiation. The documents about the game were declassified in 2016.
LIMITED WARS AND ESCALATION DOMINANCE
But let no one be disheartened by these statistics. After all, India is not planning a limited nuclear strike.
It only wants a limited conventional strike or maybe a few simultaneous limited strikes and it plans, presumably, to control escalation to avoid Pakistan going to a nuclear level.
Even Western strategists, including some smart American and British Indians, are arguing that this can be done — that India can punish Pakistan, that it can control escalation and that it can dominate escalation. Bingo! Problem solved!
Except, this is sheer poppycock! There’s no periphery where the US and the USSR played on conventional terms through proxies. The only periphery, metaphorically speaking, is the sub-conventional domain, where the two sides can employ covert means. India is already heavily involved in that domain, perpetrating and perpetuating violence against Pakistan. In fact, its current National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval is reported to have bragged about it in private.
In other words, India wants to conduct an overt, limited military operation to punish Pakistan and has convinced itself that it can choreograph the escalation levels. There are certain assumptions behind this. I wrote about this ‘theory’, if it can be called that, in these pages after the 2019 crisis in the article ‘Lessons from the Brink.’ Let me roughly reproduce what I wrote then in italics here.
 
 

There is a band in which India can use and exploit a limited conventional military option given its conventional superiority; if it does so in response to an attack it can pin on Pakistan, it has enough diplomatic weight to have the world opinion on its side for such a strike; Pakistan, having suffered a setback, will be hard-pressed to retaliate because it will have to climb up the escalation ladder, a costly proposition both for reasons of the earlier military setback as well as international diplomatic pressure; given India’s upper hand, both militarily and diplomatically, Pakistan will choose to not escalate; if, however, Pakistan did choose to escalate, India will still enjoy escalation dominance because of its superior capabilities and international diplomatic support; India, given its diplomatic and military heft, will be able to raise the costs for Pakistan in an escalation spiral.
Result: Pakistan will weigh the consequences as a rational-choice actor and prefer to climb down.
The basic premise in all this cannot be missed: the first-round result. Every subsequent assumption flows from what India could achieve militarily in the opening hand. However, if the presumably weaker side denies the stronger side success in the opening round, draws its own blood successfully while showing restraint, it can raise the costs for the stronger actor by upending the latter’s assumptions based on the success of the opening round.
In 2019, after an attack on a soldiers’ convoy in Pulwama in India-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, the starting premise went awry.
Also, these assumptions rest on yet another assumption: that the force asymmetry is such that India has a heavy advantage in the conventional realm, if not to a level where it could coerce Pakistan outright, then at least to the point where it can confidently launch such an attack and also blunt a Pakistani riposte if Pakistan chooses to retaliate. That assumption, swallowed hook, line and sinker even by many bright Western analysts (they still exist!) might just be flawed.
Within the concept of limited, we can assume the mechanisms of control to consist of limitation of means, the theatre of operations (nodal point(s) chosen for the strike) and time. Absent any one of these and limited doesn’t remain limited, much less planned and controlled. As noted above, Clausewitz’s argument was that the objective of war should be clearly defined and that objective must determine the means to that end.
In a more or less symmetric contest under the nuclear overhang, limited cannot remain limited if the two sides continue to draw blood and, in doing so, keep climbing higher up on the escalation ladder, neither prepared to climb down for reasons not just of prestige but also to establish deterrence — unless, of course, external actors can get involved, what former National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf calls “the brokered bargaining framework.” In such a scenario, the very attempt by both sides to dominate the escalation ladder would mean planned escalation by one party is dead.
 
 

American military strategist Bernard Brodie understood this clearly. In a nuclear overhang, limited war inverses the Clausewitzian ends-means relationship. Means become paramount, not because the objective is not defined “but because it is the avoidance of certain means [nuclear weapons] that determines the end.” This would also mean avoiding certain targets, which implies some form of restraint.
But exercising restraint — a resolve that can continue to loosen as more blood is shed — also indicates that it is better to find a settlement ex ante [before the conflict begins] than go through the cost during and after a conflict.
In any case, as should be evident, all of this reflects the need to prevent escalation, because it cannot remain planned and matters can get out of hand rapidly. That brings us to the question of why Pakistan and India keep getting into these cycles.
KASHMIR AND THE SUBCONTINENT’S TRAP
German theologian and anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer once said, “If you board the wrong train, it is no use running along the corridor in the opposite direction.” This sums up aptly India’s Kashmir problem.
Kashmiris don’t want to stay in India; Pakistan won’t let go of the dispute since it’s alive on the United Nations agenda and remains unresolved. India’s policy is to suppress the Kashmiris on the one hand and blame Pakistan for its woes in Kashmir on the other.
Traditionally, New Delhi has adopted two strategies. During periods of normalisation, it has talked about talks with Pakistan, rather than any substantive, result-oriented dialogue (the mid-noughties saw an opportunity but that was lost). Simultaneously, within, it has alternated between opening a track with Srinagar while using force to keep the Kashmiris suppressed.
 
 

That has not worked because there is a wide chasm between how the Indian state looks at the definition of what a “political solution” means and through what processes it can be arrived at, and how the Kashmiris perceive it.
On the Kashmiri side too, the pro-India parties, National Conference (NC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), while not asking for breaking away from India, look at a political solution in terms of greater autonomy and, since 2019, the revival of Article 370 in its original, not hollowed-out form. The Hurriyat factions and the Kashmiri youth have their own definition of a political solution and that doesn’t fit in with the NC and PDP view. A fair referendum today would see Kashmiris opting out of India.
 

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing a gathering on April 24, 2025: since coming into power, Modi has steadily moved India towards a two-pronged policy that seeks to isolate Pakistan and attempts to give Pakistan a ‘decisive blow’ | AFP

Since the coming into power of Narendra Modi, India’s policy of a “political solution” has changed. Modi has steadily moved toward a two-pronged policy that (a) seeks to isolate Pakistan and (b) attempts to give Pakistan a ‘decisive blow.’ The two prongs are supposed to work in tandem.
As Indian NSA Ajit Doval said at a talk in 2010 when he was a private citizen, Kashmiris have to be assimilated and he believes that doing so requires that Pakistan’s mindset be changed. Put another way, India has decided that Kashmir is its Pakistan problem, pushing Kashmir and Kashmiris out of the picture altogether.
This is precisely what the right wing in Zionist Israel has tried to do with the Palestinians. In fact, it is instructive to see how much has India picked up from the Israeli playbook.
Pakistan’s own Kashmir policy has been flawed at multiple levels and has harmed the Kashmiri cause immensely. It has helped India to (a) position the issue as an India-Pakistan dispute rather than an issue of Kashmiris’ right to self-determination and (b) present it as a problem of ‘terrorism’ and the struggle as religion-oriented rather than one for freedom from India’s oppressive and illegal occupation of Kashmir.
 
 

The two — resistance, armed or unarmed, and terrorism — are qualitatively different, as United Nations General Assembly resolutions 2625 and 3246 testify through their language, affirming the legitimacy of resistance by oppressed and occupied peoples in pursuit of the right to self-determination.
By making Kashmir an India-Pakistan problem and by terming Kashmiris’ armed resistance as ‘terrorism’ sponsored by Pakistan, India has sought to and has been successful in (a) removing the real issue from the international agenda (the right to self-determination) and (b) making space for the self-defence argument every time there’s an armed attack in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Since 2016, it has also entrapped itself in its own muscular rhetoric of taking the war into Pakistan. The right-wing Indian government’s belligerent statements create the domestic demand, especially in the Hindutva constituency, for action on the ground to match the rhetoric.
This is also borne out by the obsequiousness with which Mr Modi dealt with China after Chinese troops killed 20 Indian soldiers, including the commanding officer of the unit, and captured seven officers who were later returned. Modi would not even concede that the Chinese had pushed back Indian troops. He was roundly criticised for not stating the real situation on the ground. On the plus side, his restraint kept the sentiments at a manageable level, a prerequisite for a diplomatic solution.
EPILOGUE
India-Pakistan relations are normally discussed with reference to various disputes. But the issue is structural. Disputes are markers and, as in the case of Kashmir, can cause wars. In terms of Pakistan’s threat perception from India, two issues are important.
In the immediate wake of Partition, the two states went to war over Kashmir after the Poonch and Gilgit-Baltistan uprisings by the locals against Dogra rule. In July-August 1951, there was another scare with mutual allegations of troop deployments close to the border. The issue of sharing rivers’ waters was also hanging fire.
As Gen Ayub Khan wrote in his book Friends Not Masters, this was a crucial issue and, given that India had earlier threatened to block Pakistan’s share of the rivers waters and released the flow only under strict conditions, he had to move fast and decisively. That was the basis of the Indus Waters Treaty.
 
 

Ayub Khan understood that Pakistan’s “aim should be to build up a military deterrent force with adequate offensive and defensive power.” He argued that this was important because “India’s aim is to expand, dominate and spread her influence.” He was right.
The issue is not just India’s military strength but the natural inclination of India as a state to increase its influence within and outside the region. The important point in this is not so much a fear that India could conquer and hold Pakistani territory — though at the tactical level that cannot be dismissed (Siachen being an example) — but that India should not be allowed to get into a position where it can use a mix of non-kinetic and kinetic means to coerce Pakistan into accepting its terms.
That is a structural problem when a state is in the vicinity of a much bigger neighbour that aims to project power. There is empirical evidence that India has reached a state of peace with only those neighbours that have accepted New Delhi’s terms for peace and its hegemonic presence.
It is, therefore, important to view and analyse Pakistan’s responses in terms of the peculiarities of the make-up and structure of South Asian state-to-state relations, and how India and Pakistan have positioned themselves within it.
Put another way, the argument here is not just about the real or perceived Indian threat to Pakistan. Threat levels can fluctuate and whether they are/were real or perceived, can be, and is, debated. The point is both broader and — as noted — structural, and relates to Pakistan’s drive to avoid being dictated to by India.
This is not to say that the two sides cannot find a modus vivendi. They can. But that requires engagement and an understanding on India’s side that Pakistan is not what Egypt or Jordan are to Israel. I didn’t say Canada to the US because the situation there is fast changing and actually proves the structural-realist argument that relative power is the most important determinant of interstate behaviour.
The 19th century Austrian empire’s diplomat and statesman Klemens von Metternich (1773-1859) understood the nature of power. It was precisely this understanding which led him to infuse the power of reason into the diplomatic arrangement known as the ‘Concert of Europe’, to avoid war among Europe’s powers. The system, while cognisant of the interests of the states, sought to temper power through shared values.
German statesman Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) thought it unwise to subordinate power to a higher principle. Nonetheless, he too understood clearly the limits of power and, after the wars of unification, set down to ensure that Germany did not get involved in a European war, especially in the Balkans. We know how that changed with the last German emperor Wilhelm II’s Icarian overreach for dominance.
The current government in India is embarked on a policy of unilateralism and non-engagement with Pakistan. The policy is underpinned by a high dose of hubris, which is often openly on display. It is ironic, as its own script shows, that it just cannot wish Pakistan away.
There’s no substitute to positive engagement. But if the two sides are to engage meaningfully, India will have to change that mindset. Unfortunately, it does not appear that that is likely to happen anytime soon.

It was a genuine thriller as in-form Quetta Gladiators looked to upstage table toppers Islamabad United on a track which had everything for all. 
Medium-pacer Moha­mmad Shahzad was given the ball to bowl the final over with Gladiators needing 15 to win.
Shahzad off his own bowling dropped Hasan who top edged a short ball. The very next ball, captain Salman Ali Agha floored a difficult chance in the slip as the batters took two runs. The 22-year-old Hasan lifted the pacer for a six over long-off before wicket-keeper Andries Gous in confusion failed to gather the ball while running towards third man, giving Hasan yet another life as the batters added two more.
Hasan — who made a superb 64 not out off 41 balls with four sixes and two fours — had the last laugh on the penultimate ball as the right-hander smashed a slightly short delivery for a six over backward square leg giving Gladiators a memorable win besides lifting them to top of the table. They now have 11 points from eight games while United have 10 in as many matches.
Chasing 158, Gladiators got off to a swift start but lost both the openers inside the first four overs.
Captain Saud Shakeel was caught nicely by Mohammad Shahzad at point off paceman Salman Irshad on the last ball of the third over.
Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who was hit for a couple of fours by Finn Allen in the second over, came back to dismiss the batter in the fourth over who was caught by Jason Holder. Gladiators were now 28-2. Allen made 20 off 13 balls.
One-down batter Rilee Rossouw thumped pacer Jason Holder for four fours as Gladiators crossed the half-century mark to end the powerplay at 53-2.
Following a 52-run partnership off 38 balls with Hasan Nawaz, Rossouw’s 27 off 24 knock ended in a horrible run-out in the 10th over. The left-hander failed to return to the non-striker’s end after being sent back by his partner who was not interested in a run after playing a shot to short fine leg. 
Mark Chapman did not last long and, looking to play a lofted shot, was caught by Haider Ali at long-on off Nawaz in the 11th over as Gladiators slumped to 84-4.
A massive six by Hasan off Nawaz over long-on helped Gladiators reach 100 in 12.2 overs.
Haseebullah Khan (seven) was caught by Gous off a Holder’s back-of-length ball just outside the off stump in the 14th over. The batter reviewed the decision but the on-field umpire’s call was upheld.
Faheem Ashraf (six) was caught brilliantly by Holder off Salman Ali Agha at short cover while Kyle Jamieson’s (three) wicket was claimed by pacer Salman as United ended the 16th over at 117-7.  Mohammad Wasim’s cameo (16 off 11) was ended by Naseem Shah in the 19th over.
Earlier, United posted a decent 157-9 after being asked to bat first.
Sahibzada Farhan and Kyle Mayers gave United a brisk 58-run stand inside the powerplay.
In-form Farhan, who cracked pacer Kyle Jamieson for a six over widish mid-wicket in the very first over, clearly looked more aggressive than his partner — smashing fast bowler Khurram Shahzad for a six in the fourth over before hitting paceman Mohammad Wasim Junior for a four and then back-to-back sixes over fine leg in the fifth over as United cruised to 50 in 4.5 overs.
After pulling mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed for a maximum in the sixth over, Mayers was cleaned up on the very next ball. He made 22 off 17 as United ended the powerplay at 59-1.
After the departure of Mayers, United kept losing wickets.
Medium pacer Faheem jolted United with a double strike in the ninth over.
First, he dismissed Colin Munro (nine off 13) who was caught by wicket-keeper Haseebullah and then sent captain Salman Ali Agha (naught) back to the pavilion as the batter top-edged a short ball which was caught by Mark Chapman at deep square leg. United were now 70-3.
Saud, the part-time slow left-arm spinner, in the next over bowled a dangerous-looking Farhan who failed in his attempt to play a slog sweep. Farhan made 39 off 24 balls with the aid of four sixes and a couple of fours.
Faheem excelled again with two wickets in the 13th over.
The pacer picked up his third wicket when he bowled wicket-keeper/batter Andries Gous (eight). Two balls later, Shahzad (zero) fell as Saud took a stunning catch while diving to his right at extra cover that left United 91-6 in 13 overs.
Mohammad Nawaz, who was dropped by Jamieson off Faheem at long-on in the 13th over, took full advantage of the chance plundering 49 off 34 with help of five sixes and a four.
In the process, he alongside Haider (10) added a crucial 39 runs off 26 balls for the seventh wicket before the latter was caught by Rossouw at long-on off Khurram.
After touching 100 mark in 15.1 overs, United accelerated scoring courtesy Nawaz’s calculated hitting.
Having hit Jamieson for a maximum in the 11th over, Nawaz smashed Abrar for a six in the 16th over; the left-hander in the next over lifted Faheem for two more sixes and then struck a six and a four off Jamieson in the last over before getting caught brilliantly by Haseebullah. Jason Holder made 14 not out off 11.
Faheem picked up 4-25 in three overs.

While KWSC Chief Operating Officer Asadullah Khan had on Thursday said that the repair work would be completed by Saturday night, a water utility spokesman said that the repair work was still in progress and would be completed by Sunday (today).
The leakage in the main supply line wreaked havoc on Karachi University and nearby housing societies. It also caused an acute water shortage in several areas of the metropolis.
 
 

Officials said that the city required over 1,200 million gallons of water daily and it was getting 400 MGD, out of a regular supply of 650MGD, due to the repair work on the Siphon No 19.
The KWSC spokesman said that the water would be released to the Siphon No 19 after the completion of the repair work. The water pumped from the Dhabeji Pumping Station usually took 14 to 16 hours to reach the city’s distribution network, he added.

“100 per cent of samples of tea leaves and 90 per cent of milk samples collected in different areas have been found adulterated and contaminated with chemicals and added colours,” the officials added.
Speaking to Dawn on Saturday, they said that the SFA had recently inspected as many as 127 tea shops and stalls in different parts of Karachi to collect samples of the two major ingredients of the aromatic beverage prepared by boiling water, milk, sugar and cured leaves.
Their analysis showed that all of them were using contaminated and adulterated tea leaves, while only 10 per cent were using pure milk, they added.

Food Authority says milk was adulterated with detergent, carbonates, salt and water

They said that 80 per cent samples of the milk collected from 127 tea shops were found adulterated with different chemicals, while 10 per cent had water adulteration.
The sources added that the milk samples were found adulterated and contaminated with detergent, carbonates, salt, sugar, skimmed milk and added water.
They said, tea leaves in all 110 inspected tea stalls and shops were also found adulterated and contaminated.
SFA Director General Asif Jan Siddiqui said that the collected samples of the milk and tea leaves were examined by the collaborated laboratory of the SFA and the University of Karachi.
He said the authority had planned a strict action against the use of adulterated and contaminated ingredients of tea — a popular hot drink throughout the world. “Strict action will be taken against those involved in the supply and business of the adulterated milk and tea leaves,” he added.
Mr Siddiqui said that the drive against the use of adulterated ingredients in chai had been launched in all seven districts of the city and all 127 samples of the tea leaves contained polyphenols, a low-cost material found in different plants and used by manufactures and supplies to increase profit.
The SFA chief said that tea adulteration with other plants negatively impacts health, potentially leading to digestive issues and other complications.
He said that the adulterants diluted the natural polyphenol content of the tea, affecting its quality.
The officials said that the tea shops and stalls were selected in different localities across the city. The areas included Clifton, Saddar, Burns Road, old city areas, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area, Gulshan Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Korangi, Shah Faisal, SITE, Keamari and Malir.
The district-wise report of the samples, available with Dawn, said that only 10 per cent sample were found adulterated with added water and did not have any other adulterants.
 
 

According to the district-wise break-up of the collected samples, he said that as many as 43 samples of milk were taken from as many shops in district South and 19 of them were found adulterated.
Nine out of 16 samples collected in Korangi were detected adulterated, 10 out of 20 in Malir, five out of 16 in East, six out of 13 in Keamari, three out of seven in West and two out of 12 samples in district Central.
Alarmingly, all 110 samples of tea leaves in seven districts were found adulterated with polyphenols.
Of them, 43 were taken in district South, 16 in Korangi, three in West, 13 in Keamari, 16 each in East and Malir and three in district Central.

The authorities were using a private van to transport prisoners; the driver and the vehicle were released by the gunmen.
Officials said that a police team was shifting 10 prisoners to Quetta and the central jail in Mach from Gadani jail.
 
 

When the wagon reached the Mangocher area of the Kalat district in late evening, the armed men were blocking the national highway and inspecting every vehicle, including buses and trucks.
After they came across the prison van, they freed the prisoners and kidnapped five police personnel, who were guarding the van, along with their official weapons.
Two police personnel dressed in plainclothes, however, remained safe.
The prisoners included one condemned prisoner who was awarded a death sentence and another was awarded life imprisonment and both were tried for killing their wives. Other prisoners allegedly involved in drug smuggling were coming to Quetta for their case hearing on May 5.
Officials said that security forces had launched a search operation in the hilly area of Mongochar and the surrounding areas to recover the hostages. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.

An official statement issued here said that Mr Saif met deputy head of the US Embassy in Islamabad where both sides discussed the tense situation between Pakistan and India following the ‘false flag’ operation in Pahalgam.
The discussions also covered regional peace, law and order, and the political climate at both national and provincial levels, the statement said, adding that Mr Saif strongly condemned India’s baseless allegations post-Pahalgam and highlighted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war-mongering behaviour.
The statement said that the KP government’s spokesperson briefed the US diplomat on ‘politically-motivated’ and ‘fabricated’ cases against political prisoners, including PTI founding chairman Imran Khan. 
The two sides also discussed development issues in the province, especially in the merged districts.
Mr Saif stated that the KP government was specially focusing on development of the merged areas, and emphasised that the provincial government was investing heavily in improving law and order, education, and health sectors for the welfare of the people.
The US diplomat appreciated the provincial government’s initiatives for public welfare and assured full cooperation from the United States, the statement said.

• GB lawmakers call for RTI law in region
ISLAMABAD: The opposition party, PTI, has accused the government of harassing journalists and viewing the freedom of expression as a “threat”.
In a statement issued on World Press Freedom Day, the party claimed dozens of journalists have been harassed, abducted or targeted with false cases over the past year.
“Incidents like the martyrdom of renowned journalist Arshad Sharif stand as clear examples of the choking of independent journalism,” the PTI said, while referring to the journalist killed in Kenya in 2022 before the incumbent government came into power.
 
 

“In addition, prominent journalists such as Kashif Abbasi, Arif Hameed Bhatti, Habib Akram, Paras Jahanzeb and many others “who dared to speak the truth” have been deprived of their livelihoods,” said the PTI information secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, in an apparent reference to news anchors taken off air during the past few months.
Mr Akram expressed concern over the press freedom in Pakistan which was “currently under severe state repression, censorship, and retaliatory actions”.
Pakistan dropped to 158th spot (out of 180 countries) on the 2025 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. This was only marginally one point lower than 2022 — the last year of PTI’s government — when Pakistan ranked 157th.
Mr Akram alleged the current government has imposed “strict restrictions” on digital and social media.
 
 

He said pro-PTI YouTube channels and X accounts were being shut down while “journalists who speak the truth” were either being forced to leave the country or removed from their jobs.
The PTI leader questioned why senior journalists were being targeted for disagreeing with the government’s narrative and why despite court orders, there was an “undeclared ban on covering PTI or even mentioning Imran Khan’s name” on TV? He also demanded the restoration of X in Pakistan.
RTI law for GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan, government and opposition lawmakers highlighted the challenges faced by journalists in the region and called for the Right of Access to Information (RTI) law.
At an event held at the Central Press Club Gilgit in connection with the World Press Freedom Day on Saturday, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed said the assembly will play its role in formulating laws to facilitate journalists.
“The Right to Information Act submitted in the GB Assembly will be approved after necessary amendments.”
Speaking on the occasion, the president of PPP GB chapter, Amjad Hussain Advocate, said journalists in the region were facing more challenges than their counterparts in other parts of the country.
 
 

Special Assistant to GB Chief Minister on Information Iman Shah said the approval of the proposed media and digital media policy was being deliberately delayed. He said Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarrar has assured of steps for the betterment of the media industry and journalists.
Member of the Assembly and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Information Javed Manwa said the RTI Act has been submitted to the assembly, but no progress has been made on it yet.
He clarified that without the legislation, there will be risks of disinformation and misinformation.
Representatives of journalists’ bodies also spoke about their issues. They said the RTI Act needed to be implemented after approval from the assembly.
They said the GB government was using advertisements “as a weapon to suppress the voice of journalists and media houses” in the region.
Later, journalists took a rally from the Central Press Club to Chinarbagh to demand in favour of their demands.
Separately, the newly elected Central Press Club Gilgit cabinet members also took their oath on Saturday.
Speaker Ahmed administered the oath to newly elected President Tahir Rana, General Secretary Wajahat Ali, Senior Vice President Imtiaz Ali Sultan, Vice President Saadat Ali, Finance Secretary Nadeem Khan and Joint Secretary Syed Sher Abbas.

Tensions between the nuclear-armed countries have soared since the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir in which 26 people were killed on April 22.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his military “full operational freedom” to respond while Islamabad earlier this week warned they had “credible intelligence” that India was planning imminent strikes.
 
 

High season in the cooler climes of the Neelum Valley, the tourist centre of AJK, begins in May as temperatures around the rest of the country rise.
“It’s been a really bad start,” said Muhammad Awais, a 22-year-old photographer at a popular picnic spot.

Tourism drives Neelum Valley’s economy, attracting 300,000 visitors annually

Tourism is the Neelum Valley’s lifeline, drawing over 300,000 visitors each year from all over Pakistan, according to the district administration.
Much of the local population depends on roughly 350 guesthouses, which employ thousands of families.
“Our livelihoods depend on tourism, and without it, we suffer,” Awais told AFP.
“The way things are unfolding is very slow, and it’s affecting our work badly.” This week police and soldiers at army checkpoints barred tourists from entering the valley, allowing only local residents through the checkpoint.
Tourists were instead told to return to the main town of Muzaffarabad.
“It’s extremely disappointing that the government did not warn us or advise against visiting,” said Saleem Uddin Siddique, who travelled from the capital Islamabad with his family. “Our hopes are now dashed,” the 69-year-old retired accountant said.
‘We don’t want war’
Islamabad has denied any involvement in last month’s attack at Pahalgam and the uneasy neighbours have issued a raft of tit-for-tat punitive diplomatic measures.
The two South Asian nations have exchanged gunfire for nine consecutive nights along the militarised Line of Control, according to Indian defence sources.
 
 

International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to settle their differences through talks.
On India’s heavily fortified border, residents of farming villages along the Chenab river have sent families back from the frontier, recalling the terror of the last major conflict between the two nations in 1999.
There has been an exodus of tourists on the Indian side of the border too since the Pahalgam attack.
Indian authorities have heavily promoted the region as a holiday destination, both for skiing in winter and to escape the sweltering heat of the summer.
The AJK government has ordered religious schools to close and urged residents to stockpile food. However, some tourists continued to arrive undeterred.

“We don’t think the threat of possible war is serious,” said Mudasar Maqsood, a 39-year-old factory worker from the eastern city of Kasur, over 630km away, who was blocked along with his friends from entering the valley.
“We should not disrupt our routine life,” he added.
Raja Iftikhar Khan, the president of private tourism association, said the situation could become “extremely dire”.
“This disruption has been devastating for all those tied to tourism,” he said. “We don’t want war — no sensible businessperson ever does”.

Paweł Małaszko arrived in Gilgit on Saturday as part of his adventure to cycle across Pakistan — from the shores of the Arabian Sea to the K2 Base Camp.
However, his adventure was stalled as the required permit to go to the popular tourist destination couldn’t be issued due to an ongoing legal battle.
On Friday, the GB Chief Court ordered the government to issue the trekking permit to Mr Małaszko.
Last year, the GB government hiked permit fees for mountaineering and trekking expeditions by 300 per cent under the GB Finance Act, 2024.
The region’s tour operators challenged the decision in court, which issued a stay order, effectively suspending the issuance of new permits.
Mr Małaszko had filed an appeal in the GB Chief Court for the trekking permit, according to Asghar Ali Porik, a tour operator.

An official of the GB tourism department said the Polish cyclist has been granted a trekking permit after the court order.
However, permits to other foreigners couldn’t be issued until the court gives a clear directive, the official added.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Małaszko confirmed his journey to the K2 basecamp would begin in the next couple of days.
Before his journey to the K2 Base Camp,  the cyclist travelled to the Khunjerab Pass from Gilgit on Saturday.
He arrived in Gilgit after cycling from Kara­chi, covering a distance of around 1,900 kilometres.
Mr Małaszko said the expedition was not only his dream but also “an opportunity to promote Pakistan as a destination for adventure and exploration throughout Europe and beyond”.
‘Tourism to take a hit’
Since the stay order by the GB Chief Court, the tourism department has stopped issuing permits to foreign adventurers.
The matter has been pending for more than two months since a hearing could not be held due to lawyers’ strike.
Muhammad Ali, a tour operator, told Dawn the delays might force foreigners to cancel their trips this year.
 
 

He added that this would badly hurt the tourism sector as a large number of foreign tourists have planned to visit Pakistan for trekking and mountaineering this year.
The GB tourism department official said 900 foreign mountaineers and trekkers have applied for a visa this year, with more applying for visas every day. Official sources told Dawn the GB cabinet was likely to discuss the issue of permits on May 6.

The phrase is often attributed to the American visual artist Andy Warhol. In 1968, Warhol ‘predicted’ that tools to become famous (albeit for a brief period of time) will become available to every person. 
Indeed, today, anyone can gain short bursts of fame by using digital tools and social media platforms. But such folk often fall back into oblivion. The irony is, if gaining fame has become easier, sustaining it has become harder. Fame can be addictive — even that of the 15-minute variety. People want to elongate it. They become desperate enough to even cross certain ethical boundaries to remain in the picture. 
And when they can’t, they plunge into depression. Some ultimately accept their fate, but some try to rekindle moments of ‘fame’ by triggering sympathy for themselves through self-pitying/ teary-eyed videos and posts. They may also start talking about their deteriorating mental health, or apologise for their ‘unethical’ behaviour. This may lead to another round of ‘fame’, but one that doesn’t have much staying power as well. 
The desire to cling to one’s 15 minutes of fame can be a rather awkward manifestation of pathos. It is present in politics as well. In May 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic had started to peak, a report by Reno-based journalist William Puchert pleaded that the state government of Nevada start taking more serious steps against protesters who were regularly gathering to oppose the mandatory wearing of masks and the closure of shops. 

From viral videos to populist protests, fame in today’s world is fast, frequent and fleeting. But the pursuit of attention, even in the political arena, can lead to distorted priorities and the manipulation of genuine causes for personal visibility

Puchert wrote, “It’s time for their 15 minutes of fame to be over.” According to Puchert, the protesters were not only becoming willing conduits of the highly contagious Covid-19 virus, but that they were holding protests because they had started to enjoy the coverage they were getting in the media. 
Puchert was sure the moment the media stopped giving them coverage the protesters were likely to disperse. Yet, it was also possible that decreasing media coverage could have made the protesters adopt even more desperate tactics to cling on to their ‘fame.’
 
 

Take the recent example of protests in Sindh against the federal government’s decision to irrigate a corporate farming project in the arid Cholistan region in Punjab through canals cut from parts of the River Indus that runs across Sindh. The Sindh government is headed by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
Parties that oppose the PPP-led government began to hold protests against the project. 
Pressured by Sindhi nationalist groups, the Islamist Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), the conservative Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), and the populist Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the PPP-led provincial government, too, began holding rallies against the project. It then accelerated the process of making the federal government put the project on the backburner. 
The PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto argued that, at a time when India was threatening all-out war and the cancellation of a vital water treaty with Pakistan, the situation required that the canal project be postponed. The federal government agreed. Yet, even though the size of the protests shrank, they began to get more aggressive. 
 


I believe this was/is a case of (political) 15 minutes of fame. Consider this: figuratively speaking, since 2008, Sindhi nationalists, PTI, JUIF and GDA combined have never received as many votes in an election in Sindh as the number of hours of media coverage that they have recently received. Especially to the Sindhi nationalists, it doesn’t really matter anymore if the project has finally been halted. Leaders who often lose by tens of thousands of votes to PPP candidates in Sindh suddenly began to see their photos, flags and words in all kinds of media. 
But after the project was postponed, their 15 minutes of fame began winding down. As I am writing this (on Monday, April 28), some attempts were being made by Sindhi nationalists to force the Sindh government’s hand. With the media now more focused on the rising tensions between Pakistan and India, violence at an anti-canal protest alone can keep the Sindhi nationalists in the picture. They want to cling to the ‘fame’ that they enjoyed and now think they might be losing it. They are. 
Clingers in this regard start to intently focus on one specific area of concern, while overlooking other important concerns. When the recent Pakistan-India tensions began to peak, the anti-canal protests or, for that matter, a strike call by the Jamaat-i-Islami to protest against Israeli brutalities in Gaza, started to seem out of place.
So, can one assume that those who try to cling to their 15 minutes of fame may end up divorcing themselves from reality that exists outside their own immediate interests? 
In December 2014, when the Nawaz Sharif government and the military establishment decided to launch a large-scale military operation against Islamist militants, PTI chief Imran Khan was holding a sit-in in Islamabad against the Nawaz regime. 
 
 

When asked to end the sit-in by the government and sign a multiparty agreement on the military operation, Khan refused. The then military chief Gen Raheel Sharif had to arm-twist Khan into calling off the sit-in. 
As Khan was moving out of the sit-in area, his car was swarmed by groups of men and women who were pleading him not to go. One of them was a good friend’s maternal aunt. My friend told me she was there at the sit-in from day one and one could often see her on TV as well. She became a celebrity of sorts in her circle of friends and relatives.
But now there she was, weeping and urging Khan not to end the sit-in. It didn’t matter to her that just a few days before, militants had slaughtered over 140 students and teachers at a school in Peshawar. Instead, to retain that ‘buzz’ and attention that she had received during the heyday of the sit-in, she willingly cut herself off from a less glorious reality.
Unfortunately, she then slipped into depression. My friend never mentioned her again. He still doesn’t.

A Sri Lankan Airlines fli­ght from Chennai to Colo­mbo was thoroughly sear­ched upon arrival by Colo­mbo police on Saturday after the Chennai control centre alerted them about the possibility that the Pahalgam “suspects are on board”.
The airline said its flight UL122 arrived in Colombo from Chennai at 11:59am and was subjected to a “comprehensive security search” upon arrival.
 
 

“This was carried out in coordination with local authorities following an alert from the Chennai Area Control Centre regarding a suspect wanted in India who was believed to be on board.”
Speaking some 10 days after the massacre in India-held Kashmir, a Congress politician expressed doubt if the Modi government was competent to catch the attac­kers. His comments were turned into a criticism of the army, forcing him to retract.
Dismissal of ministers, NSA
The glaring security and intelligence failure have drawn criticism from opposition and defence analysts as demands have been raised for the resignation of home and defence ministers.
Some analysts have called for the dismissal of the national security adviser (NSA).
Reports are coming in of how the attackers trapped the tourists by mingling with them and shepherding them towards a place on the meadow from where they could not escape.
 
 

The Hindu quoted a senior government official as saying on Saturday that two attackers who had earlier mingled with the tourists herded the startled crowd towards the two shooters, who then segregated tourists based on religion and killed them.
It said the attack happened at two to three points within 50 metres of the entry-cum-exit point at Baisaran and so far, it seemed “four men were involved”. The meadow is fenced from all sides.
The official said two of them deliberately herded people towards the shooters, knowing that the crowd would scatter after hearing gunshots.
The official was further quoted by The Hindu report as disclosing that they received specific intelligence input on an attack at “hotels” in Srinagar and Dachigam, some 22km from Srinagar, on April 19, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to inaugurate the Katra-Sangaldan stretch of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link.
 
 

However, the PM’s visit was cancelled due to inclement weather after which the tourists were targeted, the official believed.
“A lot of chatter was picked up by security agencies for a month before the attack on April 22. This is why senior police officers were stationed in Srinagar four to five days prior to the attack and they were also trying to build on the information,” said the official.
However, another official said the input was generic, suggesting the target could be “security personnel deployed at hotels”.
90-minute delay
While he claimed the delay of more than 90 minutes for the Army to reach the shooting site was a tactical move to avoid collateral damage to the security forces, the other official according to The Hindu cited the long wait for mobilisation of adequate personnel behind the delay.
By the time reinforcements reached Baisaran, the attackers had already fled into the forests.
Two days after the attack, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah while talking to MPs at an all-party meeting blamed nearby hotels for sending tourists to Baisaran “without informing the police”.
He admitted that there was no security presence at the place on the day of the shooting, though the tourist site was usually provided with security well before the start of Amarnath Yatra in July.
However, the official quoted by The Hindu in its report said Baisaran meadow is open throughout the year, except during the Amarnath pilgrimage.
The tender to maintain the tourist site was awarded to a Bijbehara resident in August 2024 and there is no government order suggesting that it is a regulated area under security watch.

• Some see status quo after tomorrow’s meeting as war-like situation expected to hike food prices
KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11 per cent, opinions on the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) likely decision on the policy rate are divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
Researchers conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Monday to set the key interest rate for the next two months. The central bank had delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate unchanged in the last review, disappointing the business community, which was demanding a substantial cut of at least 500bps. Many experts were expecting a slight cut of up to 50bps.
However, once again, many experts believe the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some have also found reason for a likely status quot as they feel the war-like situation between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.
This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.
In a poll conducted by Topline Securities, 69pc of market participants expect a rate cut of at least 50bps, while 31pc believe that the central bank will maintain the status quo.
“We believe the central bank will maintain the status quo in the upcoming meeting,” said the Topline.
The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to bottom out and clock in below 0.50pc year-on-year at 0.29pc. For the full FY25, inflation is expected to average between 4.5 and 5pc, it added.
However, a poll conducted by Reuters shows that out of 14 analysts and investors, nine believe that the State Bank will keep the rate unchanged; three expect a 50bps cut, while the two were expecting a 100bps cut.
Due to continuous deceleration in inflation, it is generally believed in the financial sector that the interest rate should be reduced for two reasons: to attract domestic investors, increase economic growth, and reduce the real interest rate, now over 11pc.
The State Bank has slashed the interest by 1,000bps since June 2024 to 12pc and kept it unchanged in March. The business circle demands further cuts to revive economic activities, but the policymakers look cautious, fearing higher inflation in the coming months.
Some bankers believe the geopolitical tensions added uncertainty, which demands a cautious approach.
A Tresmark (global currency tracker) poll shows 68pc of traders expect no change in monetary policy stance. CPI has collapsed to 0.3pc in April against 0.7pc in March and 17.3pc last year. Core inflation has dipped to 7.4pc. A textbook setup for a rate cutMarkets are rattled by trade risks, capital outflows, and a central bank that’s rightly cautious, it said.
“Over $225m has quietly exited from bonds and equities in April. A cut could widen the exit door,” said the Tresmark report.
“That said, the growth story is buried. Export-to-GDP keeps falling. FDI is limp. If there’s ever been a case for monetary stimulus, it’s now. Perhaps the central bank may need to prioritise growth over caution,” said Tresmark CEO Faisal Mamsa.
Businesses call for major cut
Meanwhile, the United Business Group leader has strongly slammed the high interest rate regime and said that the benefits of low inflation should be reflected in the SBP policy rate decision.
Member Central Core Committee United Business Group (FPCCI) Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari said that 0.3pc inflation in April had created a ground to cut the interest rate by 400bps to 8pc and bring down the electricity tariff to Rs26 per unit to provide real relief to the economy.
“When inflation has dropped to such a low level, bringing the policy rate down to single digits is both economically logical and essential for policy coherence,” he said while addressing a meeting of the business community in Islamabad on Saturday.
“Reducing the interest rate to 8pc would stimulate investment, lower borrowing costs, and accelerate economic activity,” he said.
At the same time, the business community expressed serious concerns about high electricity rates, which were hurting industrial production and squeezing the purchasing power of ordinary consumers.
The business community warned that if this opportunity is not seized, the country could face industrial stagnation, unemployment, and economic slowdown despite the temporary dip in inflation.
The Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) also urged the SBP to cut its policy rate to single digits to stimulate industrial activity and drive sustainable economic growth.
RCCI President Usman Shaukat emphasised that the current interest rate is significantly hampering business growth and must be lowered.
“Pakistan currently maintains the highest interest rate regime in the region,” said Mr Shaukat in a statement.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of April 30, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
Earlier today, India said Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.
“This order is issued to ensure safety of Indian assets, cargo and connected infrastructure, in public interest and for interest of Indian shipping,” the Directorate General of Shipping said in a statement.
Similarly, an order issued later today from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs’ Ports and Shipping Wing said: “In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.”
Following last week’s tit-for-tat measures, New Delhi has taken more steps against Pakistan, including closing its airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23 and blocking social media accounts of media and leaders.
Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.
In August 2019, Pakistan had already formally downgraded its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.
India bans all imports from Pakistan, suspends inbound mail
India also said it banned the import of goods originating from or transiting via Pakistan and suspended the exchange of inbound mail and parcels.
India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notification, said the ban on all imports will take effect immediately.
“This restriction is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy,” it said.
 
 

In response to India’s slew of aggressive moves against the country in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan announced retaliatory measures that have included halting all border trade, closing its airspace to Indian carriers and expelling Indian diplomats.
However, Pakistan earlier this week allowed 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
In another step to cut off ties, the Indian government also announced today it was suspending the exchange of all “inbound mail and parcels” from Pakistan.
“Government of India has decided to suspend exchange of all categories of inbound mail and parcels from Pakistan through air and surface routes,” a public notice issued by its communications ministry said, according to Hindustan Times.
The notification was also shared on the official X account of India’s Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia.
 


Mail exchanges between the two arch-rivals also saw a breakdown in 2019 following India’s revocation of occupied Kashmir’s special status, according to ANI News.
Pakistan suspended postal mail services in August 2019 and resumed them in November that year, ANI said, citing Pakistani media reports.
Parcel services, however, remained suspended as of Nov 19, 2019, the report added.
Attaullah Tarar’s social media account also blocked
Meanwhile, India continued its blocking spree as Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said today his social media account had also been blocked in the neighbouring country, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
 
 

The Indian government has already blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) for users in India.
India has blocked dozens of accounts so far in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, including of high-profile Pakistani cricketers, actors, entertainment channels, news publications and journalists.
Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”
LoC visit for media
Separately, the information ministry said it was facilitating a visit for media representatives, both local and international, to the Line of Control (LoC) for Saturday and Sunday “to expose India’s baseless and fabricated propaganda regarding so-called and imaginary ‘terrorist camps’ in Pakistan”.
“India has repeatedly made unfounded and baseless claims about alleged terrorist hideouts along the LoC,” the ministry said in a press release.
 


“During the visit, media representatives would be taken to the exact locations falsely propagated by India as terrorist camps and would be presented with factual, on-ground realities that refute these malicious allegations,” it said.
The ministry said that Pakistan reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to peace and “categorically rejected any form of terrorism or terrorist activities anywhere in the world”.
“The nation remains resolute in defending its sovereignty, and any aggression by India will be met with a swift and befitting response,” it concluded.

The protest came in the wake of the deadly April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Occupied Kashmir, which left 26 people dead and reignited tensions between India and Pakistan.
India has accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack, an allegation Islamabad has firmly denied, instead calling for an independent and impartial investigation into the incident.
Waving Pakistan flags and placards, demonstrators chanted slogans including, “Gen Asim Munir Zindabad”, “Pakistan Zindabad”, “Kashmir belongs to Pakistan” and “We condemn Indian terrorism”.
 
 

The protesters also denounced India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindutva ideology, with chants of “Modi is terrorist” and “Down with Hindutva ideology” echoing through the streets.
PML-N UK President Ahsan Dar addressed the protesters, saying:“ This huge show is a reflection of the sentiment Pakistani overseas have for their motherland. Today, Pakistanis from across the UK have gathered outside India House to express their support for the civilian and military leadership of Pakistan.
He added that India had hastily blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack without presenting any evidence. “It’s clear this was a false flag operation aimed at maligning Pakistan.”
Dar also highlighted the unity among the diaspora community. “We countered Indian protesters on April 25 in large numbers. We are glad that activists of PTI, PML-N and other parties joined us against Indian aggression. The whole nation is united.”
The demonstration remained peaceful but drew significant attention from passersby and local media.
London Police maintained a visible presence to ensure order.

The reservists will be deployed to Israel’s border with Lebanon and in the occupied West Bank, replacing regular soldiers who will lead a new offensive in Gaza, the news site Ynet reported.

Religious groups have gained strength after the toppling of the iron-fisted regime of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, opposing attempts at reforms they say are un-Islamic.
Hefazat-i-Islam — an influential group made up of multiple political parties, Muslim organisations and religious schools — issued a string of demands at Saturday’s rally, including the abolishment of a government women’s commission seeking equality.
“Men and women can never be equal: the Holy Quran outlines specific codes of life for both genders,” said Mohammad Shihab Ud­din, 53, leader of a women’s mad­­rassa, a religious school. “There is no way we can go beyond that.”
No date has been set for elections, but caretaker leader Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who heads the interim government, has promised polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest.
 
 

Muhammad Umar Faruq, 30, another teacher at a seminary, said they helped the interim government run the country.
“If a government atte­mpts anything anti-Isla­mic in a country where 92 per cent of the population is Muslim, we will reject it immediately,” he said.
Hasina, who was blamed for extensive human rights abuses, took a tough stand against Islamist movements during her autocratic 15-year rule.
Since she fled to India — where she has defied extradition orders to face charges of crimes against humanity — religious groups have become emboldened.
Religious parties have demanded an end to a swath of activities, including cultural events deemed “anti-Islamic” — from music to theatre festivals, women’s football matches and kite-flying celebrations.

Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal reported 11 killed “after the bombardment of the Al-Bayram family home in the Khan Yunis camp” in southern Gaza at around 3am.
Bassal said that eight of the dead had been identified and were all from the same extended family, including a boy and girl, both one-year-olds, and a month-old baby.
An Israeli army spokesperson confirmed the strike. At the scene, rescue workers and residents searched through the rubble with their bare hands, illuminating the destruction with hand-held torches.
Footage by an AFP journalist showed a rescuer that was carrying the lifeless body of an infant from the wreckage.

Foreign Press Association urges Tel Aviv to give media ‘unrestricted’ access to Palestinian enclave

Fayka Abu Hatab, a resident in a nearby building, said she “saw a bright light, then there was an explosion, and dust covered the entire area”. “We couldn’t see anything, it all went dark,” Abu Hatab said.
 
 

“All of our windows were destroyed, our rooms were destroyed, the neighbours’ house was destroyed,” she added.
On Friday the civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 42 people across the conflict-ravaged territory, which has been under a total Israeli blockade since March 2.
Israel halted aid deliveries to Gaza, saying Hamas had diverted supplies. Israel says the blockade is meant to pressure Hamas into releasing prisoners held in the Palestinian territory.
‘Unrestricted’ access
The Foreign Press Association on Saturday called on Israel to allow news media “unrestricted” access to Gaza, off-limits to outside journalists operating independently since the conflict there began in Oct 2023.
“We call on Israel to stop the never-ending delays, uphold the fundamental principles of press freedom and allow unrestricted entry for journalists to Gaza,” the Jerusalem-based association wrote in a statement to mark World Press Freedom Day.
 
 

The FPA has more than 350 members working for foreign media outlets in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The association criticised Israel for an “unprecedented ban preventing foreign journalists from entering Gaza”, calling the decision a “mark of shame for a country that claims to be a beacon of democracy”.
The FPA, which has filed an appeal with the Israeli Supreme Court challenging the ban, said its members “salute our Palestinian colleagues who continue to report the story at great personal risk”.
With the exception of a journalist for US outlet CNN who entered a field hospital in Rafah operated by the United Arab Emirates in 2023, the only outside journalists allowed into Gaza, which is under Israeli blockade, did so with Israeli forces.

Also, a security official embraced martyrdom in a bomb attack on a convoy of security forces.
In separate clashes bet­ween security agencies and militants, two terrorists were killed in North Wazir­istan, three were shot dead in Bajaur, while two others were gunned down in retaliation by police after they atta­cked a security post on Bannu-Dera Ismail Khan Road in Lakki Marwat district.
Five terrorists, including a high-value target, were killed and two others, inc­luding one wanted by po­l­ice, were arrested in sep­arate operations carried out by security forces in KP on April 30 and May 1, according to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing.
The ISPR said during an intelligence-based operation (IBO), troops effectively engaged militants’ hideout in Bajaur. In an intense exchange of fire between security forces and terrorists, a high-value target, Fareedullah, and two other terrorists were neutralised.
In the Dossali area of North Waziristan district, security forces killed two terrorists during an IBO, according to the ISPR.
 
 

It added that troops successfully busted a hideout of terrorists during a third encounter with militants in Mohmand district and arrested two of them. One of them was later identified as Lal Ameer alias Ibrahim, who was wanted by the police for his active role in terror activities.
Security forces seized weapons, ammunition and explosives from the terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The military’s media wing said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.
Security official martyred
Meanwhile, a security official was martyred in an explosion in the Garhiom area on the outskirts of South and North Waziristan districts on Saturday, sources said.
An improvised explosive device went off near a convoy of the security forces, the sources said, adding that the explosion claimed the life of a security official.
A curfew was later imposed in the area due to security concerns.
Two killed in Lakki
In Lakki Marwat district, a security checkpoint near Gandi Chowk on Bannu-D.I. Khan Road came under attack at 2am on Saturday, prompting the police to retaliate, officials said.
A heavy gunfire panicked locals as some of them came out of their houses to assist the police.
“The militants used light and heavy weapons in a bid to take over the police post building, but failed as police fought gallantly forcing them to retreat under the cover of fire,” the officials said.
 
 

A rocket shell fired by the terrorists hit and damaged the main gate and the boundary wall of the police post, they said, adding that an area resident, Ahmad Khan, who along with others had come out of his house to assist police, lost his life in the ambush.
“A police official, Naseer Khan, and a watchman of a local market, Mujeebur Rehman, were also injured and taken to nearby hospital,” officials maintained, adding an effective response by law enforcers forced the militants to flee the place.
After the attack, a large contingent of police led by SP Investigation Murad Khan Wazir and backed by armoured personnel carriers reached the area and launched a search for the assailants.
Subsequently, police surrounded some militants hiding the forest locally called ‘darga’, near Shah Tora, Takhtikhel area of Lakki Marwat. After a fierce gun battle, two of them were killed, police said, adding that advanced weapons including M-4 rifles and 9MM pistols were seized from the area.
Later, Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan visited the site, met police personnel and praised them for repelling the attack bravely.
Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi and SP Wazir accompanied him.
Mr Khan said the cops stood against the menace firmly and thwarted the malicious designs of militants.
President, PM hail forces
Later, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded security forces for operations against terrorists in North Waziristan and Bajaur.
The president reiterated the resolve of continuing actions against terrorists and appreciated the security forces’ operations for eliminating these elements.
He said their determination for the eradication of terrorism and the defence of the motherland was resolute.
The prime minister said that they would continue foiling the nefarious designs of the enemies of humanity.
PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed continuing the fight against terrorism till its complete elimination from the country.
Funeral
Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for a martyred police official, Imranullah, at the Iqbal Shaheed police lines with full state honour.
 
 

Imranullah of the counterterrorism department of police was seriously injured in an armed clash with terrorists in the Domel Chashmi area of Bannu district on Wednesday night.
He remained under treatment at a local hospital but his condition deteriorated after which he was being shifted to a hospital in Peshawar when he breathed his last.
His body was later shifted to Bannu where RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi, SP CTD Fazal Wahid and other police officials attended his funeral.
Arrests
Also on Saturday, police claimed to have arrested scores of suspects and anti-state elements during an operation and snap checking in Bannu and Lakki Marwat district.
“The offensives were launched after a surge in militant attacks on police installations in both southern districts,” officials said.

• Food depots being relocated from exposed areas to safer zones
• Officials asked to develop contingency plans to ensure uninterrupted food supply
MUZAFFARABAD: The Food Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has accelerated efforts to replenish wheat flour stocks in vulnerable areas along the Line of Control (LoC), amid heightened tensions with India and fears of possible incursion from across the divide.
In snowbound and remote areas of AJK — many of which lie adjacent to the LoC — the Food Department traditionally stocks specially treated wheat flour with an extended shelf life to sustain local populations from December through May. In comparatively safer areas, routine storage is limited to a 15-day supply due to easier accessibility.
However, in response to fresh directives from AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, the department has begun increasing reserves in forward locations to meet the needs of residents for at least two months.
“In accordance with the prime minister’s instructions, we have launched an intensive operation to ensure wheat flour stocks are available for a full two months in the entire LoC belt,” AJK’s Minister for Food Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim told Dawn.
He said the government was simultaneously working on relocating food depots from areas exposed to potential shelling or military activity to relatively safer zones without disrupting access for residents.
 
 

The minister added that he had also instructed officials to prepare contingency plans to maintain uninterrupted food supply chains to vulnerable settlements, especially those that were frequently cut off during winter or during episodes of Indian shelling.
On Thursday, the AJK premier had informed the Legislative Assembly that he had constituted a special ‘Emergency Response Fund’ with an initial allocation of Rs1 billion.
The fund would cater to urgent needs such as replenishment of wheat flour, procurement of lifesaving medicines, and provision of other essential services in the 13 constituencies situated along the volatile LoC, spanning six districts — Neelum, Jhelum Valley, Haveli, Poonch, Kotli and Bhimber.
When contacted, AJK Food Department Director Abdul Hameed Kiani said sufficient wheat flour stocks had already been secured in all depots along the LoC.
“However, in light of the prime minister’s instructions and the uncertain situation, we are now increasing our storage capacity to meet a two-month demand,” he said.
“All contractors engaged by the department have been mobilised to use the maximum number of vehicles to deliver wheat flour in the shortest possible time,” he said, adding that department officials were supervising dispatches directly — both at the flour mills and in the delivery zones.
According to Mr Kiani, nearly 70 per cent of the target had so far been achieved.
On Saturday, around 250 tonnes of flour were dispatched from a single mill on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad.
Food Inspector Syed Zawar Haider, who was overseeing operations at the mill, said the consignments were being sent to various parts of Neelum Valley and forward areas of Jhelum Valley district.
“We are executing the task without interruption and expect to complete the operation within the next two days,” he said.

The Large Taxpayer Office  (LTO) Islamabad had decided to attach the bank accounts of the two telecoms before they could file an appeal against the court decision. The LTO remained operational on Saturday for the purpose of attaching the bank accounts of Telenor Pakistan and Deodar Pakistan, a subsidiary of Jazz. 
Following the promulgation of Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, the FBR has started recovery proceedings and enforcement measures.
The FBR officials were preparing for a forceful recovery of taxes through the attachment of bank accounts of these two companies falling under the jurisdiction of the LTO Islamabad, as the head offices of both companies are situated in the federal capital.

Both companies had gone to court over tax on equipment import

However, a final settlement between FBR and the companies was reached late Saturday evening, as they agreed to pay the recoverable amount as per court orders.
Telenor Pakistan has recently lost a case against FBR for the payment of Rs6bn in terms of withholding tax in the Islamabad high court.
As the FBR started the process to attach the bank accounts, the top management of Telenor Pakistan agreed to pay Rs6bn in pending taxes against the import of plants and equipment instead of pursuing the matter in the courts.
Similarly, Deodar Pakistan was fighting a case against the FBR over the amount of withholding tax and recently lost the case in the IHC.
The FBR team working for the attachment of Deodar Pakistan bank accounts also agreed with the Jazz management to pay Rs20bn in terms of withholding tax against the import of plants and equipment.
Sources in the tax collecting body said that Jazz Pakistan has agreed not to carry the matter further in the courts.
Deodar Ltd is responsible for establishing and maintaining the company’s cell sites and telecom towers.
However, Jazz has sold Deodar to Engro Corporation and the deal valued at approximately $563 million has been allowed Jazz by the Competition Commission of Pakistan recently, but the deal has yet not been materialised due to certain legal formalities.

Buffett spoke at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, after the conglomerate he built over 60 years showed it remained cautious about markets, allowing its cash stake to grow to a record $347.7 billion.
The 94-year-old billionaire, arguably the world’s most revered investor, had said very little about US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which unsettled many investors and caused big declines in stock markets worldwide.
“Balanced trade is good for the world,” and  “trade should not be a weapon,” Buffett said.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to design a world where a few countries say, ha ha ha, we’ve won,” Buffett added.  “I do think that the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes, ... the more prosperous we’ll become.”  But despite concerns about the direction of the US economy and the country itself, Buffett retained his traditional optimism, saying criticism of policies and the people who make them is par for the course.
“We’re always in the process of change,” he said.  “I would not get discouraged.... We’re all pretty lucky.”
Berkshire reported its cash stake with its first-quarter results, where insurance losses from January’s wildfires in southern California contributed to a 14 per cent decline in operating profit to $9.64bn.
Net income fell 64pc to $4.6bn, reflecting unrealised losses on stocks such as Apple.
Berkshire’s cash stake grew from $334.2bn at year-end. The company repurchased no stock for a third straight quarter, and was a net seller of stocks for a 10th straight quarter.
Buffett downplayed concern about Berkshire’s cash, saying the company  “came close” to spending $10bn recently, but that buying opportunities don’t come in an orderly fashion.
That should happen over five years, he said, but not necessarily tomorrow.
“We’re running a business which is very, very, very opportunistic,” Buffett said.  “We have made a lot of money by not being fully invested at all times.” 
When asked, Buffett did not address whether Berkshire was hoarding cash for Vice Chairman Greg Abel, his designated successor as chief executive, to invest.
Addressing another questioner, Buffett and Abel also strongly backed five Japanese trading houses in which Berkshire has invested.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Ambassador of the Republic of Turkiye Dr Irfan Neziroglu at the PM House.
The premier reiterated that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
The prime minister emphasised that India had failed to share any evidence and was falsely trying to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, the statement said.
“India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s offer to have a credible, transparent and neutral international investigation to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that Pakistan would cooperate fully with such an investigation and would welcome if Turkiye joined it.
The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts, including 90,000 casualties and over $152 billion in economic losses over the years.
He further said that India’s actions would distract Pakistan from its counter-terrorism efforts.
PM Shehbaz expressed his gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his strong statement that supported Pakistan during the prevailing situation in South Asia as well as his call for peace in the region.
The prime minister noted that Turkiye’s support to Pakistan was reflective of the “historic, deep-rooted and time-tested brotherly relations” between the two countries and their peoples.
He reaffirmed the government’s focus on economic recovery and growth for which it required peace and security in its neighbourhood.
The Turkish ambassador informed the prime minister that Turkiye appreciated Pakistan’s position and expressed its solidarity with Pakistan while calling for de-escalation and urging restraint in the current crisis to maintain peace and security in South Asia.
FM Dar’s diplomatic engagements
Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability while resolutely protecting its sovereignty and national interests in a telephone conversation with Greek counterpart George Gerapetritis.
FM Dar briefed him on current regional developments, categorically rejecting India’s “baseless allegations, disinformation campaign and illegal unilateral measures” that threatened regional peace and security.
“He strongly condemned India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a blatant violation of its international obligations,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a press release.
Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent investigation to establish the facts.
FM Gerapetritis emphasised the importance of restraint to prevent escalation and preserve peace and stability. He welcomed Pakistan’s proposal for a neutral and transparent inquiry.
Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and global developments, particularly in multilateral forums, including their engagement as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with Swiss Federal Councillor and Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.
He briefed FM Cassis on the evolving regional security situation, “expressing grave concern over India’s recent provocative actions, including baseless allegations, inflammatory propaganda, and its unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — an outright violation of international legal obligations”, the FO said in a press release.
Dar reiterated Pakistan’s call for an independent and transparent international investigation to establish the facts and underscored Pakistan’s commitment to exercising restraint in the interest of regional peace and security, while reserving the right to protect its sovereignty and national interests.
FM Cassis appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and endorsed its proposal for an investigation.
He expressed Switzerland’s readiness to offer its good offices and explore appropriate mechanisms to facilitate an impartial investigation.
The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation.
 






DG ISPR, info minister to brief all political leaders
Separately, state-run broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported that Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar will brief the leaders of all political parties on the situation with India tomorrow.
According to the report, the high-level background briefing will focus on national security in the context of Pakistan-India relations and the implications of recent developments.
“Participants will be briefed on the defensive preparedness of Pakistan’s armed forces, ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the official stance of the state on key issues,” the report read.
PM Haq accuses India of maneuvering to create unrest in AJK
Meanwhile, Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said on Friday that India was hatching conspiracies to create unrest in the territory.
In his address to the All Parties Kashmir Conference hosted in the state metropolis, he warned,  “If India attacks Pakistan, we will respond with full force. India is actively plotting to destabilise AJK.”
He emphasised that Pakistan’s political leadership must demonstrate complete solidarity and stand firmly behind the armed forces against the Indian aggression.
Reaffirming his stance on the Kashmir issue, Haq said his narrative drew strength from the people of Pakistan, the armed forces and the country’s military leadership.
He said that a single action by the Indian government had brought the situation back to what it was before August 5, 2019.
“The Liberation Cell is ready to support if the political leadership from the All Parties Kashmir Conference forum wants to participate in the protest demonstration,” the AJK premier said.
“As far as the Kashmir policy is concerned, we are open for debate and ready to remove any shortcomings,” he remarked.
“We have to think about how to take forward the issue of Kashmir, for which we have lost three generations,” he said.
Highlighting the significance of national unity, Haq said, “The enemy attacks you only when he thinks that the nation is divided.”</p><small>2025-05-03 20:02</small></div><hr>
