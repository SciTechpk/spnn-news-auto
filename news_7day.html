<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/020717347f46a2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970475/where-next-with-private-credit' target='_blank'><strong>Where next with private credit?</strong></a><br><p>In an economy scarred by one crisis after another, Pakistan’s banking sector has been a notable exception even as others struggled. With interest rates peaking at 22 per cent two years ago, sustained government borrowing allowed the sector to lock in high returns by parking liquidity in fixed Pakistan International Bonds (PIBs), earning bumper profits with minimal balance sheet risk.
However, the past is another country, and now things seem to be returning towards normalcy — whatever that means in Pakistan’s context. For the most part, monetary policy has already been eased as the key rates have reverted towards their long-term (20-year) average of 10.35pc, naturally raising expectations that it would revive private sector activity.
Unfortunately, the data is troubling as private sector credit becomes increasingly divergent from the broader monetary cycle, reflecting structural incentives that favour the deployment of liquidity into government securities rather than lending to the real economy. The system is so warped that scheduled banks now put $1.01 into (mostly treasuries) for every dollar of deposits they mobilise.
On the other hand, advances-to-deposits slipped below 40pc and stood at 39.75pc by December, not too far away from the trough of 36.33pc seen at October end. Unsurprisingly, private sector credit as a share of GDP has been on a declining trend since Covid-19, and currently clocks at 9.2pc, down three percentage points (pps) from its level a decade ago. This stagnancy was particularly visible as 2025 closed with loans to the private sector at Rs10.67 trillion, barely inching up 1pc from the same period of the previous year.
While advances remain stagnant, the sectoral mix is broadly unchanged, with industrial and services sectors dominating lending, and agriculture and personal credit remaining sidelined
Peer analysis further illustrates the extent of this challenge, where our private credit-to-GDP is a fraction compared to economies like Bangladesh (35.8pc), Indonesia (36.4pc), Egypt (27.6pc), and the Philippines (49.81pc). In any case, while advances remain stagnant, the broader sectoral mix has broadly remained unchanged, where industrial and services sectors continue to dominate lending with contributions of 62pc and 19.4pc, respectively. Meanwhile, agriculture and personal credit remain sidelined, except for bank employees, of course.
Amidst much of the same old, there was nevertheless one glimmer of hope as small and medium enterprise (SME) financing witnessed one of the strongest years in recent history. Loans to this segment reached Rs952.5bn by 2025 end, surging by 52.6pc or Rs328bn from the same period of the previous year. As a result, its share in total private business loans crossed 10pc for the first time in the 2020s.
Credit where due, this growth was in large part enabled by targeted initiatives like first-loss guarantees, while the refinancing schemes of the past were phased out.
In line with past trends, wholesale and retail trade remained the hot favourite, with outstanding advances of Rs326bn, outpacing manufacturing. Though nowhere near, advances to agri SMEs have also found momentum and soared by 64.5pc, well above the overall rate of 42.2pc. While data for December is not yet available, the growth has come on the back of a substantial increase in the number of borrowers, which has risen by more than 100,000 in the first six months of the previous year alone.
What’s perhaps more interesting is that even as the policy rate has declined by more than 1,200 basis points since 2022, spreads remain elevated and are near decade highs. In December, weighted average lending rates on incremental advances (excluding zero markup and interbank) stood at 11.8pps while those on deposits were 8.3pps.
Quite understandably, microfinance banks had the largest delta of 23pps at the end of the year, followed by specialised institutions at 10pps, as per an analysis done by the Karachi School of Business & Leadership InsightLab in its 2025 Credit Review.
Naturally, the question is, where does our private credit ecosystem go from here? As macroeconomic stabilisation finds firmer footing and begins yielding results, demand for financing will almost certainly increase. But supply is another matter entirely, given that capital has a safer, more attractive home in federal government securities.
One could argue that it’s simply a matter of proper incentives. Help the sector reduce its risk and it will eventually build the capacity to lend without external support. In theory, this makes perfect sense. But if the past is any guide such interventions can just as easily create structural dependencies.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, February 2nd, 2026</p><small>2026-02-02 02:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01213310b36f437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970424/at-jirga-on-tirah-issue-kp-cm-announces-another-grand-jirga-for-consultations-on-protest-march-to-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>At jirga on Tirah issue, KP CM announces another ‘grand jirga’ for consultations on protest march to Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced on Sunday that he would soon convene a grand jirga for consultations with stakeholders across the province for a protest march on Islamabad.
The CM shared his plans at a jirga at Khyber’s Jamrud Sports Complex, which he had announced last Sunday while responding to the federal government’s stance that neither the Centre, nor the military, had issued any directives for the “depopulation” of the Tirah Valley.
The federal and provincial governments have been trading barbs over who authorised the evacuation process in the valley after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes amid concerns about a planned military actions.
The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles.
Earlier this week, the federal government also insisted that the movement was actually seasonal migration and a routine practice, further maintaining that no military action had been planned for Tirah.
At the peace jirga today, the KP CM asked those attending the gathering if they would accompany him for a protest march towards Islamabad to express their resentment against the “atrocities” which the people of Tirah had been subjected to, their “forced displacement”  and the “government’s U-turn on the military operation”.
The CM said he would soon undertake a visit to merged districts to take their residents into confidence and would then convene a grand jirga prior to announcing a date for a protest march towards the federal capital.
“We will assert at the grand jirga that only people are entitled to rule Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it belongs to them, and that no decisions made behind closed doors in Islamabad will be acceptable any more”, he said among vociferous sloganeering from the emotionally charged audience.  
Afridi said that “no power on the earth could shake his confidence nor could his conscience be bought if he has the solid support and backing of his own people”.
He alleged that conspiracies were hatched so that either governor’s rule could be enforced in the province or he was disqualified and sent packing on the basis of “concocted cases”. He claimed conspiracies were also planned to “eliminate him he if does not submit to the narrative of his political rivals”.
But, “I have firm faith in God and I am not scared of anyone as I am a tribal and will never budge from our stated policy about militancy and military operations”, he asserted. 
On the allegations of the misuse of Rs4 billion pledged by his government for the displaced families of Tirah, he said  he would not hesitate to sanction even Rs100bn if the need arose as the federal government had “reneged on its promises of providing a paltry amount of Rs400,000 to the displaced families affected by previous military operations”. 
The CM vowed that “exemplary punishment” would be given to those who were found guilty of any irregularity in the utilisation of funds allocated for the displaced families of Tirah.   
He alleged discrimination against the people of KP, claiming: “We are considered as second class citizens. But I will continue to raise my voice against this injustice as I, being a soldier of Imran Khan, know how to secure our rights.”
He further stated that he would travel to Islamabad on Monday to meet the prime minister to “plead the case of KP’s rights and secure our outstanding dues”.  
Afridi then termed the federal government’s stance on the displacement of Tirah people “a joke” and insisted that the “people of tribal areas have always rendered sacrifices for the country and they will dispel the negative propaganda against them”.
 The CM said the federal government “changed its stance on Tirah” on after the international media reported about the “actual sufferings of the people of the valley”.
“We have been clamouring for a long time against the presence of outlawed militant groups in different parts of KP, particularly Tirah, and reminding the federal government that militant activities have increased. But, nobody took our assertions seriously while the situation gradually went out of everybody’s hands”, he said.    
He warned that the federal government’s statement about Tirah would lead to “people losing their confidence in the security establishment”.
On the occasion, he also announced the establishment of a relief fund for the poor and needy in KP and appealed to the wealthy to contribute to it. The contributions would later be distributed among the needy people in Ramazan, he announced. 
He also condemned the terror attacks carried out in different parts of Balochistan on Saturday and expressed his solidarity with the people of the province while saying that the people of KP shared the grief and agony of the affected families. 
Earlier, provincial minister Meena Khan, MNA Iqbal Afridi, MPAs Abdul Ghani and Adnan Qadri Aldo made hard hitting speeches and held the federal government responsible for all the hardships faced by the displaced families of Tirah.
Conspicuous by their absence were the members of the jirga of Tirah tribes who had negotiated the evacuation of families from the valley with representatives of the provincial government and security officials.</p><small>2026-02-02 02:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01193545292bf37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421/pakistan-to-participate-in-t20-world-cup-but-will-not-play-against-india-on-feb-15' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to participate in T20 World Cup but will not play against India on Feb 15</strong></a><br><p>After around a week of uncertainty, the government gave the nod on Sunday to the Pakistan cricket team for participation in the T20 World Cup but barred it from playing against India on February 15, when the Green Shirts are scheduled to play their only group-stage match against the arch-rivals.
“The government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, however, the Pakistan cricket team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India,” a post of the government’s X account said.







On Monday, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the possibility of a boycott of the T20 World Cup loomed over Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament.
After the meeting, Naqvi had said he had briefed the PM on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter” and a “final decision would be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.
The meeting took place as questions were raised about Pakistan’s participation in the tournament following the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland.
Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland on January 24, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The governing ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.
Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.
At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.
‘Selective participation’
ICC reacted to Pakistan’s and noted a statement that the Pakistan government had directed its team to “selectively participate” in the global tournament.
“While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” the statement said.
It added that ICC tournaments were built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and “selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions”.
“While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan,” the statement read.
“The ICC hopes that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.
“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the statement concluded.
The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.
The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on February 7.
Pakistan have been placed in the same group as defending champions India, but will be play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement brokered by the ICC, allowing them to play at a neutral venue.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India played all their matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka.</p><small>2026-02-01 19:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01235939036a467.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970413/trump-hopeful-of-iran-deal-after-tehran-warns-of-regional-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump hopeful of Iran deal after Tehran warns of regional war</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Sunday said he was hopeful of agreeing a deal with Iran after the country’s supreme leader warned that any US attack on the Islamic republic would trigger a regional war.
Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, Trump has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday likened the recent protests to a “coup”, warning that a US attack would trigger a broad conflict.
“The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,” he said, telling Iranians they “should not be scared” of Trump’s rhetoric.
“They (rioters) attacked the police, government centres, IRGC centres, banks, and mosques, and burned the Quran … It was like a coup,” Khamenei said, adding that “the coup was suppressed”.
Asked about the Iranian leader’s warning, Trump told reporters on Sunday: “Of course he is going to say that.
“Hopefully we’ll make a deal. If we don’t make a deal, then we’ll find out whether or not he was right,” he said.
The demonstrations in Iran began as an expression of discontent at the high cost of living, but grew into a mass anti-government movement that the country’s leaders have described as “riots” stoked by the United States and Israel.
As tensions heightened between Iran and the US, Tehran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said he was concerned about “miscalculations” but said he believed Trump was “wise enough to make the correct decision”.
He said Iran has lost trust in the United States as a negotiating partner, adding that some countries in the region were acting as intermediaries to rebuild trust.
“So I see the possibility of another talk if the US negotiation team follows what President Trump said: to come to a fair and equitable deal to ensure that there is no nuclear weapons,” he said in an interview with CNN.
‘Terrorist’ designations
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published a list of 2,986 names out of the 3,117 that authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Of the total, 131 have yet to be identified but their details will be released soon, it said in a statement.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.
The response to the protests prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies.
Lawmakers wore the green uniform of the Guards in a display of solidarity at the legislative session, where they chanted “Death to America”, “Death to Israel” and “Shame on you, Europe”, state television footage showed.
It remained unclear what immediate impact the decision would have.
The step matched similar classifications enacted by the United States, Canada and Australia.
Threats and dialogue
Firouzeh, a 43-year-old homemaker who declined to give her full name, said the recent tensions had left her “very worried and scared”.
“Lately, all I do is watch the news until I fall asleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night to check the updates,” she said.
IRGC official Ahmad Vahidi was quoted by the Mehr news agency as saying “enemies” sought to create a “war atmosphere”.
But Ali Larijani, head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said on Saturday: “Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.”
Trump also confirmed that dialogue was taking place, but without withdrawing his earlier threats, adding “we’ll see what happens”.The US president previously said he believed Iran would make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face military action.
Tehran, meanwhile, has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missile and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.</p><small>2026-02-01 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/011451207985c34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970406/we-will-fight-this-war-cm-bugti-says-145-terrorists-killed-in-40-hours-across-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘We will fight this war’: CM Bugti says 145 terrorists killed in 40 hours across Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday expressed the firm resolve to eliminate terrorists after a spate of coordinated attacks across the province, adding that 145 militants were killed within a span of 40 hours.
The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed 92 terrorists.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Addressing a press conference in Quetta on Sunday, CM Bugti said 145 terrorists were killed in 40 hours, adding that their bodies were in the custody of the authorities.
“This is the highest number since Pakistan is facing this war on terror,” he highlighted.







“Our 17 law enforcement people, including police and FC and one Navy personnel, were martyred, and our civilian casualties are 31, including some injured,” CM Bugti said.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said on Saturday night that 15 personnel were martyred during the operations and 18 civilians, including women and children, were also killed during the attacks.
Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, along with the Balochistan CM and corps commander, visited the injured policemen at the Combined Military Hospital in Quetta on Sunday.







In his press conference, CM Bugti also said that the state shared the grief of bereaved families and assured that the welfare of the martyrs’ children was the government’s responsibility.
“We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation is being planned, and as a result of those, we had already started pre-operations a day before, in which around 40 terrorists were killed in Shaban and Panjgur,” he detailed.
The chief minister noted that the terrorists had planned to attack Quetta from Shaban, adding that the forces were “very vigilant”.



CM Bugti termed the Gwadar incident, where he said five women and three children were killed, as the “most painful”. After the press conference, he also played video statements of those injured in Gwadar.
Noting that a “narrative of independence” had been created, he said “terrorists are using the Baloch on India’s instructions”.
“Whenever Pakistan begins to take off economically or on foreign fronts, you try to destabilise Pakistan by carrying out such attacks on India’s directives.”
The chief minister said the terrorists had planned to enter the Red Zone and occupy important assets, which were foiled.
However, he added, “Except for Nushki, where it took us some time to disengage them. Nushki is completely clear now.”
CM Bugti said tracing and combing operations were underway and vowed, “We will not let them go.”

 

Asked about reports of the Nushki deputy commissioner being abducted, the chief minister confirmed that the official was “at a safe place and had escaped their grip” when he last spoke with him.
“No city was taken over,” he clarified in response to a query, recalling that he visited various areas in Quetta. “Not a single bank was looted.”
Detailing an attempt to target a police station, the chief minister said terrorists were forcefully using “children as human shields”.
The Balochistan CM also assailed attempts to frame terrorism as a “political issue”.
“Is BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) a registered party with whom you have to hold a dialogue? […] They purely want to impose their ideology on us with the force of guns and push the Baloch into a futile war. […] You are linking this war with deprivation and rationalising this violence too.”
He asserted that “rationalising this violence in the name of ethno-nationalism was a direct support to BLA”.
Bugti then asked what some people wished for to be the outcome of such a dialogue. “As a result of dialogue, they want us to surrender? We will not. We will fight this war for a thousand years,” he affirmed.
“We are not ready to surrender even for a second. They can carry out a thousand such attacks. They can destabilise us, but they cannot take an inch from us. This Pakistan is not for breaking away. These people cannot do it. And neither can their masters.”
CM Bugti said “tools such as certain Sardars and social media” were being used to “disintegrate” the youth from the state. He expressed the resolve to further boost engagement with the population and the youth.

 

Responding to a question, he asserted that terrorists were only terrorists and that it upset him when they were called “Baloch terrorists”.
At another query, he emphasised that the state had still kept the door for talks open — unlike in the case of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — “just because of this so-called narrative [and] confusion spread in Pakistan’s intelligentsia, mainstream political leadership, judiciary and media for the last 30 years”.
The chief minister observed that in the National Action Plan, the government started treating “Baloch militants as separate” from other terrorists. “What a confused nation we are. Are we fighting a serious war? he said.

 

Noting that terrorists blend themselves within the civilian population, the chief minister asked, “Should we become brutal like them?
“We could kill 10 [terrorists] by throwing one mortar, but what about the 20 civilians with them? This is the only reason why we do not want to become brutal like them.”
CM Bugti also took exception to those arguing that the Balochistan “issue cannot be solved with force”. “When has force ever been used in Balochistan?” he asked rhetorically, adding that no military operation was conducted in any city.
“It is a purely intelligence-driven war,” the chief minister stressed, noting that only intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted in the province.
He also accused India’s Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of backing the terrorist activities, asserting that the authorities had “solid and circumstantial evidence”.
Responding to a question, CM Bugti expressed the state’s firm resolve to continue the war against terrorism.
“Why will we get tired? We are the state of Pakistan. We will not get tired,” he said, adding that military operations were not needed currently as IBOs were being carried out.

 

The chief minister noted that while “all kinds” of arms were employed in the recent attacks, those left behind after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan had “spread into the market and were provided to them by their masters”.
Responding to a query about the Safe City project, CM Bugti highlighted that cameras linked to the network were also targeted as they were a “threat” to them.
Asked about the surge in terrorism, the chief minister noted there were “people who adopted the policy of appeasement and the institutions” that did the same after 2018.
Pointing out that the institution had “punished their person”, the PPP leader asked whether the political leadership that did the same had held its people accountable.
“The biggest reason behind the rise [in terrorism] today is the post-2018 appeasement,” CM Bugti asserted, adding that the policy had always proved to be harmful for the state.
“There shouldn’t be any appeasement to those who took up arms against the state of Pakistan.”
The chief minister strongly refuted that there was any “public sympathy” for such acts, highlighting that the public across the entire country was strongly condemning terrorism.
“The only problem is narrative and the second problem is operations in grey. This operation is grey is the biggest problem for us,” he said.
CM Bugti also reiterated what he emphasised during his media talk in a statement on X, saying: “The Government of Balochistan had clearly announced that it is the responsibility of the families of those who have joined the ranks of terrorists to inform the government.
“Law will take its course against all the family members of these terrorists who did not alert the government,” he asserted.







Later, speaking on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan with Shehzad Iqbal’, he refuted a BBC report that 1,000 to 1,200 militants had carried out the attacks and estimated that the number could be under 200 or 250 at maximum. The CM, however, clarified he did not have the accurate number.
Asked about the number of BLA militants operating in Balochistan presently, he said he did not have the exact figure for that as well but they could be around 4,000 to 5,ooo in number.
‘Mopping-up’ operation underway: defence minister
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said peace has been established in Balochistan after yesterday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.
“At this moment in time, peace has been established, and the coordinated attack has been repulsed completely, and they (terrorists) have retreated,” Asif said while addressing the media in Sialkot.
The defence minister further said that attempts were made to “target the FC (Frontier Corps) headquarters” in Nushki and Dalbadin, adding that all attacks were foiled.
“They attempted to carry out a suicide attack in Dalbadin,” he said, adding that “all targets have been neutralised”.
Echoing Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statements, Asif blamed the incidents on neighbouring India, adding that the attacks aimed to “destabilise the country at a time when it is on the path to progress”.
“Our intelligence and the confessional statements by terrorists all prove linkages to India,” the defence minister said.



The minister said that the BLA was now “making use of female bombers”, detailing that women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted” on Saturday.
He added that in an attack in Pasni, the terrorists made use of a “female suicide bomber”.
“The minds of young women are being polluted,” he said, adding that the BLA was now targeting “labourers and poor people struggling to survive”.
“Their handlers are sitting in Afghanistan, and indoctrinating young children to be used for their nefarious purposes,” he added.
Asif noted that terrorists were able to “operate easily” owing to Balochistan’s vast and sparsely populated area, vowing that the government would “work towards ending this advantage”.
Terrorists using civilians as human shields: Tallal Chaudhry
In a separate televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said terrorists were using civilians as human shields. Therefore, security forces had to operate with great caution, which took some time, he added.
He said they were “hiding behind them and in some places, using families and children as shields to escape”.
“Terrorists could have been responded to within minutes, but the operation was carried out with caution on soft targets to avoid harming civilian women and children, who were being used as shields by terrorist,” Chaudhry said.
“If they are so capable, why don’t they attack openly instead of hiding behind women and children?” he added.



The state minister also took note of a “false narrative” being spread on social media that terrorists have taken control of some areas — a claim also rebutted by CM Bugti in his press conference.
Noting that videos, in some cases AI-generated, were aired by Indian media, Chaudhry pointed out that the “extent of terrorists’ connection with Indian media” was apparent as they were “transmitting from areas with no mobile signals, creating narratives, and broadcasting them”.
“This clearly indicates India is backing them financially and logistically.”
The interior official further asserted, “This is not about Baloch rights; it is about targeting things used by Baloch civilians.”
He also stated that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has visited Quetta, “proving that the situation is normal and showing the federal government’s support of Balochistan”.
“Most terrorists were killed; many were arrested. Some escaped, but are being pursued,” the state minister said.
PTI criticises centre, Balochistan govt
For its part, opposition party PTI expressed concerns over the security situation in Balochistan and criticised the federal and provincial governments for “lacking strategic approach”.
The opposition party condemned the terrorist attacks in a statement and said it “salutes the heroic security personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending the nation”.
“We extend our deepest condolences to their families and stand in solidarity with all citizens affected by these attacks. Our prayers are with the injured and their families,” the statement said.
It added that the deaths of innocent civilians — including women, children, and labourers — underscored the “cruel reality that ordinary people continue to bear the heaviest toll of terrorism”.
PTI expressed alarm over the “rapidly deteriorating security situation in Balochistan”, noting that the simultaneous attacks across multiple districts “clearly indicated a meticulously planned effort to spread fear, undermine peace, and destabilise the entire country”.
“The current situation clearly demonstrates that there is neither a serious strategic approach at the federal level nor an understanding of ground realities by the provincial government of Balochistan,” the statement added.
It further stated: “The Balochistan government, under Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, appears limited to issuing statements while the province is practically in the grip of a severe crisis.”
Similarly, it said, “irresponsible statements” made by the federal government and the interior minister in the past that “downplayed the situation”, have been proved inaccurate.
“PTI believes that such negligence and temporary assurances have worsened the situation in a sensitive province like Balochistan, and the nation is now paying the price through increased terrorism.
“The party is also deeply concerned over reports that thousands of citizens are stranded on key highways in Balochistan following the attacks, and communication systems, including the internet, have been suspended, preventing people from receiving accurate and timely information,” the statement read.
PTI emphasised in the statement that it was the fundamental responsibility of the government to keep the public informed with complete transparency, ensuring that affected families were not left in uncertainty and distress regarding their loved ones.
The party emphasised that the problems in Balochistan could not be addressed through mere statements, casual measures, or political negligence.
“The rising wave of terror incidents, the loss of precious lives, and the growing hardships faced by citizens demand the implementation of a comprehensive and serious policy that prioritises peace, security, and the restoration of public confidence.”
Ban on gatherings, face masks
In the wake of the attacks, the Balochistan government has imposed a ban on gatherings, processions and sit-ins of five or more people across the province for one month.
According to a Home Department order issued on Sunday, a ban was also imposed on covering faces in public places by using mufflers, masks or any other means that obstruct identification
The display or use of weapons, pillion riding, the use of tinted glasses on vehicles, and the use of unregistered vehicles were also prohibited under the order.
The bans were placed under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
US, Iran, France,EU condemn attack
Earlier in the day, US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the Balochistan terrorist attacks and affirmed that the United States remained a “steadfast partner” of Pakistan in efforts to ensure peace.
“The United States strongly condemns January 31 attacks and acts of terrorist violence against security personnel and civilians in Balochistan, claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Baker said on X.
On behalf of the US, she extended condolences to the victims of terrorism, their families and all those affected. “The Pakistani people deserve to live free from violence and fear,” she said.
Baker added: “The United States remains a steadfast partner of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure peace and stability. We stand in solidarity with Pakistan during this difficult time.”







In August 2025, the US also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs).
Besides the US, the British High Commission, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also condemned the latest terrorist activities.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the Iranian embassy in Pakistan strongly condemned the “recent terrorist attacks leading to the martyrdom of a number of innocent civilians and brave security personnel and soldiers”.
It conveyed Iran’s “sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the honourable people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families”. It also extended prayers for the martyrs and the injured.
The statement affirmed that Iran, “as a matter of principle, unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism, which remains a serious threat and concern for the international community”.
“Such heinous acts, often supported by extraterritorial actors, must be confronted through collective regional and international cooperation,” it noted.
Moreover, a post by the French embassy in Pakistan said: “We strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks across Balochistan. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and our profound sympathy to all those affected.
“We stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan against terrorism in all its forms.”







The European union (EU) also condemned the attack in a post on X.
“The EU strongly condemns and unequivocally rejects terrorism in all its forms and stands with Pakistan.
“We extend our deepest condolences to the families of civilians and security personnel killed in recent attacks in Balochistan and wish a speedy recovery to those injured,” the post said.

The last time Pakistan had clean-swept Australia in a T20 series was in October 2018 in the UAE.
While defending a gigantic 208-run total, Pakistan dominated the visitors by clinching a 111-run victory.







The stage was set by Shaheen Afridi, who took the wicket of the Australian captain Mitchell Marsh in the first over.
In the next over, Mohammad Nawaz dismissed Australia’s Matthew Short, as Babar Azam took his catch, and in the following over, Shaheen Afridi struck back with Matt Renshaw’s wicket.
In his five-wicket haul, Mohammad Nawaz also dismissed Marcus Stoinis and Cameron Green.
Stoinis and Green added 23 and 22 runs, respectively, for Australia, while seven other batters could not even reach double figures.
Apart from Nawaz’s five and Shaheen’s two wickets, Abrar Ahmed and Naseem Shah also grabbed a wicket each.
In the first innings, Saim Ayub and Babar Azam scored half-centuries as Pakistan posted 207 runs against Australia — the Green Shirts’ highest total against the visitors in a T20 game.
Winning the toss and opting to bat first, Pakistan decided to replace Sahibzada Farhaan with Fakhar Zaman, who opened with Saim Ayub. Farhaan was dismissed in the first match of the series without scoring any runs and had managed to score just five runs in the second game.
In today’s match, Saim scored 56 runs. He shared a 69-run partnership with Babar Azam, who remained unbeaten on 50.
All-rounder Shadab Khan played a searing 46-run knock for Pakistan on just 19 deliveries, smashing five gigantic sixes.
Pakistan skipper Salman Agha, who scored 76 runs in the previous match, flopped today and scored just five runs.
For Australia, bowler Cooper Connolly conceded 47 runs in four overs and took a single wicket, while Ben Dwarshuis grabbed two wickets.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended felicitations to the Pakistan team over the clean-sweep victory.







He praised Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, the team management and players for their performance. “I hope that this winning streak will continue in the future as well,” Shehbaz posted on X.
Teams
Pakistan: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam, Khawaja Nafay, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Abrar Ahmed.

For his part, KP Archaeology Director General Abdul Samad gave a detailed briefing to Banga on KP’s archaeological heritage, with special emphasis on the Jaulian Buddha site.
Appreciating the management and services of the archaeological sites, Banga praised Samad’s efforts and assured all possible support for the preservation of the province’s cultural heritage, the handout said.
He was also invited to visit other archaeological sites and historical landmarks across KP, it added.
Earlier, a press release said Banga visited the Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hasanabdal, where he offered special prayers and ate at the langar khana.
He was accompanied by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Punjab Minister for Minority Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora, the press release added.







It quoted Arora as saying that the arrival of the World Bank president at Gurdwara would send a “positive message”.
He said that followers of “all religions enjoy complete religious freedom in Pakistan”.
Arora further stated that on the directives of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, work on the beautification and renovation of historical religious places of worship was under way.
The Punjab government was also taking practical steps to promote religious tourism, he added.</p><small>2026-02-01 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01220712d6a705f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970425/punjab-cm-maryam-announces-basant-holiday-in-province' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM Maryam announces Basant holiday in province</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced on Sunday a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a Basant holiday.

The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
But now, a three-day Basant festival is set to kick off in Lahore from February 6, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.</p><small>2026-02-01 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/012025537f950ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970416/situation-has-become-intolerable-for-pakistan-envoy-to-un-highlights-rise-in-terror-attacks-from-afghan-soil' target='_blank'><strong>‘Situation has become intolerable for Pakistan’: Envoy to UN highlights rise in terror attacks from Afghan soil</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, highlighting the “exponential rise” cross-border terrorist attacks from Afghanistan, has said that the situation has become “intolerable for Pakistan”.
His remarks come against the backdrop of a spate of coordinate attacks in Balochistan on Saturday. Clearing operations following the attacks continued on Sunday while Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in the afternoon that 145 militants had been killed within a span of 40 hours.
The military’s media affairs wing said the attacks were carried out by Fitna-al-Hindustan — a term that the state has designated for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Pakistan has also been raising alarm over the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan and accuses the Afghan Taliban of harbouring them. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to rein in terrorist outfits operating out of Afghanistan.
Speaking to Dawn on Sunday, Ambassador Ahmad reiterated the accusation that the Afghan Taliban were sheltering militant groups operating against Pakistan and highlighted what he described as India’s long-standing support for proxy elements active from Afghan soil.
He said the UN secretary general had “quite rightly pointed out” earlier this week that the international community expected the Afghan Taliban to ensure Afghan soil was not used for cross-border terrorism.
The envoy noted that this commitment was central to the original Doha process but remained unfulfilled.
Under the Doha agreement in 2020, which paved the way for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years, Kabul had committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the US, its allies and other countries.
A recent article in US-based magazine Foreign Affairs said that terrorist violence in Pakistan has surged since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. It further described the Pakistan-Afghanistan border as “the most worrisome flashpoint in South Asia today.”
The magazine noted that the simmering conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan now threatened to escalate, with potentially damaging consequences for the wider region.
Citing Pakistani research organisations, Foreign Affairs reported that 2025 was Pakistan’s deadliest year in a decade.
According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, the country experienced a sharp rise in terrorist attacks, including by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The magazine described the upward trend as deeply concerning and warned that Pakistan could face even deadlier attacks in the near future. The report highlighted that repeated mediation efforts — including talks facilitated by Qatar, Turkiye, and Saudi Arabia — have failed to secure a lasting Taliban commitment to rein in the TTP.
Cross-border strikes and retaliatory exchanges in recent months have further heightened tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, raising fears of a broader confrontation.
According to the article, the Taliban appear unwilling to take action against the TTP, which maintains close ideological and operational ties with the Afghan Taliban.
The magazine also suggested that the Afghan Taliban may be leveraging their confrontation with Pakistan for domestic political advantage, as defying Islamabad could bolster their legitimacy amid long-standing public resentment in their country.
Of particular concern for Pakistan is the Taliban’s growing engagement with India. Foreign Affairs warned that warming Taliban-India ties, coinciding with a surge in attacks inside Pakistan, could further complicate regional security dynamics.
Ambassador Ahmad pointed out that “the large presence of the TTP in Afghanistan, together with BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) Fitna-al- Hindustan, and their terrorist acts against Pakistan from Afghan soil, have also been reported by the UN Monitoring Team.”
“There has been an exponential rise in terrorist attacks in recent years in Pakistan originating from across the border from Afghanistan,” he said, calling the situation “intolerable for Pakistan.”
Reiterating Pakistan’s resolve to respond decisively, he said: “We are taking all necessary steps to counter and eliminate this menace, and we are resolute in this objective.”
Pakistan attached particular importance to the Taliban’s pledge that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against other countries, the envoy said.
“This undertaking has not been fulfilled,” he said. “The Taliban have failed to do so.”
Ambassador Ahmad accused the Taliban authorities of complicity: “Not only have they failed to prevent these activities, they have sheltered, actively supported, and collaborated with these elements.”
He asserted that the terrorists also enjoyed “external support,” adding: “It is well known that India has all along supported these proxies working against Pakistan.”

 

He said concerns about Afghanistan had also been echoed by members of the Security Council. “There is broad recognition of the danger posed by terrorism emanating from Afghanistan,” he noted, adding that the country “unfortunately remains a terrorism hub under the Taliban,” a point raised by several council members during the most recent meeting on Afghanistan.</p><small>2026-02-01 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01145321be8fb28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970411/israel-to-terminate-msf-work-in-gaza-for-failing-to-provide-list-of-palestinian-staff' target='_blank'><strong>Israel to terminate MSF work in Gaza for failing to provide list of Palestinian staff</strong></a><br><p>Israel said on Sunday it was terminating the humanitarian operations of the international charity Doctors Without Borders in Gaza after the organisation failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff.
“The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the Gaza Strip,” the ministry said.
The decision follows “MSF’s failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region”, it added, stating that the group will cease its work and leave Gaza by February 28.
In December, the ministry announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from operating in Gaza from March 1 for failing to provide detailed information about their Palestinian staff.
It had alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the medical charity vehemently denies.
On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January that it would share the staff list as required by the Israeli authorities.
“Despite its public commitment, the organisation refrained from transferring the lists,” the ministry said.
“Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol.
“In accordance with the regulations, MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28, 2026,” the ministry added.
In a statement posted on its website on Friday, MSF acknowledged that it had, as an “exceptional measure”, agreed to share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff with the Israeli authorities.
“However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,” the charity said.
“These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not [be used to put] colleagues at risk.” MSF said it had not received assurances on these fronts, so “concluded that we will not share staff information in the current circumstances”.
Israel to partially reopen Gaza’s Rafah crossing today
Meanwhile, Israel is set to partially reopen the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt today, following months of urging from humanitarian organisations, though access will be limited to the movement of people.
The reopening comes amid ongoing violence in the Palestinian territory, with Gaza’s civil defence agency reporting dozens killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, while the Israeli military said it was retaliating against ceasefire violations.
The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for both civilians and aid, but has remained closed since Israeli forces seized control of it in May 2024 during the war with Hamas, aside from a brief and limited reopening in early 2025.
Israel had previously said it would not reopen the crossing until the remains of Ran Gvili — the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza — were returned.
His remains were recovered days ago, and he was laid to rest in Israel on Wednesday.
“The Rafah Crossing will open this coming Sunday (February 1) in both directions, for limited movement of people only,” COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said on Friday.
Entry and exit “will be permitted in coordination with Egypt, following prior security clearance of individuals by Israel, and under the supervision of the European Union mission”, it added.
However, key details remain unclear, including how many people will be allowed to cross and whether those seeking to return to Gaza will be permitted entry.
A source at the border told AFP that Sunday would be largely devoted to preparations and logistical arrangements.
The crossing is set to open on Sunday on a trial basis to allow the passage of wounded individuals, ahead of a regular reopening scheduled for Monday, three sources at the crossing said.
However, no agreement has yet been reached on the number of Palestinians permitted to enter or exit, the sources added, noting that Egypt plans to admit “all Palestinians whom Israel authorises to leave” the territory.
“Every day that passes drains my life and worsens my condition,” said Mohammed Shamiya, 33, who suffers from kidney disease and requires dialysis treatment abroad.
“I’m waiting every moment for the opening of the Rafah land crossing.”
Anxious wait
Safa al-Hawajri, who has received a scholarship to study overseas, is also eagerly awaiting the reopening on Sunday.
“I’m waiting in the hope of fulfilling my ambition, which is tied to the reopening of the crossing,” said Hawajri, 18.
“I hope to be able to travel as soon as it opens.”
Located on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, Rafah is the only crossing into and out of the territory that does not pass through Israel.
The crossing lies in an area held by Israeli forces following their withdrawal behind the so-called “Yellow Line” under the terms of a US-brokered ceasefire that came into effect on October 10.
Israeli troops still control more than half of Gaza, while the rest remains under Hamas authority.
The ceasefire has now entered its second phase and calls for reopening the crossing following the release or return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
Hamas had called for its full reopening in both directions after the remains of Gvili were brought back to Israel.
The reopening is expected to facilitate the entry of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), established to oversee the day-to-day governance of the territory’s 2.2 million residents.
The committee is to operate under the supervision of the so-called “Board of Peace” chaired by US President Donald Trump.
The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the Rafah crossing reopens.
Violence continued ahead of the crossing’s reopening.
At least 32 people, including children, were killed on Saturday in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, reported the civil defence agency.
Israel’s military said the strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, which it said violated the ceasefire.</p><small>2026-02-01 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/011659178f449b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970414/pakistan-7-other-muslim-nations-assert-israels-ceasefire-violations-risk-undermining-efforts-for-stability-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, 7 other Muslim nations assert Israel’s ceasefire violations risk undermining efforts for stability in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, along with seven other Muslim-majority countries, condemned on Sunday the repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza by Israel, asserting that these actions risked undermining efforts for restoring stability at a time when regional and international partners were working collectively to advance the second phase of US President Donald Trump’s plan.
The eight countries — Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan , Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and United Arab Emirates — had worked with Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
Implementation of the plan began in October 2025, leading to a ceasefire in Gaza more than two years after the onslaught began. Israel, however, has repeatedly violated the the truce, carrying out strikes in the Strip.
Meanwhile, work is ongoing on the second phase of Trump’s plan, shifting focus from ceasefire implementation to demilitarisation, technocratic governance and reconstruction.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the plan, said strongly condemned Israel’s repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza, “which have resulted in the killing and injuring of more than a thousand Palestinians”.
“These actions risk escalating tensions and undermining efforts aimed at consolidating calm and restoring stability, at a time when regional and international parties are working collectively to advance the second phase of President Donald Trump’s peace plan and to implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803,” the statement said.
It said the foreign ministers of the eight countries “consider that these repeated violations constitute a direct threat to the political process and hinder ongoing efforts to create appropriate conditions for transitioning to a more stable phase in the Gaza Strip, both in terms of security and humanitarian conditions, and stress the necessity of full commitment to ensuring the success of the second phase of President Trump’s peace plan”.
They called on all parties to “fully uphold their responsibilities during this critical period and to exercise the utmost restraint, in order to preserve and sustain the ceasefire, refrain from any actions that may undermine the current process, and create favourable conditions to move forward toward early recovery and reconstruction, as well as advancing a just and lasting peace grounded in the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the Arab peace initiative”.</p><small>2026-02-01 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0112340034b36ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970409/4-dead-28-injured-as-bus-carrying-wedding-party-overturns-in-punjabs-lodhran' target='_blank'><strong>4 dead, 28 injured as bus carrying wedding party overturns in Punjab’s Lodhran</strong></a><br><p>LODHRAN: A child was among four dead while another 28 were injured when a bus carrying wedding guests overturned after colliding with a truck in the Mandhali Mor area of Punjab’s Lodhran district on Sunday.
According to a statement issued by Rescue 1122 Lodhran, a “high-speed coaster carrying members of a wedding procession overturned while crossing in front of an overloaded truck, killing four people on the spot”.
It added that the deceased included two men, one woman and a child.
Another 28 were injured, out of which 27 sustained “severe” injuries and were rushed to the Lodhran District Hospital, while another person was provided medical assistance on the spot, Rescue 1122 said.
Separately, a statement by the office of Lodhran District Police Officer (DPO) Ali bin Tariq said he reached the site of the incident immediately after receiving an alert about it.
“Reasons behind the accident are being determined, and legal action will be taken against those responsible,” DPO Tariq was quoted as saying.
Last month, at least 24 people were killed and over 20 were injured in two separate accidents on the same day, as a truck fell into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district and a coach overturned near Balochistan’s Ormara tehsil.
In a separate incident days later, a child was among five individuals who died in two separate traffic accidents due to poor visibility caused by dense fog in Nankana Sahib and Sialkot.</p><small>2026-02-01 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/011510233b20a41.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970407/islamabad-police-arrest-54-seize-over-21000-kites-and-chemical-strings-in-a-month' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad police arrest 54, seize over 21,000 kites and chemical strings in a month</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad Police arrested 54 individuals and seized over 21,000 kites and chemical strings in January as part of a crackdown against hazardous kite-flying material, state-run APP reported on Sunday.
Kite-flying is often associated with severe and sometimes fatal accidents. Kite-flying festival — Basant — was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
Quoting Islamabad police spokesperson, APP reported that police teams carried out raids across the capital territory during which they arrested 54 people in relation to kite-flying and trading, alongside recovering over 11,000 kites and more than 10,000 chemical strings.
“Charkis and other related material were also recovered from the suspects,” APP reported, adding that police have registered cases against the suspects.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Qazi Ali Raza told APP, “Kite-flying is not a harmless pastime but a deadly activity that has claimed innocent lives and caused serious injuries, particularly to motorcyclists, pedestrians and children.”
He noted that the chemical strings used in kites “pose a grave threat to human life and can result in permanent disability or death”.
SSP Raza urged parents to “educate their children about the dangers and legal consequences of kite-flying and play their role as responsible citizens,” the report quoted him as saying.
He further detailed that awareness efforts regarding the matter were underway as well.
He stressed that the Islamabad police have a “zero tolerance policy against kite flying, kite stelling and the use of chemical string”.
The officer asserted that strict legal action would continue against those engaging in the practice.
According to the report, citizens have been urged to report people violating the policy through the emergency helpline Pucar-15 or the nearest people station.
The development comes as a three-day Basant festival is set to kick off in Lahore from February 6, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
On Saturday, Rawalpindi police said they had seized a mini-truck carrying 20,000 kites and 100 rolls of strings, as well as arrested the supplier.
The kites were supposed to be delivered to the garrison city, where the government has imposed a ban on the sale and flying of kites.</p><small>2026-02-01 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01074046f3cf1c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970288/china-un-warn-of-terror-spillover-into-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>China, UN warn of terror spillover into Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan figured prominently in warnings sounded at the United Nations this week about the growing spillover of terrorist threats from Afghanistan, with both China and the UN chief expressing concern over militant violence affecting the country.
Addressing a high-level briefing on the Counter-Terrorism Early Warning Network for Central Asia on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Sun Lei said that while the Central Asia region remained broadly stable, it continued to be affected by cross-border terrorism.
“Currently, the Central Asia region remains generally stable, yet is still deeply affected by the spillover effect of terrorist threats,” he said, citing recent attacks in Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan that “deserve our high vigilance”.
Emphasising Pakistan’s long-standing concerns, the Chinese envoy called for closer cooperation with Kabul. “We need to strengthen engagement and cooperation with Afghanistan to prevent it from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorist organisations, and to jointly prevent and address the return of foreign terrorist fighters,” he said.

Ambassador Sun also underlined the importance of development in countering extremism. “At the same time, it is imperative to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to eliminate the root causes of terrorism,” he said.
UN concerns
A day earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres raised similar concerns at a briefing in New York. He said the UN remained committed to four key objectives in Afghanistan, while voicing frustration over the Taliban’s failure to make progress on inclusivity, human rights and regional security.
“We need to make sure that Afghan institutions are truly inclusive, that all ethnic groups are represented and that all sectors of society are represented,” he said, calling this “a basic condition for the consolidation of peace”.
On women’s rights, the UN chief expressed concern over restrictions limiting women’s ability to work. “[UN Undersecretary General] Rosemary DiCarlo managed to guarantee the possibility for our female staff to work in the field, but not in our headquarters, and we are very frustrated by that.” He described the Taliban’s failure to meet the expectations of the international community as “unacceptable”.
Turning to security, Guterres highlighted the threat posed by groups operating from Afghan soil. “Another aspect is the need to make sure that no terrorist organisations can operate from Afghanistan into other countries. We are particularly concerned about what has happened with the Pakistani Taliban [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan] and the support they might receive.”

 

He added that the UN had seen meaningful progress on drug trafficking since the Taliban’s return, but lamented the lack of improvement on other fronts. “In relation to the three other aspects, we have frustration, because we do not see our legitimate concerns making the progress that is essential.”
Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in terrorist incidents in recent years, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, with officials linking much of the violence to cross-border infiltration from Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021.

 

Analysts say the resurgent TTP and allied groups have increased attacks inside Pakistan while allegedly enjoying safe havens across the Afghan border.
Islamabad has consistently urged the international community to press Kabul to prevent its territory from being used by militants targeting Pakistan, arguing that regional and global security remain directly tied to stability in Afghanistan.

“We’ve already made that deal, the concept of the deal,” Trump told reporters while on Air Force One, en route to Florida from Washington, DC.
Trump also said on Saturday that China was also welcome to make a deal with the US to buy Venezuelan oil.
Trump’s comment came a day after the US told Delhi it could soon resume purchases of Venezuelan oil to help replace imports of Russian oil, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
India pledged to slash Russian crude oil purchases after Washington also hiked tariffs related to that activity, and India is on track to lower its Russian oil imports by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the coming months, according to the sources, who declined to be identified.
Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil, including India, in March 2025, and his administration ramped up a campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom US forces captured on January 3.

 

Since then, Washington has begun directing the Caracas government and plans to control Venezuela’s oil industry indefinitely.
The US effort to supply Venezuelan crude to India comes as Washington seeks to reduce the oil revenue that is funding Russia in its war in Ukraine.
Last week, Indian Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said India is diversifying its crude sources as its Russian oil imports fall.
Two of the Reuters sources said India is preparing to cut Russian oil imports to below one million barrels per day soon.

 

In January, they were around 1.2 million bpd, and are projected to decline to about 1m bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March, one of those two sources said.
The second of the two sources said those imports are expected eventually to decline to about 500,000-600,000 bpd, helping the nation clinch a trade deal with the US.
US tariffs on Indian goods reached 50pc in August as Washington added a further 25pc tariff on purchases of Russian oil.
Challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.</p><small>2026-02-01 05:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01103650daf0a3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970338/majority-of-islamabad-buildings-do-not-have-fire-safety-certificates-cda' target='_blank'><strong>Majority of Islamabad buildings do not have fire safety certificates: CDA</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Tuesday revealed majority of buildings in Islamabad have not obtained fire safety certificates.
In the wake of the Karachi Gul Plaza inferno, the CDA recently decided to get survey of buildings of Islamabad to ensure fire and safety system.
“CDA has completed the survey regarding Fire Safety & Hazard Control in the Federal Capital, Islamabad. A total of 6,500 buildings were surveyed in this regard.
During the survey, it was observed that most buildings had not obtained approval for their fire safety plans, and the completion/fire safety certificates for these buildings had also not been issued. During the survey, 300 government buildings were also inspected, read an official handout issued by CDA.
This information was shared in a meeting held here at CDA headquarters with Chairman CDA Mohammad Ali Randhawa in the chair and attended by members administration and planning, DC Islamabad and other officers concerned.
“Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi had taken notice and directed the CDA to conduct a survey of all buildings in Islamabad regarding Fire Safety and Hazard Control at the earliest. In light of the direction all relevant departments, including the Capital Emergency Services and the Building and Housing Control Wing were directed to complete the survey immediately,” the official statement said.

 

The meeting that building owners and occupants would be directed to submit their Fire Safety and Hazard Control Certificates to the relevant offices of CDA’s Building & Housing Control Wing within fifteen days. Otherwise, legal action will be initiated against those not complying with the direction under the CDA Ordinance and the Islamabad Capital Territory Building Control Regulations 2020 (Amended 2023).
“This will entail fines and other enforcement measures. In this context, if an accident occurs in a building due to non-submission of the required certificates, the responsibility will lie with the concerned owners and the building management,” read the statement.
It said that building owners and their management are further requested to immediately ensure the safety status of their buildings and submit the necessary documents on time so that public safety standards can be maintained in the Capital.
The meeting decided that all building owners and occupants will have their buildings inspected on an annual basis and submit certificates regarding fire safety measures in accordance with the Pakistan Engineering Council codes to the CDA. Furthermore, regular fire safety drills will also be arranged in all buildings.

KARACHI: In a surprise visit to a Mega Centre of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) in Defence Housing Authority on Saturday, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi found multiple lapses of serious nature in public service delivery, including a startling case in which a death certificate was issued for a woman who was still alive.
The issue came to light when a citizen approached the interior minister during his visit to the facility with a complaint regarding his wife’s death certificate, who was in fact alive.
A statement issued after the visit said that Mr Naqvi immediately took notice of the “error” and ordered on-the-spot correction of the documentation, directing officials to ensure accountability and prevent such mistakes in the future.
During the visit, the minister interacted with citizens who had come to apply for national identity cards and other official documents. He asked applicants about waiting times and processing procedures with several people complaining of long delays and repeated visits due to inadequate guidance and system inefficiencies, the statement added.
The interior minister acknowledged the concerns and assured citizens that the problem of delays would be addressed on a permanent basis.
“The system is being further improved and the issue of delays will be resolved at the root,” the statement quoted the minister as saying who also instructed Nadra officials to complete citizens’ work within the prescribed timeframe.

 

In another case, a woman reported an incorrect name entry on her identity card. The interior minister directed the Nadra in-charge to rectify the error immediately without charging any additional fee.
He also visited multiple service counters and met staff members, emphasising that applicants should not be forced to make repeated trips.
“Instead of asking people to come back again and again, ensure their work is completed in a single visit wherever possible and provide them full guidance,” Mr Naqvi directed.
Earlier in the day, the interior minister paid a two-hour-long visit to Jinnah International Airport to review immigration operations.
He inspected immigration counters, met outbound passengers and inquired about processing times and facilitation, added the statement.
Mr Naqvi personally checked the travel documents of several passengers traveling to Saudi Arabia and asked Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials to verify certain cases.
The interior minister reiterated that no passenger with incomplete or unverified documents would be allowed to travel.
He warned that professional beggars could not be permitted to go abroad under the cover of legitimate travellers, stressing that Pakistan’s dignity must be protected at all costs.
“The genuine travellers and passengers with valid and complete documentation would not be stopped. Raising Pakistan’s stature while ensuring ease for travellers remains our top priority,” he added.

Interior minister says India behind the attacks; accuses country of providing support to terrorists
ISPR says 92 terrorists killed; 18 civilians, 15 security personnel martyred
ISPR says attacks were orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from outside Pakistan


Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, while the military’s media affairs said that 92 terrorists were killed as security forces responded to the onslaught.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said, “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.”
He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.
“We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists,” he said. Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.
For his part, Bugti expressed gratitude to Naqvi for rushing to Quetta.
“We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” the CM said.
“In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. Bugti also condemned the killing of women and children belonging to a Baloch family hailing from Khuzdar in Gwadar’s labour colony.
He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks.
“The terrorists’ morale was declining. To raise morale, they executed this attack but the lethality was very low,” the CM said.
“The rebuttal by security forces was superb,” he said. Bugti added that the state’s resolve “could not be weakened”.
ISPR says 92 terrorists killed
The military’s media affairs wing said that terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”.







It said terrorists targeted civilians in Gwadar and Kharan, including women, children, the elderly and labourers, resulting in the deaths of 18 people.
“Security forces and law enforcement agencies, being fully alert, immediately responded and successfully thwarted the evil design of terrorists, displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence,” the statement said.
It said that troops, after an “intense and daring clearance operation”, killed 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers. The statement said that during this process, 15 personnel embraced martyrdom.
“Sanitisation operations in these areas are being continuously conducted and the instigators, perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of these heinous and cowardly acts, targeting innocent civilians and law enforcement agencies’ personnel, will be brought to justice,” it said.
“Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed that the attacks were orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident,” ISPR said.
Noting that 41 terrorists were killed in Panjgur and Harnai on Jan 30, ISPR said the total number of killed militant in “ongoing operations” in Balochistan had reached 133.
‘Desperate move’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier described the attacks as “a desperate move” by the terrorists while security forces were about to neutralise them.
“This was a desperate move by the terrorists. Our security forces are close to defeating the fighters of Fitna-al-Hindustan and Fitna-al-Khawarij,” he said in an interview with Geo News.
He said the security forces were alert at all locations and were not taken by surprise. “Our security forces, personnel and officers have fought bravely. They were alert at all sites and fully prepared,” he said.
Expressing deep sorrow, he said that terrorists of the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) had killed family members of Baloch labourers hailing from Khuzdar and Gwadar.
He reiterated that the attack was thwarted with full force. Tarar further said that the prime minister was aware of the situation and was in contact.
“The prime minister condemned the attack and reaffirmed that we will not rest until the last terrorist is eliminated from the country,” he said.
“It is the resolve of the state of Pakistan that it will not rest until terrorism is eliminated from the country,” he added.
He continued, “We are fully focused. The terrorists failed due to the unity of the Pakistani nation, and the entire nation stands behind the security forces.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the recent terrorist attacks were “terrorism being run under foreign patronage, whose targets are both Pakistan and the people of Balochistan” and not a struggle for rights.
“These elements neither tolerate development nor peace. That is why they target labourers, travellers, and ordinary citizens, want to destroy development projects and employment opportunities, and conspire against projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,” he stated in a post on X.







The defence minister added that terrorist groups recruited young people through social media, while receiving funding through “organised criminal networks, a drug-fuelled economy, extortion, and smuggling”.
“The state is resolute. The morale of our law enforcement agencies is high, and we will bring the terrorists, their facilitators, and the foreign handlers to their logical end,” Asif vowed.
Bugti visits Quetta attack site
CM Bugti also visited the site of a bomb blast in Quetta to review the security situation, a statement from the CM House said. Balochistan Inspector General (IG) Muhammad Tahir provided a detailed briefing on the incident to the chief minister, who also met security and police personnel.
“The timely response against terrorist elements is commendable,” Bugti was quoted as saying, hailing the effective actions taken by the police and the CTD.
“Anti-state elements will not be forgiven under any circumstances. There will be no compromise on peace in Balochistan,” the chief minister asserted.

 


Later, Interior Minister Naqvi also arrived in Quetta to engage in high-level discussions on the law and order situation, while CM Bugti vowed that sacrifices by martyrs “would not go in vain”, according to an official statement.
It said that the minister and CM Bugti visited Police Lines to offer funeral prayers for the martyrs and meet their families.
“The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.”
CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The sacrifices of our martyrs will not go in vain. The state has always stood with the oppressed and will continue to do so.”
Earlier in the day, provincial government official Shahid Rind said police and the FC had foiled attempted terrorist attacks at a “few places across Balochistan”.
Rind, the special aide to CM for political and media affairs, noted on X that the attacks came after over 70 terrorists had been killed over the past two days by security forces at different locations across the province.







Naqvi also visited the Corps Headquarters in Quetta. According to Radio Pakistan, Naqvi was briefed about the security situation in Balochistan and the terrorist attacks of Fitna al Hindustan.
CM Bugti was also present for the briefing. The interior minister appreciated the timely and effective action of the security forces, the report said.
He also paid tribute to the personnel and citizens who were martyred in the terrorist attacks. Naqvi said the ongoing war against terrorism would continue till the last terrorist was eliminated, the report said.
Emergency imposed in hospitals
An emergency was imposed in all government hospitals across the province on the directives of Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar and Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
Kakar was supervising the provision of medical treatment to those “injured in the Quetta firing”, a statement from the provincial health department said.
The health minister directed Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran and Quetta Civil Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar to ensure the “immediate” provision of medical facilities.
According to the statement, the operating theatres of the Quetta Trauma Centre and Civil Hospital have been put on alert, and additional doctors have been deployed.
‘IED, explosives neutralised in Nasirabad’
Separately, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district.
“An anti-tank mine and explosive material were found on the railway line near Rabi Pul,” said a statement by Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Asadullah Nasir.
“A suspected IED (improvised explosive device) was neutralised as the police, FC and Special Branch took timely action,” it added.
The recovered items included half a kilogramme of explosive material, petrol and an iron rod, according to SSP Nasir. The items were handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) for further investigation.
Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year.
Most recently, on Monday night, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track.
The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.
Resolve to fight terror till its ‘complete eradication’
President Asif Ali Zardari commended the army and law enforcement agencies’ (LEAs) professional expertise for foiling “infiltration attempts by Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists at multiple locations”.
In a statement, he also paid tribute to the “security personnel and innocent civilians who embraced martyrdom during the actions”, and prayed for their high ranks.
“Our commitment is not to make any compromise on Balochistan’s peace, civilians’ protection, and national unity,” Zardari affirmed.
He asserted that the state will continue its operations against “enemy elements operating under external backing and their facilitators with full force and unity”.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for foiling malicious attempts by Fitna-al-Hindustan to disrupt peace in Balochistan, state-run APP reported.
The premier professional competence and bravery of the security forces for thwarting “coordinated attacks at 12 locations across Quetta, Noshki, Dalbandin, Pasni and Gwadar”.
He noted that 37 terrorists were neutralised during the operations, dealing a “major blow” to militant networks operating in the region.







PM Shehbaz also lauded the personnel for “neutralising 88 leading terrorists, backed by India, in various intelligence-based operations carried out over the past 48 hours, terming it a significant success in the ongoing fight against terrorism”.
He paid homage to the 10 valiant security personnel who embraced martyrdom during the operations, sacrificing their lives while giving precedence to protecting the homeland over their own safety.
“The entire nation, including myself, is proud of its martyrs,” the prime minister said, adding that the officers and personnel of the security forces were performing their duties with exemplary courage and selflessness.
Reaffirming the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz stated that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete eradication from the country.
Balochistan Planning Minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi strongly condemned the “damage to public properties and terrorising citizens by a handful of terrorists”.
“Balochistan will not be held hostage by these perpetrators of violence. With public support, LEAs have foiled terrorist designs,” he said on X.







Buledi further said that Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti “cut short his Islamabad engagements, including a meeting with the World Bank President & returned to Quetta immediately to resume official work at the CM House”.
The British High Commission also condemned the attacks.
“Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives and all those affected. We stand with Pakistan in rejecting terrorism and in our shared commitment to peace and security,” it said.







Turkiye’s foreign ministry condemned the spate of “heinous terrorist attacks” in Balochistan, praying for those who lost their lives and for a swift recovery for the injured.
“We will continue to stand by brotherly Pakistan in its fight against all forms of terrorism,” it said in a post on X.







Similarly, Qatar’s foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the attack and reiterating Doha’s firm rejection of “violence, terrorism and criminal acts in all forms, regardless of their motives or justifications“.
“The ministry also expresses the state of Qatar’s sincere condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the government and people of Pakistan, and extends its wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured,” the statement read.







Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the terrorist attacks and reiterated Riyadh’s “complete rejection of all acts of terrorism and extremism” and its solidarity with Pakistan and its efforts to maintain territorial integrity.
“The kingdom expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the deceased and to the government and people of Pakistan, and wishes the injured a speedy recovery,” the ministry said in a statement.







Rise in terrorism
The proscribed BLA has carried out frequent attacks in Balochistan, specifically targeting security forces and LEAs.
In August 2025, the United States also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations.
Earlier this week, CTD said six proclaimed offenders affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during an operation in Pishin.
On January 5, an IED attack in Panjgur killed one person and injured 16 others.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year-on-year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.

 

As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
In early December, security forces carried out a two-day operation against militants who attacked the brigade headquarters of Frontier Corps in Chagai district’s Nokundi area.
The same day the FC headquarters was targeted as a suicide bomber detonated himself at its main gate, armed terrorists also launched an attack on an FC checkpost in Panjgur district’s Gurmakan area.
On November 24, three personnel were martyred and 12 sustained injuries in a suicide attack on the FC headquarters in Peshawar.</p><small>2026-02-01 04:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01082958e6d4fc3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970289/gb-winter-adventure-tourism-hit-by-soaring-permit-fee-visa-delays' target='_blank'><strong>GB winter adventure tourism hit by soaring permit fee, visa delays</strong></a><br><p>• No permit issued to foreign trekking, expedition group in winters since 2023• Officials count climate-related disasters among factors affecting tourism industry
GILGIT: Adventure tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) has declined over the past three years, with no foreign climber or trekker visiting the region during the winter season. The arrival of climbers, trekkers, and both foreign and domestic tourists during the summer season also fell by 90 per cent last year, severely affecting the local economy.
Tour operators blamed the sharp increase in permit fees, delays in the issuance of visas to foreigners, and other factors for the decline in foreign visitors. According to the GB tourism department, no foreign climber or trekker visited GB this winter. No foreign expedition or trekking group was issued a permit during the winter expedition season, which usually lasts from November to February.
Five of the world’s 14 eight-thousanders — mountains rising above 8,000 metres above sea level — are located in Pakistan. These include the world’s second-highest peak, K2 (8,611m), followed by Nanga Parbat (ninth at 8,126m), Gasherbrum-I (11th at 8,080m), Broad Peak (12th at 8,051m) and Gasherbrum-II (13th at 8,035m).

 

Until 2023, hundreds of foreign climbers and trekkers used to visit the region each winter to attempt ascents of K2, Nanga Parbat and other peaks. However, data obtained from the GB tourism department shows that not a single foreign climber or trekker has visited the region during the winter season since 2023.
Director of the GB tourism department Iqbal Hussain said multiple factors had contributed to the decline in winter tourism. He said international conflicts and global uncertainty had led to a reduction in the number of foreign climbers and trekkers visiting Pakistan.
Meanwhile, arrivals of both foreign and domestic tourists during the summer season also declined last year, badly affecting the local economy. Liver Khan, a prominent tour operator and a member of the Pakistan Association of Tour Operators (PATO), told Dawn that government’s anti-tourism policies had contributed to the decline in both foreign and domestic tourism in GB.
He said around 90 per cent of the local population — including labourers, transporters, hotel and shop owners, travel agents, tour operators and porters in remote areas — depended on tourism as a source of income. He added that the sharp increase in permit fees for mountaineering and trekking, coupled with difficulties in obtaining visas, had discouraged foreign visitors.
Mr Khan said foreign tourists usually plan their trips to Pakistan at least three years in advance, based on their budgets. He explained that Pakistan issues three types of visas to foreign tourists: tourist, mountaineering and trekking visas. Mountaineering and trekking visas are issued only after permits are obtained through Pakistani tour operators. Delays in issuing these permits, he said, often result in visa delays and ultimately lead to the cancellation of trips.
Mr Khan said PATO had demanded that the government introduce a single visa category for foreign tourists and simplify the process for mountaineering and trekking visas. He said the increasing permit fees had forced foreign climbers and trekkers to cancel their trips to Pakistan and opt for Nepal or other countries, where permits are cheaper. Nepal, he noted, had reduced permit fees for more than 50 peaks.
Another tour operator, Mohammad Ali Nagri, told Dawn that the increase in permit fees for foreigners had virtually crippled adventure tourism in GB.
According to the GB tourism department, only 270 international climbers visited the region during the summer season last year to attempt peaks including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II and Nanga Parbat, compared to more than 2,000 foreign climbers and trekkers in previous years.
Officials attributed the downturn to unprecedented climate-related disasters in GB, as well as regional tensions and conflicts involving Pakistan and India.

It warned parties with incomplete registration that they would neither enjoy statutory privileges nor be allowed to contest polls on an allocated electoral symbol.
The clarification follows an AJK High Court judgement dated Oct 5, 2023, which set aside the registration of the AJK chapters of the PPP, PML-N and PTI and other parties on the grounds that the registration process did not conform to the requirements of the law and the Constitution of the region.
In its judgement, the court observed that the Elections Act and Rules prescribed mandatory conditions for party registration, including submission of a party constitution, manifesto, audited consolidated accounts, lists of members with proof of identity, and evidence of intra-party elections. The bench further noted that despite failure to fulfil several of these conditions, the parties had been granted provisional and later regular registration, rendering the process unlawful.
Following the judgement, the EC issued notices to all political parties, directing them to remove deficiencies identified by the court and resubmit complete documentation.
In the aftermath of the ruling, mass defections of lawmakers elected on PTI tickets in 2021 to the PPP and the PML-N were overlooked by the relevant authorities.
“In pursuance of the High Court’s judgement, all political parties that do not presently fall within the definition of registered political parties are hereby informed that unless and until they complete all requisite documentation in accordance with the applicable rules, they shall neither be entitled to any privileges of a registered political party nor be eligible to contest any forthcoming election on a specific electoral symbol,” the EC said on Saturday.
“Accordingly, the heads of all political parties whose registration is currently under process are advised to urgently submit the required documents in line with the intent of the AJK Elections Act, 2020, the Elections Rules, 2020, and the High Court’s judgement, so that the registration process may be finalised.”
An official at the Election Commission told Dawn that registration had been granted to five parties between July and October 2024 after fulfilment of legal requirements.
The parties registered so far included the PML-N and the PPP, along with three relatively lesser-known organisations — Jamaat-i-Falah-i-Insaniyat, Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith and Sada-i-Haq Party — none of which has had parliamentary representation in the past.

“The tolerance and forbearance of judges must not be so fragile or touchy as to make them easily annoyed during the hearing of a case, which is a sacred duty and trust,” observed Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar in his opinion rendered on the long-pending presidential reference seeking an answer to whether the court could revisit the 1979 judgement that sent former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to the gallows — a verdict that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and jurists regard as a historic wrong.
On March 6, 2024, after a delay of over 44 years, the SC finally corrected a historic wrong by accepting that the murder trial of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was unfair and lacked due process, both at the trial stage and in the endorsement of the verdict by the appellate court.
In his delayed opinion, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was a member of the SC bench that heard the reference, emphasised that if a judge becomes annoyed with a litigant or their advocate in an unruly manner and loses patience, control or peace of mind, it becomes difficult to impart justice in accordance with the law.

In his opinion on Bhutto reference, judge observes admission by late Justice Shah leaves no doubt about ‘judicial murder’

He said judges should therefore remain calm, be good listeners and, instead of arguing themselves, which is the core function of lawyers, must allow counsel the opportunity to present their cases and arguments.
Justice Mazhar observed that in almost all cases where appeals are filed against the confirmation of the death penalty, no advocate directly seeks conversion of the sentence to life imprisonment. Instead, they strive for a fair acquittal for their client, which is the professional duty of every lawyer.
Simultaneously, the appellate court, with its sense of right and wrong, always has inherent jurisdiction to affirm, set aside or modify sentences. However, despite established bias and grave violations of natural justice and due process in the trial and conviction of Mr Bhutto, the punishment in this case was maintained.
The matter did not end there, the appellate court also missed the opportunity and failed to consider mitigating circumstances, despite overwhelming material on record that could have justified an acquittal or, at the very least, conversion of the death penalty to life imprisonment. This omission, Justice Mazhar said, was tragic, atrocious and reprehensible.
Referring to the delayed opinion, Justice Mazhar observed that although the SC rendered its opinion almost 13 years later, it could still be said that it was better late than never. “In my view, there is no plausible justification for the delay in deciding the presidential reference,” he regretted, adding that he was at a loss to understand why the reference was kept in cold storage and why the hearing was not commenced immediately after the questions were framed by the SC.
Referring to interviews of late Justice Nasim Hasan Shah at a belated stage, Justice Mazhar recalled how the former chief justice had admitted, in print and electronic media, that the decision on Mr Bhutto’s appeal was made under coercion.
This admission, he observed, left no doubt in the mind of a sane and prudent person that it was a “judicial murder”, and such an admission constituted a violation of his oath.
The disclosures made in those interviews, though belated, not only blew the whistle on the biases involved but also pierced the veil of the entire trial and conviction, exposing blatant violations of fair trial principles with the complicity of the judges who conducted the proceedings.
Justice Mazhar noted that the SC unanimously identified various lapses and biases and ultimately concluded that the trial conducted by the Lahore High Court and the subsequent appeal before the SC failed to meet the constitutional requirements of a fair trial and due process, as enshrined in Articles 4 and 9, and later guaranteed as a separate and independent fundamental right under Article 10A of the Constitution.

WASHINGTON: A fresh cache of files released on Friday related to the investigation into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein contains documents that refer to numerous high-profile figures.
President Donald Trump, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and SpaceX founder Elon Musk are among some of the people named in the documents.

 

The disclosure offers a sprawling look into the elite circles Epstein inhabited before his death, implicating prominent figures in politics, business and entertainment.
The documents were published following a deadline mandated by a bipartisan congressional law requiring the public release of all files related to Epstein.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced release marked the conclusion of the Trump administration’s planned disclosures. The batch includes 3 million pages of documents, 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Blanche said at a press conference.
Among the names surfacing in the files is Kevin Warsh, whom Trump nominated on Friday to serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Warsh’s name appeared in an email from a publicist to Epstein detailing a guest list of 43 people, including Martha Stewart, for a Christmas gathering.
Lutnick under scrutiny
According to the documents, Lutnick and Epstein scheduled a lunch meeting for Dec 23, 2012, on Little Saint James, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.
The following day, Epstein’s assistant sent a note to Lutnick on behalf of the financier, which read in part, “Nice seeing you”.
Records also show that in November 2015, Epstein’s assistant forwarded an invitation from Lutnick for a fundraiser supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at Lutnick’s financial firm.
These exchanges stand in contrast to Lutnick’s comments during a podcast appearance last year.
Lutnick stated that he had been neighbours with Epstein around 2005 and was invited to tour the financier’s townhome. He claimed that after Epstein made a sexually suggestive comment about a massage table, he vowed to “never be in a room” with him again.
A spokesperson for the Commerce Department addressed the discrepancy in a statement.
“Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing,” the spokesperson said.
Musk inquires about parties
The documents detail a separate exchange between Epstein and Musk on Christmas Day in 2012.
“The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for,” Musk wrote, declining an offer to visit Little Saint James.
Musk added that he had been “working to the edge of sanity” and asked Epstein if he had “any parties planned.”
Epstein replied that he understood Musk’s refusal, noting cryptically that “the ratio on my island” might make a female companion of Musk’s uncomfortable, though he did not elaborate.
Days later, Musk invited Epstein to join a group for drinks in St. Barts, though it is unclear if the meeting occurred.
Trump, Melania
The files include hundreds of documents mentioning President Trump, primarily consisting of compiled media reports. However, the release also details what appear to be internal emails from federal investigators dated August 2025.
These messages, which examined accusations involving the president, indicate that investigators found no substantiation for the claims and deemed several accusers “not credible”.

 

The Justice Department noted in a press release that the files contained “untrue and sensationalist claims” regarding the president.
One redacted message from 2012 queries, “What does JE think of going to Mar-a-Lago after xmas instead of his island?” This corresponds to a period years after Trump said he stopped socialising with Epstein.
Additionally, a 2002 email from Melania Trump to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted co-conspirator, references a profile in New York Magazine.
“Nice story about JE in NY mag. You look great on the picture,” the email reads. “Give me a call when you are back in NY.”
Bill Gates
In a draft email among the documents, Epstein alleged Gates had engaged in extramarital affairs.
Epstein wrote in the email that his relationship with Gates had ranged from “helping Bill to get drugs, in order to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls, to facilitating his illicit trysts, with married women.”
The Gates Foundation, in a statement to The New York Times, denied the allegations of affairs.
The release has drawn immediate scrutiny from Democrats, who questioned whether the administration withheld relevant material. While the Justice Department identified 6 million pages of potentially responsive documents, only 3.5 million were released.

GAZA CITY: Israeli air strikes killed 32 people including children in Gaza on Saturday, according to the Palestinian territory’s civil defence agency.
Despite a US-brokered truce entering its second phase earlier this month, violence in the Palestinian territory has continued, with both Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the agreement.
The latest bloodshed comes after Israel announced it would reopen the crucial Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Sunday (today) for the “limited movement of people”.
“The death toll since dawn today has risen to 32, most of them children and women,” said the civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under the Hamas authority, updating an earlier toll of 28.
“Residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station were targeted, resulting in this humanitarian catastrophe,” agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in the statement.
A unit in an apartment building of Gaza City’s Rimal neighbourhood was left entirely destroyed, and blood spatters from its occupants were visible on the street below, an AFP journalist reported.
“Three girls died while they were sleeping. We found their bodies in the street”, Samer al-Atbash, a relative of the family, told AFP.
“What truce are you talking about? Everyone is deceiving everyone else,” added Nael al-Atbash, another relative.
One strike hit the police station in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, the territory’s largest urban centre.
Gaza’s general police directorate said seven people were killed in that attack, while Bassal said the dead included four women police officers. “The killed included police officers and personnel as well as civilians who were present at the station at the time,” the directorate said.
Ceasefire violations
About a dozen first responders rushed to the devastated building and pulled bodies from the rubble, according to an AFP journalist.
Another Israeli attack hit a shelter in Al-Mawasi, an area of south Gaza where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians live in tents and makeshift shelters, an AFP journalist reported.
Large plumes of smoke rose above the thousands of densely pitched tents.
The number of casualties from this strike was still not known.
Although people have been killed almost daily in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire on Oct 10, Saturday’s toll was particularly high.
Israel’s military said that the air strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, which it said violated the fragile ceasefire.
It claimed that it targeted commanders and sites belonging to Hamas and its ally, Islamic Jihad.
Hamas in a statement condemned Saturday’s strikes as “a brutal crime”.
The health ministry, which operates under the Hamas authority, has said Israeli attacks have killed at least 509 people in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.
Rafah reopening
Media restrictions and limited access in Gaza left journalists unable to independently verify casualty figures or freely cover the violence.
Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, condemned Israel’s “repeated violations” of the truce and demanded all parties “exercise the utmost restraint” ahead of Sunday’s reopening of Rafah crossing. Israel has said reopening of the Rafah crossing will only allow the “limited movement of people”.
The reopening is a key element in the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.

Dawn has obtained a copy of a letter the UN chief sent this week to all permanent representatives to the United Nations, in which he cautions that unless member states either pay their assessed contributions in full and on time or agree to fundamentally overhaul the UN’s financial rules, the organisation may soon be unable to function.
In the unusually stark message, dated Jan 28, the secretary general said the UN’s current financial trajectory is “untenable”, leaving the organisation “exposed to structural risk and forcing a stark choice” between reform and collapse”.
He noted that while the UN has weathered periods of unpaid contributions in the past, the present situation “is categorically different” because decisions not to honour assessed contributions have now been formally announced.
Mr Guterres highlighted what he called a “Kafkaesque” paradox at the heart of the UN’s financial system: under existing rules, the organisation is required to return unspent budget credits to member states even when those funds were never collected due to non-payment of dues. “In other words,” he wrote, “we are trapped in a Kafkaesque cycle; expected to give back cash that does not exist.”
According to the letter, the UN ended 2025 with a record $1.568 billion in outstanding dues — more than double the previous year — while collections covered only 76.7 per cent of assessed contributions.
Despite spending reductions, liquidity reserves were nearly exhausted, sharply increasing the risk of cash shortages.

QUETTA: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, stressing that authorities would go after every single one of those involved, while an opposition leader warned that the situation in the region had spiralled “completely out of control”.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.
“We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists.”
Mr Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and devising strategies.
CM Bugti expressed gratitude to Mr Naqvi for rushing to Quetta. “We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” he said.
“In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come, but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks.
Earlier, the interior minister and CM Bugti attended funeral prayers for the martyred personnel and visited Police Lines to meet the bereaved families in Quetta.
They reaffirmed that the resolve of the people and the state against terrorism remained unshakable.
“The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” an official statement quoted Mr Naqvi as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.”
Addressing the families, CM Bugti vowed that “every drop of the martyrs’ blood would be avenged” and urged them to remain steadfast and patient. He emphasised that the people of Balochistan owed a debt to their sacrifice.
Situation ‘out of control’
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, president of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) and a former chief minister, offered a sharp contrast to the government’s assurances.
“I have never seen such a dangerous situation in my entire life,” Mr Mengal said in a statement posted on the social media platform X.
Mr Mengal, a member of the National Assembly, stated with “full conviction” that no tribal chief could enter his own area without fear of militant attacks.
He called this a reality that should deeply alarm everyone, stressing that the security situation was “completely out of control”.
He added: “We take no pleasure in seeing our land burn.”
The BNP-M chief attributed the crisis to “hatred, oppression and the misuse of power” that, he said, had continued over the past three years. He argued that instead of heeding warnings, the government had funded propaganda against those trying to resolve the province’s issues.
“If the government were to stop funding private media channels to propagate against him and others genuinely striving to address Balochistan’s issues, it could help foster at least a modest sense of security,” he said.
“Everyone knew this day would come, but no one chose to listen,” Mr Mengal said, criticising federal institutions for “blindly” repeating the narrative that no problem existed.

ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned separate sessions of both houses of parliament on February 2, which are likely take up an amendment related to the National Accountability Ordinance to allow the incumbent NAB chief to remain in office beyond his term set to expire in the first week of March, said sources.
The agenda of these sessions has not been shared but insiders said the NAB amendment would be the sessions’ highlight to pave the way for the incumbent NAB chairman to remain at the helm until the appointment of his successor. Retired Lt Gen Nazir Ahmad became the NAB chairman on March 4, 2023, for three years after his predecessor Aftab Sultan resigned citing “interference” and “pressure” as the reasons for his departure. The opposition PTI had claimed Mr Sultan was being coerced to file corruption references against its chief Imran Khan.
As per the law, the NAB chief is appointed through consultations between the prime minister and the opposition leader, which is supposed to start two months before the expiry of the term and be completed within 45 days. This means the process should have been started in the first week of January, but it never did.
If there is no consensus, the names proposed by the PM and the opposition leader are to be forwarded to the parliamentary committee for the final decision. “Provided that the leader of the house and leader of the opposition shall propose two names each for consideration of the parliamentary committee,” a proviso to the law reads.
“The parliamentary committee under clause (ii) shall be constituted by the speaker, National Assembly, comprising fifty percent members from the treasury benches and fifty percent from the opposition benches, based on their strength in Majlis e Shoora (parliament), to be nominated by the respective parliamentary leaders,” the law reads.
The committee is required to recommend the name of the chairman no later than thirty days. “The total strength of the parliamentary committee shall be twelve members out of which one third shall be from the Senate. If the National Assembly stands dissolved at the material time, all the members of the committee shall be from the Senate,” the law says.
“The chairman shall, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the federal government, hold office for a non-extendable term of three years and shall not be eligible for subsequent appointment as chairman and shall not be removed from office except on the grounds and in the manner as provided in Article 209 of the Constitution,” the law reads.
According to a source, the upcoming sessions will, however, likely amend this law on the pattern of a provision in the 26th Amendment that allowed the chief election commissioner and two ECP members to continue even after the expiry of their term, while keeping the appointment process on hold.Sources said both houses will also adopt resolutions in connection with Kashmir solidarity day, observed every year on February 5.
Meanwhile, the opposition is also likely to raise the issues of delay in the commencement of the process for the appointment of a new chief election commissioner and two ECP members who continue to hold offices over a year after the expiry of their original term. Moreover, matters related to the health of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan will also come up during the proceedings.

Throughout history, accounts of Bibles, Qurans or Buddhist sutras emerging unscathed from catastrophic floods and fires have been celebrated as Divine interventions. While these events offer profound spiritual solace, a closer look reveals a fascinating intersection of material physics and psychological bias.
From a physical standpoint, Dougal Drysdale, Professor Emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, suggests that a hardbound book’s survival is often due to the ‘Closed Book Effect.’ When shut, a book functions as a dense, oxygen-starved block of cellulose. Because fire requires a steady flow of oxygen to consume fuel, the tightly packed pages resist ignition by preventing airflow from reaching the interior.
In the event of a flood, the surface tension of water against tightly pressed pages creates a natural barrier. This prevents deep seepage for a significant period, often leaving the heart of the book perfectly dry.
American psychologist Thomas Gilovich explains that when a sacred text survives a disaster, it often becomes more than just a book. It is elevated to a sacred relic. This transformation, according to Gilovich, can significantly redefine a community’s cultural path. In the aftermath of the 2011 Joplin tornado in Missouri, US, survivors and news outlets frequently highlighted the ‘miraculous’ discovery of intact Bibles among the rubble of flattened homes.

The survival of holy texts in the aftermath of natural catastrophes is often termed ‘Divine protection’, revealing the cultural and spiritual narratives people love to attach to such instances

While hardbound dictionaries and cookbooks likely survived in the same ruins due to their similar physical construction, these secular items were ignored by the media as mere debris. The surviving Bibles were immediately elevated from functional reading material to sacred relics, often being framed and displayed as symbols of Divine protection.
By focusing on these specific books, the media triggered a cognitive bias that led people to view the event through a supernatural lens rather than recognising the simple physical durability of bound paper.
British scholar Susan Whitfield, in her 2004 work The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith, details the discovery of the Mogao Caves in China. In that instance, the sealing of the Buddhist text the Diamond Sutra (868 CE) within a dry, walled-up chamber created a “natural vault” that protected the world’s oldest-dated printed book from the degrading effects of humidity and oxygen for nearly a millennium. The perception of such objects often shifts from the literary to the ‘miraculous’.
During World War I, pocket Bibles carried by soldiers occasionally stopped shrapnel due to the high density of their compressed paper. This led many soldiers to treat the Bibles as protective talismans.
The Codex Amiatinus, frequently referred to as the ‘Grandfather’ of Latin Bibles, has survived for over 1,300 years due to its immense physical durability. According to Drysdale, this enormous volume, created around 700 CE in Northumbria, England, weighs over 34 kilogrammes and was crafted from the skins of more than 500 calves.
The use of high-quality parchment makes the Bible significantly more resistant to fire and decay, as organic animal skins lack the highly flammable, oxygen-trapping fibres found in wood-pulp paper. This Bible remained virtually untouched for a millennium, preserved by the stable environment of an Italian abbey that served as a ‘natural vault.’
In West Africa, the Desert Manuscripts of Timbuktu offer a compelling example of texts surviving environmental factors, a story often framed as miraculous. When Islamist militants set fire to the Ahmed Baba Institute in 2013, there was widespread global concern over the potential loss of thousands of ancient Islamic manuscripts. However, according to the researcher Mauro Nobili, the extreme aridity of the Sahara desert was critical in aiding their preservation for centuries.
The persistently low humidity prevented mould growth and kept the delicate ink stable, allowing for their long-term survival, which many viewed as a modern miracle. However, the more vulnerable manuscripts were secretly shifted to safer locations before the militants set fire to the Ahmed Baba Institute.



 
During the Viking raid on Lindisfarne — a tidal island off the northeast coast of England — in 793 CE, a legend emerged concerning a sacred book, Lindisfarne Gospels, which was said to have been dropped into the sea by fleeing priests. Three days later, it washed up perfectly dry. While this specific account is often considered apocryphal, the physical survival of such ancient texts is frequently due to their durable leather and metal bindings, which act as a protective shell for the internal vellum.
Gilovich would point to stories such as this ‘dry’ recovery of a Bible as prime examples of how the media and oral tradition prioritise miraculous narratives over the mundane reality of material science, thereby reinforcing spiritual beliefs.
According to the prominent professor of psychological sciences J. Park, communities frequently transform these survival stories into powerful symbols of “Divine protection” as a means of processing the profound trauma of disasters. This phenomenon ultimately highlights a dynamic intersection, where material science meets deep human sentiment.
While the inherent fire-resistant properties of vellum offer logical, scientific explanations for the physical survival of many books, the human psychological element remains paramount. The inherent human need to find order, meaning and hope within chaos is what elevates these surviving sacred objects from mere material items to vital spiritual anchors for a community’s recovery and continuity.
The endurance of these texts represents a profound intersection between material science and human psychology. It is not merely the density of vellum, the chemical stability of ancient inks or the aridity of a desert that ensures survival. Rather, it is the way these physical realities interact with our inherent drive to find order in the wake of destruction.
Gilovich’s research posits that when a community witnesses the survival of a sacred text, they are not simply observing a quirk of physics. They are engaging in what Park describes as “meaning-making”, using the survived sacred object to process trauma and reclaim a sense of ‘Divine protection.’ Whether through the preservation of the Diamond Sutra in caves, or a Bible or a Quran found amidst the ruins of a modern disaster, these serve as a bridge between the tangible and the transcendent. Their survival is a testament to the fact that, while fire and time may consume the material, the cultural and spiritual narratives we attach to them remain indestructible.
Yet, it is equally important that we recognise the physical realities of their endurance, acknowledging that the science of material durability does not diminish the ‘miracle’, but rather provides a rational foundation for understanding how the written word survives the very elements meant to destroy it.

The announcement by the Petroleum Division said the new prices had been set on the recommendations of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
The price of HSD for the next fortnight, up to Feb 15, has been fixed at Rs268.38 per litre, compared to Rs257.08 during the previous 15 days.
The increase has been made due “to higher crude oil prices over the past week amid regional tensions and an order by the US president to deploy a US Navy strike group to the Persian Gulf”.
This development alone pushed up HSD prices in Arab and other international markets.
As HSD is a key fuel for the industrial and business sectors and is widely used by trucks, buses and large generators, a strong reaction from the business community is expected over the Rs11.30 per litre increase.
The price of petrol, consumed mainly by cars, mot­orcycles and small generators, has been kept unc­h­anged at Rs253.17 per litre.
Due to the rise in HSD prices, jet fuel rates have also been increased slightly for the next fortnight.
Meanwhile, despite the politically tense global environment, the US Energy Information Administration has forecast Brent crude prices to average lower in 2026 and 2027, driven by global production exceeding demand.
International analysts have predicted that global production of liquid fuels will increase by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2026 due to higher production.
LPG
Ogra has also notified new prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for the month of February, showing an increase due to higher winter demand in global markets.
The LPG consumer price has been increased by Rs6.37 per kg to Rs226.05 per kg for February, compared to Rs219.67 in January.
The LPG producer price is linked to the Saudi Aramco contract price and the dollar exchange rate.
Compared to the previous month, the Saudi Aramco contract price has increased by 3.83 per cent, while the average dollar exchange rate has declined marginally by 0.14pc, resulting in an increase of Rs75.71 per 11.8kg cylinder.

The statement said that he passed away in Islamabad after a prolonged illness. It said that the funeral prayers would be offered tomorrow in his native village of Chichiyan, Mirpur at 3 pm.
The statement said that Chaudhry was elected the AJK prime minister in 1996 and the president in 2021. He was also elected nine times as a member of the AJK Assembly from Mirpur.
His death comes days before Kashmir Solidarity Day, which the nation observed on Feb 5 to reaffirm unwavering support for the relentless struggle of the Kashmiri people.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief at Chaudhry’s passing. In a statement, the premier said Chaudhry was a “wise and dedicated politician” who spent his entire life serving the people of AJK, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said that Chaudhry’s services to the Kashmiri people and his struggle for the Kashmir cause would always be remembered.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his grief over Chaudhry’s passing and prayed that he receive “forgiveness and a high place in heaven”, a statement from the Presidency said.
It added that President Zardari also expressed his sympathy to Chaudhry’s family, deeming his national and political services “invaluable”.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was saddened by Chaudhry’s passing and hailed him as “a staunch advocate for the Kashmiri cause and its people”.
“His service to Kashmir and contributions to Pakistan will always be remembered,” he wrote on X.







Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani expressed grief over the death of the AJK president, saying Chaudhry was a “dignified and principled politician”.
“Chaudhry had a significant role in promoting the issue of Kashmir at the international level, and his services would be remembered always,” he said, adding his political struggle was a “beacon of the way for the upcoming generations”.
Gillani also extended condolences to the bereaved family.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq also expressed grief at Chaudhry’s passing. According to a statement by the NA Secretariat, he paid tribute to Chaudhry’s “distinguished political and social services, particularly his invaluable contributions towards effectively highlighting the Kashmir cause at international forums”.
He said that the services rendered Chaudhry in advocating for the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people would always be remembered.

Skipper Salman Agha hit his highest score in the shortest format before Pakistan’s spinners routed Australia by 90 runs.
Agha hit a 40-ball 76 and Usman Khan smashed a 36-ball 53 as Pakistan made 198-5, their highest-ever T20I total against Australia.
This was enough for Pakistan’s spin quintet, who shared all ten wickets between them with Abrar Ahmed returning the best figures of 3-14 and Shadab Khan finishing with 3-26.
Australia were routed for 108 in 15.4 overs, giving Pakistan their biggest T20I victory over Australia, eclipsing the 66-run win in Abu Dhabi in 2018.
“It has to be a perfect game,” said Agha. “We batted well and then were outstanding with the ball. Fielding was outstanding.”
The victory gives Pakistan an unbeatable 2-0 lead after they won the first match by 22 runs, also in Lahore, on Friday.
“We want to play in the same way, forget the 2-0 scoreline and come again with the same intensity and go to the World Cup with the same energy,” said Agha of the event starting in India and Sri Lanka from February 7.
This is Pakistan’s first T20I series win over Australia since 2018. The final match is on Sunday, also in Lahore.
Despite skipper Mitchell Marsh coming back after resting on Friday, the visiting batters had little answer to Pakistan’s spin assault.
Ahmed dismissed Marsh for 18, Josh Inglis for five and Matthew Short for 27. Cameroon Green top scored with a 20-ball 35 before spinner Usman Tariq dismissed him on his way to figures of 2-16.
Marsh admitted Pakistan were better.
“Pakistan outplayed us,” said Marsh. “Hopefully, we can improve and come back tomorrow. They put us under great pressure in batting; it was probably a 160-170 wicket so they scored a big total.”
Earlier, Agha and Usman led Pakistan to a fighting total after they won the toss and batted.
Agha built the innings with Saim Ayub (11-ball 23) during a second wicket stand of 55 as Pakistan scored 72 runs in the power-play.
Agha’s previous highest in all T20 cricket was 68 not out.
After Babar Azam failed with a five-ball two, Usman helped Agha add another quickfire 49 for the fourth wicket before Sean Abbott broke the stand.
Agha smashed four sixes and eight fours in his sixth Twenty20 half century.
Pakistan added a good 61 runs in the last five overs with Usman knocking two sixes and four fours in his second T20I half-century while Shadab’s knock had two sixes and a four.
The Usman-Shadab fifth-wicket stand yielded 63 runs off just 39 balls.Shadab finished with an unbeaten 20-ball 28.
Pacer Xavier Bartlett and spinner Matthew Kuhnemann were expensive, conceding 92 runs between them in their eight overs.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered his “heartiest congratulations” to the team on their victory and “phenomenal performance” in the T20 series in a post on X.
He lauded the players, the team management and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi for “their dedication and outstanding efforts”.
“May this winning momentum continue,” he said.







For his part, Naqvi congratulated the team on winning the series against Australia. He also lauded the Green Shirts’ teamwork.
He expressed the hope that the team would live up to the nation’s expectations in the future.







On Thursday, in the opening match of the series, the Green Shirts achieved their first T20I victory against Australia in more than seven years. Saim Ayub gave an outstanding all-round performance, taking two wickets after a blistering 40-run knock.
The two teams played a three-match Test and an ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium.
Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.
