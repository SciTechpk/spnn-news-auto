<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041142204b837e5.jpg?r=114537' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915367/child-marriage-law-challenged-in-federal-shariat-court' target='_blank'><strong>Child marriage law challenged in Federal Shariat Court</strong></a><br><p>A law banning the marriage of children under eight years of age has been challenged in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) in Islamabad, arguing that it was against the Constitution as well as the tenets of Islam and should be abolished.
The bill, which sought to protect the rights of children and eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, was signed into law by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from the religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and parliament — ruling that “classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law”.
A citizen, Shahzada Adnan, filed a petition through his lawyer, Advocate Mudassar Chaudhry, against the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025. The petition has been filed against the Ministry of interior, Ministry of Law and Justice, and the CII as respondents.
The petitioner said the law is in “clear conflict and repugnant to Sharia” and that is why it needs to be declared “un-Islamic, unconstitutional and against the fundamental of Islam”.
He reproduced several section from the Act which he said should be impugned. The law relates to registration of child marriage, punishment for male adult marrying a child, punishment for child abuse, and the punishment for parents or guardian concerned in a child marriage.
The petitioner maintained the law related to child marriage is against the Holy Quran and Hadith as well as the Constitution.
The petition read that in “accordance with the stated legislation the Islamic concept of marriage is totally negated as according [to the] injunction of Islam, age does not matter but the puberty is the key [to the] ceremony of Nikah”.
It continued that the “impugned law [is] ultra vires and against the basic fundamental laws of Sharia.” The petition also cities verses from the Holy Quran.
The petition further reads that the “impugned law is against the commandment in the Quran” whereas in Islam, “marriage (Nikaḥ) is a sacred contract and a highly recommended act”.
The petitioner said the state legislative bodies did not consider the opinion of the CCI that has declared the “impugned act as Islamic and against the spirit of Islam as well as the Constitution of Pakistan”.
It added that in Islamic Fiqh (jurisprudence), “there’s no specific age mandated for marriage. However, the general principle is that both parties must have reached maturity and have the mental capacity to understand the responsibilities of marriage”.
It read that Islamic scholars generally “consider the age of 15-16 as the appropriate age for marriage due to its suitability.”
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman recently rejected the law and announced nationwide protest rallies, alleging that it “made fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult”.
“Pakistan is a strange country — during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women’s rights that decriminalised fornication,” Fazl said.
“Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulema and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and Sunnah,” he added.
Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29. He said the party will host rallies to “create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance”.</p><small>2025-06-04 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041713273003a37.jpg?r=171502' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915388/irans-khamenei-dismisses-us-nuclear-proposal-vows-to-keep-enriching-uranium' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Khamenei dismisses US nuclear proposal, vows to keep enriching uranium</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100 per cent” against the country’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman, which has mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After five rounds of talks, several hard-to-bridge issues remain, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and Tehran’s refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium — possible raw material for nuclear bombs.
Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said nothing about halting the talks, but said the US proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’”.
“Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear programme and the enemies have focused on the enrichment,” Khamenei said during a televised speech marking the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
“The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100pc against our interests … The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear programme. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?” he added.
“Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America.”
Khamenei said, “If we have 100 nuclear power plants but don’t have enrichment, they will be of no use to us,” because “nuclear power plants need fuel” to operate. “If we cannot produce this fuel domestically, we have to reach out to the United States, which may have dozens of conditions.”
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
‘Maximum pressure’
Reuters reported on Monday that Tehran was poised to reject the US proposal as a “non-starter” that failed to soften Washington’s stance on uranium enrichment or to address Tehran’s interests.
 
 

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the US proposal includes “an arrangement that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels” as the US and other countries “work out a more detailed plan intended to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon”.
It said the proposal would see the United States facilitating “the building of nuclear power plants for Iran and negotiate the construction of enrichment facilities managed by a consortium of regional countries”.
Iran has previously said it is open to temporary limits on its enrichment of uranium and is willing to consider the establishment of a regional nuclear fuel consortium. But it has stressed that such a consortium is “in no way intended to replace Iran’s own uranium enrichment programme”.
Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January, which included tightening sanctions and threatening to bomb Iran if the negotiations yield no deal.
Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. Iran’s clerical establishment, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions.
During his first term, Trump ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the pact’s limits.
Iran’s clerical establishment is grappling with multiple crises — energy and water shortages, a plunging currency, losses among regional militia proxies in conflicts with Israel, and rising fears of an Israeli strike on its nuclear sites — all intensified by Trump’s hardline stance.
Iran’s arch-foe Israel, which sees Tehran’s nuclear programme as an existential threat, has repeatedly threatened to bomb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Tehran has vowed a harsh response.
‘Less than satisfactory’
In its latest quarterly report last week, the IAEA said Iran had further stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium.
In a separate report, it also criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60pc, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.
The reports came ahead of a planned IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna later this month which will review Iran’s nuclear activities.
Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries who were party to the 2015 deal, are currently weighing whether to trigger the sanctions “snapback” mechanism in the accord.
The mechanism would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by Israel.</p><small>2025-06-04 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0417405149525e9.jpg?r=174126' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915397/7-dead-in-stampede-outside-indias-bengaluru-cricket-stadium' target='_blank'><strong>7 dead in stampede outside India’s Bengaluru cricket stadium</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were killed in a stampede outside a cricket stadium in India’s Bengaluru, where an event was being held to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s first Indian Premier League title win, TV channels reported on Wednesday.
Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings in the tournament’s final match on Tuesday.
Thousands of people, some of them waving the team’s red flag, lined the streets leading up to the Chinnaswamy Stadium in the heart of the city as the cricket team arrived at the venue in a bus in the evening, television channels showed.
Visuals after the stampede showed a policeman carrying an injured spectator to an ambulance, while people gathered around a second person who lay seemingly unconscious on the ground.
Stampedes and other accidents are not uncommon when large crowds gather in India, including during religious events.
At least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Hindu festival in January, as tens of millions gathered to take a dip in sacred waters on its most auspicious day.</p><small>2025-06-04 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041334361c52f9d.jpg?r=133508' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915374/shares-at-psx-climb-1300-points-due-to-adb-programme' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX climb 1,300 points due to ADB programme</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed by 1,300 points on Wednesday ahead of the budget announcement on June 10.
The KSE-100 index climbed 923.71, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 121,374.58 from the last close of 120,450.87 at 1:31pm. The index closed at 121,798.86, with a gain of 1347.99 points or 1.12pc.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, attributed the bullish momentum to the news of the approval of a new financial package between Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The ADB approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Philippines-based lender.
The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the “Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme” includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB’s “first ever policy-based guarantee” of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.
Additionally, Tawfik noted that stock valuations were trading at an “attractive level” due to the correction phase witnessed at the stock market earlier this week.
“Lastly, there is also some institutional buying which has increased liquidity,” she added.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said, “The market has hit an all-time high as participants brush off any negative budget-related news flow.”
He explained that expectations were building that economic stability would persist and interest rates will gradually trend downward, allowing stock market price-to-earning (PE)  ratios to rerate upwards.
“We believe the market is gradually entering the second phase of the bull run — transitioning from the accumulation phase to the public participation or momentum phase — marked by increasing public involvement, rising stock market volumes, gradual PE multiple expansion, and clearer signs of economic recovery,” he stated, adding that investor confidence, media attention, and new IPO activity were expected to grow.
“Measures such as reduced taxation that boost corporate earnings, along with adherence to IMF guidelines, will further reinforce confidence,” Farooq highlighted, noting that steps towards mass digitisation would also propel stock market sentiment.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0415330429e449c.jpg?r=161421' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915384/modi-to-visit-occupied-kashmir-to-unveil-strategic-railway' target='_blank'><strong>Modi to visit occupied Kashmir to unveil ‘strategic railway’</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to make his first visit to occupied Kashmir since the conflict between the country and Pakistan began last month, inaugurating a ‘strategic railway’ service to the mountainous region, his office said on Wednesday.
 






Modi will visit the valley on Friday to open the Chenab Bridge, a 1,315-metre-long steel and concrete span that connects two mountains with an arch 359m above the river below.
“The project establishes all-weather, seamless rail connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country,” the Indian Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.
Modi is expected to flag off a special train.
 
 

Last month, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan fought an intense four-day conflict, their worst standoff since 1999, before a US-brokered ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and launched a series of airstrikes on different Pakistani cities.
Anti-India groups have been fighting for decades for held Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan, and enjoy broad popular support.
The 272-kilometre Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway — with 36 tunnels and 943 bridges — has been constructed “aiming to transform regional mobility and driving socio-economic integration”, the statement added.
Its dramatic centrepiece is the Chenab Bridge, which India calls the “world’s highest railway arch bridge”.
While several road and pipeline bridges are higher, Guinness World Records confirmed that Chenab trumps the previous highest railway bridge, the Najiehe in China.
Indian Railways calls the $24-million bridge “arguably the biggest civil engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history”.
The bridge will facilitate the movement of people and goods, as well as troops, that was previously possible only via treacherous mountain roads and air.
The train line could slash travel time between the town of Katra and Srinagar, the region’s key city, by half, taking around three hours.
The bridge will also revolutionise logistics in Ladakh, the icy region in India bordering China.
India and China, the world’s two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Their troops clashed in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers, and forces from both sides today face off across contested high-altitude borderlands.
The railway begins in the garrison city of Udhampur, the headquarters of the Indian army’s northern command, and runs north to Srinagar.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0411080945477bc.png?r=111140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359/bilawal-led-delegation-reaches-washington-after-wrapping-up-ny-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</strong></a><br><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.
Pakis­tan had launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
 






It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.
According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.
 






Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.
“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.
The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.
It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.
Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.
“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.
He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.
“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”
Pakistan praised globally for our kinetic actions: FM DAR
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state visit, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.
“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.
While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.
 


Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.
He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04155044e828de9.jpg?r=155116' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915380/two-chinese-researchers-accused-of-smuggling-potential-agroterrorism-weapon-into-us' target='_blank'><strong>Two Chinese researchers accused of smuggling ‘potential agroterrorism weapon’ into US</strong></a><br><p>US federal prosecutors have accused two Chinese nationals of smuggling a dangerous biological pathogen that had the potential to be used as an agricultural terrorism weapon into the United States for research.
The US Department of Justice on Tuesday identified the pathogen as Fusarium graminearum, a fungus it said was classified in scientific literature as a potential agroterrorism weapon. In a statement, it said that the fungus causes “head blight” in some crops and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses globally each year.
 






According to an FBI criminal complaint, Zunyong Liu, 34, a researcher currently in China, brought the fungus into the US while visiting his girlfriend, Yunqing Jian, 33, in July 2024.
He admitted to smuggling in the fungus so he could conduct research on it at a University of Michigan laboratory where his girlfriend worked, according to the complaint.
The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the complaint, an examination of electronic communications between the two indicated that they discussed shipping biological materials and research being done in the laboratory prior to Zunyong’s arrival.
Yunqing and Zunyong were accused in the complaint of conspiracy, smuggling goods into the US, false statements and visa fraud.
Cheyvoryea Gibson, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office, said the pair’s actions “posed an imminent threat to public safety”.
Yunqing was expected to appear in court in Detroit, Michigan, on Tuesday. A judge appointed a public defender, who could not be immediately reached for comment, to represent her.</p><small>2025-06-04 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04122205a3ee596.jpg?r=122209' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914970/indian-defence-chief-admitting-pakistan-downed-jets-may-be-veiled-criticism-of-modis-policies-expert' target='_blank'><strong>Indian defence chief admitting Pakistan downed jets may be veiled criticism of Modi’s policies: expert</strong></a><br><p>‘In the quiet hours just past midnight on May 6, a battle unfolded above the clouds that rewrote the rules of modern air warfare. It wasn’t marked by dogfights or dramatic barrel rolls seen in past conflicts between the two arch-rival South Asian neighbours. Instead, the skies over Pakistan and India became a silent battlefield of invisible forces — electromagnetic pulses, jamming beams, satellite interference, and beyond-visual-range missiles slicing through the night.’
This excerpt from a Dawn report describes the recent aerial clash between Pakistan and India, which has been termed as a significant development in the regional air power constellation.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and launched a series of airstrikes on different Pakistani cities.
In its response, the Pakistan Air Force took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 within 40 minutes. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat
India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan’s recent admission that his country’s fighter jets were shot down by Pakistan during the escalation has been termed a “veiled criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies” by an expert.
New Delhi’s fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, which included mosques in Bahawalpur, Muzaffarabad, Kotli, Muridke, as well as villages in Sialkot district and Shakargarh.

In an interview with Bloomberg at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Chauhan had said, “I think what is important is not the jets being downed but why the jets were shot down.”
In response to a query by a TV show’s host, he confirmed that Indian fighter jets were shot down during the recent escalation between the two countries, claiming that the four-day conflict never came close to the point of nuclear war.
Speaking to Dawn.com about the Indian general’s comments, Ejaz Haider, Senior Resident Fellow at the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research, said: “The Bloomberg interview by India’s chief of defence staff appears to be an attempt by India’s military to push back against a policy by the Hindutva political leadership to use the Pakistan card for domestic political reasons.”
He added that as a professional military leader, Gen Chauhan was aware of capabilities and shortcomings and realised that India had no overwhelming advantage against Pakistan.
“He also understands that Narendra Modi’s policy is escalatory and dangerous,” the analyst continued.
Haider said it was important to note how the Indian general conveyed his message. “He was asked if a plane was shot down. He could have circumvented the question by saying that combat entails losses, and India achieved its objectives by striking targets inside Pakistan.”
Haider recalled how the question was tackled by India’s Director-General of Air Operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti.
Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal Bharti said, “Losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.
 
 

“Instead, Chauhan spoke of fighter losses in the plural and kept up the plural in the follow-up question, too,” Haider remarked.
The Indian chief of defence staff had also said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.
“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and fly all our jets again, targeting at long range,” India Today quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.
Speaking on the Indian general’s admission that the IAF flew their jets again on May 10, after two days, Haider said, “This is a remarkable confession and could not be inadvertent.
“He went on to say that IAF did not fly for two days, until May 10, when they scrambled outside the PAF’s engagement envelope,” he added.
“This admission is significant because for two days, the Indian defences were without air cover, and that allowed the PAF to send in their fighter jets on the 10th to take out the Indian S-400’s [air defence system] cheeseboard radar,” he explained.
India had bought the Russian air defence system in a $5 billion deal in 2018, despite a looming threat of US sanctions on countries that trade with Russia’s defence and intelligence sectors.

He further explained that even on May 10, when India targeted Pakistani bases, the Indian jets flew outside the range of PAF’s fighter aircraft after the “silent kills” they had faced at the hands of the PAF on the night of May 6-7.
“He (Chauhan) is already been accused of going beyond his remit by Hindutva-affiliated journalists, who have called for disciplinary action against him,” he continued.
Haider added that it would be interesting to see how the Indian military’s professionalism plays out against BJP’s Hindutva politics.
Western military experts had also kept a close eye on the outcome of this aerial confrontation with a particular focus on how Chinese weaponry was battle-tested by the Pakistani armed forces, coming out on top against the French-made Rafale, which is at the cutting edge of Nato’s weapon arsenal.
Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute told the British newspaper The Guardian that “Any state producing or buying weapons is keen to see how the product does in real conflict. Tests and exercises can tell most about capabilities of weapons, but the ultimate test is often combat.”
Similarly, Andrew Small, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, was quoted as saying that the Pakistan-India aerial combat provided the weapon’s suppliers a chance to assess the performance of their weaponry. In Pakistan’s case, the supplier was China and in India’s case, mostly Europe and Russia.
“It gives them a chance to assess their performance under far more complex and challenging conditions than usual, and with Pakistan, this is not just about the fighter jets themselves, it’s about the missiles, the radar systems, and the whole technology spine of the Pakistani military, from electronic warfare capabilities to satellite systems,” Small said.

Former foreign minister and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, speaking about the clash, told reporters on Tuesday that Pakistan could have potentially shot down more Indian jets but exercised restraint during the response to the attack by New Delhi.
Bilawal, who is currently leading a Pakistani diplomatic delegation to the United States, said, “Even the shooting down of those six planes was Pakistan showing restraint, 20 Indian jets were locked by our planes,” adding that only those planes were targeted which had released their payload on civilian targets in Pakistan.
Following the air battle on the night of May 6-7, Islamabad then intercepted drones sent by India on May 8 and following tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.
Plethora of evidence
Even before the Indian top general’s confirmation, there was a plethora of evidence to establish the veracity of Pakistan’s claims, which were confirmed by different sources.
American and French officials had also earlier confirmed that Pakistan shot down an Indian jet using fighter aircraft it acquired from China, CNN and Reuters reported earlier in the month.
CNN cited a senior US official saying, as per their assessment, Pakistani forces shot down the jet during India’s air strikes inside Pakistan.
A high-ranking French intelligence official also told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.

Earlier in the month, the American newspaper The Washington Post also verified visual evidence that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
The paper based its findings on analyses by former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician Trevor Ball, Etienne Marcuz, an associate fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research and an anonymous French air power expert.
“In a review of more than a dozen images and videos posted online in the aftermath of the strikes, The Post verified debris consistent with at least two French-made fighter jets flown by the Indian Air Force — a Rafale and a Mirage 2000,” The Post reported.
Separately, Al Jazeera reported on the morning of May 7, after the clash, that three fighter jets had crashed in Indian Occupied Kashmir.

Parts of Karachi experienced three more tremors on Tuesday morning, as the city has been shaken by 19 mild earthquakes over the past three days, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) officials said.
The tremors, all classified as low to moderate in intensity, ranged from 2.1 magnitude to 3.6 on the Richter scale. The strongest tremor, measuring 3.6, was recorded on Sunday, while the weakest was of 2.1 magnitude.
PMD Director General Mahr Sahibzad Khan, while speaking during Dawn News TV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, said Karachi will face low-intensity quakes for the next couple of days.
The Met chief claimed earthquakes are occurring in Karachi due to lack of ground water and illegal pumping by the so-called ‘tanker mafia’.
“Karachi has small fault lines in areas of Korangi and Malir that are causing minor earthquakes,” he said, adding that tremors were being felt in the areas close to the fault line.
“The main problem in Karachi is that there is no ground water. If you remove the hard rocks, there is only sand,” he added.  “There is a strong tanker mafia in Karachi. They take out water through pumping or other illegal means.”
He said the pumping of ground water is being done over the fault line which causes “induced earthquakes.”
He observed that the intensity of the quakes in Karachi has reduced over the past few days. He said the first quake measured 3.6 on Richter Scale but the one that struck today (June 3) recorded a magnitude of 2.6.
When asked about the collapse of the wall in Malir prison that led to a massive jailbreak, he said the prison’s wall collapsed because it was located close to the epicentre.
“It (Malir jail) was located near the epicentre. The intensity is greater in the areas near the epicentre,” he elaborated.
When asked if the tremors will continue in the upcoming days, the Met chief said the aftershocks will remain for the next few days until the seismic activity settles.
“The tremors will continue but not with high intensity. The fault line is not very active. They will end after two to three days,” he added.
When asked if the residents of the city should panic, he said there is “nothing to worry about for people of Karachi.”</p><small>2025-06-04 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041317192b6e450.jpg?r=134733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915372/million-plus-pilgrims-begin-haj-under-blazing-sun' target='_blank'><strong>Million-plus pilgrims begin Haj under blazing sun</strong></a><br><p>More than a million pilgrims joined Islam’s most important rite under a beating sun on Wednesday, as the Haj kicked off with the Saudi hosts scrambling to avoid last year’s 1,000-plus deaths in sweltering heat.
With the temperature expected to top 40 degrees Celsius, robed pilgrims slowly circled the Kaaba at the heart of Makkah’s Grand Mosque.
State media reported that others had begun arriving in the tent city of Mina on Makkah’s outskirts where they will stay overnight before the Haj’s high-point on Thursday — prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Holy Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) delivered his final sermon.
About 1.4 million pilgrims arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of the Haj.
Authorities have ratcheted up heat protection measures such as extra shade to avoid a repeat of last year, when 1,301 people died as temperatures hit 51.8C.
On Wednesday, pilgrims will perform the tawaf — walking seven times around the Kaaba.
Pilgrims arriving on buses had begun already trickling into Mina on Tuesday afternoon, greeted by staff offering them coffee and dates.
“I am so happy, it’s such an amazing feeling,” said Reem al-Shogre, a 35-year-old Saudi performing the pilgrimage for the first time.
Following last year’s lethal heatwave, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials to improve protection.
Shaded areas have been enlarged by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands of additional medics will be on standby and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, Haj Minister Tawfiq al Rabiah told AFP last week.
Artificial intelligence technology will help process the deluge of data, including video from a new fleet of drones, to better manage the massive crowds.
Authorities said most of the deaths last year were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to air-conditioned tents and buses.
This year, they have cracked down on the unregistered, using frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by lottery. But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt the Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.
Large crowds at Haj have proved hazardous in the past, most notably in 2015 when a stampede during the “stoning the devil” ritual in Mina killed up to 2,300 people in the deadliest Haj disaster.</p><small>2025-06-04 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03174545fbc42e5.png?r=174553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912156/donkey-business-what-china-wants-with-pakistans-beasts-of-burden' target='_blank'><strong>Donkey business: What China wants with Pakistan’s beasts of burden</strong></a><br><p>For Gulzar and his family of 14, a donkey is the thin line between a modest living and dire poverty. The ‘beast of burden’, as the animal is colloquially referred to, pulls the 50-year-old and his cart loaded with 1,350 kilograms of structural iron across several miles every day.
The 38-minute journey, from New Karachi to Lyari and sometimes even beyond, earns Gulzar a daily income between Rs1,200 and Rs1,600, almost half of which is spent on the donkey’s upkeep. It is the bare minimum, but it is also what keeps his head above the water.
Over the last few years, however, rising prices of donkeys and their equally high mortality rates have put Gulzar in a tight spot. “Earlier, our expenses were aligned with our earnings, but now the work has increased,” he said. “Even if you buy an animal for Rs0.2 million, there is no point; it will die before you can utilise it fully. Donkey cart owners would be wealthy if these animals didn’t die,” rued Gulzar.
In Karachi alone, hundreds of daily wage labourers like Gulzar, whose income depends on donkeys, have felt the pinch. Muhammad Islam, 56, and Muhammad Rasheed, 41, who also use their donkey carts to transport structural iron across the port city, complained that scraping by had become harder with time as fewer healthy donkeys were available domestically.

Demand and supply
Donkeys were first domesticated in Africa nearly 5,000 years ago. Precise and latest figures are hard to obtain but reports estimate 500 million poor and marginalised people are dependent on working equids (horses, donkeys and mules) globally.
In Pakistan, the population of working donkeys stands at 5.9m, with the last three years seeing a steady increase. This has successfully helped the country maintain its spot among the list of places home to the largest number of donkeys, trailing just behind Ethiopia and Sudan.
 



In the past few months, local media reports have highlighted a surge in donkey prices, reaching as high as Rs0.3 million. Inflation is a pertinent issue across all industries in Pakistan, but the rise in donkey prices has been linked to growing demand from a high-value buyer: China and its multi-billion-dollar ejiao industry.
For animal rights advocates, China’s interest in sourcing donkeys, particularly for their hide, is not news. Of late, however, the global trade in donkey skin has become a geopolitical phenomenon where millions of donkeys are slaughtered every year to satiate a growing demand for ejiao, a gelatin used in traditional Chinese medicine made by stewing and concentrating donkey skin.
Pakistan, due to its proximity and close diplomatic ties to China, has been of particular interest to fuel this demand.
In April 2025, Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain met with a Chinese delegation that showed an interest in establishing donkey farms in Pakistan, citing the country’s favourable breeding environment. The minister welcomed the initiative, but said any formal agreement must protect Pakistan’s local donkey population.
The ejiao industry
Named after its birthplace Dong’e County in East China’s Shandong province, ejiao is considered among the top three tonics in traditional Chinese medicine. It boasts a cultural heritage spanning 3,000 years and has gained global attention over the last few decades as companies involved in its production expanded their reach and usage worldwide.
Google Trends shows a popularity hike of the search term ‘ejiao’ around 2016, with Indonesia, Singapore, China and Hong Kong showing the most interest by region. The Hong Kong Free Press attributes this surge to the television series, ‘Empresses in the Palace’, that began airing in 2011; one of the largest ejiao producers, Dong’e Ejiao, paid for its products to be placed on the show that subsequently appeared in at least 16 episodes.
Meanwhile, the Animal Welfare Institute reports the United States as the third largest importer of ejiao products with approximately $12 million in annual imports.
But what makes ejiao so sought-after?
As per a study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology — a peer-reviewed research journal — ejiao is widely used in clinics for its biological activities of anti-fatigue, immunity improvement, tumour suppression, and anti-anaemia effect. In traditional Chinese medicine, blood deficiency syndrome (BDS) refers to the pathological state of insufficient blood, but it differs from anaemia as understood in modern medicine; while both involve a reduction of blood cells or haemoglobin, the terms arise from fundamentally different medical systems.
Blood deficiency syndrome is more prevalent in women, a difference attributed to blood loss during menstrual cycles and hormonal changes during adolescence, pregnancy, lactation and menopause, all of which increase the body’s need for iron and calcium.
In the clinical trial of the cited study, although patients were recruited regardless of sex, the researchers found that of the 220 patients, 187 were females, indicating the popularity of ejiao among women. The results showed that ejiao alleviated dizziness, a major symptom of blood deficiency syndrome in patients, while improving hematocrit results, a blood test that measures how much of a person’s blood is made up of red blood cells as opposed to plasma. Simultaneously, ejiao increased the levels of white blood cells and the absolute neutrophil count.
Despite these benefits and its widespread popularity in traditional Chinese medicine, veterinary experts insist that obtaining donkey skins for the production of ejiao compromises animal and human welfare, public health, and the environment. Risks include potential exposure to tetanus, anthrax, and other zoonotic diseases. In 2019, for instance, an equine influenza outbreak in West Africa led to the deaths of 60,000 donkeys in Nigeria, which has been partly linked to illegal cross-border donkey transport.
 



Between 2013 and 2016, the annual production of ejiao increased from 3,200 to 5,600 tonnes, a 20 per cent yearly growth. But in the five years that followed, the production spiked by a whopping 160pc, requiring millions of donkey skins to keep up with the demand of China’s growing middle-class population.
In 2018, China’s biggest ejiao manufacturer raised the price of its products by 6pc, a decision based on the market supply and demand of donkey hides. China’s own donkey population has gone from 5.6m in 1990 to 0.86m in 2022, a staggering 80pc collapse, compelling the industry to turn to foreign suppliers, including Africa, South America, and Asia.
Foreign suppliers
Africa is home to two-thirds of the world’s donkeys, making it a lucrative source of donkey skins for the ejiao industry. Over the years, even though some local farmers in Africa benefited from the donkey skin trade, the fluctuations in donkey prices had an adverse effect on donkey-owning families.
“In most cases in Africa, the donkeys were being used in poor households and by sick people, refugees, and people living in remote regions, especially women and children,” said Dr Lauren Johnston, an associate professor at the University of Sydney’s China Studies Centre, with expertise in China-Africa relations.
“So the ejiao-related demand for donkey skins not only led to the theft of these animals from poor villages but also interrupted an entire service that donkeys provide by carrying water from a well to a house,” she explained.
“And children have to drop out of school because they instead have to walk to the well and get water because there’s no donkey anymore.”
Donkeys play a multi-pronged role in African households; they save time and energy, and uplift the living standard of the poor in remote areas.
Unfortunately, as Dr Lauren highlighted, the rising demand and price of donkeys cut their socioeconomic role. To counter this, the African heads of state agreed last year to ban the trade of donkey skin, effectively ending the legal slaughter of hundreds of thousands of donkeys. The ban shifted the spotlight to Pakistan, and the close relations between Beijing and Islamabad further contributed to it.
The two countries are among each other’s top trading partners, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly emphasised.
While the exact extent of the legal and illegal donkey skin trade over the last decade is unclear, data obtained from the General Administration of Customs (GACC) — a ministerial body monitoring the import and export of goods to and from China — shows that a total of 1,335,530 hides were imported from January to December 2023. Of these, six were countries from the African Union, namely Benin, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritania, and Nigeria, which exported a total of 780,021 hides. Pakistan, on the other hand, exported a total of 157,094 hides to China in 2023.
 
Similar data from 2024 indicates that Pakistan became the primary trading partner for hides following the African Union’s ban in February of the previous year.
 
It is, however, important to note that this data broadly covers all equine and bovine (cattle, buffalo, bison) skins and only reflects the legal extent of the trade without factoring in donkeys reportedly kidnapped or traded illegally.
“I can’t remember how many skins a year China had been getting from Africa, but if they can’t get those from Africa, they need to get them from somewhere else. And it seems the number one target for substituting donkey skins from Africa is Pakistan,” said Dr Lauren.
With respect to the latest meeting held in April between Rana Tanveer Hussain and the Chinese delegation, a ministry spokesperson told Dawn.com that the decision to establish donkey farms in Pakistan will be beneficial to the country’s economy as it will rely on local labor at every stage, including feeding, caretaking, and the management systems in place.
Economic asset for Pakistan
While Pakistan has predominantly supported the donkey skin trade, its official policies have contextually varied over time.
A few years ago, private Chinese companies expressed interest in animal trading with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, particularly focusing on donkeys and proposed establishing the KP-China Sustainable Donkey Development Programme to develop and enhance the donkey population for exports.
However, the proposal did not come to fruition. “We had talks with the companies, but because they were private, the proposal did not mature,” said Dr Asal Khan, director general at the KP Livestock and Dairy Development Department (Extension).
“These kinds of agreements or MoUs are government-to-government. Since all these Chinese companies were from the private sector, and their main purpose was to buy donkeys from here and take them to China, we did not allow them to do so,” he told Dawn.com, adding that the animals were a source of income for the poor.

In 2015, the Economic Coordination Council temporarily banned the export of donkey hides; the primary concern was the disposal of donkey meat, and the ban was to last until all four provincial governments devised ways to discard the meat appropriately. Reports on donkey meat being sold as beef made Pakistanis apprehensive about donkey trade because the meat of a domesticated donkey is considered inedible or haram.
According to Dr Asim Faraz, assistant professor of livestock and poultry production at Bahauddin Zakariya University, if just donkey skins were exported, the flesh was likely to be consumed locally. “So if we are to export donkeys to China, the entire animal should be exported.”
Eventually, the ban was lifted after a few years. According to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2023-24, protocols were signed to enhance the country’s agricultural exports to China, including one for exporting dried chilli in July 2023 and one for dairy products, donkey hides, and heated beef in October 2023.
In fact, in November last year, at an international donkey industry conference held in China’s Liaocheng, Pakistani officials highlighted Islamabad’s potential for the donkey industry and animal husbandry to become globally competitive with its neighbour’s assistance.
Majyd Aziz,  a former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, attended the event and, in an interview, said that there is a need to establish designated factories for the slaughtering and processing of hides and meat to ensure it does not circulate in Pakistani markets. “The use of donkey carts will fizzle out over time,” he predicted, adding that it was better if the government bought donkeys from cart owners and replaced them with motorcycles.
Even with its operational status uncertain at the moment, Pakistan already has a donkey slaughterhouse in the agricultural park of the Gwadar Free Zone, where plans to establish farms are underway. Its sole purpose is exports, according to Muhammad Akram, former animal husbandry commissioner at the Ministry of National Food Security and Research. “There would be no consumption or any leakage in Pakistan,” he added.
While there isn’t any specific legislation that explicitly addresses the donkey skin trade in Pakistan, there are other related laws and regulations that indirectly govern animal welfare and trade. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1890, for instance, prohibits beating, overworking, or causing unnecessary pain to animals. However, it is a colonial-era law with minimal penalties — a small fine of Rs50 to 100, depending on the offence, and imprisonment for a one or two-month period.
Furthermore, the Punjab Animal Health Act (2019) focuses on the prevention, control, containment, and eradication of animal diseases to meet the international standards of import and export of animals and animal products. The hide of a donkey is not influenced by the overall condition of the animal, so there might be little to no incentive to ensure positive health states. Such an export could be a violation of this act.
What’s at stake?
Despite the economic opportunity that the ejiao industry presents and the government’s assurances to protect the local donkey population, it is estimated that about 36m people across Pakistan are dependent on equine labour and could be affected by the donkey skin trade.
Donkeys are an integral part of many of the country’s industries; chief among them being brick kilns, transport, agriculture, waste collection, recycling and even laundry. A study conducted by equine charity Brooke in 2019 estimated that one donkey transports 1,000 kilograms of non-recyclable waste and 100 kilograms of recyclable waste daily.
Dr Sher Nawaz, regional manager of Brooke Pakistan (Sindh), explained that one equine supports approximately six people, contributing to a daily income of around Rs1,000-Rs1,500. He also pointed out that the price of larger donkey breeds has doubled in the past five to 10 years, reaching up to Rs0.15m. Smaller donkeys, previously available for around Rs15,000, now cost Rs30,000 to 40,000.

For donkey owners in Pakistan, income usually depends on the type of work they get. In the brick kilns industry, for example, earnings per animal can range from Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 per day but this amount is divided among several labourers.
Sharing an incident from the 2022 floods, Dr Sher Nawaz recalled meeting a man in Hyderabad who could not afford his own donkey, so he rented one and used it to earn a living.
“The floods left the man devastated, but he was very grateful when support arrived; he told me he had two daughters and was entirely reliant on the donkey for his livelihood,” Dr Sher Nawaz said. “For families like his, losing a donkey is catastrophic. If their donkey dies, they often have no choice but to borrow money to buy another, just to start working again.”
However, the Pakistani market is now expanding, and demand is high, particularly from across the border. People frequenting the donkey market in Karachi’s Lyari narrate coming across Chinese customers who wish to purchase donkeys for consumption.
Kaalu, 65, remembers being approached by Chinese buyers six to seven months back. “But I refused because I know they slaughter the donkeys and use their skin for cosmetic purposes,” he recounted.
On the other hand, Majeed, who also sells donkeys, said that he sold unhealthy donkeys to Chinese customers. “They are willing to buy donkeys in any condition; in fact, sometimes they end up buying ten to twelve donkeys at once,” he added.
Similarly, at the other end of the city, unhealthy and disabled donkeys are being sold in Bhains Colony for as low as Rs2,000, Rs1,500, or even Rs800 to Chinese customers, who, according to Feroz, are typically accompanied by security guards. Feroz looks after the trading ground for private stakeholders and has been in the business since 2006.
The celebrity donkeys
Besides working in labour-intensive industries like brick kilns and waste management, donkeys in Karachi are also part of another integral cultural activity — the donkey cart race, a sport that is not only a source of pride for its participants but also entertainment for the communities that partake.
Amongst other prominent names is Abdul Hussain Pattak, a seasoned donkey cart racer in the sport since 1971. “This has been a passion of mine since childhood, whether it is donkey carts or cycling,” said Pattak, humbly bragging about the accolades he collected over the years owing to his donkeys Jalebi and Naya Daur.

The donkeys used in races differ from regular ones in terms of agility, clocking speeds of 40 to 50 kilometres per hour, with Pattak’s favourites originating from Makran, Balochistan. Along with barley, their owners feed them almonds, pistachios, and milk to ensure a better build while also willingly spending up to Rs800 on their daily upkeep. Pattak, however, even spent up to Rs1,200 on the maintenance of his beloved late Dumper, a racer donkey who won him multiple trophies over 10 years.
“I was once offered Rs0.3 million for him, but I didn’t sell. I said he would live out his life with us,” he recalled.
The races themselves are informal yet organised, Pattak explained, expanding throughout the city from Mauripur Road to Drigh Road, Malir, and Landhi. It is a self-funded endeavour, where cart racers place bets on their donkeys, who race in pairs, with the winner advancing to the next round; a series of races ultimately decides the final winner that claims both victory and a small cash prize. A weekly affair held on Sundays, donkey cart races typically attract a large crowd of around 2,000 to 2,500 spectators.
More than a workhorse
A donkey is, hence, not just an economic asset or a beast of burden. It is, in essence, a sentient and social animal that develops astrong bonds with humans.
According to a paper published in the academic journal ‘Anthropology Today’, donkeys and their keepers develop a kind of ‘mutualism’ or interdependence.
The study quotes the story of a donkey keeper who chose to buy a donkey over a motorised rickshaw despite the animal’s inflated cost. In the long run, this was a more viable choice both financially and emotionally. “Donkeys take care of their keeper and other domestic animals; when they spot danger, they protect by kicking and biting,” the man remarked. A rickshaw, on the other hand, is an inert and soulless piece of machinery only useful for transporting goods and people.
Referring to the Pakistani government’s decision to export donkey hides, the author of the study and director at South Asia Research Institute, The Australian National University, Dr Kavesh told Dawn.com, “Besides the economic factor, there is also an ethical concern. People who keep donkeys develop a bond with them and see them as close companions. They have not experienced donkeys being slaughtered before. Therefore, slaughtering and sending donkeys would create an ethical dilemma that the government might find difficult to address.”
Talking about the practicality of the donkey trade, he argued that there is no sustainable mechanism for donkey production in Pakistan. “For example, cows, goats, sheep, and chickens all have a sustained breeding mechanism, with access to veterinary hospitals, training of vets, associations (such as the Pakistan Poultry Association, etc.), and widespread local knowledge in villages. The reproduction of donkeys either happens in the wild or through some specialised dealers. There are not many specialised donkey dealers, so it will be crucial to see how the excessive demand could keep up with the limited supply.”
Unlike cows and chickens, who start breeding much earlier and more frequently, donkeys are slow to reproduce with an average gestation period of 365 days, following which they typically bear a single foal.
Long pregnancies and other species-specific factors mean that it is challenging to breed donkeys en masse like cattle, so Pakistan would need an enormous breeding herd and other infrastructural protocols to fuel donkey hide demand. Without these, donkeys might likely in fact be sourced from families that depend on them for their livelihoods.
Sustainable alternatives
In order to help protect donkeys from exploitation, Siân Edwards, the campaigns head at charitable organisation The Donkey Sanctuary, said there is a need to spread awareness of the skin trade and lobby governments to ban the trade or slaughter. Although the charity does not currently operate in Pakistan, it recognises that there are donkeys in South Asia, and its proximity to China makes it appealing for Beijing to source donkey skins.
“Awareness about the demand and ejiao products will also support the end to the trade if consumers decide not to buy, or indeed if the producers use less or no donkey skin and perhaps switch to a bio-identical lab-grown donkey collagen,” she said.
In October last year, animal welfare groups delivered over 370,000 petition signatures to Amazon to ban the sale of ejiao-based products, citing the slaughter of an estimated five million donkeys annually. A number of ejiao products are still available on the market, albeit with limited popularity. Data obtained using an Amazon analytics tool, Helium 10, shows that over the 26 months since it became available in December 2022, the price of one ejiao product consistently remained at $26.59, with relative sales hikes in April 2023 and October 2024. The data also revealed a low listing score of 6.8 (out of 10), indicating that it does not perform well in search results and customer engagement.
In recent years, cellular agriculture has also grown in popularity as a way of manufacturing products that would traditionally require harvesting from animals. A study published in the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology suggests that the priority of cellular agriculture is to manufacture agricultural products that are similar on a molecular level to those made via traditional agricultural methods.
However, cellular agriculture based on animal cells and tissue cultures is still in its infancy.
Furthermore, with ejiao originating from China’s Dong’e County and being revered as a rich cultural heritage and an integral part of traditional Chinese medicine, it is debatable whether lab-grown alternatives would come close to satisfactorily meeting the ejiao demand.
According to Dr Lauren, “This [ejiao] is such an ancient elixir — even if it’s just a placebo — it’s such a deep and rich placebo. The donkey is sacred to different people for different and contradictory reasons. And that’s just what makes this trade the most amazing. So you have these sorts of clashing values of the donkey; unfortunately, the donkey doesn’t breed very quickly, so it’s not possible to suddenly create lots of donkeys to meet this clashing demand.”

During the meeting, the two officials also spoke about “Bitcoin integration, and the future of decentralised infrastructure”.
Bo Hines was appointed by President Trump in January 2025 to lead the national policy development on digital asset innovation, regulation, and emerging financial technologies, according to the statement.
In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.
Saqib is now responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
The meeting comes following Pakistan’s announcement of its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, positioning the country as one of the first in Asia to incorporate Bitcoin into its sovereign asset strategy.
“I envision Pakistan to be a leader in the Global South for Digital Assets.” said Saqib. “From launching our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to unlocking national infrastructure for crypto mining and AI data zones, Pakistan is building a real framework for digital asset adoption and economic modernisation.”
The statement added that both sides expressed a shared interest in fostering collaboration between the US and Pakistan on digital asset innovation, regulatory coherence, and emerging financial technologies during the meeting.
“They also discussed ways to support innovation ecosystems that empower youth and accelerate economic inclusion through blockchain,” the press release added.
Saqib also met with the White House Counsel’s Office.
Pakistan’s broader Crypto strategy includes allocating two gigawatts to power Bitcoin mining and AI-driven data zones.

Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.
The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.
“On June 2-3 2025, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in the general area Datta Khel, North Waziristan District, on the reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The statement added that during the conduct of operation, the troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and “after an intense exchange of fire, fourteen Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Last month, security forces killed nine terrorists “sponsored” by India during a series of operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the ISPR.
In July last year, the government, through an official notification, designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna al Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitnah-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-06-04 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04110050935a7f8.jpg?r=110056' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915235/lahore-high-court-bar-for-barring-ahmadis-from-practising-islamic-eid-rites' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore High Court Bar for barring Ahmadis from practising Islamic Eid rites</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) has asked the Punjab police chief to prevent Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.
A letter written by the LHCBA to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Punjab states that the Eidul Azha is a sacred Muslim festival and to perform the associated rituals is specific to the Muslims.
The letter signed by LHCBA President Malik Asif Nissoana, Secretary Farrukh Ilyas Cheema and its Khatam-i-Nabuwat Committee Secretary Tayyab Qureshi further says that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.
However, it alleges, despite being a non-Muslim minority, the Ahmadiyya community members are unlawfully presenting themselves as Muslims and openly portraying their “blasphemous beliefs as Islam”.

Govt seeks affidavits from community members, assuring they won’t observe Muslim rituals

It states that on the occasion of Eidul Azha, the Ahmadiyya community members are openly announcing the organisation of illegal gatherings that resemble Islamic Eid prayers and sacrificial rituals.
“This is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, the Pakistan Penal Code and the verdicts of the Supreme Court,” the letter adds.
 
 

The bar leaders plead that the unlawful actions of the minority community are hurting the Muslims’ sentiments, posing a risk of public disorder.
They ask the IGP to order the heads of the district police to prevent the Ahmadiyya community members from using Islamic symbols during Eidul Azha, restrain them from violating the Constitution and the law, and take legal action against them if found involved in such practices.
Meanwhile, the members of the Ahmadiyya community have been directed to submit affidavits and indemnity bonds, affirming that they would not observe Eidul Azha or its associated religious rituals.
According to an official from the Punjab home department, the measure is based on a 2023 notification aimed at ensuring strict compliance with Sections 298-B and 298-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which restrict religious expressions by the Ahmadiyya community.
These laws prohibit members of the community from referring themselves as Muslims or engaging in Islamic practices.
The affidavits include clauses requiring the signatories to pay fines in case of non-compliance —an action that human rights groups have condemned as discriminatory and an infringement on religious freedom.

ISLAMABAD: The capital police on Tuesday announced the arrest of the suspect in the murder case of a social media influencer, who was gunned down at her house in G-13 on Monday.
Addressing a hastily-called news conference, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said after the murder of 17-year-old Sana Yousuf, seven police teams were formed under the supervision of DIG Operations Jawad Tariq. These teams conducted a technical investigation, analysing social media accounts and more than 300 call records. Footage from Safe City Islamabad and private cameras was also obtained.
The suspect was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder.”

IGP says there was immense pressure on police, but identifying suspect was a complex process

The IGP said the murder of Sana caused a wave of concern across Islamabad and the entire country. The brutal killing of the young girl was a significant challenge for the police. There was immense pressure to arrest the killer, but identifying him was a complex process.
He added that a strong case would be built against the suspect, ensuring a thorough investigation and collection of solid evidence so that the competent court awards him the appropriate punishment.
The IGP held the press conference at Rescue 15 and was accompanied by DIG Mohammad Jawad Tariq and other police officers.
 
 

Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the suspect, the son of a retired grade-16 officer, and the victim had known each other for the last one year. The suspect came to Islamabad on the night between May 28 and 29 to wish her a happy birthday and reached her house in G-13; however, they could not meet due to unknown reasons.
Later, both the girl and the suspect talked on the phone with the latter complaining about her unavailability to meet him on her birthday. However, they decided to meet on June 2, and he again arrived in Islamabad. When he reached outside her house, she did not come out.
Somehow, the suspect managed to enter the house, where an argument ensued during which he pulled out a weapon and shot her, killing her on the spot.
At the time of the incident, the victim’s aunt was present in the house while her parents had gone out.
After registration of the case, the investigators collected CCTV footage from cameras installed around the victim’s house and from Safe City, which revealed that the suspect had reached Chungi No 26 and boarded a passenger vehicle to Faisalabad.
Geo-fencing of the area also confirmed the suspect’s presence at G-13 and later at Chungi No 26. Police conducted a raid in Faisalabad, arrested the suspect and brought him to Islamabad.
NCSW demands transparent investigation
Meanwhile, the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) condemned the cold-blooded murder of the young TikToker and said the heinous act was a stark reminder of the deep-rooted patriarchal violence that continues to deprive women and girls of their fundamental right to life.
NCSW Chairperson Ume Laila Azhar demanded an immediate, transparent and thorough investigation into the crime. She said the perpetrators must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
“We will not let this case be buried under social stigma, false narratives of honour, or procedural loopholes. This senseless killing highlights the vulnerability of women and girls, even in their own homes. We demand justice for Sana and her family, and expect the state to ensure accountability of the perpetrators.”
Burial in Chitral
The body of the victim was laid to rest in her ancestral graveyard in Chuinj village of Upper Chitral on Tuesday.
Touching scenes were witnessed during the burial as villagers and relatives burst into tears over the tragic death of the girl.
Her father, Yousuf Hassan, who works in a government office in Islamabad, said the Chitrali community residing in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar had started feeling insecure as incidents of cold-blooded murders had increased in the past few years.
Earlier, hundreds of people had gathered to condole with the bereaved parents in a hotel in Chitral city, where they stayed for an hour on Tuesday morning before leaving for the village in Upper Chitral with the body.

• Local businesses face mounting losses as sit-ins in Gulmat Nagar and Sost sever vital commercial links
GILGIT: Local traders protesting import-export policies continued to block the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gulmat Nagar for a fifth consecutive day on Tuesday, with a separate demonstration also halting traffic in Sost town near Khunjerab Pass.
The KKH Hunza-Nagar section remained blocked at two locations, causing difficulties for tourists and passengers amid long queues of vehicles.
Protesters, led by the Pak-China Traders Action Committee, vowed not to call off their sit-in until their demands concerning trade with China and what they termed “exploitative policies” by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) are met.
The committee is an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Importers and Exporters Association, the Nagar Chamber of Commerce, and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit.
Key demands include the clearance of 240 consignments imported from China, stuck at Sost Dry port for seven months, through an amnesty scheme, and a waiver of all port charges.
They also seek an exemption for consignments at Sost Dry Port from misdeclaration cases, facilitation of barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Xinjiang province under a 1985 border agreement, and an exemption for GB residents from sales and income taxes on goods imported from China, citing the region’s disputed status.
The protest has drawn support from GB political and religious parties, with opposition members in the GB Assembly announcing their solidarity.
Javed Ali Manwa, an opposition member who joined the protest, said, “The demands of protesters are fundamental rights of GB people.”
He accused the federal government of making “people of this [region] jobless and economically attacked”.
GB opposition leader Kazim Mesum, in a statement, noted “the only land route with China [is] blocked” and urged the federal government to “resolve the demands of the traders before the entire GB people will take to streets”.
Protesters said they initially planned to march towards Sost but were stopped by the administration, compelling them to stage the KKH sit-in.
They said the federal government is “reluctant to settle the genuine issues of the local people” and warned “the situation will be dangerous if their demands are further delayed”.
Protesters highlighted that GB people “had annexed the region with Pakistan without getting status and rights of constitutional citizens”.
Organisers of the protest closed the KKH to all traffic except ambulances, disconnecting the road link with China and leaving local passengers and tourists stranded.
Published in Dawn, June 4th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-04 05:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/040946429960af8.jpg?r=094815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915349/flawed-govt-policies-cause-sharp-contraction-in-major-crops' target='_blank'><strong>‘Flawed’ govt policies cause sharp contraction in major crops</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has conceded that policy decisions and government measures at both the federal and provincial levels have caused a substantial contraction of 13.5 per cent in major crops this fiscal year, which may lead to increased food imports next year at the expense of precious foreign exchange.
In a working paper for the federal budget 2025-26, the Planning Commission also attributed the lower-than-targeted GDP growth to a poor performance of the agriculture sector. “GDP growth for FY25 is recorded at 2.7pc against the target of 3.6pc, primarily due to a massive contraction in key commodity-producing sectors, including important crops, which witnessed a 13.5pc contraction due to adverse weather conditions, reduced rainfall, input challenges, and policy shift”, the Planning Commission candidly placed on record.
Last year, the government announced a lucrative minimum support price (MSP) for wheat, but the Punjab government subsequently withdrew its support for farmers, leaving them at the mercy of middlemen and market forces. The federal government, as part of the IMF negotiations, later announced its intention to end commodity market interventions and refrain from implementing minimum support prices.
The subsequent policy changes, including extended fertiliser subsidies, added salt to the farmers’ pain, causing input challenges as pointed out by the Planning Commission.

Planning Commission foresees higher food imports next year

“During FY25, the crop sector showed mixed trends as production of important crops declined by 13.5pc, whereas other crops showed growth of 4.8pc. Production of cotton declined by 30.7pc, maize by 15.4pc, sugarcane by 3.9pc, rice by 1.4pc, and wheat by 8.9pc”, the commission noted.
The outcome could not have been expected to be different. “Yields of sugarcane and rice declined despite a slight increase in cultivated area. This could be attributed to erratic weather patterns or input issues during the growing season”, the commission said, warning that the overall data highlighted falling yields and the need for better policy support and climate-resilient practices.
On top of that, cotton ginning contracted by 19pc in FY25 compared to a growth of 47.2pc last year. “This was mainly due to decline in cotton production and closure of ginning factories in the country”, the working paper reads.
This helped the federal government contain the expansion of net domestic assets to a marginal Rs145.6bn in 2024-25 compared to Rs1.588 trillion last year. “This was largely due to the government’s net retirement of SBP borrowings, reduced demand for budgetary support from scheduled banks owing to lower fiscal deficit and a net retirement of financing for commodity operations, mostly driven by repayment of loans availed for wheat procurement”, the commission said.
“It mainly reflects the impact of reforms in commodity operations to stem the accumulation of commodity debt. These measures included rationalisation of wheat procurement, gradual abolition of MSP” besides the timely payment of subsidies, and transitioning to targeted subsidies, mostly in the energy sector.
Conversely, the planning commission appreciated the livestock performance and gave its credit to the government. “Livestock maintained its growth streak to 4.7pc during current year compared to 4.4pc last year. This was mainly due to key initiatives like vaccination programmes for livestock, both by the federal and provincial governments” in the improvement in surveillance programmes and disease control mechanisms in the country.
This also had a cascading impact on manufacturing sector that underperformed, slowing from 3pc growth in the previous year to 1.3pc in FY2024-25 against a target of 4.4pc. The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector was a key contributor to this slowdown, which reversed its modest 0.9pc growth from last year and contracted by 1.5pc in FY2024-25, underscoring persistent weaknesses in industrial output and subdued demand.
LSM groups like food production, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products, iron and steel, electrical equipment, machinery, and furniture recor­ded a decline, which offset the growth in the output of tobacco, textiles, wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, automobiles, and other transport equipment, indicating resilience in consumer-oriented and energy-related industries.

Lee’s victory stands to usher in a political sea change in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, after the backlash against the martial law brought down Yoon Suk Yeol, the conservative outsider who narrowly beat Lee in the 2022 election.
Nearly 80 per cent of South Korea’s 44.39 million eligible voters cast their ballots, the highest turnout for a presidential election in the country since 1997, with Lee terming the polls “judgement day” against Yoon’s martial law and the People Power Party’s failure to distance itself from that decision.
 
 

With more than 99pc of the votes counted, the Democratic Party’s Lee stood at 49.3pc to PPP candidate Kim Moon-soo’s 41.3pc, according to National Election Commission data. A subdued Kim conceded the race and congratulated Lee in brief remarks to reporters.
Lee had long been favoured to win, and his supporters erupted in cheers as exit polls by the country’s major broadcasters showed him defeating Kim by wide margins.
In a brief speech to supporters gathered outside parliament after the polls closed, Lee said he would fulfil the duties of the office and bring unity to the country.
“We can overcome this temporary difficulty with the combined strength of our people, who have great capabilities,” he said.
He also vowed to revive the economy and seek peace with nuclear-armed North Korea through dialogue and strength.
The martial law decree and the six months of ensuing turmoil, which saw three different acting presidents and multiple criminal insurrection trials for Yoon and several top officials, marked a stunning political self-destruction for the former leader and effectively handed the presidency to his main rival.
Yoon was impeached by the Lee-led parliament, then removed from office by the constitutional court in April, less than three years into his five-year term, triggering the snap election.
Lee has accused the PPP of having condoned the martial law attempt by not fighting harder to thwart it.
Kim was Yoon’s labour minister when the former president declared martial law on Dec 3.
“I was here on Dec 3 after martial law was declared and Dec 14 when Yoon was impeached,” said Choi Mi-jeong, 55, a science teacher who gathered outside parliament to hear Lee speak. “Now Lee Jae-myung is becoming president. I hope he will become a leader who supports ordinary people, not vested interests, not a small number of riches.”
Need for change
Park Chan-dae, acting leader of Lee’s Democratic Party, told a TV channel that the projections suggest voters rejected the martial law attempt and are hoping for an improvement in their lives.
“I think people made a fiery judgement against the insurrection regime,” he said. The winner must tackle a host of challenges, including a society deeply scarred by divisions made more obvious since the attempt at military rule.

• CM Murad calls incident ‘unacceptable’, regrets jail authorities did not reach out to govt or law enforcement agencies for assistance
• One prisoner killed, four others injured in melee; officials say prisoners bolted after being let out of barracks following tremors
KARACHI: At least 83 of the 216 inmates — who managed to break out of the Malir District Prison — have been rounded up and teams have been formed to bring in those still at large, police said.
In the wake of the jailbreak, dubbed as “one of the largest-ever in Pak­istan” by Law Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah removed the provincial prisons chief and suspended the deputy inspector general of prisons, as well as the superintendent of the chaos-hit penitentiary.
The jailbreak began just before midnight and continued into the early hours of Tuesday after hundreds of prisoners — spooked by low-intensity quakes — were allowed into the prison courtyard, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar later told reporters at the scene.
Police said the prisoners snatched guns from prison staff and forced open the main gate after a shootout, evading paramilitary soldiers. At least one prisoner was shot dead and two others were injured, said Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn the body of one deceased prisoner, along with four other inmates with gunshot injuries and two policemen, were brought to a hospital.
IGP Memon, who visited the jail on Tuesday morning, said that as per his assessment and briefings from jail and police officials, the jail administration brought an estimated 2,000 prisoners out of their barracks for counting shortly after midnight, following low-intensity tremors.
“Most of the prisoners were drug addicts,” he noted. “The addicts’ state of mind is such that they tend to develop mob psychology. Thus, when such an atmosphere was created inside the prison, the prisoners ran by opening the door of the jail,” he elaborated.
The police chief said FC personnel deployed at the prison resorted to aerial firing to push them back.
Subsequently, law enforcers launched an operation, managing to recapture 78 prisoners.
The Sindh police head said they are setting up teams to re-arrest the remaining 138 escaped prisoners. “One of the escaped prisoners was brought back to the jail by his mother,” he added.
He said the Sindh government has decided to set up an inquiry committee to ascertain the circumstances that led to the incident and fix responsibility for it.
Heads roll
In the wake of the incident, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah ordered the removal of IG Prisons Qazi Nazir and suspended DIG Prisons Hassan Sehto and Malir Jail Super­intendent Arshad Hussain.
Terming the incident “completely unacceptable”, the chief minister said it demonstrated gross negligence and inefficiency on the part of the prison administration.
 
 

Presiding over an emergency meeting at the CM House, the chief minister directed the chief secretary to conduct a thorough investigation of the Malir Jail incident by engaging Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi and Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho.
He emphasised that the jail authorities should have immediately contacted the local district administration and law enforcement agencies for assistance. “There appears to be a complete breakdown in communication and preparedness,” he observed.
“Those responsible will be held accountable,” he said, while directing the home secretary to conduct a comprehensive security audit of all prisons across the province.
CM Murad was informed that most of the escaped prisoners were involved in minor offences, and none were facing heinous charges.
The chief minister appealed to the fugitives to surrender voluntarily. “My request to them (escaped prisoners) would be to surrender, otherwise, their involvement in the jail break incident will amount to terrorism or bigger cases,” he added.
Superintendent’s account
In his report, the now-suspended prison superintendent said that prisoners became agitated due to tremors and started raising a commotion and shouting from the barracks just after midnight on Tuesday.
He claimed that security staff rushed to control the situation and tried to convince the prisoners to remain calm, but many of them instigated their fellow inmates to break down the doors of the barracks at Circle No IV.
The report claimed that the rushing inmates overpowered him and other security staff and rushed to the main ‘Marri’ (security point) as well as other circles and broke the locks of many barracks in circles No. V and No. II.
This resulted in hundreds of prisoners rushing the office block, prison hospital and main marri, interview booths, E-Court and other rooms.
The prisoners also succeeded in entering the main Marri, where they beat the security staff and rushed towards the outer gate of the prison compound around 1:30am.

• NFC meeting in August, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to keep receiving funds to fight terrorism
• CM Gandapur wants tribal districts’ share in finance award, KP’s input in talks with Afghanistan
PESHAWAR: As India’s move to place the Indus Waters Treaty into abeyance puts Pakistan’s water security in peril, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday asked authorities to speed up construction of the Bhasha Dam, while also hinting at inter-provincial consultations to increase the country’s storage capacity.
The premier made these remarks while addressing a jirga at the Corps Headquar­ters Peshawar, in which he stressed the need for tough decisions for the development and prosperity of the country.
PM Shehbaz, while talking about the hostile measures taken by the Modi government, said that under the Indus Waters Treaty, every drop of water was the right of the Pakistani people. He said that India had tasted its own medicine after attacking Pakistan and would be taught a lesson if it attacked again.
 
 

However, the country needs to make a decision on water, he said, adding, “We will invite provinces to discuss how to increase the country’s water storage capacity to defeat India’s nefarious designs.” The PM said Pakistan was building Diamer-Bhasha Dam and other reservoirs to store water, adding that there was a need to take well-considered decisions soon in this regard.
The premier said that KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, in his speech, took up the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award issue, saying the last award was announced in 2010. The premier said that when this issue was taken up in a meeting in Islamabad some time ago, he had formed a committee in this regard. “I have been told this that the provinces have given their names to represent them and the NFC meeting would be convened in August,” the premier said.
He said that under the 1 per cent of the divisible pool, which KP is getting for fighting the war against terrorism, Rs700 billion has been provided to the province to boost its law enforcement capacity, set up a Counter-Terrorism Department, and the safe city projects. He said that KP would continue to receive this fund till the elimination of terrorism.
The premier said that he would form another committee, which would meet the tribal elders, the KP governor, and the chief minister to discuss the issues raised by CM Gandapur to draft recommendations. He said that the federal government would also take the same to parliament.
‘Don’t tax ex-Fata’
A statement issued from the KP Chief Minister’s House said that the CM urged the federal government not to impose taxes on the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions, arguing that the local population was not financially capable of bearing such burdens. “These areas have been severely affected by the war on terror and require significant investment,” he stressed.
The CM asked the federal government to fulfil all promises made to the ex-Fata people. He demanded immediate release of compensation funds for displaced persons from these regions and called for an end to drone strikes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing civilian casualties.
He also demanded the immediate inclusion of the merged districts’ share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award. “We are not asking for another province’s share—we’re demanding our rightful due,” he said.
The CM also urged the federal government to release all pending dues owed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including net hydel profits and the province’s full share in the tobacco cess.
In his address, the CM urged the reinstatement of the traditional jirga system to sustainably resolve disputes in the merged districts. He also demanded KP’s inclusion in peace talks with neighbouring Afghanistan, warning that excluding the province would render the negotiations incomplete.
Bhasha dam meeting
In a separate meeting on the Bhasha dam, the PM asked the authorities to remove hurdles in the completion of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, saying that the country’s self-reliance was linked to affordable electricity and agriculture. “The country’s self-dependence is linked with affordable electricity and agriculture, which requires increased water storage and efficient water usage,” the PM was quoted as saying in a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The prime minister directed prioritising the completion of projects like Diamer-Bhasha Dam to establish an effective system for energy production and abundant water storage.
It may be noted that the energy and the water sectors will face significant cuts in the development budget, after the government planned to reduce the energy sector’s allocations to Rs144bn from Rs169bn this year, while slashing the water sector allocation to Rs109bn from Rs135bn this year.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had said that until 2018, the estimated construction cost of the dam was Rs479bn, and Rs120bn had already been spent on land acquisition. However, the project cost increased significantly due to delays and unnecessary postponements during the previous government.
He suggested the dam and power projects be separated and the financing of the power project be obtained from the private sector. He further said that even after six years, the revised PC-1 of the project still had not been prepared.
He also said the future projects would be completed under the public-private partnership model to avoid delays in funding and completion. Diamer-Bhasha Dam will provide storage of 6.4 million acre-feet of water.

Musk left his role as an official government employee last week, lauded by Trump for spearheading a federal spending cuts programme, but disagreements between the duo have been building.
“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X, in by far his most caustic remarks on Trump’s spending plans.
 






“Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.” It was not Musk’s first comments on Trump’s so-called  “big, beautiful bill” which is set to add $3 million to US deficits over a 10-year horizon, despite deep cuts to health and food aid programmes.
But Musk’s previous criticism was restrained, with the ex-head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force offering only that it undermined his cost-cutting efforts.
On Tuesday he said that the bill — being considered by Congress — would burden  “citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” The escalation in rhetoric indicated bitter hostilities between the White House and Musk, who donated almost $300 million to Trump’s election campaign but has recently voiced frustrations.
 
 

“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill, it doesn’t change his opinion,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a rapid response to Musk’s tweet.
“This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.” As the world’s richest person bowed out of his role as Trump’s cost-cutter-in-chief, their relationship appeared on an even keel as the Republican hailed his fellow billionaire’s  “incredible service.”
Once inseparable
Trump even insisted that Musk was  “really not leaving” after a turbulent four months in which the South African born tycoon cut tens of thousands of jobs, shuttered whole agencies and slashed foreign aid. Musk was once almost inseparable from Trump, glued to his side on Air Force One, Marine One, in the White House and at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
The right-wing magnate’s DOGE led an ideologically-driven rampage through the federal government, with its young  “tech bros” slashing tens of thousands of jobs.

This was revealed by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Tuesday.
Talking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting the former prime minister, he said Mr Khan would himself lead the protest campaign announced by the party, from jail.
He said all instructions regarding the protest would be conveyed through opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan.
Mr Khan, through a message shared via his official X (formerly Twitter) account, had called on the public last week to prepare for a countrywide protest movement.
 







Gohar denies reports he is being removed from party chairmanship; says Gandapur won’t lead upcoming protest

The post had come a day after his sister, Aleema Khan, had proposed a “give-and-take formula” for his release.
Although the ex-premier does not have direct access to his social media account, PTI has not disclosed who manages his posts.
The message, posted in Mr Khan’s name, urged the masses to get ready for a nationwide protest movement, to be launched soon.
Roles of Gohar, Gandapur
Barrister Gohar also rejected “rumours” that he was being removed from the position of party chairman.
Replying to a question, he said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur would not lead the upcoming protest, adding that different personalities would be assigned different responsibilities.
In response to a query, Barrister Gohar said he had always favoured the dialogue and claimed that PTI had not closed its doors for the talks with the establishment.
When contacted, PTI’s political think-tank’s head Raoof Hasan explained that the title of the “founding chairman” gave the impression that he was “a retired person”.
“As Khan sahib has to lead the protest so he has decided to become patron-in-chief, which is a functional post. He is the boss and the position will further give an impression that Imran Khan is the boss of PTI,” he said.
Without elaborating, Mr Hasan said that after this decision, efforts would be made to keep Mr Khan in isolation and he may face further restrictions.
Similarly, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser defended Mr Khan’s decision to become patron-in-chief, saying that the decision had been made because of legal limitations, as he could not become the party chairman.
“Declaring him a patron-in-chief is no different from declaring himself a Rehbar, just as Khan Abdul Wali Khan became Rehbar of his party. Imran Khan will give the policy and direction,” he told Dawn.
Besides Wali Khan, Nawaz Sharif had also assumed the role of patron when he was disqualified from leading the PML-N following his conviction.
It may be recalled that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is hearing petitions challenging the PTI’s third intra-party in less than two years which was filed in March 2024 by one of PTI’s founding members Akbar S. Babar and four others. The PTI argues that the ECP has no powers to interfere in the internal affairs of any political party.
Raoof denies rifts within party
Mr Hasan also denied reports that Mr Khan had decided to become the patron-in-chief in an effort to save PTI from possible disintegration, due to groupings within the party.
A rift between the leaders of PTI has been visible for last over one year. Initially, a controversy over the appointment of Public Accounts Committee chairman started but it could not be settled till date.
On the other hand, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was the head of the PTI’s provincial chapter, but recently, this responsibility has been given to Junaid Akbar and he was also nominated as the PAC chairman.
Surprisingly, Mr Khan initially directed Mr Akbar to resign as the PAC chairman and focus on the party’s provincial chapter, but later allowed him to continue to head the most powerful parliamentary committee.
Also, Mr Gandapur used to lead the protests and marches earlier, but this time it was decided that he would not lead the protests, while rift and press conferences by the KP ministers against each other and the chief minister are on record.

Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis received 35 of those killed on Tuesday. Six others were received by Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah. In Gaza City, al-Shifa Hospital received 14 bodies, and three more were delivered to al-Ahli Arab Hospital, medical sources told Al Jazeera.
More than 180 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli forces opened fire on a group of Palestinians who were trying to approach the distribution centre in Rafah.
While the attacks on aid operations continued for a third consecutive day, a spokesperson for the Israeli military said, “We are trying to understand what happened”.

UN rights agency says obstructing access to food ‘constitutes a war crime’

The UN human rights office in Geneva said the impediment of access to food relief for civilians in Gaza “constitutes a war crime” and described the attacks on people trying to access food aid as “unconscionable”.
Head of the UN agency Volker Turk urged a prompt and impartial investigation into the killings.
A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah had received 184 casualties, adding that 19 of those were dead upon arrival, and eight died of their wounds shortly afterwards.
Video showed injured people being rushed to a medical centre on carts drawn by donkeys.
The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation launched its first distribution sites last week in an effort to alleviate widespread hunger amongst Gaza’s 2.3 million people, most of whom have been forced to abandon their homes to flee fighting. The Foundation’s operation, which bypasses traditional aid groups, has been fiercely criticised by the UN and established charities which say it does not follow humanitarian principles.
The private group, which is endorsed by Israel, said it had distributed 21 truckloads of food on Tuesday and claimed that the reported violence had not happened on its site.
“This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and control. We recognise the difficult nature of the situation and advise all civilians to remain in the safe corridor when travelling to our distribution sites.”

Dadu Deputy Commissio­ner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah said that initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by the rough landscape and strong winds.
However, he added, the winds eventually lost velocity allowing the fire to die down naturally. “Smoke is still rising from some areas, but flames have subsided,” he said.
The DC said it was not possible to bring in fire tenders due to the mountainous terrain. 
He said there were no casualties in the fire.
Residents of nearby villages, including Karo Koat, said the fire began on Monday evening and swiftly engulfed bushes and small mountain trees, creating thick plumes of smoke.
Since there was no motorable road in the mountainous terrain to reach the fire-hit area, aerial firefighting was the only option to control the blaze, the villagers said.
Shahoo Bozdar, a nomadic herder from the area, said wild animals were seen fleeing the affected area to safety.
