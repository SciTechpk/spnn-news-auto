Malir City Police said in a statement that they conducted an intelligence-based operation and arrested the suspect in the domestic robbery incident within the limits of the Clifton police station.
“The ringleader involved in the robbery at a foreign citizen’s house has been arrested, while his wife was also found to be an accomplice,” said Senior Superintendent of Police Malir, Dr Abdul Khaliq Pirzada.
“The suspect has been involved in theft and robbery incidents in different areas of Karachi and was hiding in the Malir area, where he was arrested after a raid,” the police official said in the statement.
Pirzada added that during interrogation, the suspect revealed his wife was also involved in the robbery. “The suspect’s wife used to work as a maid in different houses, collect information, and carry out the robberies with him,” he added.
According to the police officer, the suspect stole cash, jewellery and other valuables worth Rs1 million from the house of a foreign national, Xu Baosheng, located in the Clifton area and fled.
He added that the suspect revealed that he and his wife used to commit crimes under disguise and later escaped to other parts of the country.
“Police are conducting raids at various places to arrest other suspects, while further investigation is underway,” the statement said.
A case was registered at the Clifton police station on the complaint of the victim under Section 381 (theft) and Section 34 (common intention) of the penal code.
According to the first information report (FIR), the Chinese national said he had hired a maid to look after his children at his house for the past six months.
“During this time, Rs1 million went missing from my safe. I asked my employees, but the matter was brushed aside,” he said, adding that soon after, the woman sought medical leave for fifteen days.
The Chinese citizen said he discovered that cash worth Rs2m and jewellery worth Rs1m were also missing. He named the woman and her husband as suspects in the case.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif a day earlier said the government was building a safe and business-friendly environment for the Chinese community in Pakistan by enhancing their security.
“The confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future,” the prime minister said while chairing a meeting regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan.
He acknowledged that measures were being taken to enhance the security of Chinese nationals across the country, including in Islamabad.</p><small>2025-07-24 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24141850f3796ae.png?r=141922' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-deal-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs maritime deal with Chinese shipping giant to boost collaboration</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s shipping sector is set for a major transformation following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China on Thursday, a statement from the Press Information Department said.
The MoU was signed between the CEO of Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) and the chairman of China’s Shandong Xinxu Group, Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry.
“The signing of this MoU symbolises a growing partnership between Pakistan and China in the maritime domain, paving the way for future cooperation, investment, and development in Pakistan’s shipping industry,” Chaudhry said while addressing the signing ceremony, according to the statement.
He emphasised that the collaboration will boost regional trade, enhance connectivity, and strengthen Pakistan’s role in the global maritime industry through cooperation and shared economic goals.
PNSC, headquartered in Karachi, is Pakistan’s premier national flag carrier, operating under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.  The Shandong Xinxu Group Corporation, based in Zibo City, Shandong Province, is a leading Chinese enterprise engaged in international trade and shipping.
“This MoU establishes a framework of mutual trust and cooperation between the two entities, aimed at pursuing commercial benefits and creating favourable conditions for investment in Pakistan’s maritime sector,” the statement further quoted the minister as saying.
“The understanding primarily focuses on collaborative efforts in several key areas. These include the sale and purchase of merchant cargo vessels such as liquid bulk tankers, dry bulk carriers, and containerised ships under joint or individual ownership, as well as through profit and loss sharing arrangements.”
The MoU, per the statement, also encompasses the leasing of such vessels by Xinxu to PNSC through various charter mechanisms, including time, spot, and bare boat charters.“
Another major component of the MoU involves PNSC offering commercial, technical, and administrative management services for vessels as mutually agreed, covering areas such as chartering, marketing, revenue optimisation, maintenance, dry-docking, crewing, and regulatory compliance.
“The MoU includes provisions for financing arrangements by Xinxu to PNSC for investments in ships and other floating platforms. These arrangements will be governed by commercially competitive terms, ensuring mutual benefit and financial viability,” said the statement.
In June, PNSC aimed to generate an estimated $700 million in freight earnings by expanding its cargo fleet to 34 vessels over the next three years as part of a broad strategy to revitalise the country’s maritime and logistics sectors.</p><small>2025-07-24 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24145233fe33da6.jpg?r=145411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926261/6-killed-in-gb-flash-floods-as-search-for-missing-tourists-continues-official' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed in GB flash floods as search for missing tourists continues: official</strong></a><br><p>At least six tourists were killed in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region, while a search for missing visitors was underway, an official said on Thursday.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing on Monday.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.
According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.
Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.
Retired colonel’s body found as search for daughter swept away in Rawalpindi floodwaters continues
Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who went missing after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.
Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.
District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”
Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.
“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement from Tuesday said.
On Tuesday morning, two girls were among four people swept away in separate incidents due to flash flooding in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Last week, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.
Residents block GT Road protesting failure to recover teenager’s body
On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.
On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.
Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told Dawn.com that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.
Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.</p><small>2025-07-24 10:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24132943ea6ce36.png?r=133013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926272/islamabad-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-omar-ayub-in-oct-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues bailable arrest warrant for Omar Ayub in Oct protest case</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) issued a bailable arrest warrant for National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub on Thursday in a case related to a protest in October last year.
PTI protesters and the Islamabad police clashed on Oct 4, 2024, as hundreds of party activists defied security measures and road blockades to gather at multiple locations days before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. Over 100 PTI supporters, along with ex-premier Imran Khan’s two sisters, were taken into custody.
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing of a case filed at the Shahzad Town police station.
 
 

Advocates Sardar Masroof Khan, Zahid Bashir Dar, Murtaza Toori and Mirza Asim were among the lawyers present on the PTI leaders’ behalf.
During the hearing, Judge Sipra issued a bailable arrest warrant for Ayub and ordered that any previous bail granted to suspects who were absent today be cancelled.
However, the judge accepted Senator Azam Swati’s plea seeking exemption from attendance, which was filed yesterday, according to Masroof.
Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till July 30.
In a video statement yesterday, Advocate Masroof lamented the “speed with which these cases are being heard”.
He noted that some suspects had come from faraway areas such as Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan, having no place to stay overnight in Islamabad to attend today’s hearing.
“If these trials will be bulldozed in such a manner and you won’t give them a fair trial, then it will become very difficult for you to fulfil the requirements of justice,” the lawyer said, requesting courts to punish those guilty but not convict those who were not involved.
Today’s development comes within days of two ATCs sentencing PTI bigwigs to as many as 10 years in jail in cases related to the violent May 9, 2023 countrywide riots.
A Lahore ATC handed down at least eight leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment, while acquitting six others. A Sargodha ATC also convicted as many as 32 accused, including MNA Ahmad Chattha and Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.
In May, the Islamabad police’s prosecution nominated the PTI’s top leadership — including Ayub, Chairman Gohar Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Barris­ter Muhammad Ali Saif — in another case over the October 4 protests filed at the Koral police station.
 
 

Earlier this month, a Lahore ATC also declared PTI’s Hammad Azhar and Rana Shahbaz Ahmed as proclaimed offenders in two cases related to an alleged attack on Punjab police during a simultaneous protest as party workers reached Minar-i-Pakistan despite the government’s security measures.
Other cases over the clashes had also been registered at the Noon and Ramna police stations in the federal capital.</p><small>2025-07-24 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2414390300a0dbd.jpg?r=144738' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926298/chinas-byd-to-assemble-evs-in-pakistan-from-2026' target='_blank'><strong>China’s BYD to assemble EVs in Pakistan from 2026</strong></a><br><p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD plans to roll out its first car assembled in Pakistan by July or August 2026 to capture growing demand for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the region, a company executive said on Wednesday.
BYD, the world’s top EV maker, has been expanding rapidly outside its home market, where it is in a strong price war. The Pakistan plant addresses rising demand from emerging markets and allows the company to take advantage of incentives offered by the government.
The plant has been under construction since April near Karachi in a partnership between BYD and Mega Motor Company, a subsidiary of Hub Power, Danish Khaliq, vice president of sales and strategy at BYD Pakistan, told Reuters.
It would initially have the capacity to produce 25,000 units a year on a double shift, he said. He did not elaborate on when the plant would achieve full capacity or say when mass production would begin there.
The plant will start by assembling imported parts, with some local production of non-electric components, Khaliq said, adding it would initially produce vehicles for the domestic market, with potential to export to right-hand drive countries in the region depending on freight costs and business economics.
“We do not foresee excess capacity in our system as demand in Pakistan will catch up,” he said.
BYD started delivering imported EVs in Pakistan in March. Khaliq did not give an exact sales number but said the sales of a few hundred cars had exceeded internal targets by 30 per cent.
 


Khaliq said he expected the market size of EVs and plug-in hybrid cars in Pakistan to grow three to four times in 2025 from around 1,000 total units in 2024. BYD is targeting a 30-35pc share of the segment, Khaliq said.
Based on a Hubco filing, BYD Pakistan made around Rs444 million ($1.56m) in profit in the 2025 March quarter.
BYD will launch its Shark 6 plug-in hybrid pickup truck in Pakistan on Friday. China’s MG already sells a PHEV SUV, while rival Haval is set to join the segment soon.
Plug-in hybrids offer a more practical option in Pakistan as the country faces a lack of charging stations for all-electric vehicles. The government slashed power tariffs for chargers by 45pc in January to encourage EV uptake and private charging stations.</p><small>2025-07-24 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2413561135d4e2b.png?r=135959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926262/thailand-f-16-jet-bombs-cambodian-targets-as-border-clash-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand F-16 jet bombs Cambodian targets as border clash escalates</strong></a><br><p>A Thai F-16 fighter jet bombed targets in Cambodia on Thursday, both sides said, as weeks of tension over a border dispute escalated into clashes that have killed at least two civilians.
Of the six F-16 fighter jets that Thailand readied to deploy along the disputed border, one of the aircraft fired into Cambodia and destroyed a military target, the Thai army said. Both countries accused each other of starting the clash early on Thursday.
“We have used air power against military targets as planned,” Thai army deputy spokesperson Richa Suksuwanon told reporters. Thailand also closed its border with Cambodia.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said the jets dropped two bombs on a road, and that it “strongly condemns the reckless and brutal military aggression of the Kingdom of Thailand against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia”.
 


The skirmishes came after Thailand recalled its ambassador to Cambodia late on Wednesday and said it would expel Cambodia’s envoy in Bangkok, after a second Thai soldier in the space of a week lost a limb to a landmine that Bangkok alleged had been laid recently in the disputed area.
Thailand’s foreign ministry said Cambodian troops fired “heavy artillery” on a Thai military base on Thursday morning and also targeted civilian areas, including a hospital, leading to civilian casualties.
“The Royal Thai Government is prepared to intensify our self-defence measures if Cambodia persists in its armed attack and violations upon Thailand’s sovereignty,” the ministry said in a statement.
Thai residents, including children and the elderly, ran to shelters built of concrete and fortified with sandbags and car tires in the Surin border province.
“How many rounds have been fired? It’s countless,” an unidentified woman told the Thai Public Broadcasting Service (TPBS) while hiding in the shelter as gunfire and explosions were heard intermittently in the background.
Cambodia’s foreign ministry said Thailand’s air strikes were “unprovoked” and called on its neighbour to withdraw its forces and “refrain from any further provocative actions that could escalate the situation”.
For more than a century, Thailand and Cambodia have contested sovereignty at various un-demarcated points along their 817 km land border, which has led to skirmishes over several years and at least a dozen deaths, including during a weeklong exchange of artillery in 2011.
Tensions were reignited in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a brief exchange of gunfire, which escalated into a full-blown diplomatic crisis and now has triggered armed clashes.
Landmines
The clashes began early on Thursday near the disputed Ta Moan Thom temple along the eastern border between Cambodia and Thailand, around 360 km from the Thai capital Bangkok.
“Artillery shell fell on people’s homes,” Sutthirot Charoenthanasak, district chief of Kabcheing in Surin province, told Reuters, describing the firing by the Cambodian side.
“Two people have died,” he said, adding that district authorities had evacuated 40,000 civilians from 86 villages near the border to safer locations.
Thailand’s military said Cambodia deployed a surveillance drone before sending troops with heavy weapons to an area near the temple.
Cambodian troops opened fire and two Thai soldiers were wounded, a Thai army spokesperson said, adding Cambodia had used multiple weapons, including rocket launchers.
A spokesperson for Cambodia’s defence ministry, however, said there had been an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops and Cambodian forces had responded in self-defence.
 


Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said the situation was delicate. “We have to be careful,” he told reporters. “We will follow international law.”
An attempt by Thai premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra to resolve the recent tensions via a call with Cambodia’s influential former Prime Minister Hun Sen, the contents of which were leaked, kicked off a political storm in Thailand, leading to her suspension by a court.
Hun Sen said in a Facebook post that two Cambodian provinces had come under shelling from the Thai military.
Thailand this week accused Cambodia of placing landmines in a disputed area that injured three soldiers. Phnom Penh denied the claim and said the soldiers had veered off agreed routes and triggered a mine left behind from decades of war.
Cambodia has many landmines left over from its civil war decades ago, numbering in the millions according to de-mining groups.
Thailand maintains that landmines have been placed at the border area recently, which Cambodia has described as baseless allegations.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2410020209be788.png?r=135044' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926247/microsoft-says-some-sharepoint-server-hackers-now-using-ransomware' target='_blank'><strong>Microsoft says some SharePoint server hackers now using ransomware</strong></a><br><p>A cyber-espionage campaign centred on vulnerable versions of Microsoft’s server software now involves the deployment of ransomware, Microsoft said in a late Wednesday blog post.
In the post, citing “expanded analysis and threat intelligence”, Microsoft said a group it dubs “Storm-2603” is using the vulnerability to seed the ransomware, which typically works by paralysing victims’ networks until a digital currency payment is made.
The disclosure marks a potential escalation in the campaign, which has already hit at least 400 victims, according to Netherlands-based cybersecurity firm Eye Security.
Unlike typical state-backed hacker campaigns, which are aimed at stealing data, ransomware can cause widespread disruption depending on where it lands.
The figure of 400 victims represents a sharp rise from the 100 organisations catalogued over the weekend. Eye Security says the figure is likely an undercount.
“There are many more, because not all attack vectors have left artefacts that we could scan for,” said Vaisha Bernard, the chief hacker for Eye Security, which was among the first organisations to flag the breaches.
The details of most of the victim organisations have not yet been fully disclosed, but on Wednesday, a representative for the National Institutes of Health confirmed that one of the organisation’s servers had been compromised.
“Additional servers were isolated as a precaution,” he said. The news of the compromise was first reported by the Washington Post.
Other outlets said the hacking campaign had breached an even broader range of US agencies. NextGov, citing multiple people familiar with the matter, reported the Department of Homeland Security had been hit, along with more than five to 12 other agencies.
Politico, which cited two US officials, said multiple agencies were believed to have been breached.
DHS’ cyberdefense arm, CISA, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the reports. Microsoft did not immediately return a message seeking further details on the ransomware angle of the hacking or the reported government victims.
The spy campaign began after Microsoft failed to fully patch a security hole in its SharePoint server software, kicking off a scramble to fix the vulnerability when it was discovered.
Microsoft and its tech rival, Google-owner Alphabet, have both said Chinese hackers are among those taking advantage of the flaw. Beijing has denied the claim.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24122245c9c2584.jpg?r=134444' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926263/india-expulsions-to-bangladesh-unlawful-target-muslims-hrw' target='_blank'><strong>India expulsions to Bangladesh unlawful, target Muslims: HRW</strong></a><br><p>India has pushed hundreds of ethnic Bengali-speaking Muslims into Bangladesh without due process, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday, accusing the government of flouting rules and fuelling bias on religious lines.
The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long taken a hardline stance on immigration — particularly from Muslim-majority Bangladesh — with top authorities referring to them as “termites” and “infiltrators”.
Critics also accuse the government of sparking fear among India’s estimated 200 million Muslims, especially among speakers of Bengali, which is widely spoken in both eastern India and Bangladesh.
HRW, a New York-based nonprofit, said that India forcibly expelled more than 1,500 Muslim men, women, and children to Bangladesh between May 7 and June 15, quoting Bangladeshi authorities.
“India’s ruling BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is fuelling discrimination by arbitrarily expelling Bengali Muslims from the country, including Indian citizens,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at the nonprofit, said.
“The Indian government is putting thousands of vulnerable people at risk in apparent pursuit of unauthorised immigrants, but their actions reflect broader discriminatory policies against Muslims.”
New Delhi insists that the people deported are undocumented migrants.
 
 

However, claims by authorities that the expulsions were to manage illegal immigration were “unconvincing”, Pearson added, because of “their disregard for due process rights, domestic guarantees, and international human rights standards”.
‘They were holding guns’
HRW said that it had sent the report’s findings and questions to the country’s home ministry but had received no response.
The report documented the experiences of 18 people.
A 51-year-old daily wage worker told HRW that he “walked into Bangladesh like a dead body” after India’s Border Security Force (BSF) took him to the border after midnight.
“I thought they (the BSF) would kill me because they were holding guns and no one from my family would know,” the report quotes the worker as saying.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Dhaka’s government, an ally of India.
India also ramped up operations against migrants in the wake of the attack in India-occupied Kashmir in April that killed 26 people, mainly Hindu tourists.
New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of supporting the attack, an allegation denied by Islamabad.
In an unprecedented countrywide security drive, Indian authorities detained thousands, with many of them being eventually pushed across the border to Bangladesh.
“The government is undercutting India’s long history of providing refuge to the persecuted as it tries to generate political support,” Pearson said.
India has also been accused of forcibly deporting Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with navy ships dropping them off the coast of the war-torn nation.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2412581446b8648.jpg?r=130024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926266/plane-carrying-49-crashes-in-russias-far-east-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Plane carrying 49 crashes in Russia’s far east: authorities</strong></a><br><p>A passenger plane carrying 49 people crashed in Russia’s far eastern region of Amur on Thursday, authorities said.
The aircraft, a twin-engine Antonov-24 operated by Angara Airlines, was headed to the town of Tynda from the city of Blagoveshchensk when it disappeared from radar, regional governor Vassily Orlov said on Telegram.
A rescue helicopter later spotted the burning fuselage of the plane on a mountainside about 16 kilometres from Tynda.
 






The helicopter saw no evidence of survivors from above, local rescuers said.
The Amur region’s civil defence agency said it was dispatching rescuers to the scene.
“At the moment, 25 people and five units of equipment have been dispatched, and four aircraft with crews are on standby,” it said.
The incident comes just days after a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital, Dhaka, on Monday, killing 31 and injuring more than 170 people.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241131582952cd7.png?r=113203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926154/bcci-makes-volte-face-decides-to-attend-acc-meeting-virtually' target='_blank'><strong>BCCI makes volte-face, decides to attend ACC meeting virtually</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in a U-turn has decided to attend the Asian Cricket Council’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Thursday, the Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday.
The ACC meeting taking place in Dhaka will decide the fate of this year’s Asia Cup, which India is scheduled to host in September.
Sources within the BCCI have confirmed that the board has indeed decided to attend Thursday’s meeting virtually.
“Yes, we have decided to attend the meeting virtually,” a BCCI source told the Hindustan Times on the condition of anonymity.
Earlier, amid rising political tension between India and Bangladesh, the BCCI decided not to visit Dhaka and threatened to boycott the all-important AGM of the game’s Asian body.
The meeting on Thursday is set to determine the status of the Asia Cup, which is supposed to be played in T20 format. If the tournament gets the go-ahead, it will most likely be played in the UAE, with India maintaining its hosting rights.
Considering the fact that the BCCI and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) — amid strained political relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours that reached new heights after their military clash in May — are not keen on playing on each other’s venues particularly after the 2024 hybrid model reached between the two countries for participation in ICC events, the UAE has emerged as a frontrunner to host the latest edition of the Asia Cup.
Earlier, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) had sided with the BCCI, saying they wouldn’t visit Dhaka for the AGM. Considering the BCCI’s changing stance, the two cricket boards are now also expected to attend the meeting virtually.
The ACC chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), will host the meeting in Dhaka.
Mohsin arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday afternoon, and was greeted by Mohammad Aminul Islam, the chief of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
Published in Dawn, July 24th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-24 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241104128f04d53.jpg?r=110734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926231/punjab-igp-told-to-review-crime-control-department-encounters' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab IGP told to review Crime Control Department encounters</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday directed Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar to review the encounters being carried out by the newly-created Crime Control Department (CCD).
Earlier, in compliance with the court’s order, the police chief appeared before LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum in connection with a woman’s petition against the killing of her son in an alleged CCD encounter.
A report submitted by the IGP stated that the suspect was being taken away after a recovery, when the police vehicle’s tyre punctured and his accomplices launched an attack. It said the suspect was killed by the firing of his own accomplices.
 
 

The chief justice said the IGP was summoned after the SHO concerned failed to satisfy the court. She found the IGP’s report complete and satisfactory.
However, the chief justice questioned, “Whenever there is firing on a police vehicle, how does the bullet directly hit a suspect? Why it never hits a constable or the police vehicle?”
She mentioned that the LHC was receiving 50 petitions daily regarding fake police encounters. She observed that the current wave of CCD encounters must be assessed.
Chief Justice Neelum directed the IGP to conduct a thorough review of the ongoing encounters. She instructed the police chief to sit with senior officers and ensure that such fake encounters were not repeated in the future.
The CJ disposed of the petition by Farhat Bibi.
 
 

The petitioner’s counsel had stated that his client’s two sons, Ghazanfar Aslam and Ansar Aslam, were arrested by Sharqpur police. He said that Ghazanfar was killed in a fake encounter on April 22 and there was a serious threat to the life of the petitioner’s other son.
He argued that ever since the CCD was established, all police encounters followed the same scripted pattern.

• Rules that infertility, even if present, is no ground to deny woman dower or  maintenance
ISLAMABAD: The Supr­e­me Court on Wednesday denounced the distressing and sorrowful social practice of ‘weaponising’ infertility, or even the mere suspicion of it, against women.
“This social prejudice routinely results in courts of law becoming venues for humiliating a woman under the guise of litigation,” regretted Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi.
The CJP, who was part of a two-judge bench alongside Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, was remarking on a case filed by one Saleh Muhammad against a March 3, 2025, judgement of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), regarding a dispute over dower claims, dowry articles and maintenance of the respondent, Mehnaz Begum.
“This court cannot but record in the strongest possible terms its disapproval of the manner in which the respondent — a woman already abandoned, denied maintenance and left to the mercy of litigation — was subjected to repeated, invasive and demeaning scrutiny of her very personhood at the behest of a frivolous and cruel defence,” Justice Afridi bemoaned.
Saleh Muhammad and Mehnaz Begum married in 2006, but in 2007, the woman was left at her parental home after allegedly enduring physical abuse at the hands of the petitioner.
The husband then went abroad, severed all communication, refused to provide maintenance and effectively abandoned her within a year of their marriage. Three years later, he remarried and has two children from that union.
Left with no other recourse, Mehnaz Begum initiated legal proceedings in 2015 for the recovery of her dower, dowry articles and maintenance.
No ground to challenge ‘womanhood’
Rather than contesting the claim on any credible grounds, the petitioner pursued a defence alleging the respondent was medically unfit for conjugal duties or to bear children, thus questioning her status as a “female” under the law. This claim was rejected by subsequent medical tests, but the petitioner continued to deny her dower and maintenance on this basis.
“While it is possible that the petitioner viewed this as a genuine grievance or felt wronged in some manner, the manner in which this allegation, targeting the very identity of the respondent, was pursued remains troubling,” the Supreme Court noted.
“It was pressed persistently and aggressively through three tiers of judicial scrutiny, unnecessarily so given that all forums rendered findings effectively refuting it, thereby subjecting the respondent to what this Court recognises as profound personal humiliation,” it added.
In the seven-page order, the CJP emphasised that it must be acknowledged without equivocation that infertility, even if present, was no ground to deny a woman her dower or maintenance and it was certainly no ground to challenge her womanhood.
 
 

“To convert such personal pain into a legal weapon is not only an abuse of the process, but an affront to human dignity that should not be enabled,” he said.
“It also bears emphasis that our religion and culture treat the marital bond as a sacred covenant. The Holy Quran has described the spouse as a garment; the relationship between a husband and wife is likened to that of libaas in our religion,” the CJP said, stressing that the ideals of protection, mutual respect and dignity in marriage must not be compromised in any event.
“Lest we forget: women in our society constitute a vulnerable group, whose dignity requires vigilant protection and care,” he observed.
Fine to be paid to ‘wronged’ woman
The courts could not, and would not, be passive venues for the perpetuation of social prejudices that harm women and subject them to one trauma after another, CJP Yahya said.
“It is not a matter of judicial discretion but of constitutional and moral obligation that the personal dignity of all who appear before the courts be duly safeguarded, particularly where the power imbalance between the parties is so manifest,” he added.
The CJP said that in the present case, the petitioner has not merely wasted judicial time, he has caused a woman already in a position of vulnerability to suffer degradation and trauma over the course of protracted litigation in three forums spread over a decade. “This court would be remiss in its duty were it to allow such conduct to pass without sanction,” he said.
The court dismissed the petition and imposed a Rs500,000 fine, payable to the respondent, as a show of strong disapproval for the petitioner’s conduct.
“It is hoped this order serves as a reminder to all litigants and counsel that the dignity of every individual, particularly women, must be respected in all judicial proceedings,” the CJP noted, adding that frivolous allegations attacking the dignity of a woman would not be countenanced in any court of law.

The EHP, which takes effect on Aug 1, will remain in force for one year and is renewable. It also allows for the future inclusion of additional items, making it the first tangible step towards launching negotiations on a comprehensive PTA.
The agreement was signed by Pakistan’s Commerce Secretary, Jawad Paul, and Afghanistan’s Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, Mullah Ahmadullah Zahid, who was accompanied by a delegation of senior technical officials. The Afghan delegation arrived in Islamabad on Monday night to hold detailed negotiations with Pakistan’s Ministry of Commerce.
Under the agreement, tariffs on four Afghan agricultural exports to Pakistan — grapes, pomegranates, apples, and tomatoes — and four Pakistani exports to Afghanistan — mangoes, kinnows, bananas, and potatoes — will be reduced to 27pc, down from over 60pc previously.
A senior official at the Ministry of Commerce told Dawn the agreement will serve as a catalyst for reviving formal PTA negotiations, which had been dormant for nearly a decade. “We will now resume talks to discuss the details of the PTA,” the official added.
In 2014, both countries agreed to initiate PTA talks, and Pakistan subsequently shared a draft agreement. However, progress stalled when the Afghan side, under then-President Ashraf Ghani, linked further talks to allowing the import of Indian goods via the Wagah border — a proposal repeatedly rejected by Islamabad. As a result, negotiations remained suspended in the following years.
In the meantime, Pakistan has taken several steps to facilitate bilateral trade, including offering transactions in Pakistani rupees and allowing limited barter trade in the wake of Afghanistan’s banking crisis.
Official data shows that Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan surged 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25, up from $558.03m in the previous fiscal year. Imports from Afghanistan more than doubled to $25.89m from $11.96m in FY24, an increase of 116.47pc.Pakistan’s key export to Afghanistan this year has been sugar, with over 700,000 tonnes shipped in the past four months alone.

• Questions ‘free movement’ of terrorists across Pakistan-Afghanistan border
• MYC moot opposes two-state solution to Palestine issue, Abraham Accords
ISLAMABAD: Calling the merger of erstwhile Fata into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a “mistake”, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday expressed his tacit support for its rollback, which is reportedly being discussed in power corridors.
Speaking at a meeting of the Milli Yakjehti Council, the JUI-F leader said he opposed the marger, alleging that the move was an attempt to bring about geographic changes in the region and implement an ‘American agenda’.
The event was chaired by Allama Sajid Ali Naqvi. While Maulana Fazl was invited as the chief guest; his party is not a member of the MYC.
“We had opposed the Fata merger at the time, and our stance was clear that it was a mistake,” the JUI-F chief said. “Now, even the provincial government admits that the decision to merge was not correct and they are talking about forming a commission in this regard,” he claimed.
He added that the situation is that the tribal people were dying in their homes due to militancy, and there were talks of reversing the merger. “But if you now want to reverse it or create a new province, you will need a two-thirds majority in both provincial and national assemblies as well as the Senate,” Maulana Fazl said.
While condemning the armed struggle against the state, the JUI-F chief said that ‘elimination of terrorism’ was far from reality, as the government’s writ did not exist in the restive provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This lawlessness, is it due to the incompetence of state institutions, or is it being done deliberately,” the Maulana asked. He said operations against terrorism took place from Swat to Waziristan, but those who were displaced due to these anti-terror operations were still homeless.
He questioned how the terrorists were able to move freely between Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying that the state must not shift the burden of its failures onto others.
Stressing that the Federal Shariat Court had set Dec 31, 2027, as the final deadline for the abolition of the interest-based (Riba) economy, he urged religious parties to keep an eye on this deadline.
Palestine, Abraham Accords
The meeting rejected the two-state solution to the Pales­tine issue and the Abraham Accords, demanding that the government of Pakistan must clearly state its position on both matters. It is important to note that Pakistan does not recognise Israel but has always advocated for the two-state solution.
The resolution of the conference demanded immediate humanitarian assistance for Gaza. It officially opposed the normalisation deals made between some Muslim nations and Israel, calling them a betrayal of Palestinians. The meeting also warned the government against joining the Abraham Accords — being brokered by the West. The gathering strongly condemned the atrocities committed by Israel and India in Palestine and Kashmir and expressed full solidarity with the oppressed peoples.
The meeting also declared the so-called “honour killings” as un-Islamic, while referring to the recent killings in Balochistan.
The conference called for enhanced defence, scientific, economic, and diplomatic cooperation between Turkiye, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to collectively face the challenges confronting the Muslim world.
Maulana Fazl raised concerns over a recent Islama­bad High Court verdict related to blasphemy laws, stressing that the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) rulings must be protected constitutionally.
It was referring to the IHC’s decision related to the alleged blasphemy cases. The MYC formed an action committee, comprising representatives of all religious parties, to look into the matter.

• Claims 63pc work done with estimated spending of Rs84bn
• Wattoo visits project site, reiterates govt commitment for early completion
KARACHI / THATTA: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) on Wednesday made it clear that the timely completion of the long-delayed Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, commonly known as K-IV, depended on uninterrupted supply of funds.
In a fresh assessment that comes just weeks after the federal government allocated only Rs3.2 billion against the Rs40bn required for the scheme in the current budget, the authority in a statement said: “Overall physical progress stands at 63 per cent, while a sum of Rs86.4 billion has so far been spent on construction of the project. The Phase-I is planned to be completed in 2026, provided the required funds are made accordingly.”
The assertion came during Federal Minister for Water Resources Moeen Khan Wattoo’s visit to the project site. He was briefed during the visit that construction work on all components of the project is in progress at a satisfactory pace.
 
 

Accompanied by Parliamentary Secretary for Water Resources Rana Ansar, Sindh Provincial Minister for Energy, Planning and Development Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, former senator Nehal Hashmi and Wapda Chairman Naveed Asghar Chaudhry, the federal minister reviewed the progress on the scheme.
Member Water Syed Ali Akhtar Shah, general manager of the K-IV Project Amir Mughal, along with representatives of contractors and consultants, were also present.
The Wapda statement said the visited locations included intake structure and pumping stations being developed at Keenjhar Lake, the pressurised pipeline forming the main water conveyance system from Keenjhar to Karachi, water reservoirs and filtration plants on the city outskirts.
Expressing satisfaction over the pace of work, Mr Wattoo reaffirmed the federal government’s full backing for the K-IV project.
The project, originally launched in the early 2000s to address Karachi’s chronic water supply problems, has witnessed multiple revisions, cost escalations, and bureaucratic hurdles.
Despite renewed attention of the federal government in recent years, the latest budget allocation cast dark shadow on its future. Last month the federal government’s allocation of just Rs3.2bn sparked fears that the city may have to wait for “another 10 years” or more for the completion of the plan.
“The K-IV is a vital scheme for Karachi, and its early completion remains one of the top priorities of the Ministry of Water Resources,” the statement quoted the federal minister as saying.
 
 

The minister stressed the need for stronger coordination among stakeholders to eliminate any hurdles in the project’s implementation. He directed the consultants and contractors to strictly adhere to the project’s quality standards.
The project is designed to supply an additional 650 million gallons per day (MGD) to Karachi. The initiative is being executed in two phases: Phase-I aims to provide 260 MGD, while Phase-II will add another 390 MGD upon execution.
Currently, Wapda is implementing Phase-I through eight separate contract packages awarded to a mix of local and international contractors.

In a sweeping deal that will restore the prestigious New York institution’s federal monies, Columbia has pledged to obey rules that bar it from taking race into consideration in admissions or hiring, among other concessions.
“Columbia University has reached an agreement with the United States government to resolve multiple federal agency investigations into alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws,” a statement said, adding that the $200m would be paid over three years.
The university will also pay $21m to settle investigations brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it said.
“Under today’s agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 will be reinstated and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,” the statement said.
The promise of the federal funding spigot reopening offers relief for the university, which was under growing financial pressure, despite a comfortable endowment and a reputation it can bank on.
The agreement also represents a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly claimed elite universities brainwash students against his nationalist ideas with left-wing bias.
Thanking Columbia for “agreeing to do what is right,” Trump warned in a social media post that “numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust… are upcoming.”
The centuries-old Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is also in a fight with the administration over Trump’s threats to rip away federal funding, and Wednesday’s carefully worded agreement — in which Columbia admitted no wrongdoing — could offer a framework for future deals.
“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said.
“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.
“Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”
Disciplinary actions
Under the settlement, Columbia will maintain a security force to prevent demonstrations in academic spaces, such as those that rocked the campus last year when pro-Palestinian protestors clashed with law enforcement and occupied university buildings.
The school also agreed to “promptly provide” federal authorities with any requested information on “disciplinary actions involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia is aware of for criminal activity, including trespass or other violation of law.”
Columbia found itself at the centre of a firestorm last year over claims of anti-Semitism triggered by campus protests against Israel’s conflict in Gaza.
Some Jewish students claimed they were intimidated and that authorities did not act to protect them.
The school announced a wave of various student punishments on Tuesday, including expulsions and degree revocations, against nearly 80 students involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement that has called on the university to divest from Israel.
“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community,” Columbia said in a statement about student protests on its campus.
“Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”
While the university appears to be acquiescing to the Trump administration’s demands to quash student protest, one of the most prominent leaders of the US pro-Palestinian campus protests is still raising his voice.
Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate active in campus demonstrations, has sued the Trump administration for $20m over his arrest and detention by immigration agents.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who is married to a US citizen, missed the birth of his son while being held in a federal immigration detention centre in Louisiana.
He called the lawsuit a “first step towards accountability.”</p><small>2025-07-24 04:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24093626e2a3bc2.png?r=093824' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926171/senate-panel-slams-outdated-systems-poor-planning-for-monsoon-losses' target='_blank'><strong>Senate panel slams outdated systems, poor planning for monsoon losses</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday warned that Pakistan’s recent monsoon disasters are “not a one-off tragedy” and blamed unregulated construction, outdated early warning systems, and a lack of critical data from ministries for worsening the climate fallout.
Chairing a Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change meeting in Islamabad, Senator Rehman highlighted Pakistan’s climate crisis, with devastating floods and depleting groundwater exacerbated by poor planning and outdated technology.
“This is not a one-off tragedy — this is climate change in motion, and Pakistan is ranked number one in climate vulnerability,” Senator Rehman said.
 






She noted that from June 26 to July 22, 242 people were killed and 598 were injured in weather-related incidents. “In just the past 24 hours, 21 people have died and six were injured,” she said.

Recent catastrophes are ‘climate change in motion’, warns Sherry Rehman

Ms Rehman condemned unplanned construction in natural waterways, which she said led to preventable deaths and destruction of infrastructure in areas like Saidpur Village and DHA Rawalpindi.
“We cannot call this a natural disaster anymore,” she said.
“That absolves us of responsibility. These are human-induced disasters fueled by poor planning and inaction in the face of climate change.” The committee highlighted that Pakistan lacks a modern early warning system, relying on technology from 1912 while other nations use AI-ena­bled systems for real-time alerts.
“We are still using a 1912 model to issue warnings,” Ms Rehman said.
On country’s severe water crisis, Senator Rehman noted that no ministry could provide a map of Pakistan’s groundwater extraction on any scale.
Officials from the water resource ministry were also unable to provide data on per capita surface water consumption or a precise count of active tube wells for agriculture.
The number of tube wells grew from 160,000 in 1975-76 to 1.39 million by 2017-18, dramatically increasing the rate of groundwater depletion, officials reported.
“For a country that has been declared water scarce by the UN this year, no evidence of harvesting water in Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) or other planning, especially while we go through a torrential monsoon,” Ms Rehman said.
“It was a completely fragmen­ted and inadequate response.”
She expressed dismay that no meaningful work was being done on recharge wells or other rainwater conservation methods.
“The world is prioritising this, but in Pakistan, we are stuck in inertia,” she said.
“There’s no current status of water storage; institutions are merely engaging in dialogue while the ground realities worsen.” The committee directed provincial authorities to present up-to-date reports and action plans on groundwater conditions, tube well regulation, and rainwater harvesting at its next meeting.
Land in Balochistan and Chi­tral has already turned barren due to water shortages, the committee noted.
The meeting was attended by senators Bushra Anj­um Butt, Falak Naz, Syed Waqar Mehdi, and Shahadat Awan, along with senior officials from the Ministry of Climate Change and Environ­mental Coordination, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Federal Flood Commission.

Sherbaz Satakzai.

QUETTA: An anti-terrorism court in Quetta on Wednesday extended the physical remand of Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai and Bashir Ahmed for 10 more days in a case pertaining to the brutal killing of a man and a woman in the Dagari mines area of Quetta district, in the name of ‘honour’.
Bano Bibi Satakzai and Ehsan Samalani were killed on June 4 on the order of a local jirga, and a video of the incident went viral over the weekend. After their arrests, the court initially remanded the suspects in police custody for two days on Monday.
After the expiry of the remand on Wednesday, they were produced before the ATC under strict security. The Serious Crimes Inves­ti­gation Wing Quetta officer requested an extension of the physical remand for further investigation for 15 days. However, the court ordered a 10-day extension in the remand.
Meanwhile, Balochistan police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari told Dawn that 15  arrests had been made in the case. The police chief said efforts were underway to arrest the primary suspect, Jalal, the brother of the slain woman. He said several raids had been conducted and the police were using technology to make further arrests.

Video message
On the other hand, a viral video — which could not be independently verified by Dawn — purportedly showed the mother of the slain woman holding the Holy Quran in her hands.
The woman, speaking in Brahvi, said she was the mother of the slain woman and claimed that the deceased had five children, ranging from 6 to 18 years old. She claimed that the victim eloped with her neighbour and she was killed in line with “Baloch traditions”.
She added that her husband forgave her after her return, but the man she ran off with allegedly threatened them and “did not stop”. Addressing Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, she asked why their homes were being raided by the police.
“Whatever we did, we did in the name of honour. We have not committed any sin,” she said in her video message.
Earlier this week, police arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of the man and a woman shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha.
The horrific video of the incident went viral on Sunday, prompting a countrywide outcry, and the Balochistan Assembly also passed a joint resolution against the killings.

Presiding over a meeting to review progress SOE privatisation, the PM underlined that the privatisation of loss-making national enterprises was essential for the improvement and development of the country’s economy, whereas it was the government’s top priority to carry out the privatisation process effectively, comprehensively and efficiently.
He had directed the quarters concerned to make sure that all legal steps and transparency requirements should be fulfilled in the privatisation of selected enterprises.
 







Gives Privatisation Commission full autonomy to ‘remove red tape’ in SOEs’ denationalisation

“Illegal occupation of valuable land of national institutions is unacceptable under any circumstances. However, every possible precaution should be taken in the disposal of valuable land owned by national institutions during the privatisation process,” he added.
PM Shehbaz in his special directives, during the meeting, underlined that the phased privatisation targets of the aforementioned institutions should be set according to the economic environment of the market so that the national exchequer could be protected from possible losses at all costs.
“All decisions should be implemented fully and effectively. I will regularly monitor the progress of the ongoing work in the Privatisation Commission. More­over, the consultation of professional experts and international standards should be maintained in the privatisation process and restructuring of institutions,” the prime minister said.
During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the progress of privatisation of institutions included in the privatisation list in 2024.
The commission officials briefed that the phased privatisation of selected institutions was designed keeping in view the legal, financial and sectoral requirements.
Moreover, phased privatisation of selected institutions would be completed within the stipulated time frame as per the cabinet-approved programme and the denationalisation of all institutions on the privatisation list — including PIA and power transmission companies (Discos) — would be completed in accordance with the set economic, institutional and administrative targets.

According to the Henley Passport Index for 2025, Pakistan currently ranks 96th on the list — ahead of the war-torn nations of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
Although still quite low, the country’s ranking has improved slightly; in 2024, the Pakistani passport was tied with Yemen as the fourth-worst in the world for the fourth consecutive year.
The Henley Passport Index compares the visa-free access of 199 different passports to 227 travel destinations, and ranks all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.

Singapore, Japan and South Korea top the list; Afghanistan placed at the bottom

If no visa is required, then that passport is given a score value of 1. The same applies if you can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination.
Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value of 0 is assigned. This also applies if you need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival.
The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required.
Singapore occupies the top spot, with Japan and South Korea sharing second place on the index. Seven EU passports share 3rd place — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.
Another seven-nation Euro­pean cohort are joint 4th — Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Neth­erlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Meanwhile, New Zealand is tied for 5th place with Greece and Switzerland.
The UK and US have each dropped a place in the global passport rankings since January, continuing a long-term downward trend. Once the most powerful passports in the world — the UK in 2015 and the US in 2014 — they now rank 6th and 10th, respectively.
India has recorded the largest jump in ranking over the past six months, climbing eight places from 85th to 77th. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made the biggest gain in visa-free access.
The UAE continues to be a standout among the top risers, shooting up 34 places over the last 10 years from 42nd to 8th place, making it the only big riser to break into the Top 10 in the ranking.
Another notable country is China, also rising 34 places from 94th to 60th since 2015 — particularly impressive considering that it has not yet gained visa-free access to Europe’s Schengen Area.

• Journalist, family among 100 more killed in strikes
• Over 100 aid, rights groups say mass starvation is spreading in Gaza
GAZA: Israel’s President Isaac Herzog visited the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and told soldiers that there were “intensive negotiations about returning” the Israeli prisoners in Gaza, adding that he hopes that they will soon “hear good news”, a statement from the Israeli president’s spokesperson reported.
In a related development, the Palestinian group Hamas submitted its response to an Israeli proposal for a 60-day Gaza ceasefire on Wednesday, according to two Palestinian sources familiar with ongoing talks in Doha.
The response included proposed amendments to clauses on the entry of aid, maps of areas from which the Israeli army should withdraw, and guarantees on securing a permanent end to the war.
Negotiators from both sides have been holding indirect talks in Qatar with mediators in an attempt to reach an agreement on a truce deal.
But the talks have dragged on for more than two weeks without a breakthrough, with each side blaming the other for refusing to budge on their key demands.
For Israel, dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities is non-negotiable, while Hamas demands firm guarantees on a lasting truce, a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and the free flow of aid into Gaza.
The United States said special envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Europe this week for talks on Gaza, and might visit the Middle East afterwards.
Witkoff was departing with the “strong hope that we will come forward with another ceasefire as well as a humanitarian corridor for aid to flow, that both sides have in fact agreed to”, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said.
Journalist among 100 killed
Meanwhile, freelance journalist Wala al-Jaabari, her husband and their five children, were among more than 100 people killed in 24 hours of Israeli strikes or gunfire. The journalist’s family went to bed hungry at their home in Gaza City. Their corpses lay in white shrouds outside their bombed home on Wednesday with their names scribbled in pen. Blood seeped through the shrouds as they lay there, staining them red.
“This is my cousin. He was 10. We dug them out of the rubble,” said Amr al-Shaer, holding one of the bodies after retrieving it.
Iman al-Shaer, another relative who lives nearby, said the family had not eaten anything before the bombs came down. “The children slept without food,” he said.
Relatives said some neighbours were spared only because they had been out searching for food at the time of the strike.
More die of starvation
Ten more Palestinians died overnight from starvation, the Gaza health ministry said, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death to 111, most of them in recent weeks as a wave of hunger crashes on the Palestinian enclave.
In a statement on Wednesday, 111 organ­isations, including Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Refugees International, said mass starvation was spreading even as tons of food, clean water and medical supplies sit untouched just outside Gaza, where aid groups are blocked from accessing them.
Israel has cut off all supplies to Gaza from the start of March and reopened it with new restrictions in May.
The United Nations and aid groups trying to deliver food to Gaza say Israel, which controls everything that comes in and out, is choking delivery, and Israeli troops have shot hundreds of Palestinians dead seeking aid at aid collection points since May.
“We have a minimum set of requirements to be able to operate inside Gaza,” Ross Smith, the director of emergencies at the UN World Food Programme.

• Proposes six-point plan, including immediate ceasefire, aid access, reconstruction, and two-state solution
• Palestinian envoy highlights starvation deaths of children, mass destruction across occupied territory
• US envoy urges Hamas to accept ceasefire deal; Israeli envoy says no more visas for UN officials
WASHINGTON: Presi­d­ing over a charged debate at the UN Security Council on the worsening situation in Gaza, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar warned that the world is witnessing “a genocide in Gaza, in full view of the international community — one that the UN seems unable or unwilling to stop.”
The Security Council session on the Middle East saw urgent calls from many representatives to end the violence and protect civilians trapped in Gaza. The crisis is deepening with growing displacement, food shortages, and widespread destruction.
Senator Dar told the Council that the systematic targeting of hospitals, schools, UN facilities, aid convoys, and refugee camps in Gaza were not accidents but “deliberate acts of collective punishment.”
“The Palestinian question is a litmus test for the credibility of the United Nations, the Security Council and the integrity of the international law,” he said. “Failure to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people will embolden impunity and undermine the legitimacy of the very international order we all claim to uphold.”
 






Six-point plan
The foreign minister proposed a six-point plan to end the crisis, including: (1) an immediate and unconditional ceasefire; (2) sustained and secure humanitarian access and protection for aid workers; (3) renewed international support for UNRWA; (4) an end to forced displacement and illegal settlements; (5) implementation of an Arab-Islamic-led plan for Gaza’s reconstruction; and (6) a revived political process for a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
He welcomed the International Conference on the two-state solution, scheduled for July 28 in Paris and to be co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, as a crucial step toward peace.
“Gaza has become graveyards for innocent lives,” he warned, adding: “The Palestinian question is a litmus test for the credibility of the United Nations, the Security Council and the integrity of the international law.”
He emphasised that “failure to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people will embolden impunity and undermine the legitimacy of the very international order we all claim to defend and uphold”.
‘Unimaginable suffering’
Palestinian Permanent Observer Riyad Mansour delivered a searing statement, describing the unimaginable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He began by saying: “I speak with a broken heart and a wounded soul.”
He recounted the recent deaths of a four-year-old girl, Razan, and a six-week-old baby, Yousef, who died from starvation, alongside fifteen others, within the past 24 hours. “Children in Gaza are not starving, they are being starved,” he said.
Mr Mansour accused Israel of destroying everything: homes, schools, mosques, churches, hospitals, water networks, roads, infrastructure, cemeteries, and even aid convoys. He said 80 per cent of Gaza’s population has been forcibly displaced and warned that Israel’s end goal was “the destruction of the two million Palestinians remaining in Gaza.” He urged the Security Council to act, warning that “every day you delay action, you sign more death warrants.” He concluded by asking the world: “What would you do if this was your child dying of hunger?”
Israel to turn away UN workers
Israel’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Danny Danon, defended his government’s actions, anno­uncing that Israel will no longer renew the visas of certain UN humanitarian staff in Gaza. He claimed that hundreds of United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) employees are being vetted for alleged links to Hamas, and that “key personnel” will be denied visa renewals.
Danon said Israel had informed the UN that the head of OCHA’s office in the occupied Palestinian territory must leave by July 29.  “Enough with the hypocrisy, enough with the bias, enough with the endless defamation campaign against the State of Israel,” he said.
He dismissed UN casualty figures and statistics on aid delivery as distortions. “Israel is making the Middle East safer for everyone who values peace and calm,” he claimed, adding that “we are doing the work of the United Nations” by dismantling terror networks.
Khaled Khiari, Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, updated the Council on the scale of destruction, reporting nearly 1,900 Palestinians killed since June 30, including nearly 300 while collecting aid. He said Israeli bombardments have damaged or destroyed UN facilities and displaced tens of thousands of civilians. He called Gaza “a nightmare of historic proportions.”
Denmark’s Permanent Representative, Christina Markus Lassen, condemned the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, noting that the population has been squeezed into “less than 14 per cent of the territory.” She warned that for many civilians, “their reality is one of imminent death by hostilities, starvation or disease.”
Russia’s delegate accused the United States of “cowboy diplomacy” and warned that unconditional US support for Israel was blocking peace. He said lasting stability would never be achieved unless Israel accepted the two-state solution and learned to live peacefully with its neighbors.
‘Accept deal on the table’
Meanwhile, Acting US Ambassador to the United Nations Dorothy Shea appealed to the UN Security Council today, insisting that “Hamas must accept the deal on the table”—a ceasefire proposal already agreed upon by Israel. She asserted that any delay risks further suffering for hostages, their families, and civilians in Gaza living under Hamas’s control.
During the session, Shea urged global leaders to apply pressure on Hamas to release the 50 prisoners still held after more than 650 days and to withdraw and disarm from Gaza. “Shielding Hamas from accountability undermines Israel’s security, rewards terrorism, and does nothing to improve the lives of Palestinians,” she declared.
Shea also firmly rejected accusations that Israel’s military actions constitute genocide. “The loss of civilian life in Gaza is tragic, but the responsibility for this rests with Hamas,” she stated. On the subject of Palestinian displacement, she clarified that the US does not support any forced removal of Gazans from their land.

• Secretary claims production declined despite increase in cultivation area; no buffer stock exists
• Minister warns mills, says hoarding won’t be tolerated; crackdown underway
ISLAMABAD: As a nationwide crackdown on sugar hoarders is underway, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has raised serious concerns over mismanagement in the sugar sector, loan defaults by mills, and large-scale irregularities involving public institutions.
During its sitting on Wedn­esday, National Food Security Secretary Amir Mohyuddin revealed that although the area under sugarcane cultivation increased this year, overall production had declined compared to the previous year.
Out of 82 registered sugar mills, only 79 participated in the crushing season, which typically begins in November. The secretary admitted that Pakistan currently has no buffer stock of sugar, and a summary has been sent to import 500,000 tons, of which 300,000 tons are already planned.
Committee members, particularly Riaz Fatyana and Junaid Akbar, criticised what they descr­ibed as a “massive sugar cartel” that manipulates supply and prices.
Mr Fatyana asked why 7.5 million metric tons of sugar were allowed to be exported, alleging it was done to artificially inflate local prices.
He also questioned the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for issuing a Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) that reduced the sales tax on sugar imports. “This export was designed for profiteering,” he claimed.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan condemned the influence of sugar barons, stating, “These mill owners are part of every government. Why is the International Monetary Fund (IMF) silent on their profiteering?”
He questioned why tax exemptions were given to sugar importers while the general public was denied relief. FBR officials responded that the tax exemption was a cabinet decision and the board acted on official instructions.
MNA Naveed Qamar argued that the government should refrain from intervening in the sugar market. “Every time the government steps in, things get worse. Bureaucracy cannot run markets,” he said, adding that two main cartels — sugar and fertiliser — continue to operate without oversight.
MNA Shazia Marri demanded a report detailing how much subsidy was granted to sugar mills over the past five years and identifying the top beneficiaries. The committee also expressed dissatisfaction with the composition and transparency of the Sugar Advisory Board and directed the Ministry of Industries to attend the next meeting and clarify decisions related to sugar export and import, as the Ministry of Food Security claimed it had no access to that data.
But despite the government’s best efforts, the sugar crisis persists. In this backdrop, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain warned all sugar mills that are not releasing their existing stocks and hoarding them, will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
In a meeting with representatives of the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and other key stakeholders, he directed provincial governments to ensure the timely lifting of sugar from mills and to facilitate its smooth transportation to markets.
He stated that a nationwide crackdown is currently underway against those disrupting the sugar supply chain. Expressing serious concern over the artificial increase in sugar prices, the minister warned of strict action against hoarders.
Meanwhile, a press release from the Ministry of National Food Security noted that sugar prices have started to decline significantly—from Rs200 per kilogram to Rs175 per kilogram—as a result of the government’s crackdown.

GILGIT: Thousands of people, including foreign tourists, remai­ned stranded at multiple locations in Gilgit-Baltistan due to blocked roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), due to landslides. Mobile and internet services across the region were also disrupted after fibre optic cables were damaged in several areas.
Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq confirmed that KKH is blocked at Achar Nallah in the Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Thousands of passengers, including tourists, travelling to and from GB are stranded on both sides of the highway.
He said that while KKH has been reopened for traffic within GB, restoration work is underway in Kohistan. The Babusar Pass Road is also blocked at several locations.
Mr Faraq assured that all tourists stranded on the Babusar route have been safely evacuated and search operations for missing individuals are underway. Those rescued from Babusar Pass have been brought to Chilas, where local hoteliers and government authorities have arranged complimentary accommodation.
The mobile and internet communication systems in the region were severely damaged, leaving the majority of residents without service for up to six hours on Wednesday. The region’s communication system relies on an optical fibre cable connecting GB with Rawalpindi.
According to the Special Commu­nications Organisation (SCO), recent flash floods in Babusar Valley caused significant damage to the main optical fibre cable. Emergency alternative satellite arrangements were made, but consumers faced slow mobile and internet connectivity. Mr Faraq said that work has begun to restore the communication system.
Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Sadia Danish expressed concern over the safety of 40 individuals stranded in Danyore’s Manogah Nallah in Gilgit. In a statement, she urged the government to initiate a helicopter rescue operation immediately.
Ms Danish emphasised tha protecting human lives should remain the top priority and recognised the efforts of the provincial government, the Pakistan Army, volunteers and residents in the rescue operations during the flood emergency.
She also commended the generosity of residents, who opened their homes, mosques, imambargahs and hotels to shelter stranded tourists.
Moreover, river erosion caused the collapse of the Hotu suspension bridge in Shigar, cutting off the only access to the K2 base camp. A large number of foreign expedition members and trekkers were stranded, while eight villages were also disconnected.
Officials from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said that a C130 sortie will be arranged from Gilgit to Islamabad to airlift stranded travellers.
Stranded tourists are expected to receive airlifts free of charge on Thursday (today) in an operation overseen by Gilgit’s additional deputy commissioner.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has assured that the rescue operations will continue until all stranded people in Babusar are rescued.
He also declared the flood-affected areas of Thaki, Niyat, Khunra and Thor in Diamer as disaster zones. He also announced that the families of those who died in the floods at Babusar will receive death compensation under the government policy.
The chief minister ordered urgent measures to restore drinking water, electricity, irrigation channels and road communications in the flood-affected areas of Thor. He also visited the flood-affected areas to oversee the recovery efforts along with Adviser on Forests Haji Shah Baig and GB Minister for Agriculture Engineer Anwar.
