<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6879b93a8f514.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924925/a-real-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>A real crisis</strong></a><br><p>THE real estate sector in Pakistan is a microcosm of our political-economic system at large. Everyone knows that the rot is glaringly deep, but those who control the reins of power are so invested in status quo that they consciously allow it to fester with no end. Flash floods in the twin cities over the past few days have once again laid bare this ugly reality.
Cases in point are the coveted Bahria Town and DHA housing schemes in Rawalpindi, some sectors of which were completely submerged by raging waters. In the current season, there have been similar scenes in the concrete jungle that is Lahori suburbia. A couple of years ago, rain in Karachi turned celebrated gated housing schemes built on reclaimed land into swamplands.
It is misleading to put all this down to more rain. The effects of planetary climate change notwithstanding, the fundamental problem is that our metropolitan cities and even smaller towns have become complete hostages to real estate moguls, and gated housing schemes in particular. The officials that supposedly plan the process of urbanisation have effectively become auctioneers invested in speculative property markets.
For the umpteenth time: the vast majority of gated housing schemes cause a warped kind of urban sprawl that wipes out agriculture and/or coastal ecologies, blocks natural drainage systems, and exacerbates heat island effects due to the excessive use of concrete and asphalt — all of which directly trigger flash floods like the ones that we are witnessing again.

Millions who need housing are deprived of it.

There are, of course, many other domestic causes, but the real estate sector is arguably the single biggest contributor to urban flooding. And with each passing year, it becomes clearer that profiteers continue to make merry irrespective of long-run impacts.
Let me reiterate yet another well-known effect of these schemes: they sacrifice the basic housing and other needs of the working poor. There is an immense crisis of housing in urban Pakistan; the State Bank estimates a shortfall of 10 million housing units. Every year, the gap between the supply of housing and demand for it grows exponentially.
The cruel irony is that the real estate sector is indeed supplying housing units — but only for the rich and those aspiring to the extremely vague category of the ‘middle class’. The overwhelming majority of those who need housing in cities and towns falls into neither of these categories, and gated housing schemes actually dispossess a significant number of working families in the peri-urban areas of their homes in historical villages and/or self-made katchi abadis.
In contrast, a large number of units in gated housing schemes remain unoccupied, even when they are sold from one investor to the next. In other words, there is a glut of housing units which do not serve their intended purpose, while millions who need housing are deprived of it. A related development is that of commercial real estate, like plazas, which are also often unoccupied even as the circuit of profit grows. This absurdity is what we call financialised capitalism.
This past budget season we were fed soundbites that long-awaited restrictions would finally be imposed on the real estate sector. There were rumours of a meaningful taxation regime, along with more stringent environmental regulations. Unsurprisingly, nothing of substance actually came to pass.
There are many young Pakistanis for whom acquiring a plot in a gated housing scheme and the requisite lifestyle that it engenders is amongst one of life’s major goals. This is only natural in a society like ours, where atomisation is intensifying and there is immense ap­­peal of a ‘secure’ life away from the increasingly chaotic — and vi­­olent — everyday life.
There is nothing wrong with young people aspiring to an idyllic existence in which their basic material and recreational needs are met. But it is a matter of fact that the aspirations sold by big developers are simply unattainable for the vast majority of young Pakistanis who do not hail from hereditary wealth and power.
And it is now increasingly clear that many of these schemes are built atop deteriorating ecologies that sooner or later take their revenge on the manmade disasters masquerading as ‘secure’ gated housing schemes.
Ultimately, the state bears the most responsibility. It is wilfully presiding over the unending expansion of a sector that actively impinges on the public interest, as defined by the needs of the working class majority and future generations who will bear the burden of ecological destruction. Individual moguls like Malik Riaz may be temporary losers in palace intrigues, but it is the militarised ruling class as a whole that must be cut down to size.

Published in Dawn, July 18th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-18 04:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924922/soaring-again' target='_blank'><strong>Soaring again</strong></a><br><p>BRITAIN’S decision to lift its nearly five-year-old ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply for permits to resume flight operations to and from the UK, is a boost to Pakistan’s aviation industry, particularly the debt-ridden national flag carrier PIA.
The UK Air Safety Committee’s move to reverse the restrictions follows aviation safety improvements in this country. The British High Commission in Islamabad stated that “the decisions on delisting states and air carriers were made through an independent aviation safety process”.
 
 

It added: “The committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision. Therefore, based on this independent and technically driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the UK Air Safety List.”
The British move follows the lifting of a similar ban by the European Union late last year. PIA restarted its European operations in January. Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif expects the British ban reversal to be followed by the resumption of PIA flights to the US in September.
The lifting of the ban by the UK will lead to several welcome developments. Britain, home to one of the largest Pakistani diasporas in the world, is among this country’s top trade and travel partners and the move will promote travel and connectivity, and enhance commercial ties between the two countries. Pakistanis living in the UK have already hailed the decision as direct PIA flights will provide 1.6m expats ease of travel to and from their homeland at competitive prices.
But, more importantly, the ban’s removal by both the UK and EU is a recovery point for the national carrier, and will go a long way in supporting the new push to sell the lossmaking airline by the end of this year. It is now expected to fetch a significantly higher price than was earlier envisaged as the airline will get a new opportunity to rebuild its operations to Britain and the EU nations, which had been two of its most lucrative markets.
The ban had been prompted on safety concerns by a reckless statement made by the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan about the credibility of Pakistani pilots, days after a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in May 2020, killing 97 passengers and crew.
In a statement in the National Assembly, Mr Khan had alleged that more than a third of the licences of Pakistani pilots were either fake or suspect as the crash was attributed to pilot error. It later transpired that his allegations, resulting in avoidable but disastrous financial and reputational losses for PIA and the country, were not based on fact.
That is water under the bridge now. Nevertheless, the episode is a reminder that a demonstration of discretion is necessary by those in high offices when it comes to national interests.

• 24 Palestinians killed in attacks across the besieged enclave
CAIRO: Israeli forces killed at least 27 people in attacks in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including three people who died in a strike on a church that late Pope Francis used to speak to regularly, medics and church officials said.
Eight men tasked with protecting aid trucks were reported among the dead in airstrikes that were carried out while mediators continued ceasefire talks in Doha.
A US official said this week the talks were going well but two officials from the Pales­tinian group Hamas told Reut­ers there had been no bre­akthr­ough as the Israeli military continued to pummel Gaza.
Two women and one man died and several people were wounded in a strike by the Isr­a­­eli army on Gaza’s Holy Fam­i­­ly Church, said the Latin Patr­iarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees the small parish.
“The Latin Patriarchate strongly condemns this tragedy and this targeting of innocent civilians and of a sacred place,” a statement by the Patriarchate said, adding that the victims had turned to the church compound as a safe haven “after their homes, possessions, and dignity had already been stripped away”.
“This horrific war must come to a complete end,” it said.
Photos released by the church showed its roof had been hit close to the main cross, scorching the stone facade, and that windows had been broken.
Father Gabriele Roma­nelli, an Argentine who used to regularly update the late Pope Francis about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was slightly injured in the attack. TV footage showed him sitting receiving treatment at Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza, with a bandage around his lower right leg.
Pope Leo said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of life and renewed his appeal for an immediate ceasefire, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said attacks on civilians were unacceptable.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the incident. Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement on X that the re­­sults of the investigation wou­­ld be published. It also said the country did not target churches or religious sites and regretted harm to them or civilians.
 






Palestinian medics said one air strike on Thursday had killed a man, his wife and their five children in Jabalia in northern Gaza, and that another in the north had killed eight men who had been handed responsibility for protecting aid trucks.
Three people were killed in an airstrike in central Gaza and four in Zeitoun in eastern Gaza, medics said.
Ceasefire talks
Arab mediators Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have hosted more than 10 days of talks on a proposed US 60-day truce.
As part of the potential deal, 10 prisoners held in Gaza would be returned along with the bodies of 18 others, spread out over 60 days. In exchange, Israel would release detained Palestinians. The exact number is not clear.
A Hamas source with knowledge of the matter said Israel had presented new maps to the mediators, pledging to pull the army further back than had previously been offered. The source said this partially met Hamas’ demands, but was still insufficient.
Disputes also remain over aid delivery mechanisms into Gaza, and guarantees that any eventual truce would lead to ending the war, said the two other Hamas officials who spoke to Reuters.
Israel has told the mediators it is willing to drop its demand to maintain a military presence along the so-called Morag Corri­dor in southern Gaza during a ceasefire and is prepared to show flexibility regarding the size of the security buffer it would retain near the Israeli border, Israeli media reported.
Prime Minister Benja­min Netanyahu’s office did not immediately comment on the reports.

The grief-stricken man is being consoled by his relatives, who are coming to express condolences over the tragedy befallen the famed family of singers.
Mr Chishti’s son-in-law, Raza Sabri and maternal uncle, Ahmed Sabri, were gunned down in a deadly bus attack in Zhob on Wednesday.
Raza was the son of Mr Ahmed.
The two men, along with their fellow musicians, were going to Quetta to perform at an event.
Asif, who played musical instruments, was also killed as terrorists opened indiscriminate fire on the bus.

While the two families are not related, the killing of three musicians in Balochistan is the second such tragedy to befall the community after the assassination of Amjad Sabri nine years ago

Slain Ahmed’s three brothers, Imran, Nasir and Faisal, remained safe in the attack.
Mr Chishti tells Dawn that 12 people, including four Sabri brothers, left Karachi on Wednesday.
At around 4pm, Faisal called to inform about the attack, said Mr Chishti.
Talking about his son-in-law, Mr Chishti said he was a father of a six-month-old son. Mr Ahmed had eight children.
He said the musician brothers were invited by a senior official to perform at an event in Quetta.
Talking about his family, he said there were seven Sabri brothers, all of them qawwals. One of them died of natural causes and now Ahmed has been gunned down along with his son.
Mr Chishti clarified that though they share the surname with famed qawwal Amjad Sabri, the two families were not related to each other.
Mr Amjad was shot dead in Karachi in 2016.
 
 

Shakoor Ahmed Sabri, a representative of Sabri qawwals, said Wednesday’s killings were the second major attack on musicians since the assassination of Mr Amjad.
He said the killings have “devastated” qawwals all over the country.
“We are qawals and we sing the greatness of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). We have nothing to do with politics,” said Mr Shakoor, who presented himself as an “elder” of the Sabri qawwal community.
Funeral
The bodies of three slain musicians have been brought back to Karachi by air. However, the three Sabri brothers, who survived the attack, have yet to return as they are looking after their injured group members in Quetta.
The funeral will be held after Friday prayers at the KMC ground in PIB Colony, according to Majid Sabri, the elder brother of Mr Ahmed.
He urged the governments of Sindh and Balochistan to facilitate the return of the survivors, including his three brothers, from Quetta to attend the funeral prayer.
Several political leaders and lawmakers have visited the grieving family and expressed their condolences.
Sindh minister Saeed Ghani, who received the coffins at the airport, said the Sabri qawals were on their way to perform their art.
He assured justice would be served and the Sindh government was in touch with Balochistan to extend every possible medical facility to the injured persons there.
Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori also visited the residence of Sabri qawwals and offered his condolences.

Without any evidence, New Delhi had blamed Islamabad for the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people killed in the Baisaran hill station, and used it as a pretext to launch military strikes against Pakistan.
According to a recent BBC News report, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
India also blames the LeT for orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks and several other attacks on military forces. The US earlier designated LeT as an FTO in December 2001.
One of the first mentions of the group came in 2020, when then-Indian army chief M.M. Naravane accused Pakistan of creating a “new terror group” in occupied Kashmir.
“I would rather call it Terror Revival Front. It is another terrorist organisation by another name. This is a terrorist organisation supported by its proxies across the border. They will be dealt with appropriately,” he was quoted as saying. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had rejected the allegation at the time.
“These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the statement said.
In a recent interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that Pakistan was ready to cooperate with India against this group.
At the time, Mr Thapar had claimed that New Delhi’s attempts to have the group designated as a terror outfit by the United Nations had been blocked by China, on Pakistan’s behalf.

•  US assessment finds only one of three Iranian nuclear sites ‘greatly damaged’
ISLAMABAD: The Iranian embassy in Pakistan has said attacks by the US and Israel in June killed over 1,100 people and were aimed at toppling the regime in Tehran.
The comments were made by the Iranian defence attaché in Islamabad, who briefed military personnel of various foreign missions over the 12-day war on Thursday.
On the same day, NBC News reported that a new US assessment has found that US strikes mostly destroyed one of three targeted Iranian nuclear sites, but the other two were not as badly damaged.
 
 

Col Moshen Shahabi, the Iranian defence attaché, called Israel’s attack a “gross miscalculation”. He said Israeli leaders assumed the Iranian regime would collapse rapidly after the killing of key military and nuclear figures. “They believed there would be political chaos and potential defections.”
He said the attacks were a “regime change effort” as demonstrated by Israeli Prime Mi­­nister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address on June 14 where he addressed the Iranian people directly, attempting to “incite internal dissent”.
However, these efforts “failed”, Mr Shahabi said, adding Tehran quickly filled the leadership vacuum created by the killing of top soldiers and initiated self-defence through missile strikes. He said Israeli attacks extended far beyond military targets, hitting civilian, academic, industrial, residential, and cultural sites, including Evin Prison, hospitals, and a state broadcaster.
At least 1,100 persons, including 56 children,  were killed in these attacks, according to the Iranian official.
He added that Iran, in response, targeted Israeli military and security sites, while any civilian casualties were “likely collateral damage from Israel’s defence systems” which intercepted incoming Israeli missiles.
Mr Shahabi also talked about Iranian strikes on US bases and said the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar was chosen since it was “far away from civilian populations and cities”.
Negotiation ‘cover for attack’
He called the US and Israeli attacks a violation of the UN Charter and the principles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Iranian defence attaché also slammed Western nations for “diplomatic betrayal”, stating negotiations were ongoing when Israel launched its strikes.
The US negotiations with Iran were a “facade” to prepare for military escalation.
He said Israeli PM Netanyahu confirmed the operations were fully coordinated with Washington, contradicting US claims of diplomatic engagement.
US assessment
Meanwhile, according to NBC, US officials believe the attack on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility was successful in setting back enrichment capabilities there by as much as two years. The report, citing two current officials, said the two other facilities struck by the US were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to.
Reuters could not immediately verify the NBC report.
White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told Reuters in an emailed statement: “As the President has said and experts have verified, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran’s nuclear capabilities.”
The chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told NBC that US President Donald Trump “was clear and the American people understand: Iran’s nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were completely and totally obliterated. There is no doubt about that.”
The US launched strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities last month, saying that they were part of a programme geared towards developing nuclear weapons.
Tehran maintains that its nuclear development is purely for civilian purposes.
A preliminary assessment in June from the Defence Intelligence Agency suggested that the strikes may have only set back Iran’s nuclear program by months. But Trump administration officials said that assessment was low confidence and had been overtaken by intelligence showing Iran’s nuclear programme was severely damaged.

The presidential physician found Trump, 79, has  “chronic venous insufficiency” — a condition where damaged leg veins fail to keep blood flowing properly — Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, calling it a  “benign and common condition.”
Responding to speculation over recent photos showing bruising on Trump’s hand, Leavitt said  “this was consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”
Trump became the oldest person in history to assume the presidency when he began his second term this January, replacing Democrat Joe Biden, who stepped down at 81.
She said he had undergone  “a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70.”
“Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease,” she said. All Trump’s test results  “were within normal limits,” she said and he had a  “normal cardiac structure and function, no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness.” The hand issue, she said, was linked to the aspirin he takes in a  “standard” cardiovascular health programme.
Leavitt said there was  “no evidence” of more serious conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.

• New telemetry device installed at Kotri Canal; project to cover 27 sites nationwide
• Irsa testing accuracy of new system; Wapda once again at helm despite past controversies
A LONG, bright silver-coloured gun-like device, known as a water level sensor, has recently been installed on the left bank of the Kalri Baghar (KB) Feeder — a perennial right bank canal off-taking from the Kotri Barrage, the last barrage on the Indus River.
The installation is part of a telemetry system bei­ng deployed at 27 sites acr­o­ss the country, including major barrages and canals.
“The device records flows in the KB Feeder. It captures even minute volumes of water flowing thro­ugh the canal. These readings are then compared with the manual gauge data,” said Ali Uzair Shaikh, assistant exe­c­utive engineer at Kotri Barrage, while explaining the equipment’s function.
Two additional devices have been installed at Gates 5 and 6 of the KB Feeder to monitor gate openings. “The equipment will help us understand how the system will function at any barrage or canal in future once fully operational. Initially, the device was supposed to be installed at the main barrage, but due to low flows in the Indus during the early summer season, it was fitted to the KB Feeder instead, as it had somewhat measurable flows,” Mr Shaikh added, referring to the water shortages experienced at the site.
These installations are classified as “proof of concept” (PoC) within the telemetry project, serving as a demonstration model for engineers and barrage staff. Another PoC has been set up at Marala, on the Chenab River, a key rim station in the Indus Basin.
The revival of the telemetry system is crucial for the country, where disputes over water distribution between provinces, particularly Punjab and Sindh, have long undermined national cohesion and agricultural planning.
A reliable, real-time telemetry system can bring much-needed tra­n­s­parency to water flow. Besides, it can strengthen federal oversight and enable evidence-based policymaking at a time when climate change is causing more frequent and intense heatwaves, erratic rainfall, rapid glacial melting and devastating floods.
 
 

According to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), the country’s federal water regulator, flow measurements are being conducted to verify whether existing rating tables correspond with the new telemetry data. Irsa Director Operations Khalid Idris Rana confirmed that the system’s accuracy is under assessment.
Chief Engineer Sajid Ali Bhutto, the focal person for the federally funded project from Sindh, said the PoC installation aims to evaluate both the operational reliability and calibration accuracy of newly deployed water level sensors, which have been mounted on the radial and vertical gate assemblies at the barrage sites.
A troubled past
This is not the country’s first attempt at modernising water flow measurement. A previous telemetry system, launched in the Musharraf era, was abandoned after years of malfunction. Now, a new Rs23.83 billion “Indus Telemetry Project” is being rolled out — again with the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) at the helm.
In 2000, then-chief executive Gen Musharraf initiated the first telemetry system to improve transparency in water sharing between provinces.
Wapda was tasked with execution, while the National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak) served as project consultant, and Siemens as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor. The system was completed on schedule in March 2004, but it quickly ran into trouble.
By 2003, Irsa reported significant variations in telemetry readings across several sites. Letters to authorities highlighted faulty data and technical discrepancies. Siemens eventually exited the project, and a subsequent evaluation in 2015 declared the system obsolete. The federal government formally scrapped it, calling it a “white elephant” that wasted public funds.
A 2016 plan to test a new system at seven pilot sites was eventually shelved. Irsa had been designated to take ownership, but that transition never occurred.
Blame game
In a written response to Dawn, Wapda spokesman Abid Rana insisted that the previous telemetry system had “operated successfully” for over a decade. He attributed the challenges to inadequate operations and maintenance (O&M) funding, lack of stakeholder ownership and insufficient institutional capacity on Irsa’s part.
“As a result, the project was not handed over to Irsa. Consequently, the telemetry system became non-functional, leading to its official decommissioning,” he conceded.
Irsa’s operations director, Khalid Idris Rana, disputes this, noting that most staff running the system were from Wapda itself.
“If the system was operational, why did the PM Inspection Commission recommend outsourcing it back to Wapda?” he asked, also pointing to mismatched data from key sites like Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma — the three sites under Wapda’s control to monitor the telemetry system back then.
No agency was held accountable, and the fate of the equipment remains unknown.
Back to square one
Now, nearly a decade and a half later, the situation has come full circle.
Wapda has once again been selected as the executing agency for the revamped telemetry project. The consultants also remain unchanged. The Ministry of Water Resources has justified Wapda’s selection based on its “extensive experience in water sector telemetry projects”.
According to Abid, “a flow measurement mission is currently underway with stakeholders to develop consensus on key parameters for discharge calculations.” He stressed that the new system features significant upgrades, as it uses advanced sensors, data loggers and communication systems.
The project was approved by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) of the federal Planning Ministry in February 2024. After a two-year Defect Liability Period, the system will be handed over to Irsa.
The revised project was approved for Rs23.8bn amid a “single bid” submission under the international competitive bidding (ICB) process. Wapda’s Abid Rana claimed that “multiple bidders participated” in the process, but only one firm submitted a final bid. He insisted that the contract award complied fully with Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules.
Unlike the previous system, which covered 23 sites, the new project extends to 27 locations and is scheduled for completion by 2026.
In 2018, the estimated cost of installing telemetry systems at seven sites was Rs2.4bn, or roughly Rs343 million per unit. Under the revised PC-I, that figure has ballooned to Rs23.834bn, translating to around Rs882 million per site, with the number of installations increased to 27.
Moreover, although the project is scheduled for completion by 2027 across the country, two of Sindh’s most crucial barrages — Guddu and Sukkur — have not yet been made available for system installation. Wapda’s Abid Rana explained that progress on Sindh’s barrages would be proportional to the handover of sites to contractors.
Meanwhile, the project’s Terms of Reference required study tours to countries with comparable river systems for Wapda and Irsa officials. These tours were meant to help understand successful international telemetry systems, but they have yet to materialise.
An official said that a tour to Germany and Italy is under consideration. “A visit will only be fruitful if the host country’s water system resembles the Indus Basin, with significant annual flows driven by glacial and snowmelt and a functioning telemetry system in place,” the official said. A query regarding the choice of destinations was sent to Wapda’s project director on June 26, but no response was received.

PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.
As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.
 
 

Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.
PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.
Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.
Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.
Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.
Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.
For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.

• Justice Mazhar says critical remarks can permanently tarnish reputations
• In case of doubt over judge’s conduct, matter should be discreetly sent to relevant chief justice
ISLAMABAD: The Supr­eme Court on Thursday cautioned superior jud­g­es over issuing critical orders against their peers as these observations have an “interminable impact” on the reputation of adjudicators.
“It always haunts the judicial officer and causes sev­e­re hardship and disparagement to his name and reputation in judicial service,” remar­ked Justice Muha­mmad Ali Mazhar in an order released on Thursday.
The verdict was issued in a revision application moved by Syed Zakir Hussain, a presiding officer of an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Karachi.
Mr Hussain, who was also the administrative judge of ATC in Karachi, came to the spotlight after refusing the remand of Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect in the high-profile Mustafa Amir murder case.
The judge’s action drew flak from the Sindh High Court (SHC), which ordered the provincial government to remove Mr Hussain from his role as the administrative judge of ATC.
Subsequently, the Sindh government, through a notification on Feb 26, withdrew Mr Hussain’s administrative powers as ATC judge.
The judge moved the Supreme Court against the SHC order and sought to expunge adverse observations over his alleged “judicial misconduct” and “procedural improprieties”.
In its order, the three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Mazhar, removed the adverse remarks against Mr Hussain, but kept the Feb 26 notification intact, stripping the judge of his administrative powers.
In the 12-page judgement, Justice Mazhar observed that “strictures” against judges create a “serious impairment and a sense of guilt in the eyes of the subordinates of the judge”.
Besides, it also damages the public’s confidence in the judicial system.
Another important aspect that cannot be ignored is that a judge against whom disparaging remarks or strictures were passed cannot defend their judgment or order in front of superior courts.
Therefore, high courts “should exercise greater caution and judicial restraint”, Justice Mazhar observed.
He added high courts, on a daily basis, review judgements and orders of lower courts and if those judements and orders are found to be deficient or flawed, they should be “modified, remanded or set aside”.
He added that no ulterior motive should be attributed even to a “serious error” committed by a judge without confronting them or seeking their comments.
The high court should be mindful that scornful and demeaning remarks or observations against a judge of the subordinate judiciary, even if expunged, “would not totally restitute the defacement of esteem and dignity”.
The criticism of a judgement or order must be “judicial” in nature and it should only point out errors or flaws in the said judgement.
Justice Mazhar observed that if the court has any doubt regarding the judge’s conduct, the matter should be confidentially referred to the high court’s chief justices, who can deal with the judge as per their “own fine sense of judgement”.
He added the principles of natural justice, due process, fair play and right to fair trial are also afforded to the judges of subordinate judiciary.
“They, too, being dispensers of justice, should be granted the right to a fair trial, rather than being condemned unheard.”

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that would last throughout the country till today. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours.
Data from the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) showed that 61 people were killed and 268 injured in the last 24 hours, warning that more monsoon rains were expected in the coming days.
An order from the Punjab Home Department said there was a significant increase in the accumulation of rainwater in low-lying areas, streets and open spaces, posing serious risks to the safety of children who often bathed in standing water.
“Dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries across the province of Punjab experience heightened water levels and stronger currents during these periods, making swimming and unauthorised boating activities extremely hazardous for human life, leading to a high potential for drowning and other tragic incidents.
“Prevailing weather conditions and the inherent dangers associated with these activities, necessitates immediate preventive measures to safeguard public safety and prevent loss of precious human lives,” the order said.
It added that the home secretary was thus imposing a complete ban under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure across the province on bathing in accumulated rainwater on streets, roads, open spaces, or any other area where rainwater has collected; swimming in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries, and boating by any unauthorised person or for unauthorised purposes in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries.
“This order shall remain in force for a period of 45 days from the date of issuance unless withdrawn.”
 






Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also announced that “a rain emergency has been imposed in different areas of Punjab due to unprecedented torrential rains and a flood situation.”
She added that directives were issued to keep the public alert through sirens and announcements. The chief minister urged the public to cooperate with the local authorities and take safety precautions.
 






In Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Biddar, Dhok Shah Arif, Sohawa, Rasoolpur, Chak Muhammad and Bhampar villages, according to Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.
Around 57 people have been rescued so far with the help of the Pakistan Army, he said in a statement, with more than 50 rescue boats involved in the Jhelum operations.
The spokesperson added that rescue teams have been deployed across the province, including Mianwali, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Layyah. Over 15,000 rescue personnel and 800 rescue boats were on high alert, Ahmad added.
“Pakistan Army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he said.
“Children were screaming for help, and women stood on rooftops, waving their shawls and begging to be rescued,” Tariq Mehbood Bhatti, a 51-year-old farmer in Gujrat’s Ladian village, was quoted as saying by AFP.
 






Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meisam Abbas told Dawn.com that high floods were noted in Bhimber, Dara Pur, Chakri, Chak Majo, Dhoke Bidar, Rajroor, Nakki, Mamyan, Nakka Khlaspur, Sahoowal, Samanwaal, Bara Phaphrah and other towns and villages were among the affected areas.
DPO Tariq Aziz Sindhu said six policemen got stuck amid the flood, five of whom were rescued while a constable was carried away by the water.
“A search operation for him was underway in the area,” the officer added.
Bilal Azhar Kiani, minister of state for finance, said while talking to Dawn.com from the monitoring centre about floods in his home district of Jhelum that a quick response was given to the eventual situation that was being directly monitored by the chief minister.
“The integrated response by Rescue 1122, the army, the police and the civil defence prevented casualties,” he said.
The minister said that relief centres for displaced families were established at safe places with medical teams for the treatment of the residents and livestock.
Kiani said that a search operation for the retrieval of missing cattle and livestock of those affected was also underway, and all-out efforts were underway to minimise.
“The chief minister will announce a package for the rehabilitation of the affectees,” the minister said.
Punjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas”, leading to a flood situation.
“Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,” the Wasa DG said in a statement.
The PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) warned that urban flooding was expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad divisions during the next 24 hours.
However, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.
In a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a “significant surge” in water levels at the Tarbela, Mangla, Khanpur, Simly and Rawal reservoirs.
The water level at Khanpur witnessed a gain of 4.5 feet, while the other four recorded an increase of a foot each.
 






In a weather outlook, the FFD said the water flows in the eastern rivers were likely to increase from July 21.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 178 people across the country and injured 491 people.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 38 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death in Azad Kashmir.
Over 57 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by “house-collapse” incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 610 houses and led to the deaths of 126 livestock.

Flood alert issued for Rawalpindi
Earlier today, the PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian stations in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah rose.
At 10:50am, the Gawalmandi and Kattarian gauges had crossed the 20ft level, at which evacuation is supposed to be ordered. However, the water levels soon started to recede, reaching 7ft at Gawalmandi and 8ft at Kattarian at 4:21pm, according to the PMD’s real-time monitor.

Following the flood alert in the morning, the PDMA imposed a rain emergency in Rawalpindi, with Director General Irfan Ali Kathia noting that a local holiday has been announced in the district.
DG Kathia urged residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah to “cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary”. In a statement, he warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah.
 


In a separate statement, the PDMA also detailed the equipment provided to the Rawalpindi administration for its relief efforts. This included 16 outboard motor boats, 205 life jackets, 31 ambulances, 19 fire brigade vehicles and four rescue vehicles.
The PDMA provided 28 de-watering sets, five suction pumps, six tractors and as many jetting machines to Wasa.
Another five de-watering sets, seven mini trucks and three jetting machines were given to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), the statement added.
The Pakistan Army rescued a family stranded in the flood on Rawalpindi’s Chakri Road using a helicopter, Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Chakwal records 400mm of rain in 10 hours
Punjab’s Chakwal district was among the heaviest hit by the recent rains as it recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from the PDMA said.
“Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded,” the PDMA said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday.
However, a rainfall record issued by it at 8am stated 142mm of rainfall in the previous 24 hours.
Footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed water gushing across vast swathes of land, with floodwater entering various buildings, including a Rescue 1122 office.
 


In a statement, the PDMA said water levels had begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts were underway to rescue trapped citizens.
DG Kathia spoke on the phone with Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat, who briefed the former on the relief efforts.
She said the relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and other civil personnel, were present on the ground to take part in the rescue operation.
Relief arrangements had been made in hospitals and public buildings, Hayat said.
DG Kathia assured Hayat of providing all possible resources and assistance, according to the PDMA statement. He added that the district administration was in contact with the army as well for additional support.
“The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”
District Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, were on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources” were also on standby.
DC Hayat announced a flood emergency in Chakwal and Talagang. She directed all officers to remain present at the place of their duty for 24 hours and the leaves of all officers and employees were cancelled.
The DC also directed officials to ensure the availability of required machinery, equipment and staff to Rescue 1122. DC Hayat, along with District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin, visited the affected areas and supervised the rescue operations and relief work.
Scores of mini dams built by private individuals were washed away by the torrents, inundating many villages. Budhial village was submerged after a mini-dam was wrecked in Ghokal village.
“I have never witnessed such kind of flooding in my village”, Prof Syed Ali Raza from Budhial told Dawn.com. He added that five to six feet of rainwater accumulated in the houses, forcing people to leave their homes. The bridge on the road which connects Budhial to the rest of the area was also swept away, cutting off the village from the rest of the area.
“Three cattle were also swept away and still could not be found,” he said.
Additional Deputy Commissioner Bilal Bin Abdul Hafeez said that the exact cause of the unprecedented rain could not be ascertained yet.
“However, this situation has occurred possibly due to two factors. The first one could be a cloudburst, and the second one could be the shifting of the confluence of eastern and western winds to Chakwal from Kallar Kahar. Until now, the confluence of eastern and western winds was being considered near Kallar Kahar, but Kallar Kahar and neighbouring Choa Saidan Shah did not witness such heavy downpour as it was witnessed in Chakwal city and twenty km to its eastern belt,” he maintained.
Chakwal and Talagang have 24 small dams and due to the prolonged drought, the water level in all dams has decreased to a dead level. “All the small dams in Chakwal and Talagang are safe and they are operating as per their structure,” Executive Engineer Small Dams Division Naeemul Hassan told Dawn.com. He added that all the dams were filled 80 per cent.
NDMA forecasts more heavy rainfall across country
The NDMA has forecasted more heavy rains over the next 24 hours, Radio Pakistan reported.
“Various districts in Punjab — including Lahore, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Khushab, Sargodha, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Hafizabad — are likely to experience thunderstorms and heavy rain in the next 12 hours,” the report read.

Amid heavy rains and flooding in Punjab, authorities in the federal capital were also directed to remain on high alert by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa.
“Field teams should provide all possible assistance to citizens in case of an emergency,” Randhawa, also the Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman, said.
The chief commissioner directed that strict monitoring of all highways, drains and waterways of Islamabad should be ensured.
In case of any emergency, citizens were advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.
Child dead, 11 injured in Mandi Bahauddin
Separately, heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, rescue officials said. According to the PMD, Mandi Bahauddin recorded 167mm of rainfall in 24 hours up till 8am.
Shah Hussain, aged 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — eight-year-old Qasim and six-year-old Huzaifa — were injured due to electrocution during the rain.
Nine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations in Mandi Bahauddin. College Chowk, Pindi Purani, Jail Chowk and several other areas remained submerged under 2-4ft of water.
PM directs NDMA, ministers to prepare comprehensive disaster management plans
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA chair and federal ministers for climate change and planning to work together with the provinces for developing a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.
The prime minister visited the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) at the NDMA headquarters, where he was briefed on the country’s monsoon situation, disaster response efforts, and the increasing intensity of weather patterns.
 






PM Shehbaz commended the NDMA’s efforts and lauded the role of modern technology and skilled human resources at the authority.
“NDMA always provides an encouraging environment, and it is because of its modern infrastructure and highly capable team. This is my second visit here, and I am pleased to see the dedication.”
The prime minister highlighted recent cloudbursts and heavy downpours in Chakwal, Lahore, Islamabad, and hilly areas, acknowledging the severity of weather conditions. He remarked that while southern parts of the country saw less rainfall impact, the northern and central regions continue to face significant risk.
“As projections show increased cloudburst activity, we must prepare accordingly. The federal government and NDMA must maintain close coordination with provinces,” PM Shehbaz said.
The prime minister pledged full support from the PM Office in procuring the necessary disaster response equipment and emphasised the importance of federal-provincial cooperation in strengthening human resources, capacity building, and equipment for rescue and relief operations.
“Pakistan contributes minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions but ranks among the top ten most climate-vulnerable countries. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity to build a climate-resilient nation, especially in agriculture and infrastructure.”
With an urgent call for a unified national response and long-term climate adaptation, PM Shehbaz concluded his visit by reiterating the federal government’s commitment to protecting lives, property, and infrastructure in the face of intensifying climate challenges.
Mangla Dam situation
Meanwhile, the district administration of Jhelum dispelled the rumours of flooding in the river Jhelum.
The press release from the district information department said that the inflow of water in Mangla lake and its storage level were being monitored, and there was no imminent danger of overflooding from the dam, as its current level was 1186 feet against a storage capacity of 1,242 feet.
The deputy commissioner clarified to the residents of the area that the current flooding was a result of a heavy downpour that continued during the last 36  hours.
“The low-lying areas of Gujar Khan tehsil, including Gujar Khan city, Daultala, and Hassal village, were also flooded, while the local administration remained on alert and no casualties were reported,” Hamza Ehtisham, the assistant commissioner of Gujar Khan, confirmed.</p><small>2025-07-17 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1719563727edc65.jpg?r=195647' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924786/pakistan-uzbekistan-afghanistan-sign-trilateral-agreement-on-railway-project-in-kabul-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan sign trilateral agreement on railway project in Kabul moot</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in Kabul on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he arrived earlier today on a day-long visit for the signing.
“I congratulate the people and governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan on the signing of the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Naibabad–Kharlachi rail link under the UAP Railway Corridor.
“I also thank the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for their support and commitment for timely signing of the agreement. We remained closely engaged throughout the negotiation process to finalise the details.”
 






He hailed the UAP Railway Corridor as a major milestone in advancing regional connectivity and economic integration that would connect Central Asian countries to Pakistani seaports through Afghanistan.
Dar said the signing of today’s agreement was a result of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership and commitment, who had tasked him as finance minister of the Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government to lead the effort with the countries.
“We collectively laid the foundation for this transformational project.”
The foreign ministers of the three countries held a meeting before the signing.
“The meeting reaffirmed strong ties and a shared commitment to peace, connectivity, trade and regional development. The three sides emphasised the importance of sustained cooperation to unlock the region’s economic potential and ensure long-term prosperity for their peoples,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.
 






In 2023, the three countries agreed on the UAP Railway project to build a rail link, which will pass through Termiz in Uzbekistan, Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar in Afghanistan and enter Pakistan via the Kharlachi border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The project will facilitate regional, transit, and bilateral trade among­­st participating countries, while supporting both passenger and freight services.
Dar arrived in Kabul earlier today, accompanied by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, the special representative for Afghanistan, and the secretary of the Ministry of Railways.
 






Dar and Abbasi later met acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.
According to the FO, both sides called for maintaining “the momentum in bilateral relations” and expanding cooperation in the trade, transit and security sectors.
“They agreed to remain engaged to achieve the full potential of regional economic development, including through [the] realisation of trans-regional connectivity projects,” the FO wrote on X.
 






Dar later met Afghan Prime Minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund, and the two leaders exchanged views on issues of mutual interest, including peace and security, trade and transit cooperation and regional connectivity.
 






In a meeting with acting Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, both sides held in-depth discussions on security matters and reaffirmed the importance of eradicating threats to regional countries.
FM Dar underlined the importance of addressing all issues of concern, in particular security and border management, to harness the full potential of economic cooperation and regional connectivity.
 






Earlier in the day, the FO said the railway project aimed to build a rail link to connect Uzbekistan with Pakistan via Afghanistan and facilitate access to Pakistani seaports for Central Asian States.
“By facilitating regional trade and transit, the project is expected to promote regional stability, growth and development.”
It added that the agreement between the three participating countries will be an “important step towards its implementation”.
“During the visit, the deputy prime minister (Dar) will also hold a meeting with the Afghan acting foreign minister and will call on [the] acting prime minister of Afghanistan to discuss bilateral matters and exchange views on regional and international developments,” it said.
 






Earlier this month, Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement for the project.
In June, Pakistan and Uzbekistan decided to begin work on the trilateral railway transit corridor project, describing it as a milestone for regional economic growth and stronger trade ties.</p><small>2025-07-17 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1722304214bd613.jpg?r=223102' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924822/french-court-tries-couple-accused-of-plan-to-sacrifice-son' target='_blank'><strong>French court tries couple accused of plan to ‘sacrifice’ son</strong></a><br><p>A French couple went on trial on Thursday, accused of planning to “sacrifice” their five-year-old son in the Moroccan desert, accusations they have strongly denied.
The two music teachers were arrested in southern Spain in late 2023 as they were about to board a ferry to Morocco after buying a new four-wheel-drive and subletting their apartment near the French city of Bordeaux.
An alarmed relative had told French prosecutors that the father intended to “sacrifice” his son in the desert because he believed he was “possessed”, the investigation showed.
The father, Florian L, denies ever having said that, his lawyer Audrey Boussillon said.
“Never did he have the intention to harm his son in any way,” she added.
The couple, who hold “anti-system” and “mystical” beliefs, vehemently reject the charges of being part of a criminal gang and failing in their duties as parents, their defence team has said.
The attorney for the mother, Marie L, Aurelie Filippi-Codaccioni, said the couple had been to Morocco two years earlier and had wanted to return for an undetermined period.
But Merlene Labadie, a lawyer representing the interests of the child, said the couple’s beliefs endangered their son, who spoke of the importance of “being cold, scared and removing the snake within us” when found.
He is now in the custody of his maternal grandparents, she said.
The trial is to last a single day and the verdict will likely be announced at a later date.</p><small>2025-07-17 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17185904866965d.jpg?r=221233' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924807/punjab-police-arrest-bushra-bibis-son-for-shooting-domestic-servant-at-pakpattan-home' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Police arrest Bushra Bibi’s son for shooting domestic servant at Pakpattan home</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Police on Thursday arrested former first lady Bushra Bibi’s son, Musa Maneka, for allegedly attempting to kill his domestic servant by shooting him at his Pakpattan residence.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at the complaint of the servant’s father at Saddar Police Station under Section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant said that he and his son worked at Maneka’s residence, adding that the incident occurred at 11am when his son placed two bedsheets outside the bedroom, prompting Maneka to ask his son why he touched the bedsheets.
The son responded by saying, “I kept the sheets outside with care,” according to the FIR. “The suspect became enraged and shot my son using a pistol,” it added.
“My son was hit in front of his left knee, and the bullet passed through his leg, causing him to fall,” the complainant said. He also stated that two other people witnessed the incident, who reached there after hearing the gunshots.
District Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chaddar told Dawn.com that police rushed to the scene after receiving an emergency call.
“I entered the premises and confronted Maneka, taking him into custody,” he said, adding that the suspect was currently held at the Saddar Police station and that the police had recovered the pistol which was used in the incident.
Rescue 1122  immediately took the injured servant to District Headquarters Hospital Pakpattan for medical treatment, he said.
DPO Chaddar said that “no one is above the law”, adding that the suspect “would not be spared”.
Today is not the suspect’s only run-in with the law. He and his father Khawar Maneka and elder brother were indicted in corruption cases in a reference filed by the Okara deputy commissioner on Aug 23, 2023.

Earlier in the day, some local television news channels reported, citing sources, that Trump was expected to visit Pakistan in September. The news channels said that Trump would also visit India after arriving in Islamabad in September. The channels later withdrew their reports.
The White House dismissed the rumours. “A trip to Pakistan has not been scheduled at this time,” a White House official said.
Talking to Dawn.com on the reported visit earlier, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “We have no information about this matter.”
Similarly, a US embassy spokesperson in Islamabad told Reuters, “We have nothing to announce,” and said that the White House might be able to provide confirmation on the president’s schedule.
George W Bush was the last US president to visit Pakistan in 2006.
 
 

US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.

A first information report (FIR) — available with Dawn.com — was filed by the victim’s uncle at Saddar police station on July 10 under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (rape) and Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection Act (CPA).
The complainant alleged in the FIR that the child, after feeling pain, told their mother about the incident and said that he was sexually abused by the teacher in his room in the mosque.
“The child is visually impaired and just five years old,” the complainant stated in the FIR, demanding legal action against the suspect.
According to a statement issued by Haripur District Police Officer Farhan, after the incident, he actively engaged the team at Saddar police station, who successfully arrested the suspect.
“Under the supervision of DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) Saddar Muhammad Arif, SHO Inspector Akhtar Hussain, along with the investigation team and other police personnel, arrested the [suspect],” the statement read.
The DPO’s statement added that the investigation is ongoing.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.</p><small>2025-07-17 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17203719656fc09.jpg?r=204555' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924818/ukraine-appoints-new-government-in-biggest-wartime-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine appoints new government in biggest wartime overhaul</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine’s parliament appointed the country’s first new prime minister in five years on Thursday, part of a major cabinet overhaul aimed at revitalising wartime management as prospects for peace with Russia grow dim.
Yulia Svyrydenko, 39, has been tasked by President Volodymyr Zelensky with boosting domestic weapons production and reviving Ukraine’s loan-dependent economy.
In a speech to parliament, Zelensky said he expected his new government to increase the share of domestic weapons on Ukraine’s battlefield to 50 per cent from 40pc within six months.
He also singled out deregulation and expanding economic co-operation with allies as other key aims of the biggest government reshuffle since Russia’s February 2022 invasion.
Svyrydenko, an experienced technocrat who had served as first deputy prime minister since 2021, pledged to move “swiftly and decisively”.
“War leaves no room for delay,” she wrote on X. “Our priorities for the first six months are clear: reliable supply for the army, expansion of domestic weapons production, and boosting the technological strength of our defence forces.”
 






Svyrydenko is also well known to the Trump administration, having negotiated a deal giving the US preferential access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth. It was considered crucial to bolster relations between Kyiv and Washington.
Addressing lawmakers on Thursday, Zelensky said further deals with the US would be forthcoming but did not offer any specific details.
Parliament also appointed former prime minister Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s longest-serving head of government, as defence minister and Svitlana Hrynchuk as energy minister.
Former Svyrydenko deputies Oleksiy Sobolev and Taras Kachka will serve as minister of economy, environment and agriculture and deputy prime minister for European integration, respectively.
“This team is time-tested,” Shmyhal wrote on Thursday. “Ahead are new tasks, challenges and a high level of responsibility.”
 






Challenges ahead
Svyrydenko takes over the government as Russian forces press a grinding offensive across the sprawling, more than 1,000-kilometre front line and intensify air strikes on Ukrainian cities.
Ukraine is betting on a budding defence industry, fuelled in part by foreign investment, to fend off Russia’s bigger and better-armed war machine.
With state revenues going to defence, Kyiv will also need to find money to finance its ballooning budget deficit as foreign aid diminishes. Officials have said they could face a shortfall of about $19 billion next year.
Svyrydenko said her government would launch a full audit of public finances to achieve “real savings”, as well as accelerate large-scale privatisations and help entrepreneurs.
Some opposition lawmakers voiced scepticism about the new government’s ability to remain independent of Zelensky’s administration, which wields significant wartime powers under Ukraine’s constitution.
“They will be told by the president’s office what they should really do,” wrote Yaroslav Zheleznyak of the Holos party.
Drone ‘mega-deal’
US President Donald Trump and Zelensky are considering a deal that involves Washington buying battlefield-tested Ukrainian drones in exchange for Kyiv purchasing weapons from the US, Zelensky said in an interview with The New York Post.
Zelensky said his latest talks with Trump focused on a deal that would help each country bolster its aerial technology. Ukrainian drones have been able to strike targets as deep as 1,300 kilometres into Russian territory.
“The people of America need this technology, and you need to have it in your arsenal,” Zelensky told The Post in the interview conducted on Wednesday.
The Ukrainian leader said drones were the key tool that has allowed his country to fight off Russia’s invasion for more than three years.
“We will be ready to share this experience with America and other European partners,” he said. Ukraine was also in talks with Denmark, Norway and Germany, he said.
On Thursday, Zelensky announced unspecified future agreements with the United States, which he said would strengthen his country.
Next year’s US defence and national security budget request boosts spending on small drones, in part because of lessons learned during Russia’s war in Ukraine, where unmanned aircraft have proven to be an integral part of low-cost, yet highly effective fighting.</p><small>2025-07-17 15:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17193116697786a.png?r=193453' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924815/pakistan-eu-agree-to-strengthen-cooperation-in-security-during-bilateral-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, EU agree to strengthen cooperation in security during bilateral dialogue</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the European Union (EU) on Thursday agreed on bolstering cooperation in security and counter-terrorism among other sectors during a bilateral dialogue, according to a press release issued by the Foreign Office (FO).
EU Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Riina Kionka in March had announced that European companies recognised Pakistan as a potential business destination and were exploring new avenues for economic partnership.
The EU is Pakistan’s sec­ond-largest trading partner, with the GSP+ status allowing the country to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
According to the press release, Pakistan and the EU held their 10th Political Dialogue in Brussels and discussed key regional and international issues, including multilateral cooperation. Both sides agreed to deepen dialogue and discussions on security during the event.
“The EU and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP) signed in 2019,” the FO stated. “Both sides aim to further deepen cooperation in all areas covered under the SEP.”
Additionally, both sides agreed to continue close engagement under the GSP+ framework. They also acknowledged meaningful cooperation on various aspects of migration, with the third Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Dialogue slated for later in 2025, the FO stated.
According to the FO, the EU and Pakistan acknowledged the importance of multifaceted cooperation on security matters, including counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics.
“They condemned all forms of terrorism,” the press release read. “Both sides agreed on the need for efforts based on dialogue and diplomacy in order to solve contentious issues and underscored the importance of upholding international law and the sanctity of international agreements [and] treaties.”
The FO stated that both sides also exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and Indian-occupied Kashmir and stressed the need to pursue peaceful solutions to conflicts, in respect of the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
“They agreed on the urgent need to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the statement read. “Both sides called for the resumption of a ceasefire and expressed support for initiatives that contribute to a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Palestine, in accordance with the two-state solution.”
Pakistan and the EU reaffirmed their aspiration to convene the 7th Strategic Dialogue in 2025 to strengthen Pakistan-EU cooperation. According to the FO, they agreed to hold the next Political Dialogue meeting in Islamabad next year.
Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch led Pakistan’s delegation, while the EU delegation was headed by Olof Skoog, Deputy Secretary General of the European External Action Service.
The EU is not the only Western power with whom Pakistan has experienced improved relations.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when US President Donald Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
Additionally, United States Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla last month praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).</p><small>2025-07-17 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17190505fdf7de8.png?r=190524' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924812/uk-to-lower-voting-age-to-16-in-general-elections' target='_blank'><strong>UK to lower voting age to 16 in general elections</strong></a><br><p>The British government said on Thursday that it would allow 16-year-olds to vote in general elections, a landmark change giving the United Kingdom one of the lowest voting ages worldwide.
The ruling Labour Party pledged to lower the age from 18 ahead of winning power last year. It is among several planned changes to the democratic system.
Some argue Britain’s democracy is “in crisis”, in particular due to low turnout.
The voting age change is contentious, however, with critics previously arguing it is self-serving as newly-enfranchised teenagers are seen as more likely to support centre-left Labour.
“I think it’s really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote, because they are old enough to go out to work, they are old enough to pay taxes, so [they] pay in,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
“And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go,” Starmer added.
The government will have to bring legislation before parliament, where it has a comfortable majority, to make the changes.
Only a small number of countries allow 16-year-olds to vote in national elections, according to online databases.
They include Austria — the first EU country to lower the voting age to 16 in 2007 — as well as Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Cuba.
’Democracy in crisis ’
Labour ministers insist the change is intended to “modernise our democracy”, while aligning general elections with the existing voting age for elections for the devolved regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales.
Other planned changes include introducing automated voter registration — which is already used in Australia and Canada — and making UK-issued bank cards an accepted form of ID at polling stations.
It follows changes to the electoral law introduced by the previous Conservative government, which required voters to show a photo ID. The Electoral Commission found that the rule led to around 750,000 people not voting in last year’s election.
Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, called the changes “the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969”, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
He noted that lowering the voting age and introducing automated voter registration could add 9.5 million more people to the voter rolls.
“Our democracy is in crisis, and we risk reaching a tipping point where politics loses its legitimacy,” he added, backing the changes.
The main Conservative opposition, however, accused Labour of inconsistency as 16 and 17-year-olds will still not be able to stand as election candidates, buy lottery tickets or alcohol, or get married.
“This is a brazen attempt by the Labour Party whose unpopularity is scaring them into making major constitutional changes without consultation,” the party’s communities spokesman Paul Holmes said.</p><small>2025-07-17 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17121423c29bc20.jpg?r=121727' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924775/psx-reaches-new-peak-of-138000-with-2200-point-rally' target='_blank'><strong>PSX reaches new peak of 138,000 with 2,200-point rally</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday continued its renewed bullish momentum as it crossed the 138,000-point barrier.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,785.25 points, or 1.31 per cent, to stand at 138,165.21 points at 11:57am, from the previous close of 136,379.96 points. The index closed at 138,665.49 points, up by 2,285.53 points or 1.68pc.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said: “Investor optimism over a potential rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy, expected later this month, has strengthened following a decline in yields during yesterday’s PIBs (Pakistan Investment Bond) auction.
“A stable external account and easing inflation further support the case for bringing interest rates down into single digits,” he told Dawn.com.
The PSX had staged a modest recovery yesterday as investors resumed buying, encouraged by the formation of a high-level committee to address the business community’s concerns over the recently introduced taxation measures.
 
 

The development has helped the KSE-100 index gain momentum despite the July 19 strike call by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry to protest against the powers to arrest and prosecute businessmen introduced in the federal budget.
Investor confidence was also reinforced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s recent briefing to Moody’s on Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic outlook and financial stability, bolstering optimism for a potential ratings upgrade in the credit rating agency’s upcoming review.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17120352f3e41f8.jpg?r=120358' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773/3-terrorists-killed-during-joint-operation-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists killed during joint operation in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday night, police said.
The spokesperson for the Bannu police, Khanzala Quraishi, told Dawn.com, “The three terrorists, belonging to the Zarar group, had been eliminated in an intelligence-based joint operation conducted in the Bannu city outskirts at midnight.”
He said that the “terrorists were wanted for attacks on security forces and the target killing of police personnel”.
According to the spokesperson, the terrorists were identified and all of them were residents of Bannu.
“Three Kalashnikovs, magazines, pistols and handmade improvised explosive devices were recovered from their possession,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the last few months.
Yesterday, two policemen were gunned down in a terrorist attack in Kulachi area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.
In early July, at least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured in an explosion targeting a government vehicle in Bajaur.
Terrorist killed by police during DI Khan search operation
Meanwhile, a terrorist was killed and six others were injured during a search operation in Dera Ismail Khan area against assailants who attacked police personnel, according to the District Police Officer (DPO).
A statement issued by DI Khan DPO Sajjad Khan said that a search and strike operation was conducted in the Kulachi area under his supervision. It added that an exchange of fire took place between terrorists and police, leaving one terrorist dead and six others injured.
“The process of identifying the dead terrorist is underway,” the statement read. “A Kalashnikov with a magazine and ammunition was recovered from his possession.”
Separately, six people were killed as a result of a clash between two parties over personal enmity in the Panyala area of KP’s Dera Ismail Khan early on Thursday morning.
According to the DI Khan police spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, “the two parties were close relatives, and the clash took place due to a long-standing family dispute.”
The bodies and the injured parties were transported to Panyala Hospital. The police have cordoned off the area and started an investigation, but no arrests have been made yet, he added.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17165640e99029e.jpg?r=172322' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924802/air-india-crash-probe-focuses-on-actions-of-planes-captain-report' target='_blank'><strong>Air India crash probe focuses on actions of plane’s captain: report</strong></a><br><p>A cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the Air India flight that crashed last month indicates the captain cut the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
The newspaper cited people familiar with US officials’ early assessment of evidence uncovered in the investigation into the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner in Ahmedabad, India, that killed 260 people.
A preliminary report into the crash released by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday said one pilot was then heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel and “the other pilot responded that he did not do so”.
Investigators did not identify which remarks were made by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and which by First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3,403 hours, respectively.
Kunder, who was flying the plane, asked Sabharwal why he moved the fuel switches to the “cutoff” position seconds after lifting off the runway, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The Journal did not say if there was any evidence that Sabharwal did move the switches, beyond the verbal exchange it cited. But it quoted US pilots who have read the Indian authorities’ report as saying that Kunder, the pilot actively flying, likely would have had his hands full pulling back on the Dreamliner’s controls at that stage of the flight.
India’s AAIB, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Air India and two unions representing Indian pilots did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the Wall Street Journal report. Boeing declined to comment.
The AAIB’s preliminary report said the fuel switches had switched from run to cutoff a second apart just after takeoff, but it did not say how they were flipped.
Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.
The London-bound plane began to lose thrust, and after reaching a height of 650 feet, the jet started to sink.
The fuel switches for both engines were turned back to run, and the airplane automatically tried restarting the engines, the report said.
But the plane was too low and too slow to be able to recover, aviation safety expert John Nance told Reuters.
The plane clipped some trees and a chimney before crashing in a fireball into a building on a nearby medical college campus, the report said, killing 19 people on the ground and 241 of the 242 on board the 787.
No safety recommendations
In an internal memo on Monday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.
The AAIB’s preliminary report had no safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturer GE.
After the report was released, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The circumstantial evidence increasingly indicates that a crew member flipped the engine fuel switches, Nance said, given there was “no other rational explanation” that was consistent with the information released to date.
Nonetheless, investigators “still have to dig into all the factors” and rule out other possible contributing factors, which would take time, he said.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
The Air India crash has rekindled debate over adding flight deck cameras, known as cockpit image recorders, on airliners.
Nance said investigators likely would have benefited greatly from having video footage of the cockpit during the Air India flight.
Air India has faced additional scrutiny on other fronts after the crash.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said this month it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, after Reuters reported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance.</p><small>2025-07-17 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17135538a30c222.jpg?r=135616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924763/fire-at-mall-in-iraq-leaves-at-least-69-dead-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at mall in Iraq leaves at least 69 dead, officials say</strong></a><br><p>A massive fire in a hypermarket in al-Kut city in eastern Iraq has left at least 69 people dead and 11 others missing, the city’s health authorities and two police sources told Reuters on Thursday.

“We have more bodies that have not been recovered still under fire debris,” city official Ali al-Mayahi told Reuters.
Officials said many people suffocated in bathrooms, while one person told AFP that his five relatives died in an elevator.
Several people told AFP they lost family members, including mothers and children who had gone to shop and dine at the mall.
The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but the province’s governor said initial results from an investigation would be announced within 48 hours, the INA state news agency reported. One survivor told AFP an air conditioner had exploded.
“We have filed lawsuits against the owner of the building and the mall,” INA quoted the governor as saying.
He told the news agency the victims included men, women and children.
A medical source in Kut told AFP there were “many unidentified bodies”.
An AFP correspondent reported seeing charred bodies at the province’s forensic department.
Civil defence teams rescued more than 45 people who were trapped inside the building, which includes a restaurant and a supermarket, the interior ministry said.
Ambulances ferried casualties as late as 4am, with wards in Kut overwhelmed.
An AFP correspondent reported seeing distraught relatives waiting at the forensic department for news, some collapsing in grief.
One man fell apart, pounding his chest and screaming.
Nasir al-Quraishi, a doctor in his 50s, said he lost five family members in the fire.
“A disaster has befallen us,” he told AFP.
“We went to the mall to have some food, eat dinner and escape power cuts at home.
“An air conditioner exploded on the second floor and then the fire erupted — and we couldn’t escape.”
Lax safety regulations
Moataz Karim, 45, hurried to the mall at midnight, only to be met with the devastating news that three of his relatives were missing.
Hours later, he identified two relatives despite their charred bodies, one of whom had only begun working at the shopping centre three days ago.
“There is no fire extinguishing system,” he said in anger, as he waited for further news outside the forensic department.
Safety standards in Iraq’s construction sector are often disregarded, and the country, whose infrastructure is in disrepair after decades of conflict, is often the scene of fatal fires and accidents.
Fires increase during the blistering summer as temperatures approach 50 degrees Celsius.
In September 2023, a fire killed at least 100 people when it ripped through a crowded Iraqi wedding hall, sparking a panicked stampede for the exits.
In July 2021, a fire in the Covid-19 unit of a hospital in southern Iraq killed more than 60 people.
The governor declared three days of mourning in Wasit province.
“The tragedy is a major shock … and requires a serious review of all safety measures,” he said.
Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ordered a “thorough probe” into the fire to identify “shortcomings” and prevent further incidents.

Thousands of Afghans who worked with the United Kingdom were brought to Britain with their families in a secret programme after a 2022 data breach put their lives at risk, the UK government revealed on Tuesday.
The scheme was only revealed after the UK High Court lifted a super-gag order banning any reports of the events.
UK Defence Minister John Healey said the leak was not revealed because of the risk that the Taliban authorities would obtain the data set and the lives of Afghans would be put at risk.
“Nobody has been arrested for their past actions, nobody has been killed and nobody is being monitored for that,” the Afghan government’s deputy spokesman, Hamdullah Fitrat, told reporters on Thursday. “Reports of investigation and monitoring of a few people whose data has been leaked are false.”
After the Taliban swept back to power in 2021, their Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada announced an amnesty for Afghans who worked for Nato forces or the ousted foreign-backed government during the two-decade conflict.
“All their information and documents are present here in the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the intelligence [agency] ,” Fitrat added. “We don’t need to use the leaked documents from Britain.”
He said “rumours” were being spread to create fear among Afghans and their families.
 
 

Around 900 Afghans and 3,600 family members have now been brought to Britain or are in transit under the programme known as the Afghan Response Route, at a cost of around £400 million ($535m), Healey said.
They are among some 36,000 Afghans who Britain has accepted under different schemes since the August 2021 fall of Kabul.
Tens of thousands of Afghans fled Afghanistan in a chaotic weeks-long evacuation when the Taliban won their insurgency, after the mass withdrawal of international troops and air support to the country.
Tens of thousands more have been resettled under European and US asylum schemes, which, after four years, have now slowed to almost a halt.
The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in 2023 that there were credible reports of serious human rights violations by the Taliban authorities against hundreds of former government officials and former armed forces members.
 
 

From the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan on 15 August 2021 to 30 June 2023, UNAMA documented at least 800 instances of extrajudicial killing, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and ill-treatment and enforced disappearance, it said in a report.
The Taliban’s Foreign Affairs Ministry denied the allegations and said all former employees had been pardoned.

The incident occurred almost two weeks after a five-storey building collapsed earlier this month in Lyari’s Lea Market, killing 27 people. This incident raised serious concerns about building safety, prompting authorities to evacuate other dilapidated buildings in the city.
Regarding the incident today, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com, “Two women have died in the accident, while more than two others are reported to have been injured.”
Providing details of the incident, he said: “The building was dilapidated. Some labourers were working on the roof of the sixth floor when it collapsed.”
He added that the rescue operation has been completed.
Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) South, Asad Raza, confirmed that the two people were killed and three others were injured in the incident.
“The top floor of the six-storey building — named Ghani Mansion, situated next to Bilal Masjid Peshawari Hotel — collapsed on the lower fifth floor,” he told Dawn.com.
He said three injured people and the bodies of the deceased, including two women, were taken to Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.
“The deceased women were sisters. Their daughters are among the injured and are being given medical assistance,” he said.
After the collapse of the Lyari building earlier this month, Sindh Local Government minister Saeed Ghani had addressed an emergency press conference, revealing that 588 buildings across the city had been declared hazardous — 456 of them located in District South, including 107 in Lyari alone.
The Sindh government had suspended the director-general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) for approving the building’s construction. The provincial government has formed a committee on hazardous and dilapidated buildings to ensure transparency.
A day earlier, it was revealed that as many as 44 dilapidated buildings, including 10 declared protected heritage in the city’s South district, have been vacated for demolition in the aftermath of the Lyari building tragedy.
A meeting, chaired by Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi, was told that so far, 44 dilapidated buildings had been vacated in the South and East districts for the safety of the residents.
In total, out of 588 buildings declared dilapidated by the SBCA, 68 buildings have been declared “highly dilapidated” by the city administration and will be vacated and demolished in the first phase.</p><small>2025-07-17 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/171337362f407e8.jpg?r=133920' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924784/syrias-sharaa-vows-to-protect-druze-rights-as-ceasefire-holds' target='_blank'><strong>Syria’s Sharaa vows to protect Druze rights as ceasefire holds</strong></a><br><p>Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa promised to protect the rights of Druze citizens on Thursday as a ceasefire appeared to be holding in the country’s south following US intervention to end fighting between government forces and Druze fighters.
Overnight, the government’s troops withdrew from the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, where scores of people have been killed in days of conflict pitting local fighters against the Damascus authorities and Bedouin tribes.
The violence in Syria escalated sharply on Wednesday as Israel launched airstrikes in Damascus while pressing attacks on government forces in the south, demanding they withdraw and saying Israel aimed to protect Syria’s Druze minority.
 
 

Describing Syria’s new rulers as “barely disguised jihadists”, Israel has bombed repeatedly this year, saying it will not allow Syrian government forces to deploy into areas near its frontier.
Facing calls from Israel’s own Druze minority to shield Syria’s Druze, Israel has also seized ground in the south.
In a speech to the Syrian nation on Thursday, Sharaa said Israel had “consistently targeted our stability and created discord among us since the fall of the former regime”, accusing it of seeking to “dismantle the unity of our people”.
Reuters footage showed Syrian forces moving out of Sweida overnight. The situation in Sweida was calm on Thursday morning, according to two people in contact with residents there.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late on Wednesday that the United States had engaged all the parties involved.
“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight,” he said on social media.
 






The violence has underlined the challenges that Sharaa faces in stabilising Syria and exerting centralised rule over the country, despite his warming ties with the United States and his administration’s evolving security contacts with Israel.
In his first televised statement after the outbreak of violence, Sharaa said protecting Druze citizens and their rights was “our priority” and rejected any attempt to drag Druze citizens into the hands of an “external party”.
“We have spent our lives facing challenges and defending our people, but we have put the interests of the Syrians before chaos and destruction,” he said.

“We will not allow southern Syria to become a terror stronghold,” said Eyal Zamir, Israel’s military chief of staff.
The United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday to address the conflict, diplomats said.
“The council must condemn the barbaric crimes committed against innocent civilians on Syrian soil,” said Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely against any terrorist threat on its borders, anywhere and at any time.”
The Syrian Network for Human Rights said 193 people had been killed in this week’s violence, including six women and six children.
Sharaa faces challenges to stitch Syria back together in the face of deep misgivings from groups that fear “Islamist rule”. In March, mass killings of members of the Alawite minority exacerbated the mistrust.
 
 

Druze, followers of a religion that is an offshoot of Islam, are spread between Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
Scores of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence on Wednesday, linking up with Druze on the Syrian side.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border.
The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed.</p><small>2025-07-17 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1711453083c9d20.jpg?r=114643' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924755/paf-to-showcase-advanced-jf-17-thunder-jets-at-uk-airshow' target='_blank'><strong>PAF to showcase advanced JF-17 Thunder jets at UK airshow</strong></a><br><p>A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) featuring the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets arrived in the United Kingdom to take part in the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025, a statement from the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
RIAT, which will run from July 18 to 20, is one of the world’s largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its website.
A PAF contingent comprising “state-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, has landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford, United Kingdom, to participate in the prestigious” RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.

“PAF’s participation in RIAT, one of the world’s largest military airshows, underscores Pakistan Air Force’s commitment to showcasing its professional excellence, operational capability and the indigenous strength of its aviation industry,” the ISPR highlighted.
Adding to the operational significance of this international deployment, Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.
“The intricate refuelling operation demonstrated PAF’s long-range operational capabilities and the proficiency of its air and ground crew in conducting extended operations beyond national borders.
“JF-17 Block-III is an EASA Radar and Long Range BVR equipped 4.5 generation multi-role fighter aircraft which is capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions, bolstering airpower application in the face of contemporary challenges, thereby strengthening national security,” the statement added.
In May, when Pakistan downed 5 Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the Pakistan-India conflict, the PAF formally acknowledged a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down the jets.
The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.
“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.
“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p><small>2025-07-17 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/17084501fd09fba.jpg?r=084522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924724/us-firms-eye-investment-in-pakistans-port-sector' target='_blank'><strong>US firms eye investment in Pakistan’s port sector</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: Over 65 US companies joined a landmark webinar on Wednesday to explore commercial opportunities at Karachi Port and Port Qasim.
The webinar hosted by the US Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration and the US Department of State, in collaboration with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, part of the ‘Gateways to Growth: South Asia Port Opportunities’ series, has opened new doors for American commercial services in the port sector of Pakistan.
The webinar served as a strategic platform for American companies to engage directly with Pakistani port officials and private operators.
 






“US investors have made substantial contributions to Pakistan’s development, and we are confident that the port sector will be another area where we can achieve great success together,” said US Consul General Scott Urbom in Karachi, emphasising the role of partnership in fostering long-term commercial ties.
“We believe that by working together, we can unlock the full potential of Pakistan’s port sector, create new opportunities for American businesses, and contribute to Pakistan’s economic development,” he said.
Senior representatives from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Port Qasim Authority, Abu Dhabi Ports, which operates Karachi Gateway Terminal Ltd, and Dubai Ports World, which operates Qasim International Container Terminal, outlined Pakistan’s infrastructure goals, regulatory landscape, and trade priorities, and participated in the webinar.
 
 

The hybrid session highlighted how American firms can support Pakistan’s port development plans, helping expedite trade flows and build new supply chain linkages between our countries.
Ean Hundley, Director of ICT and Infrastructure Policy at the US International Development Finance Corporation, noted, “This initiative equips US companies with market intelligence and direct access to local decision-makers, enabling them to capitalise on infrastructure opportunities across South Asia.”

The KCCI has installed hoardings and billboards across major arteries of Karachi announcing the complete strike, with slogans demanding respect for taxpayers “instead of handcuffs”.
Despite the formation of a high-level committee by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to hold consultations with traders on budgetary measures aimed at documenting the economy, the KCCI leadership remains resolute in its decision. The committee, comprised of multiple stakeholders, has been tasked with conducting a 30-day consultation process to formulate a consensus-based proposal for submission to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
Mr Bilwani said the strike decision was reaffirmed following an unproductive meeting with the finance minister, where key demands to suspend five major anti-business measures were left unaddressed. These demands include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, which grant sweeping powers of arrest and prosecution to tax officials; repeal of Section 21(S), which imposes penalties on cash transactions of Rs200,000 or more; abolition of Section 40C, mandating the e-Bilty system for goods transport; rollback of SRO 709, which enforces a flawed digital invoicing system; and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.

In a statement, Mr Bilwani criticised those spreading rumours about the strike, stating that such elements have no affiliation with the movement and are not part of the consultative process.
He stressed that the strike call was the result of extensive discussions with presidents and representatives of leading chambers of commerce and industry from all four provinces.
He further clarified that any decision to defer or cancel the strike would only be made through mutual consensus and formally announced at a joint press conference attended by all supporting chambers. “No decision will be made unilaterally or behind closed doors,” he assured.
Mr Bilwani lashed out at those disseminating false narratives, calling them enemies of the business community attempting to derail a unified national cause. He reaffirmed that preparations for the strike are complete across the country and appealed to industrialists, wholesalers, shopkeepers, and traders to stand in solidarity with the movement for the sake of the economy and the nation.
He concluded by urging the business community and the public to disregard misinformation and rely solely on official announcements issued by the KCCI and its legitimate partners.
