On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan, who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh presided over today’s hearing of the case registered at the Samanabad police on May 9, 2023.
PTI legal team head Malik Khalid Shafiq confirmed today’s court decision to Dawn.com. He said that out of the total 109 accused, 59 were handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and 16 were given three years’ jail time.
PTI leaders Zartaj Gul, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rasheed), Ashraf Khan Sohna,  Rai Hassan Nawaz, Rai Murtaza Iqbal were among those convicted.
All of these PTI leaders were also convicted in other May 9 cases on July 31.
 
 

Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, who quit PTI in the wake of the May 9 incidents, and MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi) were among those freed of the charges today.
Fawad and Zain had also been acquitted in three other Faisalabad cases pertaining to the May 9 riots.
PTI parliamentarians convicted would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
The deadline given to ATCs to decide various May 9 cases had already passed earlier this month. Therefore, day-to-day hearings were being held in the case, according to PTI lawyer Shafiq.
Last week, the Kasur Crime Control Department (CCD) presented former Faisalabad Civil Lines station house officer Zeeshan Khalid Randhawa as a witness during the trial. The former SHO was already under arrest in a separate kidnap and murder case of a Kasur resident.
A joint investigation team probing the case had been summoned by an ATC in July 2024 to submit the charge sheet.
Sentences against opposition pile up
Today’s convictions are the latest in a slew of ATC sentences, wherein over 100 PTI leaders and workers have been handed lengthy jail terms.
On July 22, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at Sherpao Bridge. However, incarcerated Shah Mahmood Qureshi and five others were acquitted.
 
 

The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced as many as 32 accused, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in a case registered at the Musakhel police station.
On July 31, a Faisalabad ATC had senten­ced over 100 PTI leaders and workers to up to 10 years’ imprisonment in three cases. Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among key opposition leaders handed 10 years’ jail time.
In one case, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted. In another case, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, while one person received a three-year sentence and 77 were acquitted.
On August 1, a Sargodha ATC sentenced PTI worker Muham­mad Ismail to rigorous life imprisonment in May 9 cases related to an attack on the judicial complex in Mianwali and declared 50 others as proclaimed offenders.</p><small>2025-08-25 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251359025df6ea8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937109/fitch-maintains-its-rating-on-india-citing-strong-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Fitch maintains its rating on India, citing strong growth</strong></a><br><p>Credit-rating firm Fitch on Monday maintained its long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating on India at ‘BBB-’, citing the country’s strong economic growth and resilient external finances.
“India’s economic outlook remains strong relative to peers, even as momentum has moderated in the past two years,” Fitch said in a statement.
The agency forecast GDP growth of 6.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (FY26), unchanged from FY25, and well above the ‘BBB’ median of 2.5pc.
Fitch’s rating comes days after S&P Global Ratings lifted its sovereign credit rating on India, citing strong economic growth, marking its first upgrade in 18 years.
Economic Affairs Secretary Anuradha Thakur had then said she expects other rating agencies to take note of the factors behind S&P’s upgrade and follow suit.
Domestic demand will remain “solid”, helped by the government’s ongoing capital spending drive and steady private consumption, Fitch said, but flagged that private investment will remain moderate due to risks from US tariffs.
US President Donald Trump has threatened to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50pc — among the highest rates imposed on Washington’s trade partners — targeting India’s oil purchases from Russia. The 50pc tariffs are set to kick in from August 27.
 
 

“US tariffs are a moderate downside risk to our forecast,” Fitch said, adding that they will reduce India’s ability to benefit from supply chain shifts out of China if tariff levels fail to be negotiated lower.
“Proposed goods and services tax (GST) reforms, if adopted, would support consumption, offsetting some of these growth risks,” Fitch added, referring to the tax restructuring promises made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month.</p><small>2025-08-25 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25135230df0604a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937108/sabalenka-djokovic-win-before-medvedev-tirade-sparks-chaos-at-us-open' target='_blank'><strong>Sabalenka, Djokovic win before Medvedev tirade sparks chaos at US Open</strong></a><br><p>Aryna Sabalenka and Novak Djokovic overcame early tests to reach the US Open second round before the Grand Slam descended into chaos late on Sunday when Daniil Medvedev launched a tirade at the match umpire and fans disrupted his opponent’s service game.
New York’s famously rowdy fans caused a six-minute delay by refusing to stop jeering and booing midway through Medvedev’s 6-3 7-5 6-7(5) 0-6 6-4 defeat by Benjamin Bonzi on Louis Armstrong Stadium.
The controversy began when a photographer entered the court prematurely after Bonzi missed his first serve on match point at 5-4 in the third set, prompting chair umpire Greg Allensworth to award the Frenchman another first serve for the disturbance.
An incensed Medvedev exploded at the official and whipped up the crowd, preventing a rattled Bonzi from serving.

Medvedev, the 2021 champion at Flushing Meadows, fought off the match point and took the set in a tie break before bageling Bonzi in the fourth to set up a decider.
It was not to be his day, however, as Bonzi composed himself to secure a dramatic win.
“The energy was wild. Thanks to all the ones booing. Thanks for the energy in the fifth,” the Frenchman said.
“It was crazy match point in the third. A crazy scenario. I was exhausted in the fourth set. I gave what I had in the final set. That’s a crazy win.”
 






Sunday start
Under the tournament’s new extended 15-day format, first-round singles action is being contested from Sunday to Tuesday rather than over two days as in previous years, spreading out the star attractions and allowing access for another 70,000-odd spectators.
World number one Sabalenka was among the marquee names on the opening day’s schedule and the Belarusian fed off the vocal Arthur Ashe crowd to overcome determined Swiss Rebeka Masarova 7-5 6-1.
“I didn’t choose to play on Sunday, but if you win the match, it feels great. You have an extra day off, which can be good and bad. I’ve got used to it. I like it,” Sabalenka said.
“But it only works when you win the match. Imagine if you finish the tournament on Sunday. Then you can be a little bit frustrated with the scheduling.”
Novak Djokovic has had plenty of time to recuperate after his run to the Wimbledon semi-finals but the Serb needed to find an extra gear to battle past Learner Tien 6-1 7-6(3) 6-2 as he launched his latest bid for a record 25th major title.
Victory in draining conditions under the lights made Djokovic the first player since the sport turned professional in 1968 to win 75 straight opening-round matches at Grand Slams.
Americans Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton enjoyed more straightforward wins.
Last year’s finalist Fritz beat compatriot Emilio Nava 7-5 6-2 6-3 while 2023 semi-finalist Ben Shelton eased past Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse 6-3 6-2 6-4.
Fourth seed Fritz and sixth seed Shelton have emerged as two of the brightest hopes to end a 22-year U.S. men’s drought at their home major, as their women’s counterparts have long carried the torch for American tennis.
Different feel
Emma Raducanu, the first qualifier to win the tournament four years ago, moved into the second round for the first time since hoisting the trophy when the Briton beat Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1 6-2.
“I did feel different coming into it this year,” said Raducanu, who lost in the first round in 2022 and 2024.
“I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it’s in the back of your head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.”
 






Canada’s Leylah Fernandez, who lost to Raducanu in the final four years ago, defeated compatriot Rebecca Marino 6-2 6-1 while 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova saw off Oksana Selekhmeteva 6-3 7-6(3).
Former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko made smooth progress with a 6-4 6-3 win over Chinese qualifier Wang Xiyu before last year’s New York runner-up Jessica Pegula got past Mayar Sherif 6-0 6-4.
There were a handful of surprises, as qualifier Janice Tjen earned Indonesia’s first victory in a Grand Slam main draw in 22 years when she knocked out 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4 4-6 6-4 to book a match-up with Raducanu.
Alexandra Eala of the Philippines got the crowd on their feet as she battled back from 1-5 in the deciding set to defeat Denmark’s 14th seed Clara Tauson 6-3 2-6 7-6(11) at the Grandstand.

Torrential rains on August 19 had flooded neighbourhoods, severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, left people stranded on roads for hours, disrupted industrial operations and led to prolonged power outages.
Thoroughfares are still riddled with potholes, exposing the devastation of Karachi’s road network and posing serious dangers to commuters across the metropolis.
 
 

Subsequently, as Karachiites left their homes for offices and schools this morning, they faced hurdles caused by accumulated rainwater and “development work” being carried out to repair the ruined roads, as reported by the traffic police.
Areas in the Malir, East and Korangi districts were affected, with locations including the busy thoroughfare of Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road near Shaheen Complex.
Dawn.com staffers also reported traffic congestion near Shaheen Complex and on Sharea Faisal at around 10am.
To avoid hassle and inconvenience, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) urged commuters to call the 1915 helpline for alternative routes.
At around 12pm, Google Maps showed most main arteries as having light traffic flow. However, multiple road blockages were reported across the city, notably in locations where roads had been inundated due to rainwater.
 

This Google Maps screengrab shows traffic flow across Karachi at around 12pm on Aug 25, 2025.

Following the recent heavy downpour, roads located within the territorial jurisdictions of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, cantonment boards, Karachi Development Authority, various town municipal corporations and other land-controlling agencies are in damaged condition.
Vital arteries impacted include both tracks of Shahrah-i-Sher Shah Suri, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, University Road, S.M. Taufiq Road, Jahangir Road, Manghopir Road, Shahrah-i-Qaddafi.
Other key arteries, including M.A. Jinnah and I.I. Chundrigar Road, also have cracks.
On the stretch adjacent to Burns Garden on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road, rains have created a deep crater, raising questions about the authorities’ ability to maintain some of the busiest and most vital thoroughfares of the metropolis.
In an update at 7:37am, the traffic police said “development work on potholes” was being done on the second track of Natha Khan Bridge going towards the airport.
However, the statement said there was “no traffic problem” as vehicles passed through the sides.
 






In the Malir district, Madras Chowk heading to Sachal Goth and Muhammad Khan Goth and on Suparco Road, was blocked for traffic at 8:43am as “drain development work” was underway.
“Traffic is being diverted to other roads on both sides. Due to both roads being blocked, there’s traffic pressure at Madras Chowk,” the KTP said.
 






For similar work, both roads in front of Huma Lawn near Shaheen Chowk on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed were also closed for traffic at around 9am.
Commuters were being diverted towards Jang Press from Shaheen Complex and from S.M. Law College as well.
 






At the same time, slow traffic flow was reported at Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Johar as developmental work was being carried out on the underpass.
 






Another point impacted by accumulated rainwater and potholes was Checkpost No. 6 towards Tank Chowk near Malir Cantonment. The traffic police said it was managing the “slow” traffic flow.
 






Slow traffic flow was also reported at the main Superhighway in front of Sachal Mor before the Punjab Adda bus stand. The Frontier Works Organisation was carrying out cleaning on the first track, the KTP said.
 






Rainwater accumulation and potholes also caused traffic delays on Kashif Shaheed Chowk going towards Jamali Bridge on Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi Road at 9:18am, as vehicles were moving via a single track.
 






Bagh-i-Korangi Road from Awami Cut to Mazaar Cut was closed for traffic at 9:20am due to damage and flooding. “Traffic is being diverted to another road with double traffic,” the police said.
 






At 10:35am, traffic was moving at a slow speed on EBM Causeway heading towards Baloch Colony and Brookes Chowrangi, with KTP citing rainwater accumulation and potholes on the road as the reasons.
 






Slow traffic was also witnessed at Drigh Road Underpass, which had been closed for traffic due to rainwater last week, at 11:33am as Karachi Cantonment Board was doing drainage work.

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed over 62,000 people and injured 157,951, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The United Nations warned last week that with Israeli forces blocking aid, half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza, with famine conditions likely to spread further across the Strip. Meanwhile, Israel has continued its bombardment after approving a plan to seize control of Gaza City, calling it the “last bastion of Hamas.”
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar […] has arrived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in the 21st Extraordinary Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) being held today at the OIC Secretariat in Jeddah,” the FO said in the statement.
“The DPM/FM was received at the King Abdulaziz International Airport Jeddah by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to OIC, Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah, Khalid Majid.”
 






It added that the session will bring together foreign ministers and senior officials from the OIC member states to deliberate on coordinated responses to the escalating developments in Palestine, arising from the ongoing Israeli military aggression, proposed plans for full military control over Gaza, and the continuing egregious violations of Palestinian rights.
Yesterday, the FO said FM Dar will reject Israel’s “outrageous” plan to occupy Gaza at the extraordinary session and emphasise the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian assistance.
“He will reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering support for Palestine and reiterate its principled stance and call for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, most notably, the establishment of an independent, contiguous, and sovereign Palestinian state,” it said.
The OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organisation after the United Nations, with 57 member states. It was established in September 1969 in response to the Israeli terrorist attacks on Al Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem.
As a founding member, Pakistan has been at the forefront of the OIC’s efforts to champion Muslim causes — from freedom of the Palestinian and Kashmiri peoples struggling under foreign occupation, to upholding the rights of Muslims in Myanmar and Bosnia, to ending conflicts in Muslim lands such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Libya.
‘Complete control’ of Gaza
Last week, Tel Aviv approved a plan to seize control of Gaza City, describing it as the last bastion of Hamas.
Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to press on with the offensive on the city where famine has been declared, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. Katz has said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas agrees to Israel’s terms.
Hamas said Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it wasn’t serious about a ceasefire, saying that a ceasefire agreement was the only way to return the Israeli prisoners, holding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for their lives.
The proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners held in Gaza and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Once a temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining Israeli prisoners.
Netanyahu said last Thursday that Israel would immediately resume negotiations for the release of all 50 Israeli prisoners held by Hamas — of whom Israel believes around 20 are still living, and an end to the nearly two-year-old war but on terms acceptable to Israel.
‘Manmade’ famine
According to a report released last week by the Famine Review Committee of the United Nations’ Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made” and could be “halted and reversed”, but it required an “immediate, at-scale response” to do so.
“The time for debate and hesitation has passed; starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the committee said in a report.
“There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay — even by days — will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.”
The report also warned that avoidable deaths would “increase exponentially” unless a ceasefire was implemented to allow in humanitarian aid and restore the delivery of food and basic supplies to Gaza’s population immediately.
Pakistan dispatches aid
Meanwhile, a fresh consignment of 100 tons of relief goods was dispatched to Palestine from the Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore via a special flight on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, marking the 21st consignment dispatched for the people of Gaza, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The consignment includes ration bags, ready-to-eat meals, and canned fruits to meet the urgent food needs of the Palestinian people. With this dispatch, the total volume of aid sent by Pakistan to Gaza has reached 2,027 tons through 21 consignments, the report said.</p><small>2025-08-25 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251110093639330.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937091/world-bank-approves-479m-grant-to-improve-punjab-primary-education-enrolment' target='_blank'><strong>World bank approves $47.9m grant to improve Punjab primary education, enrolment</strong></a><br><p>The World Bank on Monday approved a $47.9 million grant to improve primary education in Punjab, saying the project will expand early childhood schooling, re-enrol out-of-school children and strengthen teacher support.
The move came over a month after the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the World Bank teams conducted the 12th and final mission to review and evaluate progress against the targets set under the Higher Education Development in Pakistan (HEDP) project.
“The World Bank has approved a US$47.9 million grant, funded by the Global Partnership for Education Fund, to help improve girls’ and boys’ participation at pre-primary and primary levels in Pakistan’s Punjab province,” the organisation said in a press release dated August 23, shared on social media today.
According to the press release, the GRADES-Balochistan project will also improve the responsiveness of the education sector to climate change and emergencies.
Among the four million children that the project aims to benefit are 80,000 out-of-school children, over 3m in School Education Department (SED) schools, 850,000 in the non-formal sector, and 140,000 differently-abled children in Special Education Department (SpED) schools, it said.
The World Bank added that over 100,000 teachers and school leaders, as well as parents and community members, would benefit through professional development and awareness campaigns.
“The project is aligned with the Government of Punjab’s broader education reform agenda, which seeks to create a more effective, accountable, and inclusive education system,” said Izza Farrakh, World Bank Task Team Leader for the project, according to the release. “It will do so by supporting the government’s efforts to improve governance, management, and capacity in the education sector.“
Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, called the project a “crucial step towards addressing learning poverty and ensuring equitable access to quality education across Punjab”.
The statement added that the project targeted those populations that were most vulnerable, in line with the group’s goals of eliminating extreme poverty and the promotion of “shared prosperity” and its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) with Pakistan.
It highlighted that Pakistan had been a member of the World Bank since 1950 and that since this time, the World Bank had provided over $48.3bn to the country in assistance.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, had invested approximately $13bn in Pakistan since 1956, it added. The projects it funded supported renewable energy, financial inclusion, infrastructure, healthcare and agribusiness, among others.
The current portfolio has 54 projects and a total commitment of $15.7bn.
In June, the World Bank had ap­­proved $100m for the “Getting Results: Access and Delivery of Quality Education Services in Balochistan” (GRADES-Balochistan) project, which aimed to benefit around 250,000 students by increasing enrolment and improving literacy.</p><small>2025-08-25 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/151459037c464d2.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930661/why-pakistani-students-feel-unheard-and-what-can-change-that' target='_blank'><strong>Why Pakistani students feel unheard — and what can change that</strong></a><br><p>Across Pakistan’s higher education landscape, an underexplored challenge is quietly taking root: the growing disconnect between university administrations and their students.
Universities in Pakistan have made commendable strides in expanding access and infrastructure. Yet, between those who run these institutions and those who fill their classrooms, an invisible gap persists — one of dialogue, and mediation, subtle enough to escape daily notice, but powerful enough to shape policy, campus culture, and the student experience itself.
In recent years, Pakistan’s student population has surged. Enrolment in higher education crossed 2 million in 2022-23, up from 1.58 million in 2017-18, according to the Higher Education Commission (HEC). With this growth has come greater diversity not only in socioeconomic backgrounds, but in expectations, communication styles, and cultural references.
Many university administrations, however, remain rooted in older institutional traditions, shaped by administrative norms that were designed for smaller, more homogeneous cohorts. As the social, digital, and cultural profile of Pakistani youth evolves, so too must the ways universities connect, communicate, and collaborate with their students.
 
 

Autonomy and governance
One of the central structural issues is the lack of formal mediation bodies or consistent platforms for dialogue. Without these, students are left to navigate opaque decision-making processes on their own, while administrators handle policy and discipline without structured feedback. This results in a mutual sense of disconnect — students feel unheard, and institutions operate in the dark, unable to anticipate or fully grasp the concerns of the very people they serve.
Unlike in many other countries, Pakistani universities are governed by individual institutional charters. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) sets minimum academic and administrative standards but grants universities considerable autonomy in how they govern themselves.
Under the HEC’s 2002 Ordinance, degree-awarding institutions are authorised to craft their own statutes, including rules on governance, student conduct, and disciplinary proceedings. While this autonomy encourages innovation and accountability, it also creates inconsistencies in how student affairs are handled. Some universities have clear grievance redressal policies; others lack accessible processes or dedicated forums for dialogue. As a result, the quality of governance often depends entirely on internal policy choices.
The legal vacuum in student representation
Adding to this complexity is the legal status of student representation. Since the 1984 ban on student unions, formal avenues for student voices have been limited. While the ban may have contributed to greater campus stability at the time, its long-term effect has been the absence of structured, representative dialogue between students and university leadership.
In March 2024, the Supreme Court, in Judgment No. 7 of 2024, acknowledged the importance of student representation in university governance and called for clearer regulatory frameworks to safeguard against politicisation. The ruling has reignited policy debates but has not addressed the broader challenge of how universities can integrate student perspectives through neutral, accountable mechanisms. In their absence, students often resort to social media or informal channels to voice grievances — a practice that can further widen the trust gap between administrations and the student body.
This policy vacuum is especially concerning in a sector where unmanaged tensions can escalate rapidly. A 2022 study by the Institute of Social and Policy Sciences (I-SAPS) found that over 70 per cent of students in public-sector universities felt they lacked adequate platforms to raise concerns about academic policies, housing conditions, or campus life. In private universities, student satisfaction was generally higher, yet the perception of having limited influence over policy decisions remained a recurrent theme.
 
 

Comparative legal models
International models offer useful points of reference. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the Education Act 1994 requires universities to engage students through formally recognised student unions and academic representation systems. In the United States, many institutions maintain Ombuds offices — neutral, confidential spaces where students can raise concerns and seek mediation. These bodies are neither adversarial nor political; their sole mandate is to preserve institutional harmony by ensuring students are heard and administrators remain informed.
In Pakistan, by contrast, such institutional forums are rare. While a few private universities have experimented with town hall meetings, feedback portals, and faculty–student liaison committees, these initiatives are often ad hoc and lack legal recognition. As student populations grow and digital communication accelerates the flow of information, informal mechanisms alone are unlikely to suffice. Universities must now consider whether structured, legally backed forums for mediation can complement governance structures and build trust without undermining institutional authority.
The benefits of such mechanisms go beyond procedure. When students feel heard, they are more inclined to follow institutional policies, engage in academic initiatives, and contribute to a healthier campus culture. Likewise, administrators with access to real-time student feedback can make better-informed decisions, reducing the risk of resistance, misunderstandings, or policy missteps.
Legally, there is room to explore this middle ground. Section 10 of the HEC’s Model Charter for Private Universities encourages the creation of academic councils with student representation, albeit limited to academic matters. Extending this principle into wider aspects of campus life — without even reverting to politicised structures — could be a useful starting point. Similarly, grievance redressal systems under the HEC’s Quality Assurance Framework could be expanded to include student mediation cells, with representation from both students and faculty.
Risks of ignoring the mediation gap
Today, universities grapple with a host of challenges — from regulatory compliance to financial sustainability. Yet neglecting student–administration relations risks brewing long-term tensions that could erode institutional cohesion.
As Pakistan’s higher education sector seeks to compete globally and serve a younger, more connected generation, the lack of structured mediation mechanisms is poised to become an ever greater governance liability.
Furthermore, unresolved grievances can invite litigation under constitutional provisions on equality (Article 25) or due process (Article 10-A), especially when disciplinary actions are perceived as arbitrary. If grievance management continues to be inconsistent and opaque, it could potentially undermine public confidence in higher education governance.
 
 

It is important to clarify that the case for mediation is not a critique of existing governance structures, many of which have adapted to manage complex academic ecosystems with limited resources. Rather, it is an acknowledgment of the changing nature of student engagement, and the growing need for responsive institutional frameworks that reflect this shift.
Building such systems does not require sweeping legislation or major structural change. It simply requires recognising that, when thoughtfully institutionalised, dialogue can be a source of stability, not disruption. Universities that anticipate and manage student expectations through transparent, participatory forums are far better positioned to thrive in an increasingly complex educational environment.
In a country where education is both a constitutional right and a cornerstone of national progress, fostering genuine partnership between students and universities is a legal and strategic necessity. Ensuring they work in concert, rather than in conflict, may prove to be one of the most vital reforms yet to shape the future of Pakistan’s higher education.

The Indian government has been considering projects since the early 2000s to control the flow of water from Tibet’s Angsi Glacier, which sustains more than 100 million people downstream in China, India and Bangladesh.
But the plans have been hindered by fierce and occasionally violent resistance from residents of the border state of Arunachal Pradesh, who fear their villages will be submerged and way of life destroyed by any dam.
Then in December, China announced that it would build the world’s largest hydropower dam in a border county just before the Yarlung Zangbo river crosses into India.
That triggered fears in New Delhi that its longtime strategic rival — which has some territorial claims in Arunachal Pradesh — could weaponise its control of the river, which originates in the Angsi Glacier and is known as the Siang and Brahmaputra in India.
India’s largest hydropower company in May moved survey materials under armed police protection near a prospective site of the Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam, which would be the country’s biggest dam, if completed.
Senior Indian officials have also been holding meetings about accelerating construction this year, including one organised in July by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.
Delhi’s concerns were described in the undated Indian government analysis of the Chinese dam’s impact, the specifics of which Reuters corroborated with four sources and is reporting for the first time.
Beijing hasn’t released detailed plans about the dam’s construction, but the analysis drew on past work conducted by Indian government-affiliated institutions like the Central Water Commission and accounted for the expected size of the Chinese project, which broke ground in July and will cost nearly $170 billion.
Delhi estimates the Chinese dam will allow Beijing to divert as much as 40 billion cubic meters of water, or just over a third of what is received annually at a key border point, according to the sources and the document.
The impact would be especially acute in the non-monsoon months, when temperatures rise and lands become barren across swathes of India.
The Upper Siang project would alleviate that with its projected 14 BCM of storage capacity, allowing India to release water during the dry season. That could mean the major regional city of Guwahati, which is dependent on water-intensive industry and farming, would see a reduction in supply of 11pc, according to the sources and the document, as opposed to 25pc if the Indian dam isn’t built.
The project could also mitigate any move by Beijing to release devastating torrents of water downstream, the sources said.
If the dam is at its minimum drawdown level — where water is stored at less than 50pc of its height — it would be able to fully absorb any excess water released from a breach in Chinese infrastructure, according to the document and the sources.
India is considering a proposal to keep 30pc of its dam empty at any time in order to account for unexpected surges, two of the sources said.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that the hydropower projects “have undergone rigorous scientific research on safety and environmental protection, and will not adversely impact the water resources, ecology, or geology of downstream countries.”
“China has always maintained a responsible attitude toward the development and utilisation of transboundary rivers, and has maintained long-term communication and cooperation with downstream countries such as India and Bangladesh,” the spokesperson added.
Modi’s office and the Indian ministries responsible for water and external affairs did not respond to Reuters’ questions. State-owned hydropower major NHPC also did not return a request for comment.
India’s foreign ministry has said that top diplomat S. Jaishankar raised concerns about the dam during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on August 18. A Jaishankar deputy also told lawmakers in August that the government was implementing measures to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of citizens in downstream areas, including building the dam.
India has itself been accused by Pakistan, a Chinese ally that it briefly clashed with in May, of weaponising water. Delhi this year suspended its participation in a 1960 water-sharing treaty with Islamabad and is considering diverting flows from another crucial river away from its downstream neighbour.
An international tribunal has ruled that India must adhere to the agreement but Delhi says the panel lacks jurisdiction.
 

India aims to construct a dam in its northeast to mitigate the potential impacts of a massive dam being built across the border in China.

Development or destruction?
When NHPC workers moved surveying materials near the village of Parong in May, angry locals damaged their machinery, destroyed a nearby bridge and looted the tents of police sent to guard the operation.
Many of them are members of Arunachal’s Adi community, who live off paddy, orange and sweet lime farms in the mist-shrouded hills and valleys nourished by the Siang.
The villagers have set up makeshift watch posts on regional roads to deny access to NHPC workers. That has forced security personnel to trek miles, often under the cover of night, to reach a prospective site of the dam.
At least 16 Adi villages are likely to be lost to the storage area of the dam, directly affecting an estimated 10,000 people, according to two of the sources.
Community leaders say more than 100,000 people will be impacted overall.
“The cardamom, paddy, jackfruit and pear we grow on this land help educate our children and support our family,” said Odoni Palo Pabin, an Adi grocer and mother of two. “We will fight the dam to death.”
The dam has the support of Arunachal’s chief minister, who is a member of Modi’s party and has called the Chinese project an existential threat.
The project will “ensure water security and provide flood moderation to counter any potential water surges,” the state government said in a statement, adding that it decided in June to engage in detailed compensation discussions with families that could be affected by the dam.
Lawmaker Alo Libang, an Adi who represents an area that would be submerged by the Indian project, said he believed locals could be convinced to move if they received generous compensation.
NHPC has plans to spend more than $3 million on education and emergency infrastructure to incentivise the villagers to move elsewhere, three of the sources said, citing instructions from Modi’s office.
In one sign of progress, three villages in the area recently agreed to let NHPC officials carry out dam-related work, according to the Arunachal government and dozens of locals.
India has a history of activist movements against large dams, which have sometimes slowed these projects by years or forced them to scale down.
Even if the Upper Siang dam gets the go-ahead, it could take a decade to build after breaking ground, according to four of the sources.
That means the project would likely be completed after China’s project, which Beijing expects to start generating power by the early-to-mid 2030s.
The delay means an Indian project would be vulnerable during construction if Beijing suddenly releases water during the monsoon season, triggering a surge that could wash away temporary dams, two of the sources said.
International experts and Adi activists have also warned that building large dams in seismically active Tibet and Arunachal could heighten risks for downstream communities.
The Chinese “dam is being built in a zone of high seismicity and in a zone that experiences extreme weather events,” said Sayanangshu Modak, an expert on the India-China water relationship at the University of Arizona.
“These kinds of extreme weather events trigger landslides, mudslides, glacial lake outburst flooding,” he said. “So that raises concerns about dam safety… it’s a very legitimate concern, and India should engage with China.”</p><small>2025-08-25 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2507574086bceb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936966/centre-kp-seem-to-be-on-same-page-on-nfc-tweaks' target='_blank'><strong>Centre, KP seem to be on ‘same page’ on NFC tweaks</strong></a><br><p>• First meeting of 11th NFC scheduled for Friday
• PTI’s Muzammil Aslam says KP will seek disincentivising  population, propose prosperity and forestation as criteria for  resource distribution
• KP minister rues imbalance in Centre’s approach to smaller provinces
NATHIA GALI: For a change, the federal government led by the PML-N and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government headed by the PTI seem to be in agreement on changes to the oversized population factor in determining the share of the federation and its federating units under the new National Finance Commission (NFC), set to hold its introductory meeting later this week.
“We will demand that population and backwardness should be disincentivised for resource distribution among the provinces,” said KP Mini­ster for Finance Muzammil Aslam while speaking at the first two-day ‘Prosper Pakistan’ conference organised by the FPCCI Regional Office Peshawar in collaboration with KP’s Board of Investment and Trade.
 


The federal ministers, particularly development minister Ahsan Iqbal, had been publicly calling for disincentivising the population for NFC shares, although no political party in any province has ever called for the population to secure more funds from the divisible pool. However, the allegations of irregularities in the population census have cropped up in the past, which required improvement in census methodologies. The first meeting of the 11th NFC, constituted last week, has been scheduled for August 29 (Friday) to set the stage for subsequent deliberations.
The apparent converging stance of the two arch rivals — the PML-N and the PTI — is likely to put the two larger provinces, Punjab and Sindh, under immense pressure for disincentivising population as the key determinant for the distribution of divisible pool resources. The revision, however, also benefits Balochistan, the sparsely populated largest province by area.
 
 

Led by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the political partners at the Centre and backed by the relevant quarters, it would be very challenging for junior leaderships of the ruling parties in Sindh and Punjab to resist reducing the importance of population to work out vertical shares of the federation and its federation units and then decide horizontal shares of the provinces.
Mr Muzammil said the KP government would demand changes in the formula of the horizontal resource distribution within the federating units during the upcoming NFC deliberations. He said 82pc resource distribution among the provinces was based on the population criterion and 10.6pc on the basis of backwardness, but the KP government would now stipulate reduction in population, prosperity, and forestation as criteria for the distribution of resources.
He said the new NFC had been constituted to evolve a consensus on the vertical and horizontal distribution of financial resources. The provinces currently receive 57.5pc share under the vertical formula, while the remaining amount goes to the federal government. He said the KP would demand changes in the criteria for the horizontal distribution as well.
‘Imbalance in development approach’
KP’s finance minister, who hails from Karachi, criticised the federal government, saying the National Highway Authority (NHA) was used for the road and highway projects in Punjab and Sindh, but it ignored the KP and Balochistan.
“This imbalance in the development approach has aggravated the situation in the smaller provinces”, while the planning minister Ahsan Iqbal was talking about the collapse of the federal government in five years due to its financial constraints as the development budgets of Sindh and Punjab exceeded that of the Centre.
 
 

He told the participants that 12 hydropower projects were currently under construction in KP capable of producing 1,000MW at an estimated supply cost of 8 US cents per unit. However, he said the government had increased the wheeling charges to Rs27 per unit that would block cheaper electricity from the province.
He regretted that the Left Bank Canal could not be constructed in more than three decades since the water apportionment accord was signed in 1991.
Under the 7th NFC award delivered in 2009 and still in force after 15 years instead of a five-year constitutional term, the provincial share had increased to 57.5pc from about 47pc which further increased to about 59pc given special allocations to Balochistan, KP and Sindh on different grounds and reduced the federal share to 42.5pc.
 
 

In subsequent years, the Centre imposed a petroleum levy (about Rs1.5 trillion) on petroleum products and secured about Rs1.5tr cash balances from the provinces on an annual basis, effectively reversing the financial balance to its favour. The Centre, however, has been advocating disincentivising the population factor and provincial shares to common responsibilities like dams, natural disasters, climate change and national security etc.

Achieving this requires substantial investment in job-creating sectors like agriculture and industry, hence the plan to launch Phase II of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) later this month in Beijing.
Official sources also said the prime minister will travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO) summit. Furthermore, he is expected to attend the Pak-China B2B Investment Conference.
According to media reports, preparations for the visit were discussed during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s trip to Pakistan last week for the 6th Strategic Dialogue, where both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the high-quality development of the upgraded China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Without a clear roadmap, strong inter-departmental coordination, sustained security assurance and funding clarity, the reboot of CPEC Phase II may meet the same success as past efforts

This would, however, mark yet another relaunch of ‘CPEC 2.0’, which has already been announced multiple times over the past six years. It was first unveiled in April 2019 by then prime minister Imran Khan at the 2nd Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, with a focus on industrial and agricultural cooperation and socio-economic development.
 
 

It was then relaunched in July 2021 with renewed emphasis on Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and agriculture modernisation, and again in November 2022 by PM Shebaz Sharif during his 1st term in Beijing, where both nations agreed to revive momentum on key projects such as Gwadar Port, the ML-1 railway and SEZs.
However, earlier efforts failed to yield sustained progress due to a variety of reasons, including the pandemic, political instability, economic crises and persistent security challenges.

There are several elements creating a more conducive investment climate, but the success of Marka-e-Haq and Pakistan’s renewed recognition as a close ally by the US have shifted the tide, says Dr Ahmed

Now, Haroon Akhtar, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production, has expressed confidence, citing a shifting global landscape that he believes currently favours Pakistan.
“With macroeconomic indicators stabilising, the time is right to inject fresh momentum into CPEC. The prime minister is visiting China for the SCO summit, but many business-to-business meetings are planned on the sidelines. There is a strong appetite on both sides to advance to the next phase of CPEC, especially as world trade dynamics continue to evolve rapidly,” he noted.
Another member of the economic team, speaking off the record, pointed to both internal and external factors aligning to accelerate progress on CPEC. “There are several elements creating a more conducive investment climate in Pakistan, but I believe the success of ‘Marka-i-Haq’ and Pakistan’s renewed recognition as a close ally by the US have shifted the tide. This has opened up greater space for the government to pursue its economic targets with support from its most dependable partner,” he observed.
 
 

Probably overwhelmed by the pace of global developments and preoccupied with recalibrating business strategies to navigate new challenges and seize emerging opportunities, business tycoons chose to stay silent on an issue that could spark controversy. “At a time when uncertainty is the only certainty, it’s wiser to avoid the risk of appearing overly aligned with either the East or the West. Besides, we already have more on our plates than we can chew,” a senior business leader remarked privately.
“Bulls are raging in the capital market. Pakistan’s credit ratings are being upgraded by agencies like Moody’s and Fitch, the government is celebrating its economic management, the US is easing additional tariffs, and China appears committed to continued support, yet I feel low. Why isn’t my business picking up?” remarked a CEO anonymously. “I am too busy trying to solve this riddle to risk upsetting anyone right now.”
Abdul Aleem, Secretary General, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, shared his perspective: “We believe there is growing recognition, particularly on Pakistan’s side, of the need to capitalise on the economic and investment opportunities CPEC offers. With regional economic and political dynamics evolving, CPEC presents a valuable window of opportunity for both countries. Pakistan needs investment in large-scale manufacturing and infrastructure to boost exports, while China may view Pakistan as a strategic regional partner for relocating some of its mature industries.”
Experts generally expressed cautious optimism. They noted that without a clear roadmap, concrete targets, strong inter-departmental coordination, sustained security assurance and funding clarity, this latest ‘relaunch’ risks becoming the fourth rhetorical reboot of CPEC Phase II. “The difference lies not in intent, but in the sustained execution of the plan,” remarked an official who was previously part of the CPEC team in Islamabad.
 
 

Dr Manzoor Ahmed, Pakistan’s former World Trade Organisation representative, outlined several factors that could improve outcomes this time, including greater political stability, recognition of CPEC as the primary investment driver, stronger forex reserves and a favourable US tariff deal.
Reflecting on the past setbacks during the PMLN tenure, Dr Ahmed cited political instability, default fears, uncertainty around Trump’s stance, budget pressures and regional tensions as major distractions. “The environment has now improved, allowing the government to focus on achieving 4–5pc growth over the next two years,” he noted, nevertheless.

Yet, even as the country seeks external backing, recent events at home — unprecedented rains and flash floods — have exposed deep-seated governance gaps, showing that economic and geopolitical gains may be undermined by internal administrative failures.
The country’s handling of these floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi this month has highlighted that it is governance issues that impose heavier costs on lives, property, and infrastructure than most external shocks.
 
 

Karachi’s urban flooding was not simply a drainage problem; it revealed systemic flaws: poor planning, political exclusion, entrenched corruption, and an absence of effective administration. Citizens were left stranded as services collapsed, underscoring how repeated neglect in disaster response mirrors Pakistan’s broader economic vulnerabilities.
Our recent economic gains — lower inflation and a rising stock market — mask several similarly deep, structural weaknesses that threaten growth. Meeting the government’s 4.2 per cent GDP target in the current fiscal year will be difficult unless these systemic issues are addressed.

Urban flooding reveals serious, systemic flaws in national governance

The threat of political instability remains one of our largest obstacles, undermining good initiatives, fuelling unrest, and eroding investor confidence. In this environment, long-term planning is too difficult, and structural reforms struggle to take root.
The human cost of these structural weaknesses is immense. Families face uncertainty as inflation, unemployment, and inadequate public services erode living standards. Rural communities struggle with poor access to healthcare and education, while urban populations confront congested infrastructure and rising informal settlements. Persistent poverty fuels social unrest, creating a cycle that reinforces economic stagnation.
Addressing these challenges requires policies that are not only economically sound but also politically and socially inclusive, ensuring that growth translates into tangible improvements in daily life. Without this focus on citizens’ well-being, reforms risk being abstract numbers rather than lived progress.
 
 

A concentration of privileges further hinders the economy. Powerful groups benefit from exemptions that cost the treasury Rs5.84 trillion in the last fiscal year, over 50pc more than the previous year, according to a Dawn report based on data from the Economic Survey of Pakistan 2024-25. These exemptions, granted across key sectors, limit resources for social services and infrastructure.
Meanwhile, nearly half the population lives in poverty, with weak social spending and chronic underinvestment in infrastructure keeping demand subdued. Emerging priorities are evident: following a military clash with India, defence spending rose 20pc to Rs2.55tr even as the federal budget spending shrank by roughly 7pc.
The International Monetary Fund remains a critical, if contentious, partner. Bailouts come with strict reform conditions — taxing exempt sectors, cutting subsidies, and rationalising tariffs — that successive governments announce but rarely fully implement. This pattern erodes credibility both at home and abroad.
Industrial production is faltering. Large-scale manufacturing contracted 0.74pc in the last fiscal year against a 3.5pc growth target. The textile sector, still a major employer and exporter, struggles under global competition, while emerging sectors like IT remain too small to offset losses. Energy constraints exacerbate stagnation, with circular debt reaching around Rs2.4 trillion at the end of March 2025, causing load-shedding and unreliable supply. Policy reversals in renewables have further deterred investment.
 
 

The government has proposed a new industrial policy, including corporate tax cuts from 29pc to 26pc over three years, debt restructuring for sick industries, and reforms in corporate and tax laws. Banks are encouraged to forecast industrial distress, but history suggests weak implementation may blunt these measures. Structural bottlenecks — low-value production, complex tariffs, and poor logistics — persist. Even tariff cuts in the budget primarily benefit existing players, leaving small and medium enterprises at a disadvantage.
Fiscal pressures are severe. Debt servicing alone will consume Rs8.2tr in FY26, nearly half of total expenditure, limiting resources for development. Inflation, after peaking at 38pc in May 2023, eased to 4.1pc in July 2025, but the target for FY26 is 7.5pc.
Interest rate cuts from 22pc to 11pc may support growth, yet misalignment between fiscal and monetary policies could reignite inflationary pressures.
In the outgoing fiscal year Pakistan’s savings rate stands at 14.1pc of GDP, with investment at 13.8pc, creating a gap that necessitates external financing. Projections for FY26 show savings at 14.3pc against investment at 14.7pc, still leaving a gap to be filled with external inflows. Foreign direct investment stood around $2.5bn in the last fiscal year, much below Pakistan’s potential and slightly above one-tenth of the external financing gap.
Industrial stagnation and fiscal-monetary discord are mutually reinforcing. Industry cannot revive without affordable credit, reliable energy, and supportive taxation, while fiscal stability depends on stronger industrial growth and competitive exports.
Yet opportunities remain. The information technology sector, though small, is expanding by double digits, with global outsourcing demand offering potential for job creation and foreign exchange earnings.
 
 

Agriculture, if modernised with technology and value-added, could provide both export revenue and food security. Renewable energy, despite policy reversals, remains viable given falling global costs and Pakistan’s natural endowment of sun and wind.
The way forward requires politically difficult but economically essential reforms. A progressive tax system, simpler import tariffs, market-determined exchange rates, and efficient public spending could restore credibility and attract investment.
More importantly, Pakistan needs a long-term economic charter that includes debt restructuring, predictable taxation, productivity-linked wages, transparent public projects, provincial performance benchmarks, and investment in human capital.

Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo when India hosts this year’s tournament from Sept 30 to November 2. Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
The women’s national selection committee named the squad for the tournament, and announced that the same squad will also feature in a three-match ODI series against South Africa, scheduled at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore from Sept 16-22.
 






“Uncapped right-handed batter Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland, is part of the ODI squad,” PCB said.
“Fatima Sana, who represented Pakistan in the previous edition of ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, will lead the side for the first time in the mega event,” it added.
The 23-year-old had previously captained the side in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier held in Lahore this year, where the team maintained a 100 per cent win record to secure qualification for this year’s ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup set to take place in India and Sri Lanka, the statement added.
 
 

Six players are set to feature in their maiden ODI World Cup, namely: Natalia Parvaiz (8 ODIs, 24T20Is), Rameen Shamim (8 ODIs, 11 T20Is), Sadaf Shamas (15 ODIs, 12 T20Is), Sadia Iqbal (27 ODIs, 50 T20Is), Shawaal Zulfiqar (3 ODIs, 9 T20Is) and Syeda Aroob Shah (2 ODIs, 15 T20Is).
Moreover, 21-year-old Aroob, 20-year-old Shawaal alongside 20-year-old Eyman featured for Pakistan in the inaugural edition of ICC Women’s U19 T20 World Cup held in South Africa in January 2023.
“Additionally, two changes have been made from the 15-member squad that featured in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier,” PCB said.
“Eyman and Sadaf come into the squad in place of Gull Feroza and Najiha Alvi, who have been named in the five-member non-travelling reserves alongside Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.”
The 15 players alongside five reserves players will take part in a 14-day pre-South Africa series camp from August 29. “The players under the coaching staff led by Muhammad Wasim will undergo practice sessions as well as 50-over practice matches.”
South Africa women’s cricket team will arrive in Lahore on Sept 12.
Pakistan became the fourth side to announce their squad after Bangladesh, England and India announced their squads earlier this month.
15-member squad:
Fatima Sana (captain), Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (vice-captain), Aliya Riaz, Diana Baig, Eyman Fatima, Nashra Sundhu, Natalia Parvaiz, Omaima Sohail, Rameen Shamim, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal, Shawaal Zulfiqar, Sidra Amin, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper) and Syeda Aroob Shah.
Non-traveling reserves:
Gull Feroza, Najiha Alvi, Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.
Player support personnel:
Hina Munawar (manager), Muhammad Wasim (head coach), Junaid Khan (assistant coach bowling), Tahir Khan (assistant coach bowling), Abdul Saad (fielding coach), Muhammad Rafi Ullah (media manager), Muhammad Asfand Yar (strength and conditioning coach), Waleed Ahmed (analyst), Tehreem Sumbal (physiotherapist), Kiran Shahzadi (masseuse) and team doctor (tbc).

According to a Harvard study, when social markets move into the economic realm, people stop acting altruistically and begin engaging in cost-benefit analysis. In one experiment, when parents were fined for picking up their children late from daycare, tardiness ironically increased — and remained high even after fines were discontinued.
This phenomenon suggests that monetary incentives corrupt social motivations permanently, further turning genuine acts of goodwill into mechanical obligations. As Pakistan debates making Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mandatory by law, it is worth asking: will mandating philanthropy eradicate its sincerity?
 


Proposed in February 2025, the CSR Bill emphasises the integration of social and environmental initiatives into corporate governance. It calls on the private sector to contribute to the welfare of the underprivileged and address environmental challenges — particularly urgent given Pakistan’s climate crisis. With the country’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index dropping to 57.02 and its global ranking falling to 137 out of 166 countries, the country’s situation is worrying.
However, Pakistan’s failure can be attributed to a combination of deep-rooted political and structural challenges. Long-term planning is frequently derailed by power struggles and unstable tenures in government. Moreover, Pakistan has yet to meaningfully integrate the SDGs into its national development agenda despite long-standing plans by the Planning Commission and the Ministry of Planning & Development.
 
 

The 18th Amendment has further complicated matters, leading to policy overlaps and conflicts between the provincial and federal governments. Corruption, red tape, and bureaucratic inefficiency continue to erode public trust and the impact of development spending.

By proposing a one-size-fits-all obligation, the government risks alienating the very actors it hopes to mobilise

The CSR Bill aims to move Pakistan toward greater welfare — but it may be a step off the cliff. By proposing to impose a one-size-fits-all obligation without acknowledging existing corporate initiatives, the government risks alienating the very actors it hopes to mobilise. Rather than fostering collaboration, it could deepen the regulatory divide and reduce the chance for meaningful private-public partnerships.
 
 

By suggesting the imposition of a flat one per cent of net profits companies must allocate to CSR spending, this bill may place financial pressure on low-margin sectors. Additionally, quarterly reporting and mandatory committees will add not only to the corporate administrative burden but also increase bureaucratic overhead for the state. With an already overtaxed private sector and a country that significantly falls behind on the ease-of-doing-business scale, the government continues to make business activities cumbersome, ultimately steering away foreign investment and economic growth.
Pakistan may look to India — as it is the only other country in the world to make CSR spending mandatory for firms of certain size and profitability — as a model. But how effective has this approach been? Research on India’s mandated CSR showed that voluntary spenders reduced their CSR spending after the regulations were implemented.
Many firms came to view the policy as a form of ‘triple taxation’: first on profits, then on dividends, and now through enforced post-tax CSR spending. Similarly, the new mandate had multiplier effects as firms had to bear additional evaluation and monitoring costs. Firms no longer turned to CSR for brand or reputation building but now perceived it as a quasi-tax that destroyed the firm’s value. Given its limited success, both the effectiveness of India’s CSR mandate and the rationale behind such top-down policymaking have come under increasing scrutiny.
Many multinational and local firms in Pakistan — such as the banking, telecom, and fast-moving consumer goods sectors — already engage in CSR spending voluntarily.
 
 

Globally, Unilever, for example, has committed to investing 1 billion in meaningful climate, nature, and resource efficiency projects. Swiss multinational food giant Nestlé S.A. has committed Rs2bn in renewable energy initiatives under its sustainability efforts in Pakistan. Similarly, Engro Corp in Pakistan has spent roughly 2pc of its cumulative profits over the past three years. A flat mandated approach could also then penalise genuine, high-efficiency actors.
Even though the concept of CSR is not foreign to Pakistan, it is understandable that the state seeks alternative revenue streams for welfare in a country with a low tax-to-GDP ratio. But coercion is not the solution — it rarely ever has been.
Under the guise of an additional regulatory requirement, the government appears to shift its responsibility of social welfare onto the private sector — making taxpayers question where exactly their own contributions are going. Instead of an additional burden, the private sector can instead be urged to embed the United Nations’ SDG framework into its operations, which many are already doing.
Many companies are already engaged in philanthropic work, but the government can benefit from encouraging them to record, report, and connect their efforts to broader developmental goals. Together, the private sector and public sector can align their projects for meaningful impact.
CSR can be a powerful tool for social good — but only when it is collaborative, not coercive. Regulating charity without securing the foundations of governance and business structure risks undermining both trust and impact. Mandating morality may tick boxes — but it may fail to build a better Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: A unique collection of ancient artefacts representing almost the entire heritage trail of the country has left for China to be part of a show in Beijing that is hosting the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) 2025.
The exhibition, which will open at the National Museum of China, coincides with the Meeting of the Council of Heads of States of SCO, 2025, being held on August 31.
“Under the theme of ‘Respecting Diverse Civilisations, Pursuing Common Development’, the exhibition will invite national museums of SCO members to send representative objects to attend the exhibition. By doing so, the exhibition can display the diversity of culture, friendship and cooperation of the SCO family,” said a letter inviting the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM) to participate.
Pakistan is among the nine full-member states, such as Russia,  Kazakhs­tan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Iran, which are contributing  artefacts for a show titled “Collections from Museums of Shanghai  Cooperation Organisation Member States. Belarus officially joined the  SCO in July 2024, making it the tenth member.

Relics include iconic Indus bull seal, astrolabe and several pieces depicting the Buddha

Pakistan is contributing ten artefacts dating from the late Neolithic period — Mehrgarh, down to Mohenjo Daro and all the way to the Islamic period, DOAM Director Dr Abdul Ghafoor Lone told Dawn.
The items include a stunning terracotta female figurine dating back to 3,000-3,500 BCE from the Neolithic period and a 2,800-2,700 BCE painted globular pot.
 
 

The 5,000 BCE Steatite Indus Seal with a humped bull and inscription is the oldest relic to be put on display at the exhibition. The 1,600-1,800 BCE terracotta horse figurine and the Jain ritual tank adorned with birds and lamps, which dates back to 600-200 BCE, will also be put on display.
The most interesting piece, perhaps, is the stone panel depicting Apalala Jataka, 3-4 Century BCE. The relic shows Buddha commanding Naga Apalala, a water-dwelling Naga in Buddhist mythology, to stop flooding the Swat River and the valley. It is said that Apalala lived near the Swat River.
Besides the 3rd to 4th Century CE Buddha head, also on display will be the 19th Century CE Astrolabe used by sailors. In its simplest form, it’s a metal disc with perforations that allowed sailors to calculate astronomical positions precisely.

• This is not a political matter and we will address it through legal means, says elder brother
KARACHI: Chanesar Town chairman Farhan Ghani, younger brother of senior Pakistan Peoples Party leader and local government minister Saeed Ghani, was booked, arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal.
Police got one-day remand of Farhan from a duty magistrate on Sunday. He will be produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday (today).
In a statement, Saeed Ghani, who is also the president of the PPP Karachi division, said that a dispute occurred on Sharea Faisal within the remit of the Chanesar Town and a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against his brother Farhan and some others. “Soon after, Farhan and his associates voluntarily surrendered themselves to the authorities.
“This is a legal matter, not a political one, and we will address it through legal means,” the elder Ghani said.
Earlier, the Ferozabad police registered a case under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 379 (theft), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Without identifying his department, complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon told the police that he is a “government employee” and was supervising fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal on Aug 22.
He stated at around 4:47pm, around 20-25 persons, including Chanesar Town chairman Farhan, in three vehicles arrived there and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal. He said he told them that he had all permissions but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said when he insisted that he had all required no-objection certificates, they started using smear language and beating him.
He said they dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station where they kept him in illegal confinement and continued beating him. In the meantime, a police team arrived there, rescued him and took him to the police station where he lodged the FIR.
On Sunday, the investigating officer (IO) produced three suspects, including Mr Farhan, before Judicial Magistrate (East) Waseem Abbas and sought their one-day police custody.
The IO informed the court that the suspects had been arrested on terrorism charges and their custody was required to apprehend their remaining accomplices with their help and to check their criminal record.
He further submitted that since the case was registered under terrorism charges and ATCs remained closed on Sunday, he was seeking their one-day custody to produce them before the concerned anti-terrorism court for remand.
After hearing the IO, the duty magistrate granted one-day physical custody of the suspects and directed him to produce them before the administrative judge of the ATCs on Monday (today).

He was identified as Rashid and his brother Wajid had already died of severe torture marks at the spot.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in Raiwind area two days back.
They were lying in a pool of blood and the suspected attackers holding clubs in hands were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around.
According to the video clip, no one from the passersby tried to rescue the two young men when they were being tortured by the attackers.
There were reports that the police traced and arrested two of the suspected attackers after lodging a case against them.
A police official said Wajid and Rashid had argued with a street vendor over the price of the fruit.  
He said the minor issue later led to the heated debate and then physical attack by the suspects.

The party contends that the video being relied on pertains to its Kahna public meeting, held on Sept 21, 2024.
Shahrez Khan was “arrested” from his home, when he was preparing to go abroad to participate in an athletic international championship on Thursday (Aug 21) after men in plainclothes barged into his home on the Canal Road.
The next day, his younger brother Shershah was also arrested from outside his house. Both are on police remand.
In a video posted to state broadcaster PTV News’ official X handle, a series of clips are shown wherein Shahrez can be seen walking alongside his mother Aleema Khan, as well as PTI’s Khadija Shah, Shayan Bashir and some others.
 






In the caption of the clip, it is claimed that both Shahrez and Shershah were arrested over their involvement in the attack on the Lahore corps commander’s residence on May 9, 2023.
However, PTI’s Shayan Bashir stated the video clip in question was from the party’s public meeting in Lahore’s Kahna area, for which the party had obtained an NOC.
 






He said Shahrez, owing to non-availability of a driver, had driven his mother to the public meeting. He claimed that since police had stopped party leaders’ vehicles some five kilometres from the venue, they could be seen walking to reach the venue.
Mr Bashir claimed he had met Shahrez at a police station in Lahore Cantt and reported that “he was OK”.

Following the recent heavy monsoon rains, “significant erosion and damage” have been reported in the Hub Canal within the jurisdiction of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), said a statement issued by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC).
According to KWSC officials, the recent damage to the Hub Canal did not occur in the old or new Hub Canal. Instead, the damage took place in an eight-kilometre stretch that falls under the jurisdiction of Wapda.
They said that the section is managed entirely by Wapda, and after this stretch, the canal connects to the section overseen by the KWSC. The point where the canal transitions from Wapda to KWSC control is known as the “Zero Point,” they said.
In an urgent move to prevent further destruction, the statement said that Wapda has drastically reduced the flow from the dam, sending shockwaves across the city’s water distribution system.

KWSC says city receives only 40 MGD instead of 100 MGD from Hub Dam

“Karachi is currently receiving only 40 million gallons per day (MGD) from the Hub Dam, down from the usual 100 MGD,” the KWSC statement confirmed while quoting the chief engineer of bulk.
This sharp drop in supply is already being felt across the western, central, and Keamari districts, where taps have started to run dry. Residents are bracing for extended hours without water as the city struggles to cope.
Although the emergency repair work was expected to be completed by 4pm on Sunday, the water supply is unlikely to return to normal immediately.
“The repairs are expected to take until 4pm on Sunday, though it takes around 12 hours for water to travel from the dam to the Hub Pumping Station,” said the KWSC statement, confirming delays to any immediate relief while urging the public to act responsibly.
“We apologise for the inconvenience and urge citizens to use water sparingly. All available resources are being deployed to expedite the restoration process,” said the KWSC chief engineer.
MQM-P pins blame on Sindh govt, KWSC
As the city reels under the water shortage due to emergency repairs at the Hub Canal, political tempers have flared. Senior MQM-Pakistan leader and Member of the National Assembly, Syed Aminul Haque, launched a scathing attack on the Sindh government and KWSC, accusing them of “criminal negligence” and “systemic corruption” that has left citizens “thirsting for every drop.”
In a strongly worded statement, Mr Haque alleged that despite the much-publicised 100 MGD Hub Canal water supply project, the water board has failed to deliver water to large swathes of the city.
 
 

“The people in Orangi Town, Surjani Town, Baldia Town, Keamari, Korangi, Landhi, North Karachi, Malir, and Shah Faisal Colony are struggling without water,” he said.
He further accused the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Sindh government of growing mismanagement.
“Their incompetence has written a new chapter of urban failure. Even after the recent rains, areas like Orangi remain submerged in sewage water,” he said.
The MQM leader also criticised Jamaat-i-Islami, saying their role has been limited to slogans without action.
“Drainage and sanitation projects exist only on paper. Central Karachi and other districts flood every time it rains,” he added.
The MQM-P leader demanded immediate, practical solutions and accountability.
“People pay taxes, but receive garbage, sewage, and broken promises in return. Karachi needs action, not speeches,” he said.

Passengers are particularly affected as luxury bus services have been shifted to the general bus stand where there are no quality facilities provided to them such as separate waiting areas and clean bathrooms.
Meanwhile, a private bus terminal continues to run on government land that was earlier allocated for Speedo Bus Service during the term of chief minister Usman Buzdar near the general bus stand while another was forcibly shifted by the district administration to the general bus stand.
 
 

The transport owners as well as private bus terminals are not happy with the government’s move and raised questions about the transparency in shifting them from within the city to the general bus stand.
An officer who carried out the operation of shifting of terminals claims that the managers of private terminals had signed a mutual understanding document for moving their stands to the general bus stand. The owners of private terminals reject the administration’s claims, saying that the agreement was not signed by their actual representatives.
On the other hand, the district administration has so far failed to provide essential facilities such as a sewage, water supply and electricity to the private transport owners who have shifted to the GTS. As a result, the ongoing dispute between transport owners and the administration is causing troubles for the commuters.
Another related problem is the absence of intra-city transport service to approach the bus stand, which is crowded and the passengers don’t get any facility despite paying higher fare than the general bus stand passengers.
“We buy expensive tickets for safe air-conditioned luxury stay with other facilities at the bus terminal but there are no such facilities at the general bus stand,” bemoans a passenger.
He suggests to the district government that limited operation from the city should be allowed until the shifting of all private stands at a properly developed site.
Deputy Commissioner Usman Khalid says private bus stands couldn’t operate in the city that’s why the government shifted them to general bus stand.

The meeting, attended by the chief engineers of Wasa and the Irrigation Department, as well as representatives of the Pakistan Red Crescent and other officials, reviewed the worsening shortage of clean drinking water in the provincial capital.
Officials briefed the meeting that underground water levels in Quetta had dropped to alarming depths due to over-extraction and wasteful consumption.
They proposed several measures, including introducing a metering system, reviving traditional karez channels, installing rooftop rainwater harvesting systems in government buildings, sealing illegal tube wells and establishing recharge points to replenish groundwater.
Commissioner Kakar described Quetta’s water shortage as a “dangerous stage” requiring urgent intervention. He stressed the need for a comprehensive water policy to guarantee the supply of clean water while curbing misuse. He also urged public awareness campaigns to encourage responsible consumption.

Illegal connections to be cut, private suppliers to be regulated

He warned that strict action would be taken against those involved in illegal water extraction and directed Wasa to repair damaged pipelines without delay. Legal measures would also be enforced against those found wasting water.
“Water survival depends on our collective responsibility,” he emphasised, urging citizens, institutions and authorities to play their part in conserving the resource.

• Warns against foreign powers seeking to create internal rifts
TEHRAN: Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday called for a united national front to confront what he described as US efforts to subjugate the Islamic republic.
The remarks, delivered at a mosque in the capital Tehran and published on Khamenei’s official website, come two months since fighting halted between Iran and its sworn enemy Israel in a war that the United States had briefly joined, and as Tehran is engaged in talks with world powers about its nuclear programme.
The rare Israeli and US attacks in June, which targeted key nuclear sites and prompted Iranian retaliation, were designed to destabilise the Islamic republic, Khamenei argued.
He said that a day after “Iran was attacked” by Israel at the start of the war, “American agents” met in Europe “to discuss what government should rule Iran after the Islamic republic”.
Khamenei claimed that the United States was ultimately seeking to make Iran “obedient to it”.
To the leader, the country has emerged strong from the 12-day war in June, the most intense direct confrontation in its history with arch foes Israel and the United States.
“The Iranian nation, by standing firm alongside the armed forces, the government and the system, delivered a strong blow” to its enemies, Khamenei said.
The supreme leader, who has the final say on state affairs, also warned against internal divisions he said foreign powers were fomenting.
 
 

“The way forward for the enemy is to create discord” in Iran, he said, blaming “agents of America and the Zionist regime” — a reference to Israel — for seeking to sow division.
“Today, thanks to God, the country is united. There are differences of opinion, but when it comes to defending the system, defending the country, and standing up against the enemy, the people are united,” Khamenei added.
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.
The June war broke out as Tehran and Washington were due to hold their sixth round of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, but the negotiations that had begun weeks earlier were derailed by the conflict.
Iran is due to meet on Tuesday with Britain, France and Germany for nuclear talks, as the European powers have threatened to reimpose sanctions if no agreement is reached.

An official told the BBC that the man “has been arrested for perjury”.
In early July, the middle-aged man had lodged a police complaint and appe­ared before a magistrate to record his statement.
His identity has been withheld and, so far, he has appeared in public dressed fully in black, including a hood and a face mask. In the police complaint, the man claimed he worked as a cleaner at the temple from 1995 to 2014 — and alleged that he had been forced to bury the bodies of hundreds of girls and young women who were brutally raped and murdered.
He narrated five alleged incidents where he gave specifics, and said there were many others. Some of the victims, the man alleged, were minors.
He said he had been in hiding since 2014 and had returned and spoken up to silence his nagging conscience.
The man did not name anyone, but blamed the “temple administration and its staff” — allegations the temple chief rejected as “false and baseless”.
A spokesperson for the temple said it welcomed a thorough investigation and hoped police would “bring out true facts to light”.
In the complaint, the former cleaner accused temple officials of forcing him to dispose of the bodies and told police he would name the officials if they protected him and his family.
Karnataka’s interior min­­ister Gangadharaiah Parameshwara told the state assembly last week that the protection was in place. The former cleaner said he had secretly exhumed a skeleton from one of the burial sites to prove his claims.
A special investigation team formed by the Karn­ataka government later recovered human remains from two of 16 suspected burial sites, according to two senior police officials familiar with the probe.

According to a provisional schedule shared by UN officials, Pakistan may have a strategic advantage of speaking after India, giving it a direct platform to respond to New Delhi’s narrative.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level Pakistani delegation, which will include Deputy Prime Mini­ster Ishaq Dar, as well as the PM’s adviser on foreign affairs, Tariq Fatemi.
 
 

The 80th UNGA officially opens on Sept 9, with the high-level general debate running from Sept 23 to 29.
Brazil will speak first, followed by the US, where President Trump will deliver his first address to the UNGA in his second term.
This year’s theme is: ‘Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights.’
According to the provisional list, India’s premier will speak in the morning, while Pakistan’s leader, along with the heads of Israel, China, and Bangladesh, is scheduled for later that day. Officials in New Delhi have indicated that their prime minister will also participate in the general debate.
Observers note that the back-to-back appearances of PM Shehbaz and Modi will underline the gulf in perspectives. While India is expected to stress sovereignty and security, Pakistan will be able to respond directly, emphasising Kashmir and regional peace as core issues.
A senior Pakistani diplomat said: “The world has seen how quickly South Asia can slide toward conflict. Without a just settlement of Kashmir, the UN’s own pro­mise of peace, development, and human rights cannot be fulfilled in our region.”
The 80th UNGA promises to be one of the busiest diplomatic seasons in years, taking place amid the Israel’s war on Gaza, the Ukraine conflict, and the lingering aftereffects of the May India-Pakistan war. For Islamabad, the message is clear: the world cannot ignore South Asia’s flashpoints, and Kashmir remains the key to lasting peace.
According to the provisional schedule, a special event on climate will be held on Sept 24, while a high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons will be held on Sept 26.

PESHAWAR: At least 13 people were killed and 52 others injured in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours lashed several districts of Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa over the weekend.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), the death toll from floods and rains in the province has risen to 409 since Aug 15, with 251 people injured.
The PDMA report said the victims included 305 men, 55 women and 49 children. Among the injured were 183 men, 38 women and 30 children. Rains and floods have also destroyed 578 houses and partially damaged 2,954 across the province.
In Dera Ismail Khan, eight people were killed and 48 were injured after torrential rains and strong winds wreaked havoc on Saturday night. Three children lost their lives in Lower Dir when a house collapsed, while one fatality was reported in Mardan and another in Upper Kohistan.
A severe rainstorm caused widespread damage, crippling the power supply and destroying homes, solar panels and public infrastructure. Wind speeds reached up to 100 km/h, uprooting trees, toppling poles and collapsing walls and roofs. The district plunged into darkness after feeders tripped and the power system collapsed.
Officials confirmed that five of the deceased belonged to Dera tehsil and three to Paharpur tehsil. In Maryali, a wall of Jamiatul Madina collapsed, destroying a solar plant but causing no casualties.
Hospitals declared emergencies to treat the injured, while Dera Commissioner Zafarul Islam Khattak urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel during stormy weather. He directed that all available resources be deployed to provide medical assistance.
Punjab on high alert
The Punjab government is on high alert as heavy monsoon rains continue to swell rivers across the province. An official flood alert from India reported a “high flood”  level in the Tawi River at Jammu on Aug 24, prompting emergency measures  downstream.
 
 

Secretary of the Department of Emergency Services Dr  Rizwan Naseer made an emergency visit to Sialkot to inspect flood defences at the Head Marala Barrage and the Marala Flood Control Room.  Rescue operations are underway, with more than 21,000 people already evacuated from vulnerable areas.
The Chenab River basin is a particular point of concern, with key sites like Marala, Khanki, and  Qadirabad showing significant inflows. While these locations are currently within normal limits, the rising inflows at Khanki and the substantial water volumes pose a latent threat for the next 48 hours.
High flood at Indus, Chenab
Meanwhile, the Flood Fore­casting Division (FFD) warned on Sunday that the Chenab and Indus rivers are likely to reach high flood levels within 24 hours, while the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala will remain in high flood for the next few days, subject to water releases from India.
Flash floods are expected in the nullahs of Dera Ghazi Khan and northeastern Balochistan, while medium to high flows are predicted in nullahs linked to the Ravi and Chenab. Urban flooding is forecast for Lahore, Gujranwala and Rawalpindi in the next two days.
Heavy rainfall is expected in upper Punjab, particularly over the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum catchments, from Aug 25 to 27. The Indus River is already in high flood at Guddu and medium flood at Sukkur, while the River Sutlej is in medium flood at Ganda Singh Wala.
Water levels at Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs are nearing their maximum conservation limits.
In Vehari district, floodwaters from the Sutlej River worsened after India released water, submerging rural localities. Authorities have established three tent villages in Jam Laira, Farooqabad and Sahooka to house the displaced.
According to an official handout, Deputy Com­mission­er Imrana Tau­qeer said the top priority was shifting affected people to safer locations. So far, 371 residents and 26 cattle have been moved. Seven flooded settlements have been evacuated.
 
 

In Sahiwal and adjacent districts, a medium-level flood along the Sutlej River has displaced more than 1,450 people and 450 livestock in the past 48 hours. Over 40 kilometres of the river belt from Pir Ghani to Irazi Bali Dilawar is underwater.
Rescue teams have deployed dozens of boats and over 100 personnel to evacuate stranded villagers in Pakpattan, Bahawal­na­gar and Okara. Officials warned that water discharge levels at Herikey and Ganda Singh Wala exceeded 126,000 cusecs.
Standing crops across thousands of acres have been destroyed. Locals have demanded urgent medical aid, vaccination for livestock and measures against waterborne diseases.
Former Punjab chief minister Manzoor Ahmad Khan Wattoo urged the government to declare the affected districts as calamity-hit areas. He criticised India’s release of floodwaters and described it as “water terrorism”.
In Narowal, Rescue 1122 evacuated 30 people, including women, after a sudden flood surge in Nala Auj, which merges into the Ravi River at Shakargarh. The surge submerged hundreds of acres of farmland and damaged protective embankments.
Floodwaters also entered homes and livestock enclosures in nearby villages. District officials said Section 144 has been imposed to ban bathing in rivers and drains after three villagers went missing in Nala Dek.
Nationwide toll
Since June 26, torrential rains and floods have claimed 788 lives, injured 1,018 people, damaged 6,630 houses and killed 5,548 livestock across the country, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The deceased included 200 children, 471 men and 117 women.
Punjab recorded 165 deaths, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 469, Sindh 51, Balochistan 24, Gilgit-Baltistan 45, Azad Jammu and Kashmir 23, and Islamabad eight.
The injured included 279 children, 493 men and 246 women. Punjab reported the highest number of injuries at 584, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (285), Sindh (71), Gilgit-Baltistan (42), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (28), Balochistan (five), and Islamabad (three). The NDMA said 25,644 individuals have been rescued in 512 operations nationwide as part of a coordinated response.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded the highest number of rescues, with 14,317 people evacuated in 211 operations. Punjab followed with 9,211 rescues conducted across 245 operations.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, 940 individuals were rescued in 18 operations, while Gilgit-Baltistan saw 1,027 evacuations in 25 operations. Sindh reported 95 rescues in five operations, Balochistan 19 in four, and Islamabad 35 in four operations.
The National Disaster Management Authority said that in collaboration with the Pakistan Army and partners, it has distributed over 83,649 relief items to flood-affected communities.
Key supplies include tents, blankets, hygiene kits, ration bags, food packs, and drinking water. Additional support, such as solar panels, de-watering pumps, and generators, has been provided to aid recovery efforts.
Widespread flooding has caused extensive damage acr­oss the country, affecting at least 6,630 homes, of which 1,562 were destroyed while 5,068 sustained partial damage.
The National Disaster Management Authority has set up 564 relief and medical camps across the country. Of these, 45 medical camps have provided treatment to 3,227 individuals, while 519 relief camps have extended shelter and essential services to 29,311 people.

Under the leadership of Mr Ibrahim, Jazz has transformed from a traditional telecom company into a full-fledged serviceco, serving more than 100 million customers across financial services, entertainment and digital platforms beyond connectivity.
And yet, the business model of mobile operators in Pakistan is heavily burdened: massive upfront payments for spectrum and licences, recurring levies to the industry regulator and high taxation eat away much of their revenue, leaving little for reinvestment or delivering shareholder value. On top of this, the global rise of “over-the-top” platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, etc has fundamentally shifted customer behaviour.
“Connectivity is essential but no longer profitable enough. Rising costs of infrastructure upgrades and falling revenues from core telecom services created a structural mismatch. People’s loyalty is not to telecom operators; it is to mobile brands and apps, so the telecom business doesn’t make sense in Pakistan,” Mr Ibrahim muses.
This realisation marked a major inflection point in its transformation: Jazz stopped thinking of itself as a telecom company — or even a tech company — and began reimagining itself as a service company.

CEO of Jazz

 
Mr Ibrahim believes that technology and connectivity are enablers of a wider service ecosystem. “Our transition into a serviceco has completely reshaped our identity. We see ourselves as serving needs across five key verticals: financial services, entertainment, education, health, and e-commerce and ride hailing. Whatever our customers need, we will strive to meet their expectations.”

With the government unable to encourage shared telecom infrastructures and lower barriers for the industry, connectivity is no longer a profitable enough business

Another critical inflection point came with a rethink of telecom infrastructure. Duplication of networks among four telcos is inefficient and wasteful in a foreign-exchange-starved economy. To address this, Jazz recently sold its tower infrastructure, allowing shared usage and reducing redundancy. “Telecoms can also share their spectrum — their active infrastructure of information highways. It should have been the job of netcos to build and manage connectivity networks while telcos focused on quality of services and customer offerings.”
The government has failed to encourage shared telecom infrastructure and lower barriers for the industry by easing spectrum scarcity — a tactic used to make money from spectrum sales by forcing operators to compete aggressively. In contrast, countries around the world are distributing spectrum more liberally — in some cases even free — recognising that expanding internet access drives GDP growth, boosts exports and strengthens the overall economy.
“The problems with the internet in Pakistan — low speeds, patchy services, poor quality, etc — are not because we don’t invest. Every year, we invest between $200–250 million in infrastructure upgrades. The real challenge is that the number of customers is growing rapidly, and with better handsets, people are consuming more and more data. Yet, we haven’t widened our ‘information highway’ to accommodate this massive surge in usage. To put it in perspective, the spectrum available per person in Japan is four times higher than in Pakistan.
“Now is the time to rethink the spectrum policy. Pakistan still has a lot of unallocated spectrum that remains unused, which is delaying Pakistan’s digital growth.”
Mr Ibrahim, who is part of a task force set up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to recommend ways to transform Pakistan into a cashless economy, insists that Pakistan is undergoing a change — quietly. Every day, around 20m digital banking transactions take place, and the number of unique banking accounts has already crossed 100m. Financial inclusion has expanded significantly since the introduction of mobile wallets that have opened the doors of financial services to millions who were previously excluded.
Yet, despite this progress, Pakistan continues to lag behind comparable economies. India, which started this journey later than Pakistan, now conducts 20–25 per cent of retail payments digitally compared to Pakistan’s meagre 5pc. Kenya runs almost entirely on M-Pesa. Even Bangladesh is slightly ahead of us.
“The problem is not technology but taxation. Many retailers resist digital payments because of the FBR, as merchants wish to stay outside the tax net. A reduction in tax rates to 4–5pc could prove far more effective than coercion, and the government would end up collecting more revenue. Expanding financial inclusion was the first step. The next stage — bringing retailers into the digital net — is where the real battle will be fought.”
Challenges notwithstanding, the Jazz CEO plans to expand existing businesses and diversify into new ones in the next three to five years. His future strategic priority is to reduce dependency on traditional telecom services to 50pc and complete Jazz’s transformation into a full-service company within three years.
“We are doubling down on financial services. These services are set to become our second-largest line of business after telecom and internet connectivity. We plan to get a commercial bank or digital bank licence; besides, we are going big on insurance services by acquiring an insurance company.
“Beyond that, we will focus on education, healthcare and entertainment — sectors that touch the daily lives of millions. We intend to invest in more spectrum and 5G technology. But our position is clear: if spectrum is allocated properly, even 4G can address most of Pakistan’s connectivity challenges. Customers don’t really care about whether the service is labelled 4G or 5G. What they want is better speed, stronger signals, and reliable coverage — even in their basements. The real use cases for 5G — like autonomous cars or fully connected ecosystems — are still years away in Pakistan.”
Moreover, Jazz is actively integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its services. “AI’s importance and usage will only grow across every sector and area in the years ahead. We are already collaborating with NUST [National University of Sciences & Technology] to develop a local large language model. But here we face a challenge: data scarcity. AI systems learn from records and datasets available online, and in Pakistan, much of our critical information has not yet been digitised. To truly unlock the potential of AI, we must first digitise Pakistan’s knowledge base.”
The business strategy transformation has also accompanied a cultural change at Jazz. “We have worked hard to build an environment where hierarchy doesn’t matter; knowledge and merit make our hierarchy. Creating a culture where innovation and bold decisions are rewarded has been a key to our journey.”
