Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade.
The decision was made during a meeting between Commerce Minister Jam Kamal and the Iranian Minister for Industry, Mines and Trade, Mohammad Atabak, on the sidelines of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s two-day official visit to Pakistan.
According to the ministry’s statement, the high-level discussion marked a renewed commitment from both sides to accelerate trade, remove border bottlenecks, and build trust-based partnerships across priority sectors.
“[During the meeting], Kamal envisioned that, if fully leveraged, bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran could easily exceed $5–8 billion annually in the coming years,” the ministry said.
Minister Kamal suggested organising targeted trade delegations that include representatives from federal and provincial chambers of commerce, enabling focused discussions on market access and regulatory facilitation, according to the statement.
“We’ve done this model successfully in Belarus and elsewhere,” he was quoted in the statement as saying. “Let’s do the same for Iran, starting with sectors that show the greatest potential for mutual benefit.”
The ministers also expressed a shared commitment to increasing the use of existing trade corridors and border facilities. Emphasis was placed on maximising the potential of neighbourhood trade, with Kamal highlighting how ASEAN countries have benefited enormously by trading within their region.
“Geography is an advantage. Pakistan and Iran must utilise this discount of distance. If we don’t, we lose both time and cost benefits,” he stated.
Atabak also highlighted ongoing discussions about increasing Pakistani exports to Iran and encouraged swift follow-up on newly signed agreements.
“Traders and industrialists in both countries are ready. They trust each other. What they need now is a clear and consistent facilitation mechanism from our side,” he noted.
Kamal said that beyond bilateral gains, such connectivity could expand to Turkey, Central Asia, Russia, and even parts of the Middle East, creating an economic bloc of substantial power and resilience.
Atabak supported the idea of holding a dedicated B2B day during every high-level visit and offered to bring Iranian business groups to Pakistan for in-depth meetings, the statement said.
The two ministers acknowledged the historic depth of Pakistan-Iran relations, expressing that recent regional and global developments have pushed both nations closer together.
“Without the rapid engagement and determination from you and your team, we wouldn’t have reached this stage. The momentum we’ve built must now be translated into structured trade outcomes,” Minister Atabak said while praising the Pakistani government’s proactive role in facilitating bilateral trade progress.
Kamal echoed similar sentiments, noting that both governments, as well as the private sector, had shown strong will and passion to work together.
“There’s a moment in diplomacy when the iron is hot—and this is that moment. We must act swiftly. Delays only complicate things,” he said.
He emphasised that formalities follow passion and political will, and highlighted that Pakistan is ready to deepen its economic relationship with Iran through structured channels like the Joint Economic Commission (JEC), regular B2B exchanges, and sector-focused delegations.
Both ministers agreed on the importance of identifying specific sectors such as agriculture, livestock, services, energy, and cross-border logistics for future collaboration.
Reflecting on the human element of bilateral ties, both sides underscored the cultural and linguistic commonalities between the people of Pakistan and Iran.
The ministers agreed to fast-track the next session of the JEC, ensure participation from both public and private stakeholders, and prioritise border facilitation and trade logistics.
“With high-level political alignment and mutual trust, Pakistan and Iran appear poised to enter a new phase of strategic economic partnership that could reshape regional trade dynamics,” the statement said.
Dar calls on Iranian president
Separately,  Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called on President Pezeshkian on Sunday and conveyed Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining “brotherly ties” with Iran, according to a statement from the Foreign Office.
“Welcoming the Iranian president, the deputy prime minister/foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep commitment to its historic and brotherly ties with Iran, emphasising their strong foundations in shared history, common cultural heritage, faith, and mutual respect,” the statement said.
President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s support and reaffirmed Iran’s resolve to improve bilateral collaboration in various areas of shared interest. He also looked forward to meaningful discussions with Pakistani leaders to further reinforce the political and economic ties between the two friendly nations, the FO said.

The ministry had said earlier on the Telegram messaging app that expected wave heights were low, but warned people to move away from the shore.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning System, which gauged the quake at 7.0, said, however, there was no tsunami warning after the quake. The US Geological Survey also said the earthquake was at a magnitude of 7.
Overnight, the Krasheninnikov Volcano in Kamchatka erupted for the first time in 600 years, Russia’s RIA state news agency and scientists reported on Sunday.
Both incidents could be connected to the huge earthquake that rocked Russia’s Far East last week, which triggered tsunami warnings as far away as French Polynesia and Chile, and was followed by an eruption of Klyuchevskoy, the most active volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula.
The Kuril Islands stretch from the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russian scientists had warned on Wednesday that strong aftershocks were possible in the region in the next several weeks.
“This is the first historically confirmed eruption of Krasheninnikov Volcano in 600 years,” RIA cited Olga Girina, head of the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team, as saying.
On the Telegram channel of the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, Girina said that Krasheninnikov’s last lava effusion took place within 40 years of 1463, and no eruption has been known since.
The Kamchatka branch of Russia’s ministry for emergency services said that an ash plume rising up to 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) has been recorded following the volcano’s eruption. The volcano itself stands at 1,856 metres.
“The ash cloud has drifted eastward, toward the Pacific Ocean. There are no populated areas along its path,” the ministry said on Telegram.
The eruption of the volcano has been assigned an orange aviation code, indicating a heightened risk to aircraft, the ministry said.</p><small>2025-08-03 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/03133303fe14e6e.png?r=134820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928472/cop-martyred-in-bannu-checkpoint-attack-as-retaliatory-fire-kills-3-militants' target='_blank'><strong>Cop martyred in Bannu checkpoint attack as retaliatory fire kills 3 militants</strong></a><br><p>Funeral prayers were held Sunday morning for a police constable martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu in July.
Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan said in a statement that three terrorists were killed and police constable Rooh Niaz Khan was martyred when 40 to 50 terrorists attacked the police check post in Fateh Khel, Bannu.
Three terrorists were killed and as many policemen were injured in the exchange of fire, which lasted more than an hour, the statement added.
Soon after receiving information about the attack on the post, RPO Khan and District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi, along with the force, left for the site of the incident, Aamir Khan, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, told Dawn.com.
“The terrorists had blocked the roads leading to the post, but the police officials reopened the roads and fought with the terrorists,” RPO Khan said.
“Police personnel bravely fought the terrorists, who used heavy weapons.”
He noted that the search operation for the miscreants was still underway.
According to a statement by the Bannu Police Office, funeral prayers for the martyred constable were offered on Sunday morning at Bannu Police Lines. In attendance were his relatives, RPO Khan, DPO Kulachi, and other police officers.
While speaking on the occassion, DPO Kulachi said: “Martyred police officer Rooh Niaz Khan sacrificed his life while fighting against anti-national elements, proving that Bannu Police is steadfast on every front.”
“We will never forget his sacrifice,” he said, adding that the bravery, sense of duty and sacrifice of the deceased are a beacon of light for everyone else.
DPO Kulachi emphasised that Bannu Police were fully capable of confronting terrorists on every front.
On Thursday, at least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area, where KP police had foiled a terrorist attack bid earlier in the week.
However, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred last month when terrorists attacked him in Bannu.
Earlier in July, three terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation in Bannu, while another died in an encounter with police in Malakand district.</p><small>2025-08-03 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0311485956a4aaa.jpg?r=114912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928460/last-ball-hero-holder-lifts-west-indies-over-pakistan-in-t20' target='_blank'><strong>Last-ball hero Holder lifts West Indies over Pakistan in T20</strong></a><br><p>Jason Holder smashed a four on the final ball to give West Indies a dramatic two-wicket victory over Pakistan on Saturday, lifting the hosts level in their T20 international series.
On the same night he took four wickets to reach a West Indies T20I record 81 for his career — breaking Dwayne Bravo’s old mark of 78 — Holder went 16 not out and West Indies ended a horrid losing streak with zero balls to spare.
Pakistan, which won Thursday’s opener by 14 runs, will try to bounce back in Sunday’s series-deciding T20 match under the lights at Lauderhill, Florida.
 






West Indies, set 134 to win, was on the brink of a seventh consecutive T20 defeat after having been swept 5-0 last month by visiting Australia.
Gudakesh Motie led West Indies with 28 runs but went down on the first ball of the 17th over, run out by Mohammed Haris with the hosts on 96 for six.
Haris caught Keacy Carty for a duck three balls later but Holder swatted a six to end the 18th over, West Indies still needing 24 to win.
Romario Shepherd smashed a six and a four off Hasan Ali in the 19th over to leave West Indies on 126 for seven entering the final over.
Shaheen Shah Afridi allowed Holder a run but then took Shepherd’s wicket lbw for 15. He allowed newcomer Shamar Joseph a run that pulled West Indies within six runs with three balls remaining.
Holder and Joseph each struck for singles and Afridi went wide to Holder, leaving West Indies three runs shy for the final delivery, setting the stage for Holder’s heroics.
Pakistan won the toss and batted first, going 133 for nine.
Hasan Nawaz led Pakistan on 40 with four sixes and a four while captain Salman Agha added 38 on one six and three fours.</p><small>2025-08-03 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/030956099f59d35.jpg?r=095614' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928316/body-of-man-who-drowned-himself-two-children-found-at-sea-near-china-port' target='_blank'><strong>Body of man who drowned himself, two children found at sea near China Port</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The body of the man who drowned himself and his two minor children at Do Darya near Seaview on Thursday afternoon was recovered on Saturday, police and rescue officials said.  
An Edhi spokesperson added that when their lifeguards resumed the search operation on Saturday morning, they found the body of Aurangzeb Alam floating at sea near China Port.  
The bodies of the two minor children — Ahmed and Ayat — were found at Seaview on Friday morning.  
The man with his minor son and daughter had jumped into the sea near a waterfront high-rise building.  
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the children’s maternal uncle Rameez Husain in a written statement told the police that his brother-in-law Alam and his sister along with their children had appeared before a court on July 31 over a petition (No 3290/2024) for custody of the children. He claimed that the custody issue was ‘amicably’ settled between the couple.  
Later, Alam, along with his wife and children, went to the food street at Burns Road for a lunch. Subsequently, he left the restaurant, saying he needed to go to the toilet. He took his children with him and did not return.  
Mr Rameez said they had immediately informed the Madadgar-15 about that and also submitted an application before the Aram Bagh police to this effect.

Jatoi was talking to journalists outside the court of the first additional sessions judge Larkana on Saturday where he appeared in connection with a case, accusing him of obstructing official duty. The court adjourned the hearing to Aug 18.
He said the case was registered at Badah police station. It was initially heard in Dokri court and was then transferred to the district and sessions court from where it was subsequently assigned to the first additional sessions judge Larkana. 
He said the hearing did not proceed and was put off to Aug 18. “God willing, truth will prevail, and falsehood will be exposed,” he said.
He said that a similar case was registered in Ranipur but later his and his colleagues’ names were struck off the case, and they were acquitted. “I believe these false cases will not hold up. God willing, all the cases will gradually come to an end,” he added. 

Says there’s huge difference between PPP of Benazir Bhutto and today’s ruling party in Sindh

He said that instead of registering false and concocted cases against political opponents, the Sindh government should focus on law and order. “I believe the law and order situation can improve but police are being used to suppress political opponents. The situation has led to unrest in Sindh, he said.
He said: “If you enter Sindh from Punjab, you will clearly feel difference in development. Here, all attention is focused on minting money and eliminating political opponents,” he alleged. 
Jatoi said that there was a huge difference between the PPP of Benazir Bhutto and the current party. Now the PPP had been taken over by thieves, mafias and looters, who were exploiting the people of Sindh, he said.
“The true heir of Bhutto is Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Junior and we will welcome him to politics,” Mr Jatoi said, adding that he had twice met him. The entire opposition in Sindh should unite and work collectively to rid the province of this mafia as no single party could do it alone, he said. 
He advised Zulfiqar Bhutto Jr. to form his own party and join hands with the entire opposition to launch a joint struggle for a clean, honest, and corruption-free leadership in Sindh.

PTI Islamabad chapter head Aamir Mughal said that, under the “guerrilla struggle,” they would block various main roads and share the message of Imran Khan.
“However, workers will disperse before the arrival of police. Our goal is to record the protest and protect our workers from arrest and police torture. We know that torture is the only weapon of the ruling elite,” Mr Mughal said.
 






He vowed to expand this new strategy from Islamabad to the rest of the country.
It is worth mentioning that PTI has called for a protest on August 5, the day marking two years of Imran Khan’s incarceration. Imran Khan will lead the protest from jail.
Earlier this week, PTI submitted a request to the capital administration to hold a workers’ convention (jalsa) at F-9 Park on August 5.
A written application was submitted by the PTI Islamabad chapter to the office of the deputy commissioner.
The application, signed by PTI Islamabad Region President Aamir Masood Mughal and General Secretary Malik Amir Ali, stated that “On behalf of PTI Islamabad Region, we are writing this letter to seek your kind permission to organise a peaceful workers’ convention (jalsa) at Fatima Jinnah Park (F-9 Park), Islamabad on Tuesday, August 5, 2025, from 4pm to 10pm.”
The gathering, it added, was part of the party’s ongoing political activities to mobilise and engage its workers. “It will be a peaceful event aimed at energising and uniting the workers across Islamabad,” it stated.
“We assure you that all arrangements will be made in a disciplined manner, and full cooperation will be extended to the district administration and law enforcement agencies. Kindly provide us the necessary permission to use the venue and deploy security personnel to ensure the safety of all participants,” the application stated.
All SOPs, including public safety and park usage regulations, will be strictly followed. We hope for your kind cooperation and timely approval of our request, it added.

The interior ministry on Thursday issued a special regulatory order (SRO), saying PoR cards expired on June 30 this year, rendering their holders’ stay in the country unlawful. It empowered district administration, police, prosecution, prisons and all other authorities to take appropriate measures for the arrest and detention, whether in jails or other suitable premises, and repatriation of all such illegal foreigners.
“Federal Government is pleased to invoke the provisions of sub-sections (I), (2)(c), (2)(e)(i) and (2)(g) of Section 3 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, in relation to PoR card holders forthwith,” the SRO read.
Following the issuance of SRO, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa home and tribal affairs department on Friday made a public announcement regarding the deportation of Afghans with PoR cards. It was also published in Saturday’s newspapers.

UNHCR says govt’s decision raises serious concerns about refugees protection, legal status

In the announcement, the department said since PoR cards had expired on June 30, their holders were unlawfully staying in the country.
It added that the government had already implemented the decision of deportation of undocumented Afghans as well as holders of Afghan Citizen Card (AAC).
“Stay of all those Afghan nationals without having Pakistani visa on valid passport is unlawful, therefore, they should leave for homeland,” it said.
The department also said that the KP government had set up transit points at Peshawar and Landikotal area of Khyber tribal district to host the returning Afghans.
Though PoR cards’ validity expired on June 30 this year, its holders hoped that authorities would extend their stay, like they always used to do.
At least three notifications were issued by the Ministry of State and Frontier Regions in June and July this year, directing police and other authorities to not arrest those with PoR cards, block their accounts and phone SIM cards, further giving them hopes about possible extension of their stay in the country.
Chairperson of the Muttahida Afghan Tajir Ittehad Syed Naqeeb Badshah told Dawn that the “sudden decision to expel Afghans” was an unwise decision.
He said that just weeks ago, the Safron ministry had conveyed to government departments that the case for extension of PoR holders’ stay was being submitted to the federal cabinet.
Mr Badshah said that it was cruel to order millions of people to leave immediately, who were staying here for decades.
“I am not sure if Afghan refugees fall victim to politics or something else happened,” he said.
The chairperson said that there were around 40,000 Afghans businessmen in Peshawar, who had invested from Rs1 million to Rs1 billion in Pakistan.
“Pakistani government wakes up one fine day and asks these people, including 559 having invested over Rs1 billion in the country, to leave immediately. This makes no sense,” he said.
Mr Badshah said that Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was due in Islamabad the next week to hold talks with Pakistani authorities, UNHCR, IOM and refugee leaders.
“This decision is unilateral and we have repeatedly asked the Pakistani leaders to review it,” he said.
An Afghan leather garment designer told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the notification had spread fear and panic among Afghans living in Pakistan.
“Every Afghan is fear-stricken and even there is no forum left where we could petition,” he said.
He said that they were businessmen and not refugees.
“At least 22 workers are working with me and fear-mongering about refugees as a burden was unfounded,” he said.
Spokesman for UNHCR Pakistan Qaiser Khan Afridi voiced “deep concern about the latest worrying developments” regarding the implementation of Islamabad’s plan to repatriate registered refugees with PoR cards.
“We have seen the recent notification [SRO] that was issued by the Ministry of Interior on July 31 regarding the launch of phase III of the Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan and are following up with the relevant authorities to clarify the implications for registered refugees,” he said.
He said that the SRO, which rendered PoR card holders present in the country unlawful, raised serious concerns about their protection and legal status, not to mention severe disruption to incomes and education.
“The refugee legal character of people affected by the threat of deportation remains, and forced returns could breach the principle of non-refoulement, where states are bound not to return people back to countries where their life or freedom could be threatened,” he said.
Mr Afridi added that UNHCR advocated for the protection of all refugees and that any return should be conducted in a voluntary, safe and dignified manner, in line with international principles.
According to UNHCR, there were over 1.3 million Afghans in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. More than half of them (717,945) lived in KP, 326,584 in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh and 43,154 in Islamabad.
Following a nationwide census of Afghans in 2004-05, the Pakistani government with the help of UNHCR issued a Proof of Registration (PoR) card to Afghan refugees whereas in 2016, through an amendment in the Foreigner Act 1946, Afghan Citizenship Card (ACC) was introduced.
Since November 2023 when Pakistani authorities started implementing the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, undocumented as well as AAC Card holders have left the country, while Afghans with PoR cards are the only category of those still legally staying in Pakistan.
The July 1-15 figures from the report on the IOM biweekly flow monitoring of Afghan nationals show that a total of 1.14 million individuals have returned to Afghanistan since Sept 2023. According to them, the highest number of 262,443 individuals returned to Afghanistan in November 2023, while 148,121 others went back in April this year, following a government drive to deport ACC Card holders.
The IOM report stated that during the reporting period (1 - 15 July 2025), fear of arrest (93pc) remained an important reason for respondents to return. “Additionally, 29 per cent reported that they returned because a family member was deported,” it said.

Since July 1948, Pakistan has faced multiple insurgencies in the province of Balochistan. These insurgencies have ebbed and flowed, advanced and receded for almost 77 years now. From tribal uprisings, to leftist ‘liberation’ insurgencies, to separatist sub-nationalist surges, Balochistan has witnessed numerous Baloch nationalist outfits and movements.
Some still claim to be working for the rights of the Baloch people within Pakistan’s federal paradigm. However, in the last decade or so, outfits looking to completely separate from the federation have grown. Like most separatist movements anywhere in the world, the Baloch ‘liberation’ movements too have had external supporters. Separatist movements cannot survive without these. But this is not to suggest that survival in this regard always leads to victory.
Indeed, there have been cases in which the survival of separatist movements — aided by external forces — has succeeded in achieving their end goals. Some examples in this regard include the erstwhile East Pakistan, where Bengali nationalists, who were militarily supported by India, managed to break away from the rest of Pakistan and become Bangladesh.
Another example is that of the Kosovo Liberation Front (KLF). Initially formed to ‘liberate’ the Kosovo region from Yugoslavia, the KLF’s target became Serbia when the region became part of Serbia after Yugoslavia dissolved in 1992. 

History offers examples of separatist movements succeeding with foreign help — but most often, they become pawns in geo-political rivalries. Is the insurgency in Balochistan, which may reportedly see the involvement of Israel, destined to remain trapped in this vicious cycle?

The KLF struggled to sustain its presence until the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) countries began supporting it. Nato wanted to remove the Serbian nationalist regime headed by Slobodan Miloševi. In the late 1990s, KLF fighters and informants helped Nato dismantle the Miloševi’ regime as Nato jets bombed Serbia’s military installations. By 2000, Miloševi was gone. Nato mainstreamed the KLF and kept a military presence in Kosovo until the region declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. 
But on most occasions, external support for separatist movements has only been able to prolong their presence. They’ve failed to take these movements over the finish line — sometimes as policy. According to the researcher Joshua C. Underwood, if an external supporter doesn’t provide military aid, separatist movements usually collapse. 
Underwood gives the example of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. Wanting to create a homeland for Sri Lanka’s Tamils in the north of the country, the LTTE — from 1983 till 1987 — ran a relentless campaign of terror against the Sri Lankan state. 
According to the Indian academic Rajat Ganguly, during this period, India provided weapons and training to LTTE militants. But, in 1987, supporting Tamil separatism increasingly began being viewed as counterproductive by India because of concern that it may spread into India’s own Tamil-majority areas, and because the LTTE had begun to eliminate other Tamil outfits who too enjoyed support from many Indian Tamils. 
Also, India only seemed to have been interested in creating a continuous state of instability in Sri Lanka because it viewed Sri Lanka as being pro-Pakistan. Sri Lanka addressed this by signing an accord with India that allowed Indian troops to operate in Sri Lanka and ‘help’ Lankan troops fight Tamil militants. According to Underwood, LTTE’s survival became tougher once India stopped providing it with military aid. By 2009, the Tamil separatist movement had been crushed by the Sri Lankan armed forces. 
There are three main types of aid that an external force provides separatist movements: economic, military and moral. But military aid is the most vital — even if the policy of the external force is to only keep a country in a permanent state of instability. India is now almost openly supporting the Baloch movements in Pakistan for this very purpose. The thinking is that continuous instability in Balochistan will destabilise China’s economic presence in Pakistan. 
Israel’s reported entry in this regard is not that surprising. But, historically, Israel has not supported separatist movements as such, apart from showing support for the separatist movement of the Kurds in Iraq and Israel’s recent military support for the Druze in Syria. Its motive vis-a-vis Balochistan also seems to be to keep the province in a perpetual state of instability. But it is India that remains the central external actor in Balochistan. 
Over the decades, Baloch separatist movements in Pakistan have depended on various external actors: Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and, now, India. Iraq is no more active in this regard, and Afghanistan’s support to Baloch separatists has continued to move away to supporting anti-Pakistan Islamist movements. Iran’s involvement is linked to the alleged support that Pakistan extends to the anti-Iran Baloch communities. But never has any external actor been so heavily invested in Baloch separatism as India has, especially since 2014.  
According to the researcher Mir Sherbaz Khetran, since Balochistan has been a politically and economically neglected area, its vulnerabilities have provided enough fodder to foreign actors to use it as a platform to create disruption and instability in Pakistan. 
 


But the question is, to what end? 
Pakistan is a nuclear power. Western powers may be as troubled as India is by China’s growing economic and military investments in Pakistan, but they wouldn’t want to trigger total collapse of a nuclear state — unless they’re stupid enough to want Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal falling in the wrong hands. One can, therefore, conclude that the idea is to keep Pakistan unstable, enough to keep China at bay.  India has increasingly tried to do this by providing funds, weapons and training to Baloch (as well as Islamist) militants. 
Consequently, this has stripped whatever little ‘ideology’ that was left attached to Baloch separatism. Baloch separatists, along with Indian-backed Islamists, have become willing tools of instability.
The KLF succeeded in acting as foot soldiers and informants for Nato forces in Serbia, enough for them to eventually break away from Serbia when it was attacked from the air by Nato planes. But India’s aerial and missile attacks against Pakistan in May this year could only draw fiery anti-state rhetoric from Baloch militants. The fact that Pakistan effectively retaliated against Indian aggression made a KLF-type scenario almost impossible in Balochistan.
As China’s strategic relationship with Pakistan deepens, I can’t see how a ‘defeated’ India will be able to maintain its support for Baloch militancy, despite the fact that it has intensified its involvement in the province after the war. The Baloch militancy is likely to remain stuck in a vicious circle — and it may even recede if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to lose popularity in India.
Maybe this is why Israel has jumped in?

Within the first 40 minutes, they’d counted 12 shooting stars, and no one was in the mood to leave. In fact, for many, the experience meant so much that they came back again two days later, choosing to skip the planned movie night to instead spend another few hours under the stars.
For Sawab Husnain, founder of The Cherry Club — a luxury wellness retreat she hosts at the Byarsa Hotel in Skardu — this moment made all her planning and efforts worth it. Husnain, who spent six years of her childhood living in Skardu on and off, tells Eos that her time there allowed her to explore the area in a new way — finding spots and locations that were off the beaten path. This became a key inspiration once she started planning her retreats for The Cherry Club last year, where she focused on curating unique experiences for her fellow travellers.
Husnain reveals, “Initially, I wanted people to see Skardu the way I see it, which is at a slower pace, because a lot of trips up north are very hustle-and-bustle, and I think nature is best appreciated slowly. Even at a popular place such as Upper Kachura Lake, we have a secret spot and, whenever I take someone there, they are truly able to enjoy their surroundings.”
Husnain’s is one of a growing number of wellness and travel retreats in Pakistan being run by women. Husnain plans each part of the retreat in a way that’s designed to show the group she’s leading new aspects of Pakistan’s north. This includes the planning of new activities and experiences that help visitors connect with nature. But it’s not just Husnain’s knowledge that makes her so popular, particularly with women of all ages looking to travel up north.

Much of the recent rise in wellness retreats, adventure tourism and group trips across Pakistan has been spearheaded by women intent on carving out spaces where other women can safely travel. As a result, many of these initiatives are more than just relaxing getaways — they offer a
place where women can find camaraderie, joy and independence

For many female travellers, the manner in which Husnain tailors their stay in Skardu is what makes the experience worthwhile. According to Husnain, “The reason there are more and more women signing up for our retreat is because I have curated the retreat as something designed by a girl for other girls. There are very few safe travel spaces for women in Pakistan to begin with, so when they find a place like this, they want to hold on to it.”
She adds that, while she does run mixed groups as well, men need to be part of a couple or family, or they need a reference, as single men are not allowed to sign up with Husnain’s group. After having only 10 people for her first retreat last year, Husnain’s retreat this year hosted 33 people, ranging across various ages — from couples that have been married for almost a decade, to teenage girls in search of adventure.
The exciting thing is that The Cherry Club is just one travel retreat being offered that’s gained popularity in recent years as Pakistan sees a boom in local tourism, particularly after the Covid pandemic and the travel restrictions that came with it. But what’s been more interesting in recent years is that, in a country known mainly for its adventure tourism and high mountain peaks — which have long attracted climbers from all over the world — women are now carving out a very unique travel space for themselves.
From taking a break at yoga and wellness retreats, to exploring unknown parts of the country as solo travellers, women increasingly are emerging as shapers of Pakistan’s travel industry in a completely new way over the last five years.
From Karachi to Islamabad, an increasing number of women are signing up to travel to different parts of Pakistan, with areas such as Skardu, Hunza and Fairy Meadows being some of the most popular. These areas are seeing many more women enter the tourism industry, as local tour guides, cafe owners and even climbing instructors. In many ways, the rise of women and women-led initiatives in the Pakistani tourism landscape has completely reshaped the industry in terms of accessibility, how travel is perceived and the resources that are available.

With several women now at the helm of this travel revolution, it is clear that a lot has changed. The industry is opening itself up to new experiences that are available for travellers, irrespective of their gender. There is now also a deeper, more personal connection between travellers and tour guides as the concept of seeking out unique experiences through travel and retreats becomes more appealing.

Where Pakistani travel was once linked only with those daring enough to climb its mountains, or families going for a trip up north, it is now expanding into a diverse range of experiences. For many women, these new offerings provide them with a chance to ‘find themselves’ in a completely new way that had been previously unavailable to them.
More importantly, this has also empowered women, both those who are travelling and those who are facilitating them, to be a part of Pakistan’s growing tourism industry. Beyond that, this transformation is also giving women entrepreneurial opportunities and a sense of independence that is often hard to come by for women in Pakistan.

A RETREAT FOR THE BODY AND MIND
For Fatema Siddiki, the founder of the art therapy platform therapeuArt, and Hira Haq, who runs the community platform Girls and the City, craving that sense of independence is what inspired them to plan their upcoming retreat, Midway to Me, which they’ll be hosting in August at Samarkand House in Murree.
“As an adult, planning women-centric activities is very different,” explains Siddiki. “You don’t find anyone else to travel with and not a lot of people are into solo travelling.  Some are, but most want to experience these things with other people, so providing these retreats gives people a space where they can relate with others and have their own space as well.”
Haq also points out that, while they initially planned to have the retreat open to everyone, they decided to make it women-only after seeing that almost all of their sign-ups were women. “Most of these women are coming alone,” Haq adds, “and because we have shared rooms, they’ve signed up to share rooms with a stranger.”
When women started getting in touch with the organisers to finalise their plans, Siddiki noticed one common pattern. “While talking to the participants, the one thing that is similar for all of them is that they are all exhausted of ‘playing a role’ for someone else in their life,” Siddiki shares. “They just want to be themselves at the end of the day, reconnect with who they are and not have to play a role based on the expectations of others or society.” Siddiki believes that even just the four-day get-away they are providing can mean a lot to many of these women.
While this is the first time they’ll be hosting a retreat, both Haq and Siddiki are avid travellers and, having had experience hosting activities and events for large groups of people, they’ve been very hands-on with how they are planning the upcoming retreat. Haq says, “The retreat has been designed so that, in the middle of the day, women can just do what they want to do. It’s designed for women to take a break.”
Sereena Chaudhry, a corporate lawyer-turned avid traveller and Reiki (a Japanese form of healing) master has been attending women-led retreats in Pakistan’s northern areas since 2014. She has organised and led trips in the mountains and across Pakistan’s coastal region since 2019. Since 2022, she has been leading retreats with her friend and business partner, Salina Taqi. While Chaudhry has led and attended both women’s-only groups and mixed groups, she says it’s the women’s-only groups that really allow women to “let their hair down.”
Husnain agrees, pointing out that “if we were running the same retreat with more men than women, it kind of changes the overall vibe of the space. There’s a certain level of lack of comfort that comes with male-dominated spaces.”
Husnain, Chaudhry and other tour and retreat organisers have all noticed that when women, especially first time travellers, travel in Pakistan, they are always surprised and relieved by the experience. Chaudhry says, “They love it and can’t wait to go back. They’re pleasantly surprised by how safe they can feel in public in their own country, how they’re treated with respect by the men they come across in the northern areas. The people there are so kind and hospitable by nature.”
TAKING THE PLUNGE
For Ayesha Ehtisham, her first-ever solo travel experience with the travel group Teen Musafir was so rewarding that she later joined the group as their social media associate and now regularly travels with them. “Our main goal is to normalise travel for women in Pakistan. Even now, I feel that many girls are a little shy when they start the trip. They’re cautious, looking over their shoulder. But then they realise that they are surrounded by women and they no longer feel as scared or guarded.”
For Teen Musafir’s project manager Mahrukh Siddiqui, who also started travelling with the group before joining and leading retreats herself, one of the biggest successes has been seeing women take that first step to travel independently, which then acts as a stepping stone for many women to become more independent.
“For most of the girls, it’s not just a trip — it’s the first time they are stepping out of their comfort zone,” Siddiqui explains. “This one girl told me that she fought with her parents a bit to get permission to travel by herself. She knew that going back home after her travels and showing to her parents that everything went okay would lead to a greater sense of trust and understanding.”
This is also what has encouraged Zahra Noor, a high altitude mountaineer on a campaign to summit the 14 peaks (the 14 mountains in the world over 8,000 metres in elevation), to pursue her interests and create a space where others can also join in. Through her start-up Escape, which focuses on increasing adventure tourism in Pakistan, Noor hosts “conventional” tours to tourist destinations, exploring areas for trekking, and “unconventional ones”, which focus on high-altitude mountaineering. Noor shares that she had started considering only focusing on her “unconventional” tours in an effort to focus on her own mountaineering skills. However, a trip to Fairy Meadows changed her perspective.
While hosting a women’s-only trip to Fairy Meadows a few months ago, Noor realised the power these trips hold for the women accompanying her. By chance, most of the women on the trip observed hijab or some level of pardah [veil], and most of them shared with Noor that they were able to really enjoy themselves due to the female-centric space she had created.
“They were so happy and so relaxed to be able to be without men,” says Noor. “Most of them were solo travellers, and I felt so happy and humbled. This is what keeps me going.”

EMPOWERING WOMEN THROUGH TRAVEL
For many Pakistani women who travel solo for the first time, the decision and the experience that follows is one that marks the start of their independence — of making decisions beyond just the roles they play in their everyday lives. Haq believes that travel is a basic need and a right that everyone should have access to, and yet most Pakistani women don’t. Haq tells Eos, “Travel for women isn’t a big thing abroad, but it is here. We want to make it a thing in Pakistan that women can do easily.”
When Aneeqa Ali started her experiential travel company The Madhatters in 2017, her aim was simply to promote local cultures in lesser known areas of Pakistan. For her, The Madhatters came about due to her passion for travelling and a desire to inculcate a love for and understanding of Pakistan’s traditions, customs and local communities within fellow travellers.
But, for Ali, the journey has been far from easy and continues to present several challenges: “Every time I travel to a place within Pakistan, I realise that there are a lot of gaps in our tourism industry, especially when seen from the perspective of female travellers. There are a lot of challenges female travellers have to face and many of their specific needs are often neglected, since tourism in Pakistan is a very male-dominated industry. Whether you look at most travellers, tour operators, hotel owners or transporters, it’s a world of men.”
When she first started, Ali’s focus wasn’t necessarily on women-centric travel. It was only when she saw just how many women were signing up for a woman-led tour that she realised the gap there was in the market. The Madhatters now has a team of female guides in many areas — a job once considered to be only for men — and has made an effort to support countless local women-led businesses, from cafes to carpet workshops.
In Gulmit, Hunza — which is an area Ali has frequently travelled to, both on her own and as a tour guide — multiple women point out the changes they’ve observed due to the increase in women-led tourism and the impact this has had on local women-led businesses.
Shamim, who co-owns Korgah Carpet Centre with four other women, says she has noticed a drastic change in the demographic of travellers to the area in the past few years. Korgah Carpet Centre specialises in traditionally woven hand-made carpets, and this female-driven initiative has only been bolstered by the increase in female travel groups visiting the area. “For the last three-four years,” Shamim says, “lots of groups have been coming here and most of them are women. Aneeqa [Ali] was the first woman who led a group here, and she’s really supported local women across our various industries.”

Shamim adds that the increase in women travellers has also led to local women interacting with tourists in a different way.  “When women come we can sit with them in a more relaxed way. We can talk to them about work, the area, travel, and so I think it’s great that women are playing so many multi-faceted roles in the region’s tourism.”
Rashida, the founder of Bozlanj Cafe in Hunza, echoes similar sentiments. “Initially, there were no women involved in tourism and local industries here, but now there are so many women working and people are hiring women. My co-founder and I want young girls to join the tourism industry and uplift themselves.”
Bozlanj Cafe has also seen a marked increase in business, both with Ali’s support and the general increase in tourism in the area. “I’ve never had a negative experience,” Rashida says, “no one has ever misbehaved, and people even tell me I’m giving food for very cheap.” She does, however, laughingly add that tourists from Karachi often miss the spiciness of their food when they’re travelling up north.
For Ali, these positive impacts on locals and travellers alike are what make her job so rewarding. Ali’s trips are all about adventure and going to places where others don’t, in an attempt to push people out of their comfort zone. Ali adds, “We do offer some women-only tours and, in all such tours, one common factor is the sisterhood and bond that forms during the trip. There’s a huge difference in terms of how the general vibe of the tour is when it is a mixed tour, as compared to when it is a women-only tour. In the latter, I feel the women are always super-helpful towards each other, and the human-to-human connection on that tour is far deeper and more intense.”
It’s not just the travellers interacting with each other that helps form bonds and connections. Interacting with the communities they are visiting helps them see the locals and their way of life in a new light as well.
“Women also appreciate women working in the tourism industry a lot more,” Ali says. “They appreciate that women tour guides are accompanying them and they are supporting women-led businesses. They really love this part and they want to see how women are living their lives in this part of the world.”
TRANSFORMING LOCAL TOURISM
It was during her travels and interactions with local communities over five years ago that Ali first met the 17-year-old Tabassum Saher in Hunza. Saher’s father was a tour guide in the region and his young daughter had always harboured a passion for travel. Now 22-years-old, Saher is a Tourism and Hospitality major at the Karakoram International University in Hunza. Saher says that meeting Ali changed what she thought was possible for her own future and led to her currently working as a tour guide in Hunza.
The first time Saher found herself waiting on the side of the road for passengers that she had to guide, she felt a sense of fear and uncertainty. But, after five years in the field, Saher says she’s come out the other side as a completely different person.
Last year, she saw her efforts being recognised in a new way. In the midst of a grass-skiing competition in Kashmir, the young travel enthusiast received an unexpected call. She’d won the Best Tour Guide Award at the National Tourism Awards 2024. It’s not just the recognition that she’s proud of, it’s the financial independence she’s gained along the way that has helped to transform her life and give her a sense of independence.
“I am paying for my studies myself by working in the tourism industry — from my university fees, to my food and hostel fees,” says Saher. “I didn’t have to ask my parents for money.”
While women working in Pakistan’s tourism industry, especially in adventure tourism, is still a rare sight, many women are breaking this mould and are changing perceptions along the way.
Zeba Batool started working as a tour operator in Gilgit-Baltistan while pursuing her certification as a mountaineering instructor with the American Mountain Guides Association. For Batool, one of the biggest positive impacts the expanding tourism landscape has had in Pakistan is that it has allowed many women to take charge of their own lives. It has given them the opportunity to become independent, to take up public space and to connect with nature.
Noor has felt that impact in her own life as well: “When I started solo travelling, I experienced a totally different version of myself. I was 20 when I started and, in those two years, I’ve changed a lot. I feel more independent in different situations in my life now and my decision-making has improved.”
AN ONGOING EVOLUTION
With several women now at the helm of this travel revolution, it is clear that a lot has changed. The industry is opening itself up to new experiences that are available for travellers, irrespective of their gender. There is now also a deeper, more personal connection between travellers and tour guides as the concept of seeking out unique experiences through travel and retreats becomes more appealing.
“Women are able to travel and feel safe due to the presence of other women,” says Siddiqui, “and that’s why Pakistan’s travel industry is on the rise,” adding that even several men prefer travelling with Teen Musafir because of the safe and unique experience they are able to offer.
But Ali, who’s been around long enough to have witnessed these changes, and has spearheaded many of them herself, believes so much more can be done.
“Right from the get go,” Ali says, “people were telling me it’s not a woman’s field. I now have a lot of international partners and companies I work with who value what women bring to this field. I feel the industry has opened up a little bit for women and I do feel we’re on the right track. With the right kind of support and systems in place, we can come at par with international tourism standards. However, there has to be a constant effort to make this happen — it’s not going to be an overnight change.”
For every woman who’s played a role in shaping the future of Pakistan’s evolving tourism industry, the journey has presented several challenges and forced them to step out of their comfort zones. But the path they have charted has opened new windows of opportunity for women across the country — and that’s what keeps many of these women coming back for more.

The second round of talks between Bajaur Aman (peace) Jirga members and local terrorist leaders aimed at convincing them to leave the region ended on Saturday, said the sources.
They told Dawn that talks between the 50-member peace jirga and terrorist leaders were held in the Lowi Mamund tehsil.
The terrorists had requested a day’s time at the Friday meeting to consult their leadership over the jirga’s two-point demands — either to return to Afghanistan or retreat to the mountains if they wanted to fight the security forces, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals.
However, the sources said that no significant development took place in this crucial meeting, meant to convince the terrorist to leave the region peacefully.
The details of the meeting, which started at around 3pm and ended late on Saturday evening, have yet to be formally disclosed by the jirga’s head, to the media.
The sources said that the terrorist leaders also assured the jirga members that they would remain peaceful in the region.
According to the sources, head of the Bajaur Aman Jirga Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, who along with several members met with high-ups to inform them about the meeting’s developments, was satisfied that people would hear positive news soon.
However, Mr Rashid didn’t inform the media about the meeting’s developments till the filing of this report at 9:20pm, ‘as they were still in a meeting’.
Meanwhile, several humanitarian organisations have established relief camps in anticipation of displacement of residents from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil amid an anti-terrorist operation, sources said on Saturday.
They told Dawn that the relief camps were mostly set up by local non-governmental organisations in different safe areas of Lowi Mamund and Khar tehsils.
The sources said Al-Khidmat Foundation, JUI-F, and the Pakistan Red Crescent Society were among the organisations that had set up relief camps to facilitate those displaced from the operation-affected areas of Lowi Mamund.
They added that some well-off individuals in the district had also set up relief camps, providing food and essential commodities.

The new tariff, added on top of existing duties, is seen as significantly higher than expected, undermining hopes for improved trade relations and market share, particularly in comparison to regional competitors such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
Industry leaders argue that the new tariff structure, combined with rising domestic production costs, makes it increasingly difficult to compete. One exporter noted that the higher tariffs, along with Pakistan’s growing production costs, could result in a decline in export volumes. “The deal is neutral at best,” the exporter said, pointing out that regional players like Vietnam and Bangladesh, with their lower production costs, remain better positioned.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani told Dawn that Pakistan’s primary competitors in the US market, Bangladesh and Vietnam, stand to benefit from the existing tariff structure due to their significantly lower production costs.

Textile sector struggles as tariff hike limits market gains

Mr Bilwani estimated that Pakistan’s production costs are 10-20pc higher, putting local exporters at a distinct disadvantage. He further criticised the government’s failure to support exporters effectively, pointing to the recent proposal of new taxes on cotton yarn and fabric imports — critical materials for producing export-grade goods. He stressed that imported yarn offers superior quality, which is vital for maintaining competitiveness in global markets.
 
 

On April 2, the US imposed a 29pc reciprocal tariff on Pakistani exports, an additional duty on top of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rate. This was followed by a 90-day pause, which set a provisional baseline tariff of 10pc (MFN + 10pc) until July 9, later extended to August 1.
After a series of “comprehensive and discreet negotiations,” the revised tariff of 19pc was finalised. While the government has hailed this as a success, some industry representatives, including M. Hassan Shafqaat, CEO of the Pakistan Textile Council, expressed disappointment. “We were expecting a lower reciprocal tariff, in the range of 10-15pc, based on positive signals from government officials,” he said, adding that the new tariff is equivalent to what was imposed on Pakistan’s competitors without them offering anything in return to the US.
Sources revealed that Pakistan had proposed to reduce the $2.9bn trade deficit by importing US cotton worth $1bn, oil-related products worth $1.2bn, and other US goods such as soybeans. The country also offered to remove non-tariff barriers, as recommended in the US Trade Representative’s report.
Mr Shafqaat explained that Pakistan’s competitors, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, now face tariffs between 19-20pc under the MFN+ regime. Only India, with a reciprocal tariff of 25pc, faces a higher tariff than Pakistan.
However, he noted that India’s favourable economic conditions — lower business costs and significant fiscal space — allow the government to cushion exporters with subsidies, rebates, and interest-free financing. As a result, he said, the 6pc tariff differential may not significantly affect India’s competitiveness in the apparel sector. Shafqaat suggested that some US-based buyers of home textiles might consider shifting to Pakistan if the tariff on India does not reduce in the near future.
Textile exporters also expressed concerns about potential conditions attached to the tariff, particularly the rules of origin for Pakistan. US President Trump’s letters specifically mention that transshipped goods will be subject to higher duties, raising the possibility of tariff adjustments for countries like Pakistan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. “It remains unclear whether countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which were subjected to tariffs without formal agreements, will be exempt from rules of origin requirements,” Shafqaat noted, adding that further changes to reciprocal tariffs cannot be ruled out.
China is expected to redirect its unsold textile products — originally intended for the US market — to the EU and UK, with India likely to follow suit. As a result, Pakistan could face intensified competition from both China and India in these alternative markets.
Khurram Mukhtar, Patron-in-Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, welcomed the US tariff reduction but stressed that the government must take urgent action to make the textile sector more competitive. “Reforms in taxation, energy tariffs, improved refund mechanisms, and better access to credit are critical for sustaining growth in the sector,” he said. While he noted that overall US demand might decline as consumers bear the cost of higher tariffs, he warned that Pakistan’s exporters cannot afford complacency. “There is no room for complacency. Reforms are more urgent than ever,” he added.
Published in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025</p><small>2025-08-03 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/688ec993888fe.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928420/us-game-in-the-region' target='_blank'><strong>US game in the region</strong></a><br><p>THERE is considerable euphoria in Pakistan over what is viewed as a marked improvement in its relations with the US administration under President Donald Trump and the trough that Washington-New Delhi ties seem to have hit.
But is this euphoria well-founded and will it last? Some observers are already calling the shift in US-Pakistan relations a realignment and change in direction. If this ‘realignment’ means a shift away from Beijing for Islamabad, then I suspect these analysts may not have it right. This is simply because Beijing represents the sort of reliable partner and friend that Islamabad has been increasingly dependent on for many of its economic needs and infrastructure development. Pakistan also remains an integral part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
More significantly, with an increasingly belligerent Hindu nationalist government in charge in New Delhi, which is constantly kicking up anti-Pakistan sentiment to cement its communal support base, Islamabad needs military hardware to deter Indian ambitions — in addition to the nuclear deterrent, of course.
Having said that, there are opportunities for Pakistan that are not part of a zero-sum game. Unlike the US, China’s relationship with not just Pakistan but other nations too isn’t based on ‘you are either with us or against us’. It is far more nuanced and pragmatic, because China for now is focused on economic development and trade.

It would be naïve to assume that ties between global powers hinge on relatively minor issues.

Western democracies often point fingers at China’s lack of political freedoms and human rights. But rarely do they laud how China has pulled 800 million people out of poverty in just 40 years. And in the current state of play, particularly in Gaza where almost the entire ‘democratic’ West is complicit in the ethnic cleansing there, while suppressing domestic dissent over this policy, they hardly have a leg to stand on when they pontificate about freedoms. The Gaza Palestinians are being denied the most basic freedom: the right to life.
For now, two things have gone in Pakistan’s favour. Firstly, Islamabad attached the right kind of importance to Trump’s narcissism. It nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and gave his ‘tough leader’ image a boost by quickly apprehending and extraditing one of the accused in the Kabul Airport ‘Abbey Gate’ bombing. The attack, which occurred in August 2021 during the US withdrawal, left 13 US service personnel and nearly 200 Afghans dead.
Then, when India attacked Pakistani targets in May last year after a terror attack in Indian-held Kashmir, and the US asked both sides for de-escalation, US sources say, Islamabad was quick to respond positively and gave the narcissistic leader a ‘win’. Trump does not tire of claiming the mantle of peacemaker for himself. This massaged his ego no end.
On the other hand, those in the know say that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made two moves that upset Trump. The first was reportedly cancelling a meeting with Trump during his US visit last year when the then presidential candidate was on the campaign trail.
The Indians firmly deny that any meeting was scheduled but during a campaign address on Sept 17 Trump said he’d be meeting Modi. Diplomatic sources said that the Modi meetings were pencilled in with both presidential candidates — Trump and Kamala Harris. The latter had to cancel her meeting due to a last-minute development and, therefore, Modi was advised by his team to also cancel the Trump meeting so he did not appear to be meeting/ endorsing one candidate. If true, this must have bruised Trump’s enormous ego.
Another irritant is said to have surfaced during India’s aggression against Pakistan in May this year. American leaders were working the phones to put a lid on the conflict before it spiralled out of control and both South Asian nations told the White House that they’d de-escalate. But India went ahead and launched missile attacks in retaliation for losing an embarrassing number of warplanes in combat, which led to the grounding of prime IAF assets for two days. Pakistan also retaliated and in the small hours of May 10, a top Pakistan official is said to have informed the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that India’s firing of dual-use missiles was a dangerous escalation and Pakistan was exercising restraint only at America’s request.
This reportedly also caused ties to sour as Trump may have felt India chose to slight America by saying one thing and doing the opposite. Although India responded to the renewed US effort and Trump was able to announce a ceasefire some heartburn had been triggered.
The chain of events may have contributed to the deterioration of ties between the US and India but it would be naïve to assume that relations between global powers hinge only on such relatively small issues, even if some of the leaders have bloated egos.
The major irritant in US-India ties is the latter country’s membership of BRICS where Russia and China have joined hands with Brazil, India, South Africa and a host of smaller countries to create a trading bloc. The grouping is pursuing the idea of a new currency for trade without the US dollar. Were this to happen, the dollar would lose its pre-eminence and the world would find a way around US sanctions through a new payment system. The US finds this intolerable, even if many see it as inevitable.
America has been propping up India as a counter to China, and New Delhi is now also part of the Quad comprising US, Australia and Japan. That is why India’s BRICS membership is seen as incompatible with the West’s strategic architecture in Asia. India may have followed a foreign policy keeping its own interest foremost. It is now being pressured to choose sides.
So, some social media mocking of India by Trump, including doomsday predictions about its economy and the new tariffs, has more to do with whipping India into line. If it works, Pakistan’s euphoria may be short-lived. If not, we’d have ringside seats to interesting game.

Galula argued that insurgency is not a military contest but a political struggle, in which both insurgents and counterinsurgents vie for the population’s support and allegiance.
Recent developments in Bajaur, where citizens are protesting against military operations and the tragic events in Tirah Valley last week, when five demonstrators were killed after security forces allegedly opened fire, must be viewed through this lens. These incidents suggest an urgent need for the state to reassess its counterterrorism (CT) strategies, which appear increasingly detached from the goal of winning hearts and minds.
In his seminal book Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice, Galula emphasises that military force must be subordinate to political objectives. Force used without legitimacy alienates civilians and reinforces the insurgents’ narrative. It is essential to remember that insurgents do not need to win militarily; they only need to survive, avoid defeat, and steadily erode the state’s credibility in the eyes of its people.
Militants in KP’s tribal districts have been challenging the state for the past two decades. Despite numerous operational successes, security forces remain engaged in prolonged conflict, arguably with little substantive change in their tactics or strategic orientation. The prevailing operational approach remains focused on achieving military victories while largely neglecting the critical objective of winning the population’s allegiance.
This strategic oversight not only deepens mistrust among the local population but also fosters suspicion towards the counterinsurgent forces themselves, ironically serving the militants’ very aim of delegitimising the state’s presence and actions.

A lasting solution to insurgency lies not in overwhelming military force but in political strategy.

Occasionally, the security forces convene jirgas with local tribes and mobilise lashkars against militants, as was recently seen in Bajaur, where security officials sought to gain the tribesmen’s confidence regarding their CT operations. However, such engagements are infrequent and seldom integrated into a broader strategy. The dominant pattern remains one of evacuating areas and displacing local populations or conducting small- to medium-scale operations that restrict civilian movement, often without prior warning or any provision for livelihoods.
Within this framework, engagement with local communities lacks the consistency, trust-building and institutional backing necessary for a successful CT strategy. Without a deliberate reorientation towards long-term civilian support and political legitimacy, operational victories are unlikely to translate into sustainable peace.
The engagement initiative in Bajaur came only after the launch of a military offensive against militants, a sequence that undermined its effectiveness. In that operation, three civilians, including a 12-year-old boy and a young girl, were reportedly killed, and at least 12 others injured. Engagement should have come first. The local population should have been taken into confidence before deploying a heavy military contingent and imposing prolonged curfews.
Moreover, the provincial government was apparently not brought on board during this operation, further deepening mistrust among the population. The jirga in Bajaur should have been initiated by the provincial government rather than the security forces to lend greater political legitimacy and reduce the perception of unilateral action.
KP is one of Pakistan’s most critical provinces. It is grappling with severe governance challenges and widespread political discontent. The political outlook of the majority in KP often diverges from that of the power centres in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, fostering a sense of alienation and suspicion. Several districts in the province have become ungovernable due to persistent militancy. In such a context, nothing can replace the value of a consensus-based CT strategy, one that is locally rooted and politically inclusive.
The recent incident in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley mentioned earlier, illustrates the urgency of such an approach. In response, a local jirga not only demanded a formal inquiry into the killings but also called for the evacuation of civilian homes occupied by security forces within 15 days and an end to unnecessary harassment of citizens at checkpoints. These demands reflect deep-seated grievances and highlight the need for a more humane, transparent, and politically accountable approach to security operations.
Pakistan’s departure from the colonial-era counterinsurgency approach of rule by exception was shaped by a mix of military repression and divide-and-rule politics, rooted in imperial anxieties over borders, tribal autonomy and anti-colonial resistance.
The Frontier Crimes Regulation, based on collective action, was the worst legal framework, which Pakistan abandoned after seven decades. But there is still a mindset that wants to run the affairs of the tribal districts within the same framework. If someone is thinking of bringing back these laws and restoring Fata’s status, it would be a grave mistake, which can trigger anger and mistrust.
The British co-opted the maliks and used jirgas to manage conflict and secure cooperation. Tribal lashkars were at times mobilised to act on behalf of the state. However, these colonial-era approaches can be counterproductive today. Past military operations in the tribal districts have significantly transformed the region’s social structures. The forced displacement of local populations not only traumatised communities but also exposed many to urban life and alternative social models. As a result, a new middle class is emerging in these districts, one that does not identify with colonial methods of control. While a few traditional elders and religious parties, who once benefited from draconian colonial laws, may still support such approaches, they no longer represent the broader aspirations of the population.
As echoed by David Galula and reaffirmed in modern counterinsurgency doctrines, a lasting solution to insurgency lies not in overwhelming military force but in political strategy. Counterinsurgency is 80 per cent political and only 20pc military. It demands serious attention to the underlying grievances that fuel unrest, corruption, exclusion, inadequate service delivery and ethnic or sectarian marginalisation.
Military force must be applied with precision and restraint, avoiding harm to civilians, which only deepens alienation. Insurgencies are long and complex wars; tactical victories mean little without strategic consistency and political legitimacy. The most effective strategies are those that are adaptive, locally grounded and responsive to evolving realities on the ground. The wisdom distilled from decades of conflict is simple yet profound — we can’t kill our way out of an insurgency.

In recent days, various anti-terrorism courts have handed down wholesale punishments to elected leaders and political workers affiliated with the PTI, over various cases related to the violence and rioting that broke out in parts of the country on May 9, 2023.
Scores have been convicted and handed lengthy sentences in relation to cases that were long criticised as politically motivated, built on ‘fabricated’ or weak evidence, and prosecuted without regard to due process. Several elected lawmakers, including the opposition leaders in both the Senate and the National Assembly, stand to lose their seats under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution. Some have already been de-notified by the Election Commission, including the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly, in what critics describe as ‘undue haste’.
The scale of lawfare against political workers is unprecedented in Pakistan’s history. Never before have so many lawmakers and political workers been convicted during a period of what is supposed to be democratic rule, and never before have political workers been tried as terrorists. One must give credit where it is due: to politicians who campaigned long and hard for civil supremacy and democracy, and judges who once decried judicial capture.
Unfortunately, these very politicians abandoned their principles as soon as the doors to power were flung open for them, while the judges appear to have surrendered their independence and responsibility. These are difficult times, with no end in sight. The damage already wrought will take decades to heal and reverse. And yet, sadly, there seems to be no recognition or acceptance among even the civilians who hold the present regime together that it may be time to turn back.
At least those left out by the system still have the luxury of speaking rationally. Friday’s declaration, shared after the opposition’s multiparty conference, has sought a truth and reconciliation commission that could probe the collapse of the constitutional order and bring to book those “judges, generals and politicians” who have violated the Constitution, harmed democracy and usurped people’s rights. It also seeks a new charter of democracy between all political parties, along with the abolition of the ‘hybrid system’ of governance recently extolled by the defence minister.
If civil supremacy is indeed what Pakistani leaders seek, this may be the most sensible way out of the present mess. However, given their proclivity for partnerships with unelected powerbrokers, it still seems like a distant dream. The PTI may be suffering, but it still wants the blessing of its tormentors more than the sympathy of their other victims. And this, unfortunately, is our democracy’s Achilles heel.

The first incident occurred on Saturday morning in the Langerkhel Surband area, where children playing in the fields discovered an unexploded mortar shell and brought it back to their village.
The device detonated as they played near a rainwater tank, killing five children aged between eight and 12, and injuring 13 others, including two women.
 
 

“The explosion left five children dead and 13 others, including two women, injured,” police said.

15 people, including four women, injured

The deceased were identified as Zenat Bibi, daughter of Jhang Khan; Shaila Bibi, daughter of Naimatullah; Muzammil, son of Naimatullah; Rafiullah, son of Fatehullah; and Palwasha, daughter of Bankhan; all residents of Wanda Langerkhel Surband.
The injured included Luqman, Bilal, Shadan, Latifa Bibi, Mohsin, Fawad, Jamshed, Wajeeh, Riffat, Mumtaz Bibi (wife of Bankhan), Fatima Bibi (wife of Sattar), Ahmad, and Saqib, according to the police.
ASI Zafar Mehmood, the official in charge of Lakki City police post, said he with his team was on patrol duty when they learned of the incident and immediately reached the hospital.
Separately, a villager was killed and two women injured in a quadcopter strike in the Shaikh Khula area.
Police said Azizullah, 54, died instantly when an explosive device dropped from a quadcopter detonated at his home. His wife, Shaikhzad Bibi, 50, and daughter-in-law, Raj Bibi, 22, were injured in the blast. The police quoted Saadullah as saying that the explosive device dropped from a quadcopter detonated, resulting in the death of his father Azizullah.
The injured were taken to hospital by the villagers. Police have registered case under relevant sections of law in the city police station and launched investigation.

• Prisoners’ families tell Witkoff Israeli govt won’t end war ‘willingly’
• Israel’s top general denies widespread starvation
GAZA: As Palestinians across Gaza Strip struggled for food, Israeli bombardment in the territory continued on Saturday with at least 30 more deaths.
Among them were 13 aid seekers. The UN human rights office in the Palestinian territories said  at least 1,373 Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza had been killed since  May 27.
On the other hand, seven more people, including one child, have died due to “famine and malnutrition” in Gaza, the territory’s health ministry said, bringing the number of deaths from starvation to 169, including 93 children.
The amount of aid entering Gaza remains  “very insufficient” despite a limited improvement, the German government said on Saturday after ministers discussed ways to heighten pressure on Israel.
 
 

The criticism came after Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited the region on Thursday and Friday and the German military staged its first food airdrops into Gaza, where aid agencies say that more than two million Palestinians are facing starvation.
Germany  “notes limited initial progress in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the population of the Gaza Strip, which, however, remains very insufficient to alleviate the emergency situation,” government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said in a statement.
 
 

Israeli forces attacks have killed at least 60,430 people and wounded 148,722 since October 2023, besides displacing millions of Palestinians in Gaza. A total of 898 Israeli soldiers have also been killed, according to the military.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that Saturday’s bombings mostly targeted the areas near the southern city of Khan Yunis and Gaza City in the north. He said two people were killed and another 26 injured after an Israeli strike on a central Gaza area where  Palestinians had gathered before a food distribution point run by the  US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
US envoy Steve Witkoff visited a GHF site for five hours on Friday, promising that Trump would come up with a plan to better feed civilians.
Israeli families want end to war
US envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday met the anguished families of Israeli prisoners, as fears for their survival mounted amid the Israeli bombardment across Gaza.
Witkoff was greeted with some applause and pleas for assistance from hundreds of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, before going into a closed meeting with the families.
Videos shared online showed Witkoff arriving as families chanted  “Bring them home!” and  “We need your help.”
Yotam Cohen, brother of 21-year-old Israeli prisoner Nimrod Cohen, told AFP in the square:  “The war needs to end. The Israeli government will not end it willingly. It has refused to do so. The Israeli government must be stopped. For our sake, for our soldiers’ sake, for our prisoners’ sake, for our sons and for the future generations of everybody in the Middle East.”
But Israel’s top general warned that there would be no respite in fighting in Gaza if the prisoners were not released. “I estimate that in the coming days we will know whether we can reach an agreement” for the release of prisoners, said army chief of staff Lt-Gen Eyal Zamir, according to a military statement.
“If not, the combat will continue without rest,” he said, during remarks to officers inside Gaza.
The Israeli general denied that there was widespread starvation in Gaza. “The current campaign of false accusations of intentional starvation is a deliberate, timed, and deceitful attempt to accuse the IDF (Israeli military) … of war crimes,” he said.

In a statement on Saturday, PTI CIS lashed out at the government for labelling the PTI founder’s sons as foreigners. He made it clear that they were Pakistani nationals who possessed National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOPs), and therefore have every legal and constitutional right to visit Pakistan and see their father.
 
 

“The oppressive and tyrannical government was forced to lie out of fear of Imran Khan’s children coming to Pakistan, which shows how weak and cowardly they are,” Mr Waqas stated.
He emphasised that both were issued tracking numbers for their visa applications submitted to the Pakistan High Commission in London — with Sulaiman’s tracking ID being 88005575178 and Kasim’s 88005575782.

Asserts both are Pakistanis, shares details of visa, NICOP applications

He said applications for both visas and NICOPs have been submitted, and while the issuance of NICOPs may take several weeks from Pakistan, visas can be granted within a matter of hours.
The high commissioner intimated a friend of Mr Khan’s family, who spoke to him that he needed clearance from the Ministry of Interior, the PTI leader claimed.
He said the boys were contacting the embassy through normal routes, and there was no response.
The interior ministry in an official statement claimed it had nothing to do with visa issuance. Then the government claimed, “visa applications have not been received”, he remarked.
The party leader also formally released details about NICOP status of Kasim and Sulaiman as issued by the government.

• Below average inflows in Jhelum mean water in reservoir increases only a few inches each day
LAHORE: Despite record rainfall and flooding in rivers, experts have warned of a 25 per cent water shortage in a few months due to a significant decline in Jehlum River’s inflows.
The drop in inflows has also slowed the filling of the Mangla Dam, one of the country’s two biggest reservoirs.
Inflows in the Jhelum River on Saturday dropped to 25,200 cusecs, 47 per cent less than its recorded average. On the corresponding day last year, the inflows were 39,700 cusecs.
The last five-year average for the day was 47,900 cusecs and 44,200 cusecs for the last 10 years.
Due to lesser inflows, water in the Mangla dam was only increasing a few inches each day. According to water experts, this could result in a 25pc water shortage in the coming Rabi season.
From Thursday to Friday, the dam’s storage only increased from 1,200.65 feet to 1,201.20 feet, 41ft below the total capacity of 1,242 feet.
Currently, the dam is holding 4.3 million acre feet (MAF) of water against its total live capacity of 7.3MAF.
The loss of 3MAF water would translate into up to 12 to 15 per cent water shortages in the coming Rabi season.
Adding the permanent water loss of eight to 10pc due to the reduced capacity of the Tarbela Dam — as a result of silt accumulation — the country is expected to suffer 20 to 25pc water loss during the next Rabi season, according to experts.
According to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) data, all but one river yielded less water than they did last year.
The data from April 1 to July 31 showed the Indus River produced 37.20MAF water, which is 31pc higher than its 10-year average and 36pc more than last year.
During the same period, the Kabul River yielded 8.2MAF water, 36pc less than its 10-year average and 53pc less than last year.
The Chenab River nearly maintained its average yield with 10.70MAF water, still 6pc less than the 10-year average but 3pc more than last year.
In total, the Jehlum river produced 8.7MAF water in the last four months. It was 27pc less than the last year and 28pc less than the 10-year average.
Tensions between India and Pakistan since early May have also affected water inflows in the Mangla Dam.
India has stopped sharing river inflows data since April when it unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty.
Irsa Spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana has said almost half a million acre feet of water had to be released from Mangla Dam to cover for the uncertainty created by India’s decision.
“On May 5, inflows in the Chenab river dropped from 35,000 cusecs to mere 5,000 within 24 hours.
Similarly, on May 31, it dipped from 45,000 to a paltry 7,000 cusecs,“ Mr Rana added.
Earlier, on April 5, inflows dropped from  10,000 to 4,000 cusecs.
To cover for these inconsistencies and ensure smooth irrigation of crops, Irsa released additional water from the Mangla Dam, Mr Rana said, adding these factors apparently slowed the reservoir’s filling.
“Normally, we get two to three late showers every monsoon, which helps Mangla dam filling,” he said, adding the downpour didn’t happen this year and there was no forecast for one in the near future.

• Pakistani officials say electronic assault on Indian communications systems reduced situational awareness
ISLAMABAD: India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India in May, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.
India’s defence and foreign ministries did not return requests for comment about the intelligence mistakes. Delhi hasn’t acknowledged a Rafale being shot down, but France’s air chief told reporters in June that he had seen evidence of the loss of that fighter and two other aircraft flown by India, including a Russian-made Sukhoi. A top Dassault executive also told French lawmakers that month that India had lost a Rafale in operations, though he didn’t have specific details.
Account of aerial battle
Reuters spoke to eight Pakistani and two Indian officials to piece together an account of the aerial battle, which marked the start of four days of fighting between the two nuclear-armed neighbours that caused alarm in Washington. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.
Not only did Islamabad have the element of surprise with its missiles’ range, the Pakistani and Indian officials said, but it managed to more efficiently connect its military hardware to surveillance on the ground and in the air, providing it with a clearer picture of the battlefield. Such networks, known as “kill chains,” have become a crucial element of modern warfare.
Four Pakistani officials said they created a “kill chain,” or a multi-domain operation, by linking air, land and space sensors. The network included a Pakistani-developed system, Data Link 17, which connected Chinese military hardware with other equipment, including a Swedish-made surveillance plane, two Pakistani officials said.
The system allowed the J-10s flying closer to India to obtain radar feeds from the surveillance plane cruising further away, meaning the Chinese-made fighters could turn their radars off and fly undetected, according to experts. Pakistan’s military did not respond to requests for comment on this point.
Delhi is trying to set up a similar network, the Indian officials said, adding that their process was more complicated because the country sourced aircraft from a wide range of exporters.
Retired UK air marsahl Greg Bagwell, now a fellow at RUSI, said the episode didnt conclusively prove the superiority of either Chinese or Western air assets but it showed the importance of having the right information and using it.
The winner in this was the side that had the best situational awareness, said Mr Bagwell.
Change in tactics
After India in the early hours of May 7 struck targets in Pakistan that it called terrorist infrastructure, the PAF chief ordered his squadrons to switch from defence to attack.
Five PAF officials said India had deployed some 70 planes, which was more than they had expected and provided Islamabad’s PL-15s with a target-rich environment. India has not said how many planes were used.
Five Pakistani officials said an electronic assault on Indian sensors and communications systems reduced the situational awareness of the Rafale’s pilots.
The two Indian officials said the Rafales were not blinded during the skirmishes and that Indian satellites were not jammed. But they acknowledged that Pakistan appeared to have disrupted the Sukhoi, whose systems Delhi is now upgrading.
In the aftermath of the episode, India’s deputy army chief Lt. Gen. Rahul Singh accused Pakistan of receiving live inputs from China during the battles, implying radar and satellite feeds.
He did not provide evidence and Islamabad denies the allegation.
Beijing’s air chief Lt Gen Wang Gang, however, visited Pakistan in July to discuss how Islamabad had used Chinese equipment to put together the “kill chain for the Rafale, two PAF officials said.
The Pakistani military said in a statement in July that Wang had expressed “keen interest in learning from PAF’s battle-proven experience in Multi Domain Operations.”
The hour-long fight, which took place in darkness, involved some 110 aircraft, experts estimate, making it the world’s largest air battle in decades. The J-10 jets shot down at least one Rafale, Reuters reported in May, citing the US officials.
Its downing surprised many in the military community and raised questions about the effectiveness of Western military hardware against untested Chinese alternatives. Shares of Dassault, which makes the Rafale, dipped after reports that the fighter had been shot down.

The “Jubilee of Youth” — when the Vatican invites Catholics aged 18 to 35 to the seat of the global Church’s power — has seen young pilgrims from around the world flood Rome, waving flags, singing or praying in groups. 
It comes nearly three months after Leo, 69, the first American pontiff, began his papacy, and 25 years after the last such massive youth gathering in Rome under Pope John Paul II of Poland. 
On Saturday morning, thousands of young pilgrims had already gathered at the vast open space in Rome’s eastern Tor Vergata neighbourhood where the pope will lead the vigil, the ground already dotted with blankets and mattresses. Elsewhere in the “eternal city”, numerous groups of young people were seen preparing to set off for the venue. 
On the plaza outside the Basilica of St John Lateran, they filled water bottles, applied suncream and checked bags of food and snacks — ready to spend the next 24 hours surrounded by a swarm of people and then sleep under the stars. 
Victoria Perez, who carried a Spanish flag, could not contain her excitement at seeing “the Pope up close. “It’s the first time I’m going to see him, and I can’t wait,” the 21-year-old said, excited to experience the “night of prayers under the stars”. 
French pilgrim, Quentin Remaury, 26, said he had been inspired by the late Pope Francis’s rousing message to youth during a 2016 visit to Krakow, Poland. “Pope Francis told us to `get off your couches’, and that really gave me a boost,” he said.
`What is his message?’
Since the youth jubilee began on Monday, attendees have participated in various Church-planned events throughout the city. 
On Friday, approximately 1,000 priests were on hand to take confession at Circus Maximus, one of Rome’s top tourist spots. 
Some 200 white gazebos lined the hippodrome where chariot races were once held and youths lined up to speak to priests in 10 different languages. 
Of the many languages heard on the streets of the Italian capital this week, Spanish seemed to dominate. The Vatican has said that more than 146 countries were represented and it expects up to a million people to attend the vigil. 
The pilgrimage is taking place as economic uncertainty and anxiety over climate change rises among the under-30s, with many saying they were curious to hear the Church’s position on global warming, wars and economic inequalities. 
Samarei Semos, 29, said she had travelled three days from her native Belize to get to Rome. 
“We are still trying to understand his leadership,” she said of the new pope, adding she hoped he would have a strong say about “third world countries”. 
As Parisian student Alice Berry exclaimed: “What does he have to say to us? What is his message for young people?”

The USGS recorded its depth at 122.6 kilometres, while other initial reports cited a depth of 114 kilometres.
Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi reported feeling the tremors at around 2am, with many describing how buildings shook.

Despite efforts by locals, the body couldn’t be traced for 17 days until it was spotted along the left bank of the river in the Keran village of India-held Kashmir. 
On July 20, images and videos circulated by AJK residents showed Indian army personnel and residents retrieving a body from the riverbank. 
Authorities from both sides, through military channels, subsequently coordinated to establish the boy’s identity and facilitate the repatriation.

Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region. A day after he and his party came out all guns blazing against the military offensive, CM Gand­apur had appea­red to throw his full weight behind a “targeted operation” against militants. His statement came in complete contrast to the one issued on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.
Though CM Gandapur took a U-turn, his party, the ruling PTI, had denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a “dangerous replay of past mistakes”.
In a message from Imran posted today on his X account, which is not operated by him, the ex-premier said regarding any operation in KP: “I convey a clear message to Ali Amin that the federation must not be allowed to conduct another military operation in KP and the tribal areas.
“Confrontation between the army and the people destroys the institution of the army. Operations are not a solution to any problem. Issues should be resolved through dialogue in accordance with the system there. Afghanistan is our Muslim neighbouring country. Relations with them should also be improved, and issues should be addressed through discussions.”
Responding to the party founder’s instruction from his personal account, Gandapur said that keeping in mind Imran’s thinking, he had hosted today the first of several jirgas on restoring law and order in the province.
 






Gandapur had announced earlier this week that a series of jirgas would be convened to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
In a post on X, a statement from the CM Office said the regional jirgas began today and were attended by tribal elders and elected public representatives from the Khyber and Orakzai districts, as well as representatives from the tribal subdivisions of Darra Adam Khel and Hassan Khel.
It added that 150 tribal elders from the aforementioned areas, six MPAs, three MNAs and one senator participated in the jirga.
 






The statement added that the CM’s adviser on information, the KP chief secretary, inspector general of police and commissioners and deputy commissioners were also present in the jirga.
The statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.
“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.
“Tribal elders have recommended to the federal government that arrangements should be made to send a jirga of the provincial government and tribal elders for negotiations with Afghanistan,” the statement added.
The statement said that the jirga should receive resources and cooperation to achieve this, adding that the next regional jirga would be held in the Mohmand and Bajaur districts. A third jirga would be held in North and South Waziristan, while the fourth would be convened in Kurram district.
No dates were given for the jirgas in this statement.
“Immediately after the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-08-02 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02224129513b81e.png?r=224333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928297/karachi-police-book-8-suspects-under-terror-murder-charges-for-gunning-down-senior-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police book 8 suspects under terror, murder charges for gunning down senior lawyer</strong></a><br><p>The Darakshan Police on Saturday registered a case against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges for killing senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam and critically injuring his young son inside a mosque in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority a day prior.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza had told Dawn.com on Friday that the firing took place after prayers at a mosque in DHA Phase 6. “As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG had said.
The Darakshan Police registered a first information report (FIR) today upon the complaint of the victim’s brother and under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
“My brother Khawaja Shamsul Islam, along with his two young sons and two guards had gone to offer Friday prayers and attend funeral prayers at the Quran Academy mosque located on Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase 6,” the FIR read.
“He was picking up his slippers at the staircase of the mosque when [the suspect] fired two shots at around 2:30pm. As a result, one bullet hit my brother and another hit his son. The suspect managed to escape while taking advantage of the rush.”
The complainant added that the victim’s younger son was unharmed in the incident and took his injured father to a private hospital in Clifton, while unidentified persons took the injured son to another private hospital in the same locale.
“Khawaja Shamsul Islam expired during treatment while his son was admitted with critical injuries,” the FIR added.
The complainant alleged that the primary suspect, along with 15-20 accomplices, attacked the lawyer last November, in which he was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.
“Now, the suspect, his two brothers and five other suspects attacked together … resulting in the death of the lawyer and serious injuries to his son,” the complainant stated, adding that the incident also triggered fear and chaos among the general public.
The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the nominated suspects over terrorism, murder charges and criminal conspiracy.
DIG Raza also told Dawn.com, “The prime suspect has confessed to the crime in a recorded video message.”
On Friday, the DIG constituted a special team under the supervision of the South senior superintendent of police to arrest the suspects who murdered the advocate and injured his son.
He had added that the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past, as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members would not appear before any court today to express solidarity with the slain senior lawyer.</p><small>2025-08-02 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02194041e5bd2c0.jpg?r=194154' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928257/iran-president-lands-in-islamabad-for-2-day-visit-eyeing-to-boost-trade-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Iran president lands in Islamabad for 2-day visit, eyeing to boost trade ties</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.
Pakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.
Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office said. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday pledged to help defuse tensions between Iran and the United States.
Dr Pezeshkian arrived at Nur Khan Air Base, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar received him.
 






PM Shehbaz said he was honoured to welcome the Iranian president and looked forward to “substantive engagements during this important visit that will pave the way forward for stronger Pakistan-Iran ties”.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited the Foreign Office, where he met FM Dar and the two held discussions.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties, with a focus on expanding cooperation in regional stability, trade, and economic collaboration. They also discussed enhancing bilateral engagement across key areas of mutual interest,” the FO said.
 






FM Dar said the two had productive discussions on all areas of mutual interest, including trade, economic cooperation, regional and international developments. “Looking forward to substantive talks at the leadership level tomorrow.”
 






The FO said both held preliminary discussions on key substantive issues to be addressed at the leadership level, including regional developments, bilateral trade and connectivity, energy cooperation, and the need to strengthen mechanisms for regular consultation and coordination.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening the longstanding and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Iran. They also emphasised the importance of sustained dialogue, enhanced cooperation on economic and security matters, and greater people-to-people exchanges.”
 






Dr Pezeshkian arrived earlier in Lahore, where PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz received him.
 


He visited the mausoleum of Allama Iqbal to pay tribute to his legacy with CM Maryam, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari accompanying him.
President Pezeshkian laid a wreath at the grave and offered prayers, led by Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad.
The Iranian president also penned remarks in the visitors’ book, expressing admiration for Allama Iqbal’s contributions to Islamic philosophy and the Pakistan Movement.
Tight security arrangements were in place to ensure the safety of him and his delegation throughout the visit.

PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his visit to Iran in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India.
Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had visited the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a helicopter crash.
According to Iran’s state media IRNA, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had agreed in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.
The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.
“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.
Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to IRNA.
 
 

Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.
Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent Israel-Iran war and the United States’ strikes against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that strongly condemned this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.
According to IRNA, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.
Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.
