Karachi’s key development projects —from the long-delayed K-IV water supply scheme and Red Line bus corridor to stalled roadworks like the Karimabad underpass and Malir Expressway—remain stuck due to chronic funding gaps, utility relocation issues, regulatory hurdles, and weak inter-agency coordination, leaving the city’s residents waiting years for essential infrastructure.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Sattar said, “They cannot conceive a development project, nor can they deliver it.”
During the presser, the MQM leader talked about the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Recently, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government, halted the federally funded Rs6 billion project of the Green Line Bus extension, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
“An excuse was made that a NOC was not obtained, and that is why work was stopped. I think this is all an inter-departmental problem. The KMC is a government department, and the Sindh government has been elected by the people,” he said.
He questioned the need for delaying work on the project even if an NOC was required, adding that all the necessary approvals had been obtained in 2017.
He alleged that the reason for stopping work on the project was that the credit was going to the MQM, which the Karachi mayor “could not digest”. He said that Wahab had made hundreds of promises to the residents of the metropolis but had not fulfilled even a single one.
“If the PPP-led provincial government or the Karachi mayor does something right, then there should be an award worth thousands of dollars for them,” he quipped.
He further said that the provincial government had failed to complete several projects, including the K-IV project that was launched in the 2000s to ease Karachi’s water woes.
“From 2008 to 2022, they sat on this project similar to how a chicken sits on an egg for 21 days. However, after 21 days the egg hatches […] they sat for 14 years on the first phase of the K-IV project […] but they did not complete it.”
He further said, “This is an infertile [sic] government. You should not expect them to complete any project. You should not expect them to give relief to the people.”
He said that an underpass being constructed at Karimabad was being ignored, while work had been abandoned on an underpass in Gulistan-i-Jauhar. He added that a flyover had been promised for the Korangi Causeway in 2022, which had also not been followed through on.
He also highlighted the damage done to Shahrah-i-Bhutto during the recent rainfall.
“Pray for thanks that some of it was damaged while it was being constructed. What would have happened if it had occurred after it had been constructed? How many lives would have been lost? How many cars would have been damaged?”
He called on the Sindh government to seek forgiveness from the people of Karachi due to the state of affairs in the city and to make up for their lapses.</p><small>2025-09-24 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/241511239e5fc40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944332/more-than-100-roma-fans-arrested-in-france-ahead-of-europa-league-clash' target='_blank'><strong>More than 100 Roma fans arrested in France ahead of Europa League clash</strong></a><br><p>French police arrested 101 Roma fans, some with weapons, in Nice on Tuesday, a day before the teams were due to meet in the Europa League, the local prefecture announced.
A separate source told AFP that the Italian supporters were carrying sticks, shovels and knuckle dusters around the city centre on the French Riviera.
The prefecture said that more than 400 police officers will be present for Wednesday’s group stage match.
“Since yesterday, more than 200 personnel, including two mobile units, were deployed in the city centre of Nice to prevent all types of public disorder and proceeded with the arrest of 102 individuals identified as Roma ultras, carrying weapons,” it said on Wednesday, before later revising the number of arrests down to 101.
“These individuals were taken into police custody,” it added.
The local authorities have banned Roma fans from displaying visible signs of their allegiance in the city between 1300 GMT (6pm PKT) Tuesday and 1000 GMT (3pm PKT) on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-24 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2414060259b7f84.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944327/aseefa-says-bisp-fastest-way-to-aid-flood-affectees-irresponsible-to-not-utilise-it' target='_blank'><strong>Aseefa says BISP fastest way to aid flood affectees, ‘irresponsible’ to not utilise it</strong></a><br><p>PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the first lady and a member of the National Assembly, on Wednesday asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was the “most effective way” to distribute aid to flood-affected people, adding that it would be “irresponsible to not utilise it”.
Her statement comes a day after Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the provincial government would issue relief cards to the flood victims in their personal names using its own resources instead of using BISP to assist them. Over the past month, the PPP has repeatedly urged the Centre to disburse stipends among displaced citizens via the “efficient and proven” BISP.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
In a post on X, Aseefa said that over four million people had been impacted by the “unprecedented floods” in Punjab. She termed the BISP as the “fastest and most effective way” to distribute aid to those affected.
“Not utilising one of the state’s key organisations, which has both the data and the capacity to deliver assistance, would be irresponsible,” she said.
 






Over the past weeks, the PPP chairman and senior leaders have encouraged the use of the flagship income support initiative to provide relief to thousands of citizens affected by the monsoon floods.
PPP Vice President Sherry Rehman had “strongly and repeatedly” advocated the use of BISP for the purpose in a Senate committee meeting.
In yesterday’s press conference, Azma Bukhari had said that the relief cards would ensure that help reaches the right people, adding that the government was focused on “serving, not politicising” the issue.
The minister, taking a jibe at PPP’s insistence over BISP use, remarked, “Should we take advice from those who have turned Sindh into archaeological ruins?”
At present, the Punjab government has announced a compensation package for the flood-hit families, which includes Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
On September 18, PML-N leader and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah had ruled out the use of BISP in helping flood-affected people, calling it unviable for a cash-strapped government. Rana Sana said the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.</p><small>2025-09-24 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24125611e410fa1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944320/massive-sinkhole-in-bangkok-street-forces-evacuations' target='_blank'><strong>Massive sinkhole in Bangkok street forces evacuations</strong></a><br><p>A portion of a busy road in Thailand’s capital caved in early on Wednesday, leaving a hole dozens of metres deep in front of a main hospital and forcing people nearby to evacuate.
Just outside a local police station and Vajira Hospital in a residential district of Bangkok, a roughly 50-metre (160-foot) hole pulled down power lines and exposed a burst pipe gushing water, AFP journalists saw.
Dozens of police and city officials cordoned off the site, while a pickup truck teetered precariously on the edge of the hole.
Suriyachai Rawiwan, director of Bangkok’s disaster prevention department, told AFP at the scene that the collapse was likely linked to recent heavy rain and a leaky pipe.
“There was a leak in the water pipe — water from the pipe eroded (earth) under the road so this incident happened,” he said, adding that there were no known casualties.
“The water that eroded brought some soil that dropped down to an under-construction subway station, causing the collapse,” Suriyachai added.
The tunnel is part of an underground service being built by the state-run Mass Rapid Transit Authority, which said it would investigate the cause of the cave-in.
Suriyachai said the local police station facing the collapsed road was evacuated.
Senior police officer Sayam Boonsom also said he had ordered the evacuation of nearby apartment blocks.
“The location is at a station, and the soil was sucked into the site … it collapsed,” Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt told AFP at the scene.
A video posted on social media and verified by AFP shows several people running from a construction area on Samsen Road as the street cracks open and collapses, revealing a water-filled hole.

Vajira Hospital, a teaching facility for one of Thailand’s top medical universities, said in a Facebook post it was suspending outpatient services, adding that they would “resume as soon as possible”.
Noppadech Pitpeng, a 27-year-old hospital staffer who lives in a nearby building, said he was frightened by a rumbling sound on Wednesday morning that woke him up.
“The sound was like an electricity pole collapsing and my whole flat shook,” he said, while carrying clothes in a large bucket out of his building.</p><small>2025-09-24 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24130652aac11c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944321/coordinator-to-pm-urges-locals-in-kps-tribal-areas-not-to-provide-refuge-to-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>Coordinator to PM urges locals in KP’s tribal areas not to ‘provide refuge’ to terrorists</strong></a><br><p>The Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan has said that terrorists are being “facilitated and given refuge to” in the tribal areas of the province, because of which security forces are compelled to carry out operations.
The remarks come days after alleged aerial strikes in KP’s Tirah valley killed at least two dozen residents, including women and children. The incident prompted protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, calling for an inquiry into the matter.
On the other hand, officials claimed that the explosions that led to the killings were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.
During an interview on the DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Wali was questioned about the PTI-led government in KP criticising the security situation in the province, with some suggesting the party was on board with military operations, while others claimed the party opposed the measures. He was asked how he viewed this apparent contradiction.
In response, Wali said, “Our brothers, sisters, friends, sons, children, and elders in tribal areas should not give refuge to people targeted in military operations.”
“Do not make people who are wanted by the state your guests,” Wali asserted.
When asked if he meant locals were sheltering the terrorists, Wali replied: “It certainly cannot be an outsider. How would the terrorists be operating in these areas otherwise?”
 
 

“Someone has to be giving refuge to them and facilitating them. And when operations are carried out, our citizens also lose their lives.”
At this point, Wali was asked to confirm if he was saying that locals of tribal areas were giving refuge to terrorists.
To this, Wali did not respond in the affirmative but instead repeated his claim, saying, “There certainly has to be facilitation from some side.”
The country, mainly KP and Balochistan, has lately witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, particularly after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a peace deal with the government and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement personnel.
Earlier this month, at least one person was killed in a bomb blast while a cricket match was being played in KP’s Bajaur district on Saturday, according to the police.
In May, four children were killed and five others, including a woman, were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan district, prompting locals to protest against frequent strikes.
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice.
While earlier this year, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.</p><small>2025-09-24 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2412593153d508c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944317/typhoon-ragasa-takes-aim-at-china-after-leaving-14-dead-in-taiwan-lashing-hong-kong' target='_blank'><strong>Typhoon Ragasa takes aim at China after leaving 14 dead in Taiwan, lashing Hong Kong</strong></a><br><p>Typhoon Ragasa, the world’s most powerful tropical cyclone this year, barreled towards tens of millions of people in southern China on Wednesday after killing 14 people in Taiwan, leaving scores missing and lashing Hong Kong with ferocious winds and heavy rains.
Some 129 people are missing in Taiwan’s eastern Hualien county, after a barrier lake overflowed and sent a wall of water into a town, the Taiwan fire department said on Wednesday, with Ragasa’s outer rim having drenched the island since Monday.
Many residents in the tourist town of Guangfu complained there was insufficient warning from Taiwan authorities, who are used to moving people out of potential danger zones swiftly on the island, which is frequently hit by typhoons.
 






As rains inundated Taiwan, Hong Kong grappled with huge waves that crashed over areas of the Asian financial hub’s eastern and southern shoreline, breaking into white-water streams as they rushed along pavements and submerged some roads alongside residential properties.
At the Fullerton hotel on the island’s south, videos on social media showed a torrent of seawater surging through its glass doors before flooding the floor area. Calls to the property remained unanswered on Wednesday.
China’s marine authority issued its highest “red” wave warning for the first time this year, forecasting storm surges of up to 2.8 metres (9 feet) in parts of Guangdong province, as Ragasa charges towards the densely populated Pearl River Delta.
Ragasa formed over the Western Pacific last week. Fueled by warm seas and favourable atmospheric conditions, the tropical cyclone rapidly intensified to become a Category 5 super typhoon on Monday with winds exceeding 260kph (162mph). It has since weakened to a Category 3 typhoon, which is still capable of bringing down trees and power lines, shattering windows and damaging buildings.
“Authorities have taken lessons from Hato and Mangkhut, which both caused billions of dollars in damage in 2017 and 2018,” said Chim Lee, a senior energy and climate change specialist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
“The Pearl River Delta is one of the best-prepared regions for typhoons, so we’re not expecting major disruptions. One change this year is that the Hong Kong stock market has stayed open during typhoons — a sign of how resilient the infrastructure has become,” he added.
That said, Zijin Gold International (2259.HK) delayed its $3.2 billion IPO in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
China braces for rainfall
After passing around 100 km (60 miles) south of Hong Kong over the next few hours, Ragasa is expected to make landfall along the south Chinese coast in the late afternoon.
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Dongguan, the largest cities in the storm’s path, are home to around 50 million people.
The emergency management ministry dispatched tens of thousands of tents, folding beds, emergency lighting equipment and other rescue supplies to Guangdong on Tuesday, Chinese state media reported, while over 770,000 people have been evacuated.
Some shops and restaurants in the province parked large rented trucks in front of their storefronts in a bid to shield them from the storm, local media reported.
“We live on an upper floor and saw there wasn’t too much danger, so I brought the kids out to experience this heavy rain and wind,” a 40-year-old Shenzhen resident surnamed Liang said. “We walked along the open road to make sure to stay safe.”
A crowd chasing the storm under the Shenzhen Bay Bridge were moved on by traffic police, a Reuters witness observed.
“The typhoon was really intense, but I’ve not been out long,” said an electric scooter delivery driver who goes by the name of Tim and was using his vehicle to move around and assess the damage.
“It’s a lot of fun, but it’s also dangerous. I wanted to ride around the waterfront, but it’s too dangerous, so I had to come back onto the bridge.”
China’s marine authority warned of a high risk of flooding in Shenzhen, especially in low-lying areas, with a storm surge alert expected to remain in effect until Thursday.
A woman and her five-year-old son were swept into the ocean on Tuesday after watching the typhoon from the Hong Kong waterfront, according to the South China Morning Post, which said they were now in intensive care.
Hong Kong lowered its typhoon signal to 8 from 10 just after 1pm (0500 GMT) on Wednesday, keeping the city locked down.
The hospital authority said at least 50 people had been injured by the typhoon, while the government had opened 50 temporary shelters, within which 791 sought refuge.
In the gambling hub of Macau next to Hong Kong, casinos were forced to shutter their gambling areas. Guests are not able to leave their property if they are staying there.

In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
Having received the TCO certification, the national carrier announced that it would now be allowed to operate direct flights and carry not only passengers but also cargo.
“In the first phase, flight operations to Manchester will be resumed, after which Birmingham and London will be included in the B network,” the statement read, adding that the carrier was informed about the approval a day prior.
“The same day, the British Department of Transport also issued PIA Security and Cargo ACC3 certificates for five years,” PIA added.
“These certificates, issued by international aviation organisations, are a manifestation of complete confidence in PIA’s air operations and safety.” it said.
In a post on X, the national carrier expressed gratitude to the prime minister, foreign minister, defence ministry and Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority for their assistance in getting operations resumed.
 






The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-09-24 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/241056222336f5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944307/pm-shehbaz-urges-imf-to-consider-flood-impact-in-next-review-of-pakistans-economy' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz urges IMF to consider flood impact in next review of Pakistan’s economy</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday stated that Pakistan was steadily meeting its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme commitments, but urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its upcoming review for the country.
The prime minister made the remarks during a meeting with Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, on the sidelines of the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
According to a Topline Securities’ report, Pakistan is on track to meet all seven Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC) set by the IMF ahead of the September 25 review of its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF),  which was approved in May this year. The review will assess Pakistan’s performance for the March–June quarter of 2025.
However, massive floods in the country have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
A statement issued by the Press Information Department (PID) following today’s meeting between PM Shehbaz and Georgieva said: “While emphasising that Pakistan was making steady progress towards meeting the various targets and commitments under the IMF programme, the prime minister said that the impact of the recent floods on Pakistan’s economy must be factored into the IMF’s review.”
The government had been optimistic about 2026, pencilling in 4.2 per cent growth on the back of a rebound in farming and manufacturing after the economy was stabilised under the IMF bailout. Instead, record monsoon rains since late June, amplified by dam releases from India, have submerged large swathes of Punjab and Sindh.
While waters have yet to recede in many districts, officials and analysts warn the hit could be deeper than in 2022, when a third of the country lay under water, due to dual shocks to agriculture and manufacturing.
A report from the agricultural monitoring initiative GEOGLAM estimates at least 220,000 hectares of rice fields flooded between August 1 and September 16. In Punjab, 1.8 million acres of farmland have been inundated, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
According to the PID statement, Georgieva expressed her sympathy to all people affected by the floods.
“She noted the importance of the damage assessment to underpin recovery priorities,” the statement said, adding that the official commended PM Shehbaz’s commitment to pursuing sound macro-economic policies and reiterated the IMF’s continued support as Pakistan advances the necessary economic reforms to ensure sustainable long-term economic growth.
During the meeting, the premier also appreciated the IMF’s longstanding constructive partnership with Pakistan.
He acknowledged the IMF’s timely support under various instruments, including the Stand By Arrangement for $3bn in FY 2024, followed by the EFF of $7bn and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) of $1.4bn, per the statement.
“Today, with the institution of deep-rooted structural reforms, Pakistan’s economy [is] showing positive signs of stabilisation and is now moving towards recovery,” the premier was quoted as saying.
Premier meets World Bank president
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met World Bank (WB) Group President Ajay Banga and praised the bank’s support to the country, according to a separate press release issued by the PID.

While appreciating Banga’s leadership, the premier briefed him of the government’s “comprehensive reform agenda, encompassing resource mobilisation, energy sector reforms, privatisation and measures to build resilience against climate change”.
“He reiterated that the reform agenda had steered Pakistan towards macroeconomic stabilisation, restored investor confidence and promoted sustainable and inclusive economic growth,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF), providing $40bn for Pakistan, reaffirming commitment to ensure its effective implementation in close coordination with provincial governments, it added.
The WB president appreciated Pakistan’s reform measures and reaffirmed commitment to the country’s development agenda. “He emphasised the bank’s readiness to extend continued support for advancing economic reforms and undertaking long-term initiatives on climate resilience under the new CPF,” the press release added.
It further stated, “Both sides reiterated their resolve to further strengthen cooperation under the CPF in order to advance Pakistan’s development priorities.”

The plan was first launched in Indonesia earlier this month with “positive” reception. According to Google, the new plan opens up “more access to powerful AI tools to help people level up their productivity and creativity at an accessible price”.
“Pakistan’s digital landscape is vibrant and growing, and we’ve been inspired by the creativity Pakistanis have shown in adopting AI tools,” said the Country Director of Google Pakistan, Farhan Qureshi, in a statement.
“With the launch of Google AI Plus, we are making these tools even more accessible to more people across the country. This is a core part of our commitment to fuel Pakistan’s digital transformation, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to enhance their productivity, creativity, and learning with AI,” Qureshi was quoted as saying.
The plan includes the following features:

Higher limits for image generation and editing (Nano Banana) in the Gemini app
More access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google’s most capable AI model for complex queries
Access to Veo 3 Fast, Google’s video generation model, in Gemini, Whisk, and Flow
Gemini integration in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more
200 GB of storage across Photos, Drive, and Gmail

Moreover, the statement added: “Users can share all of these benefits — from Gemini in Workspace to the 200 GB of storage — with up to five other family members.”
This, as per Google, is “an easy way for everyone to enjoy an upgraded Google experience with a single plan”.
“Google AI Plus is available in Pakistan starting today for Rs1,400 per month,” said the statement. “For a limited time, first-time subscribers will get 50 per cent off for the first six months.”

Two days after getting thrashed by arch-rivals India for the second time in the tournament, the national side bounced back with a hard-fought five-wicket victory against Sri Lanka on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi.
It was a low-scoring encounter and Pakistan were clearly not clinical, especially with the bat, but it sure was a confidence boost for the side reeling after the India drubbings.
 
 

More importantly, the match-winning performances came from players who were under fire coming into the clash. While Hussain Talat — whose selection was questioned in the Super Four match against India — took the anchor’s role after impressing with the ball, Mohammad Nawaz bounced back from a poor show in the previous game to turn finisher for Pakistan. Abrar Ahmed, who was battered by the Indian openers on Sunday, showed against Sri Lanka that he can’t be kept quiet for long. Shaheen Shah Afridi, meanwhile, spearheaded the Pakistan attack in the truest sense, producing the results with the new ball.
Hussain’s redemption
Few players had come under the microscope as quickly as Hussain Talat. Drafted in ahead of the India match, his inclusion was questioned after he struggled with both bat and ball in that lopsided defeat. Against Sri Lanka, however, the left-hander produced a display of calm and composure that showed why the management had placed their trust in him.
Chasing a tricky target of 134, Pakistan were wobbling at 80 for five in the 12th over. The collapse threatened to undo all the hard work the bowlers had put in earlier. Hussain, though, held his nerve. His unbeaten 32 off 30 balls was not a match-winning knock in terms of brute force, but in the context of the game, it was invaluable.
He read the situation perfectly, absorbed pressure when wickets kept tumbling, and then rotated the strike smartly once Nawaz began to find his range. The calmness he exuded rubbed off on Nawaz too, giving Pakistan stability during a phase where another wicket could have been fatal. In many ways, Talat’s innings was a reminder that anchors still have their place in T20 cricket.

Nawaz the finisher
If Hussain provided calm, Mohammad Nawaz brought the fire. Criticised for a timid knock against India, Nawaz had looked short on confidence in recent games. But Tuesday was a different story. He played with intent from the moment he arrived at the crease, cracking boundaries and, more importantly, clearing the ropes when pressure seemed to be mounting.
His unbeaten 38 off just 24 deliveries included three sixes — each one a dagger to Sri Lanka’s hopes of sneaking back into the game. The left-hander targeted the spinners effectively, using his reach and timing to pick gaps at will. What stood out was the clarity of his role: he was there to finish, and he finished in style.
For a side that has often been criticised for lacking reliable finishers, Nawaz’s innings was a timely reminder of what he can offer. If Pakistan are to go deeper into the tournament, this version of Nawaz — aggressive, fearless, and decisive — will be indispensable.

Unplayable Abrar
Abrar Ahmed’s previous outing had been a nightmare. India’s openers neutralised him with ease, treating his mystery spin with disdain. But class, as they say, is permanent, and Abrar bounced back superbly against Sri Lanka.
Bowling with discipline and guile, he finished with miserly figures of one for eight from his four overs. His variations were subtle, his length immaculate, and his control suffocated the Sri Lankan middle order. With Kamindu Mendis waging a lone battle at one end, Abrar’s spell ensured that partnerships never flourished.
It was the kind of performance that not only restored his confidence but also reaffirmed his importance in Pakistan’s T20 setup. On UAE pitches that favour spinners who can maintain pressure, Abrar could yet become a trump card in Pakistan’s campaign.

Good old Shaheen
If Abrar squeezed the middle overs, Shaheen Shah Afridi blew the top off Sri Lanka’s innings. Pakistan’s spearhead was at his best with the new ball, producing the trademark swing and venom that has made him one of the most feared fast bowlers in the world.
He struck early to remove Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka, derailing Sri Lanka’s hopes of a strong start. Later, just as Kamindu Mendis threatened to take the game away, Shaheen returned to deliver a searing yorker that ended the left-hander’s resistance. His three for 28 was the bedrock on which Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to a modest total.
For a side that often depends on early breakthroughs to control games, Shaheen’s spell was priceless. It was also a reminder that when Pakistan’s talisman is in rhythm, he can tilt contests almost single-handedly.

The victory against Sri Lanka does not erase the scars of the India defeats, but it does inject belief into a side that looked rudderless just 48 hours earlier. Importantly, the players who had been under fire stood up and delivered, giving the management more options and flexibility heading into crunch fixtures.
The batting remains fragile — the top order once again failed to provide solidity, and questions over strike rotation linger. But with Nawaz finding form, Hussain proving his worth, Abrar reasserting his quality, and Shaheen firing, Pakistan now have momentum.
The Asia Cup is far from over, and sterner challenges lie ahead. Yet, if Pakistan can build on the grit and resilience shown in Abu Dhabi, they may yet turn this campaign into something memorable.</p><small>2025-09-24 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24113147f428455.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944310/at-least-12-dead-as-record-rain-floods-indias-kolkata' target='_blank'><strong>At least 12 dead as record rain floods India’s Kolkata</strong></a><br><p>At least 12 people died as heavy rain lashed the eastern Indian city of Kolkata and surrounding areas ahead of a major festival, flooding streets, disrupting transport and leaving residents stranded for hours, officials said on Wednesday.
Most of the rain, as much as 251.6 mm (9.9 inches) in 24 hours, fell during the early hours of Tuesday and was the heaviest witnessed in the city since 1988, said HR Biswas, the regional head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Kolkata.
Police said nine people died in Kolkata, with most of the deaths due to electrocution. Two people drowned, they added.
The rains brought the state capital to a standstill, seriously hampering preparations for the upcoming Durga Puja — the biggest annual festival of Hindus in West Bengal state.
Many pandals, temporary structures built with bamboo and other materials for the festival, and clay idols of the deities also suffered damage across the city.
 






Roads were submerged under waist-deep water in some areas, stranding vehicles and forcing commuters to wade through flooded streets.
Road, train, and air traffic were severely disrupted, with several flights and trains cancelled or delayed. Power outages affected multiple areas for hours, compounding residents’ difficulties.
“I got stranded in my hotel as my flight got cancelled and the roads were all waterlogged,” said Ranjan Panda, a water and climate expert.
Authorities said they have deployed water pumps to clear streets and railway tracks, with relief measures, including food distribution and emergency services, underway.
 
 

The IMD predicted more rain in the state and eastern India over the next few days due to the formation of a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal.
The state government declared schools and other educational institutions closed on Wednesday and Thursday before the holidays, for the festival to take effect from Friday.
Officials said conditions will normalise by Wednesday evening while urging residents to remain cautious as water levels gradually recede in low-lying areas.
“This should not have happened after four hours of rain. West Bengal is not in a good condition,” Sandip Ghosh, a resident in Kolkata, told Indian news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake.</p><small>2025-09-24 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24101352f46e2df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944296/trumps-gaza-plan-diplomacy-dilemmas-and-pakistans-role' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s Gaza plan: Diplomacy, dilemmas, and Pakistan’s role</strong></a><br><p>After a fiery address at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, where he opposed the growing wave of global recognition for a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump convened a high-level meeting with leaders of Muslim-majority countries to present Washington’s plan for ending the war in Gaza.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar represented Pakistan at the gathering, alongside leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Türkiye, and Indonesia.
The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session, brought together regional heavyweights in an unprecedented show of diplomatic coordination. Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests:
“We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.”
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 65,000 people in response to the Hamas attack and the taking of hostages.
Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.”
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani responded to Trump’s comments by thanking him for hosting the meeting.
“We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” he said.
Pakistan’s consistent advocacy
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while talking to Pakistani journalists, welcomed Trump’s commitment, describing it as evidence that the US leader was “indeed a man of peace”.
He recalled Washington’s role in preventing a potentially devastating conflict between India and Pakistan back in May, adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.”
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, in an earlier UN engagement, highlighted the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, describing it as a “graveyard for humanity” and urging the international community to move beyond statements to tangible action.
Pakistan’s participation reflects a careful balancing act: maintaining constructive engagement with Washington while insisting on Palestinian sovereignty, adherence to international law, and a two-state solution. In doing so, Islamabad aligns with Arab states that reject unilateral solutions undermining Palestinian self-determination.
Anatomy of Trump’s proposal
According to reports from Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios, President Trump’s plan envisions:

An immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and
deceased
Phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian
Authority
Deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and
facilitate Israel’s withdrawal
Internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes
funded by regional contributors

These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan.
In interviews with various US channels, Secretary of State Marco Rubio framed the proposal in long-term terms.
“The only way to a permanent solution to the challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement,” he said.
“One in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.”
Describing the New York meeting as “one last shot” in an interview with CBS News, Rubio emphasised its goal: ending the Gaza conflict, securing all remaining hostages, and establishing a humanitarian relief framework.
Multiple challenges
Trump’s plan attempts to address three simultaneous crises: Israel’s security concerns, Palestinian humanitarian needs, and the geopolitical desire of the US to position itself as the ultimate mediator.
However, the plan faces multiple challenges, including legitimacy, as excluding Hamas would risk alienating a significant portion of the Palestinian population.
Secondly, the plan could have regional consensus. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that proposals affecting Gaza’s population without their consent constituted “a very different threat to world peace.”
Thirdly, the on-the-ground realities pose extraordinary challenges. With more than 65,000 Palestinians reported killed since October 7 — most of them civilians — achieving a swift diplomatic settlement will be exceedingly difficult.
Trump’s outreach contrasts with his UNGA speech, where he criticised European recognitions of Palestine as rewarding Hamas for “horrible atrocities” and pressed instead for a “ceasefire-for-prisoners” deal.
Meanwhile, 154 countries have recognised Palestine, underscoring the limits of Washington’s unilateral influence.
Humanitarian and political implications
Beyond ceasefires, Trump’s plan seeks to reshape Gaza’s political landscape — empowering the Palestinian Authority while relying on regional peacekeepers. While this could stabilise governance temporarily, it risks inflaming political tensions if not paired with inclusive, locally sanctioned negotiations.
Pakistan’s emphasis on legality, human rights, and the two-state solution ensures that its stance remains morally credible and aligned with international law. This approach also strengthens Islamabad’s credibility among Muslim-majority nations increasingly wary of unilateral Western initiatives.
US mediation shows assertiveness but future remains uncertain
Trump’s Gaza plan embodies both ambition and risk. Diplomatically, it signals an assertive US effort to mediate a complex conflict, yet long-term prospects remain uncertain. Pakistan’s careful balancing — engaging with Washington, reaffirming Palestinian rights, and urging immediate humanitarian relief —  illustrates the nuanced role smaller, principled actors can play in global crises.
As Rubio framed it, the New York meeting was “one last shot” at ending the conflict, securing hostages, and establishing humanitarian relief.
For Pakistan, the challenge lies in ensuring that this diplomatic opportunity upholds justice, protects human life, and preserves the possibility of a sovereign, viable Palestine.</p><small>2025-09-24 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24104523089771f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944266/ihc-judges-consult-lawyers-after-sc-registrars-objections' target='_blank'><strong>IHC judges consult lawyers after SC registrar’s objections</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Su­­preme Court registrar’s administrative objections to the petitions filed by Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges has deepened an unprecedented dispute within the judiciary, with the five judges subsequently consulting senior lawyers.
Last week, IHC judges — Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahan­gi­­ri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Sam­an Rafat Imtiaz — went to the Supreme Court, where four of them filed petitions concerning the internal affairs of the high cou­rt. The registrar of the Su­­preme Court later rais­­ed multiple objections to the petitions.
The judges separately met senior lawyers Faisal Siddiqui and Abid Zubairi on Monday and Tuesday.
Advocate Siddiqui had earlier argued on their behalf during the hearing of a petition filed against the transfer of incumbent Chief Justice Sardar Moh­ammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif.
He was initially enga­ged by former Islamabad High Court Bar Assoc­ia­tion (IHCBA) president Riasat Ali Azad to defend the five judges’ case, but that petition was withdrawn by his successor. Mr Azad, however, retained him as counsel while filing another identical petition through four former IHCBA presidents.
 
 

The Supreme Court’s Registrar Office on Monday raised administrative objections to the petitions separately filed by the five sitting IHC judges. The judges had appeared in person before the Supreme Court last Friday to institute constitutional petitions challenging the exercise of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
In their pleas, the judges sought a declaration that the  administrative powers of the IHC chief justice could not be exercised in  a manner that undermined judicial authority. They argued that once a  bench was seized of a matter, the CJ-IHC was not empowered to transfer  cases, reconstitute the bench, or exclude available judges from the  roster at will.
According to the objections, the petitioners invoked the apex court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the grievances raised were of an individual nature and thus not maintainable in view of the 1998 Zulfiqar Mehdi case. In that judgement, the Supreme Court had held that Article 184(3) could not be pressed into service for redress of personal grievances.

Speaking at the inauguration of the 26th ITCN Asia expo in Karachi, she assured that 5G was on track but dismissed current disruptions as a “technical issue” caused by damage to two submarine cables in the Red Sea near Jeddah.
She said her ministry was taking steps to expand submarine cable capacity and strengthen fibre networks to ensure more reliable internet services.
The minister said IT was also a central pillar of the recently signed Pakis­tan-Saudi Arabia agreem­ent, and the sector would play a key role in economic stability and growth.
She claimed that Pakis­tan’s macro-economic situation had improved, inflation had come down, and international institutions were praising the country’s resilience. Karachi, she said, remained the backbone of national economic development.
Ms Khawaja said the government was pushing ahead with the Digital Pakistan initiative, aiming to expand digitalisation, promote a cashless economy and meet IT ex­­port targets. She said the Special Investment Fa­­cilitation Council (SIFC) was set up to improve the ease of doing business and attract investment.
The minister also highlighted the federal cabinet’s approval of the national Artificial Intelligence policy, stressing that work was underway on its implementation.

The WHO said evidence of a link remained inconsistent and urged caution in drawing conclusions.
Trump had linked autism to childhood vaccine use and the taking of Tylenol by women when pregnant.
The European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that there was no new evidence that would require changes to the region’s current recommendations for the use of paracetamol, known as Tylenol in the United States, during pregnancy.
“Available evidence has found no link between the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and autism,” the EMA said, adding paracetamol could be used during pregnancy when needed, though at the lowest effective dose and frequency. Earlier, Britain’s health regulator said it was safe to use.
“The evidence remains inconsistent,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jaarevi told a Geneva press briefing when asked about a possible link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism. He cited unspecified studies that pointed to a possible link, but said this was not confirmed by subsequent research. “This lack of replicability really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions,” he said.

• Naushahro Feroze tops the list with 89pc coverage
• 33pc girls immunised in Karachi division; district Keamari ranks last with 12pc coverage
KARACHI: As the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination campaign enters its final stages, data collected by the Sindh Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) shows that Karachi has seen the lowest coverage so far in the province, much to the surprise and disappointment of health department officials and experts.
Launched last week, on Sept 15, the first-ever initiative in the province to protect girls, aged nine to 14, from cervical cancer concludes on 27.
The drive targets 4.1 million girls, aiming to cover 1,190 union councils across 30 districts of the province.
According to the data, 57 per cent girls have been vaccinated in seven days across the province with Naushahro Feroze seeing the highest coverage (89pc) followed by Qambar (88pc), Badin and Sujawal (85pc each), Ghotki (84pc), Sanghar (82pc), Tharparkar (81pc), Sukkur (80pc), Kashmore (79pc), Dadu (74pc), Umerkot (73pc), Khairpur and Tando Muhammad Khan (72pc each), Larkana and Matiari (71pc each), Thatta (70pc), Jamshoro (66), Shaheed Benazirabad (64pc), Shikarpur (59pc), Mirpurkhas (51pc), Tando Allahyar (50pc), Hyderabad (49pc) and Jacobabad (46pc).
Karachi division has seen an overall 33pc vaccination coverage. Of the target 887,692, a total of 288,477 girls have been vaccinated so far.
The highest coverage was recorded in District West (65pc) followed by Korangi (38pc), District South (34pc), District Malir (32pc), Central (27pc), East (22pc) and Keamari (12pc).
“There has been persistent false propaganda against the HPV vaccine by some social media influencers from day one that greatly harmed the campaign in Karachi where they have large following. These people have no medical background. Opposition from certain religious circles came in at a later stage,” Dr Khalid Shafi of the Pakistan Paediatric Association said, while explaining the poor public response to the vaccination campaign in Karachi.
A significant population (affected by the misleading information), he pointed out, decided to wait and see the drive’s outcomes. “Hopefully, the families would re-think their decision. Having said that, our vaccination rates are generally around 70 percent, even without people spreading false information.”
EPI Project Director Dr Raj Kumar described Karachi’s response as “surprising”.
“Towns with low literacy levels have performed better. I think area MPAs and political leaders played a key role in encouraging families (in rest of Sindh) to get their daughters vaccinated,” he said, adding that there wouldn’t be any major change in the strategy at this moment.
“However, we have increased sessions of parental counselling in schools in Karachi where we aren’t seeing encouraging responses. Having said that, the province of Sindh and Karachi have performed better than the rest of Pakistan. For instance, the HPV vaccination coverage in Islamabad is 18percent so far.”
According to officials, Pakistan is the 149th country to introduce this vaccine into its immunisation schedule. It’s already being used in Muslim countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Indonesia.
Cervical cancer is the second deadliest cancer for women worldwide and a major health threat in Pakistan, with a mortality rate exceeding 65 per cent. The HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine is the first-ever cancer prevention vaccine.
The vaccine, experts say, is safe and effective, providing 100 per cent protection from cervical cancer.

The measures taken for the safety of people will affect tens of millions of people and see multiple factories shut across China’s manufacturing heartland.
Chinese tech hub Shenzhen has ordered the evacuation of 400,000 people, with the city’s emergency management authorities warning of “severe wind, rain, waves and floods”.
“Except for emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people’s livelihood, please do not go out casually,” the authorities said in a statement, adding that work and market closures will begin in the afternoon.

Other cities in Guangdong province that are implementing the suspension measures include Cha­o­zhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Foshan.
“The strong winds and heavy rainfall that the typhoon will bring will severely impact our city, posing a critical defence situation,” Foshan’s emergency headquarters said in a statement.
Ragasa was generating maximum sustained winds of 230 kilometres (140 miles) per hour at its centre while churning across the South China Sea, according to Hong Kong’s weather service, having earlier hit parts of the Philippines.
Hong Kong shuts down
Hong Kong shut down ahead of Super Typhoon Ragasa on Tuesday, with authorities urging people to stay at home, while most passenger flights were due to be suspended until Thursday.
People piled into supermarkets, leaving little on the shelves, as panic buying set in and residents stocked up on necessities for fear that shops could be closed for two days.
Windows in homes and businesses across the city were taped up, with residents hoping it could help reduce the impact of any shattered glass.

Guangdong authorities evacuated over 770,000 people, state broadcaster CCTV said, adding that more than one million people are expected to be relocated across the province on Tuesday.
Hong Kong issued the typhoon signal 8, its third highest at 2.20pm, which urges most businesses and transport services to shut down. More than 700 flights have been disrupted, including in the neighbouring gambling hub of Macau and in Taiwan.
The weather is expected to deteriorate rapidly.

Palestinian and Jordanian authorities had said earlier on Tuesday that Israel would close the border the following day.
The crossing serves as the main gateway for many Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to travel abroad and is used to transport commercial goods between Jordan and their territory.
The move comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday the government would give its “response” to other countries recognising a Palestinian state once he returns from a visit to the United States.

Allenby Crossing serves as main gateway for Palestinians in the occupied territory to travel abroad

France, Britain, Canada and Australia are among several countries who have or will recognise Palestine this week, in what they hope will revive momentum for the two-state solution.
Some of Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition allies have said that the government should annex the occupied West Bank in response.
Israel fully reopened the Allenby crossing on Monday, four days after alleging that a Jordanian truck driver had shot dead two of its soldiers. The crossing was closed following the shooting.
A spokesperson for the Israeli authority overseeing the Allenby crossing  said it would be closed from Wednesday morning “at the direction of the  political leadership”.
Rally in occupied West Bank
Crowds of people rallied in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, waving flags and holding posters of President Mahmud Abbas to celebrate the wave of recognition by Western powers of a Palestinian state.
Nationalist slogans blared from loudspeakers across the central square in Ramallah, where a crowd of more than 100 clutched Palestinian and European flags alongside signs reading “stop the genocide”.
High-ranking officials from Abbas’s political movement, Fatah, and the Palestinian Authority — which exerts limited control in the occupied territory — shook hands and smiled.
“This recognition is a first step in a process that we hope will continue,” Jibril Rajoub, secretary general of Fatah’s central committee, said.
“It is the result of more than a century of resistance and determination by our people.”
Rajoub said he had felt moved listening to the speeches made at the UN General Assembly in New York the night before.
“We must learn from the past and unite the people,” he said.
Maysoon Mahmud, 39, who is also a Fatah member, said:  “We came here today to thank the countries that have recognised Palestine, but also to ask them to continue to support us in stopping the war.
“It is time for the world to take responsibility.”
Further north in Tulkarem, dozens more gathered, holding the flags of countries that now recognise a Palestinian state.
But many Palestinians expressed ambivalence at the move due to the bitter reality on the ground.
Roula Ghaneb, an academic from Tulkarem, stood impassively in the middle of the Ramallah rally, holding a photo of her 20-year-old son, Yazan.
“He was arrested at our home eight months ago,” she said, adding that he was being held in poor conditions.
Ghaneb said she wanted an end to all violence, insisting: “We don’t want words, we want action.”

• Want case to be heard by full court
ISLAMABAD: Against the backdrop of growing calls for an early hearing, an eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court will resume on Oct 7 proceedings on a set of petitions challenging the 26th Constitution Amendment.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the bench also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
On Aug 20, senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar had written a joint letter following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31, 2024 committee’s minutes that called for a full court meeting to determine the vires of the 26th Amendment.
Two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website on Aug 14, explaining why he had disregarded the committee’s decision. The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past.
In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”
The last hearing on the challenges was held on Jan 27, when the Constitutional Bench had asked different petitioners to consider the existing eight-judge bench as the full court. At that hearing, Justice Mazhar noted: “This is not the domain of the CB to constitute the Full Court or refer the matter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan after Article 191A of the Constitution.” He explained that a Full Court cannot be formed merely on the wishes of lawyers.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, however, issued notices to the respondents on points raised by counsel regarding reference of the matter to the Full Court, the amendment’s impact on judicial independence, and arrangements for live streaming of proceedings.
The Supreme Court is currently seized with multiple petitions filed by the PTI, individuals and various high court bar associations, urging the constitution of a Full Court to hear the matter rather than the Constitutional Bench formed under the 26th Amendment.
The petitions had argued that the process through which the amendment was passed contravened Articles 63A, 238 and 239 of the Constitution, pointing to the absence of a fully constituted parliament, the inclusion of defecting members’ votes and other procedural irregularities that allegedly rendered its passage unconstitutional and of no legal effect.
The petitioners also sought to have Sections 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 21 and 27 of the 26th Amendment declared unconstitutional, ultra vires and in direct conflict with the Constitution’s salient features and, therefore, void ab initio.
 
 

They pleaded that any appointments made by individuals or bodies pursuant to the 26th Amendment and its consequential legislation were unlawful and without authority, and should be set aside.
The petitions also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

It said the exercise was likely to be held in Madhya Pradesh.
The drill aimed at assessing the effectiveness and shortcomings of the current air defence capabilities. Confirming the development, a senior official was quoted as saying the exercise would focus on evaluating operational readiness against evolving aerial threats.
The Cold Start doctrine was developed by the Indian armed forces involving rapid, integrated offensive operations by combined arms units. It would thus bypass traditional slow troop mobilisation to achieve conventional objectives within a limited timeframe.

Drill aimed at assessing shortcomings of current air defence capabilities

The doctrine was developed after Operation Parakram exposed India’s slow response to the 2001 Parliament attack, the doctrine aims to provide a swift, decisive, and limited military response to terrorism without triggering a full-scale war. Analysts, however, say it carries a significant risk of escalating conflict to the nuclear level given Pakistan’s possession of tactical nuclear weapons.
 
 

Industry partners, research and development agencies, academia, and other stakeholders, too, will participate in the ‘Cold Start’ exercise.
Speaking at a conference on “Counter UAVs & Air Defence Systems — The Future of Modern Warfare” in Delhi, India’s Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit making a pointed reference to Pakistan said, “They too are working to ‘become like India’, so we must always stay a step ahead.
“Our counter-drone and GPS jamming systems performed effectively during Operation Sindoor, ensuring no damage from adversary drones. But the adversary has also learned our capabilities. Next time, we have to be ahead and much better,” The Hindu quoted him as saying.
He said the vision for the future involves an integrated defence system, inspired by the Sudarshan Chakra concept, to counter drones, UAVs, hypersonic weapons, and other threats. There is a need for systems usable in both peace and wartime, taking into consideration anti-social elements acquiring drone technology, necessitating widespread counter-drone capabilities.

• Boasts of stopping ‘seven wars’; questions the need for a global watchdog
• Criticises European immigration policies, offers his own crackdown on immigrants as a model to follow
• Jokingly complains about malfunctioning escalators, teleprompters
UNITED NATIONS: In a combative, wide-ranging speech before UN General Assembly on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump railed against climate change, and told world leaders their countries were “going to hell” because of their immigration policies.
The 56-minute speech was a rebuke to the world body and a return to form for Trump, who routinely bashed the UN during his first term as president.
Trump, who has cast himself as a peacemaker in a bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize, complained that the United Nations did not support his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
 


“I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help,” he said.
“What is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such tremendous potential … but it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential. All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action,” he said.
However, in a meeting with the UN chief after his speech, Trump struck a softer note, saying: “Our country is behind the United Nations 100pc… I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it”.
In a moment of levity, Trump jokingly complained that a UN escalator had abruptly stopped as he and First Lady Melania Trump were halfway up and then the teleprompter in the General Assembly did not work.
“I can only say that whoever’s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” he said. These are the two things I got from the United Nations a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.” a UN official said the White House operated the teleprompter.
After Trump finished speaking, UNGA President Annalena Baer­bock said: “The UN telep­r­o­mpters are working perfectly.”
‘Pet’ topics
But much of his speech was dominated by two of his biggest grievances: climate change and immigration.
President Trump called climate change a “con job” and urged a return to a greater reliance on fossil fuels as he mocked renewables as a “joke”.
The “carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they’re heading down a path of total destruction,” he insisted.
“We’re getting rid of the falsely named renewables, by the way, they’re a joke, they don’t work, they’re too expensive,” he said at another point, calling wind technology “so pathetic, so bad,” and boasted that he had instead “unleashed” massive efforts to drill for new oil, gas and coal reserves. “Immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,” he said. Trump also offered his US immigration crackdown as a case study for what other world leaders should do to curb mass migration he says is altering the fabric of nations.
He also mocked Nato allies for not shutting down purchases of Russian oil.
“They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one? In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs,” he said. Scientists and world leaders reacted sharply to the US president’s barbs.
“President Trump and his administration continue to spew lies and disinformation about climate science and the overwhelming benefits of clean energy, a grave disservice to the American people,” said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Conc­erned Scientists.
“Climate change is here, it’s costly, and people need real solutions, not propaganda designed to boost the profits of fossil fuel polluters,” she argued.

LAHORE / DADU: The Punjab government on Tuesday announced a relief package for people affected by recent floods, but stopped short of giving a date for its distribution.
“A sum of Rs1 million will be given to the owner of a destroyed house and Rs500,000 for partially damaged houses,” Punjab Inform­ation Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference.
She said that farmers whose land had been submerged would receive Rs20,000 per acre, while compensation of Rs500,000 would be provided for each cow or buffalo lost.
“All these payments are being made from the Punjab government’s own resources without seeking external aid,” she said, taking a jibe at the PPP that has been pressing the federal government to appeal to the international community for help.
Ms Bokhari said that “relief cards” would be introduced so that the flood victims could receive aid without standing in long queues.
She said 10,000 employees had been deployed to conduct surveys in flood-affected areas, but no timeframe had been set for compensation payments.
The minister said that more than 4.7 million people and 2.1 million livestock had been affected across 27 districts and 4,794 villages, including areas along three rivers. “For relief and rescue operations, 2,213 teams are still working in the field,” she added.
Ms Bokhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had visited every flood-hit area and claimed the provincial government had set an example in relief and rescue operations, while criticising opposition parties for politicising the issue.
Breaches in Sutlej embankment
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding triggered by three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the river Sutlej has inundated vast swathes of Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts, leaving thousands homeless and critical infrastructure severely damaged.
The embankment gave way at three locations — Noraja Bhutta union council in Jalalpur Pirwala, Bahadurpur and Jhangra. One breach widened to 400 feet, while two others stretched 30 to 40 feet.
The breaches diverted the Sutlej’s flow into nearby villages, submerging dozens of settlements, including Jhan­gra, Bahadurpur, Noraja Bhu­tta, Kotla Chakar, Tarut Bash­arat, Basti Lang, Basti Kanu, Depalpur and Khairpur Dha.
The floodwaters also damaged the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, creating a lake between the two roads. Authorities carried out a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water towards the Chenab River.
A senior irrigation official said 70,000 to 80,000 cusecs of water was still flowing in the Sutlej and could reach the area within a day or two. He said efforts were underway around the clock to plug the breaches, which could take up to 12 days to seal completely.
He said that the authorities were also diverting the water to the canals at Sulemanki and Islam headworks and 20,000 to 25,000 cusecs of water in the Sutlej would further decrease near Noraja Bhutta, which would take the usual course to enter the Chenab River.
Meanwhile, the residents of these union councils were forced to live on Gilani Road and other embankments under the open sky, many without tents or food.
Shakir Kanu of Basti Kanu told Dawn that water would not recede in their areas until the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta dyke were plugged.
He said that most houses in his locality were destroyed or collapsed, while some were under threat due to the continuously rising water.
 
 

“The government is making efforts to save the motorway and bringing heavy stones, but no effort is being made to save our areas,” he lamented.
Mr Kanu further said that the people and cattle heads were not getting proper food and they were also facing medical issues.
On CM Maryam Nawaz’s instructions, 44 additional machines were dispatched to the breach site in Lodhran, with senior ministers overseeing the operation.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.7 million people had been affected across 27 districts, with 271 relief camps and 300 medical camps set up, while over 2.6m people and 2.1m animals had been moved to safety.
According to Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Dire­ctor General Irfan Ali Kathia, the overall water flow in Punjab’s rivers is normal and water levels in flood-affected areas are significantly receding, where rehabilitation measures are ongoing.
Dadu villages submerged
In Sindh, as a medium flood passes through the Kotri Barrage, several parts of Jamshoro district have been submerged.
These include parts of Sehwan, Laki Shah Sadar, Amri, Sun, Manjhand, Lakha, Indpur, Budhapur, Aliabad, Khanot, Petaro, Kotri, Khanpur, and Karokho, among others.
Homes , infrastructure and agricultural land in these regions has suffered extensive damage. In Sehwan, 10 more villages have come under floodwater. The flood has crossed the bridge on Indus Highway and reached the historic Lal Bagh area. Water has also entered the graveyard near Lal Bagh and inundated nearby homes.
Electricity supply has been completely suspended in the riverine areas, leaving residents in a lurch, while road links have been severed as connecting thoroughfares remain under water.
In addition, several parts of Manjhand are under water. Villagers from Goth Detha, located near the shrine of Shah Owais Qarani, are stranded after their road link was severed by rising floodwaters.
The area’s plight was depicted in a video shared on social media, showing a funeral procession trudging though three to four feet of water.

• Imran’s lawyer opposes video link arrangement for PTI chief, will appeal ATC order
• Plea in IHC seeks enforcement of conjugal rights for incarcerated ex-PM, spouse
RAWALPINDI: The prosecution is likely to conclude its evidence against former prime minister Imran Khan and other PTI leaders next week in the case pertaining to a violent protest outside the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023, following the arrest of Mr Khan in a corruption case.
During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court.
On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order.
The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement.
The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests.
Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership.
According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing.
He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards.
The court adjourned the case till Sept 27.
Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024.
Conjugal rights
Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued notices to the authorities concerned on a petition seeking permission for Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while incarcerated in prison.
Justice Arbab Tahir took up the petition filed under Article 199 by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and Imran’s supporter.
The court issued a one-page written order, directing the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Punjab government, Punjab’s inspector general of prisons, and the jail superintendent, among others, to submit their replies before the next hearing.
During proceedings, the petitioner’s lawyer argued that Section 545A of the Criminal Proc­edure Code supported the protection of family life and provision of facilities for marital relations to prisoners as a basic need.
He argued that denial of conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous judicial rulings. It also cites a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh Home Department in compliance with Supreme Court directions, allowing convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. Additionally, the petition relies on a landmark Shariat Court judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement.

• US president calls for immediate end to war, tells Muslim leaders ‘this is the group that can do it’
• Opposes recognition of Palestine statehood in UNGA speech; Rubio says permanent solution only possible through ‘negotiated settlement’
NEW YORK: After an antagonistic speech at the UN General Assembly, where he opposed a growing global push towards the recognition of a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump met Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to present his plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza.
The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia.
Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.”
“We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders.
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back.
“We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said.
‘Stop the war immediately’
Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas.
He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza.
Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead.
“We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said.
Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”.
He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.”
 
 

The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM.
When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.”
The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press.
Plan for peace
According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave.
Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines.
 
 

It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled.
Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported.
Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”.
Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.”
In separate remarks to CBS News, he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.

According to railway officials, six bogies of the train coming from Peshawar derailed after the blast and one overturned, injuring the passengers in that carriage.
It was the second blast in the same area within 10 hours. Earlier in the morning, an explosion had occurred near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country, just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta Railway Station. The train was briefly halted but allowed to continue after security clearance, as the track was not damaged.
Police officials said an explosive device plan­ted on the track was detonated when the Quetta-bound train was passing through the Spizend area.
“Six bogies of the Jaffar Express derailed after the blast and one of them over­t­urned,” a senior Pakistan Railways official told Dawn, adding that five pa­s­s­engers sustained injuries.
 
 

Security forces and pol­ice rushed to the site soon after the blast and shif­ted the injured to a nearby health facility.
The railway officials confirmed 270 passengers were on board at the time of the blast. They said the damaged part of the track would be repaired after security clearance on Wednesday, during which train service would remain suspended.

A letter from the Central Power Purchasing Agency to all banks and power sector entities invited their chief executive officers and heads to attend the event.
It said the event will be held at the PMO and PM Shehbaz Sharif will also virtually address the event as he is currently in New York for the UN General Assembly session.
Pakistan’s debt burden has become the defining constraint of its fiscal and economic future. According to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan, the total government debt (excluding the International Monetary Fund) increased from Rs69 trillion in June 2024 to Rs78tr by June 2025.
The public debt (including the IMF debt) increased to Rs80.5tr from Rs71.2tr in June 2024. Both the numbers understate the full level of the government’s indebtedness.
 
 

Developments suggest that the government is negotiating with banks to borrow Rs1.2tr to settle the power sector’s circular debt.
It was planned to borrow Rs1.275tr from banks as the government is willing to settle a portion of the circular debt, which has surged to Rs2.3tr.
What is strange is that this loan will be repaid over six years through a Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) included in the electricity bills.
Initially, the banks were hesitant to meet the government’s request to lend money at a lower rate than the policy rate, but eventually, 18 commercial banks agreed to do so. The loan will be repaid over a six-year period.
“The government has been borrowing less than the maturity amount of treasury bills during FY25, which has substantially increased the outstanding amount. This new borrowing could address this accumulation,” said a banker.</p><small>2025-09-23 19:07</small></div><hr>
