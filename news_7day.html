<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/121033478880642.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972699/imran-claims-only-15pc-vision-left-in-right-eye-sc-forms-medical-team-to-examine-pti-founder' target='_blank'><strong>Imran claims only 15pc vision left in right eye; SC forms medical team to examine PTI founder</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the formation of a medical team to examine former premier Imran Khan’s eye, after a report submitted in court quoted the PTI founder as claiming that “only 15 per cent” vision was left in his right eye.
The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
The instructions came as a two-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the case regarding the PTI founder’s living conditions in Adiala jail.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
“The issue of Imran’s health is most important,” CJP Afridi observed, adding that “intervention was necessary”.
“We want to know the government’s stance on the matter of his (Imran’s) health,” the top judge said, at which Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan affirmed that it was the state’s responsibility to provide medical facilities.
“If the prisoner is not satisfied, then the state will take measures,” AGP Awan added.
CJP Afridi then noted that the issue of Imran’s “telephone calls with his children is also important”.

 

“We are trusting the government. The government is in a good mood today,” he remarked.
PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Tuesday, had submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living condition in the prison.
In his report, seen by Dawn, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6 x 6 vision in both eyes”. He then began experiencing persistent blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then-jail superintendent but “no action was taken by the jail authorities”.

 

The report read: “[Imran] stated that he subsequently suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye, following which an ophthalmologist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was called to examine him.
“According to [Imran], he was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused severe damage, and despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye.”
Adding to Imran’s claims, Safdar said he “personally observed that the petitioner appeared visibly perturbed and deeply distressed by the loss of vision and the absence of timely and specialised medical intervention”.
“Throughout the meeting, the petitioner’s eyes were watery, and he repeatedly used a tissue to wipe them, reflecting physical discomfort,” the lawyer recalled.
However, during the hearing, the SC dismissed the request to have the condition of Imran’s eye examined in the presence of his family members.
On the request to provide some books to the PTI founder, AGP Awan said it would be done after consultation with eye doctors.
Noting that the SC had received reports from Safdar and the Adiala jail superintendent, CJP Afridi said: “Most of the things in both reports are similar — the place is good, the facilities are fine.”
Noting that the issue of Imran’s meetings with his family members was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the top judge said it would be appropriate for the relevant forum to decide on that.
‘No access to personal physicians amid deteriorating eye condition’
The report detailed Safdar’s meeting with Imran, the cell conditions, the facilities and amenities provided to the ex-premier, his living compound’s description, as well as the lawyer’s process of reaching the jail.
Safdar further quoted Imran as claiming that “regular and periodic blood tests” were not conducted.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.

 

“[Imran] stated that for nearly three months, the only treatment administered consisted of eye drops, which resulted in no improvement and was followed by a major impairment of vision in his right eye,” Safdar said.
Imran also claimed that “despite being 73 years old and requiring dental consultation, no dentist had examined or treated him over the past two years, notwithstanding repeated requests”.
According to Safdar, Imran told him about “rapid and substantial loss of vision over the preceding three months while he was living and detained under the ‘care and custody’ of Abdul Ghafoor Anjum”, the jail superintendent.
“This concern of his was neither taken seriously nor addressed by the relevant jail authorities,” Safdar was told. Upon inquiry, the jail staff informed the lawyer that Anjum had been transferred on Jan 16, 2026, and replaced by Sajid Baig.
Safdar stated that upon inquiry, the jail superintendent informed him that Imran was currently under the care of Pims’ Dr Arif and that the on-duty jail doctor recorded the PTI founder’s vital signs three times daily.
A day ago, Safdar denied making any statement on Imran’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard, it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
On Tuesday, the day he met Imran, Safdar had reportedly told the media that the incarcerated PTI founder was fine and looking healthy.
The SC’s order allowing Safdar to meet Imran came after the bench rejected senior PTI leader Latif Khosa’s request for an immediate meeting, but issued notices to the parties.
Diagnosis and treatment
Meanwhile, a medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.
It noted that Dr Sikander had been directed by the prime minister’s office to communicate to the jail staff about Imran’s medical condition.
Imran “reported reduced vision in the right eye”, Dr Sikander said, without specifying when.

 

He added: “A qualified ophthalmologist from Pims, Islamabad, conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiyala Jail [sic], including slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure measurements, essential laboratory tests and OCT (optical coherence tomography) of the retina.
“Based on his assessment, a diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made and hospital-based follow-up treatment was recommended.”
Recalling Imran’s treatment on the night of January 24, the doctor said the ex-premier was “brought to Pims on the night of Saturday/Sunday for advised procedure”.
“At the hospital, the treatment plan i.e. need for administering anti-VGEF intravitreal injection was explained in full to the patient. Accordingly, an informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure,” Dr Sikander stated.
He reiterated that the procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocols and monitoring, adding that it was “completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes”.
In his report, Safdar said Dr Sikander’s note was provided to him by Imran’s family and it did not “contain full details of the episodes”.
“Nor does it identify the qualified ophthalmologist who conducted the tests and administered the treatment,” he highlighted.</p><small>2026-02-12 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12141023f9307e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972715/pakistans-second-earth-observation-satellite-launched-from-chinas-space-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s second earth observation satellite launched from China’s space centre</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has marked a major achievement in its national space programme with the successful launch of its second indigenous Earth Observation Satellite, EO-2, from China’s Yangjiang Seashore Launch Centre on Thursday.
Developed by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), the EO-2 satellite is designed to significantly enhance the country’s earth observation and high-resolution imaging capabilities.
The officials of Suparco said the satellite will provide critical data to support national development planning, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and urban expansion.
It will also strengthen governance, disaster management, climate analysis, and strategic decision-making by delivering accurate and timely satellite imagery.
With the addition of EO-2, Pakistan has expanded its satellite fleet, ensuring improved continuity, coverage, and precision of earth observation data, added the space agency.
Suparco officials termed the launch a milestone in Pakistan’s space journey, noting that the successful indigenous development of EO-2 reflects the country’s growing technical expertise and self-reliance in advanced satellite technology.
Earlier on February 7, Pakistan marked a major step forward in its Human Spaceflight Programme as two candidates were officially shortlisted by the Astronauts Centre of China (ACC), according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The development follows a cooperation agreement signed in February 2025 between Suparco and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
Under the agreement, two Pakistanis will undergo astronaut training in China, with one ultimately selected to travel to the Tiangong space station.
Last year, Pakistan launched its first indigenous Electro-Optical (EO-1) satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China.</p><small>2026-02-12 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11235047d788238.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972556/ex-army-chief-qamar-javed-bajwa-hospitalised-after-fall' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa hospitalised after fall</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former chief of army staff Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa has been admitted to a military hospital after sustaining injuries in a fall at his home.
Inter-Services Public Relations confirmed this on Thursday, a day after the incident was initially reported.
The military’s media affairs wings said in a statement that the former army chief was under treatment at the Combined Military Hospital after the fall.
An informed source, which also confirmed the reports of Bajwa’s fall, earlier told Dawn that he suffered injuries after slipping at his residence.
He was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit. While the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear, he was reported to be in stable condition.
‘100pc out of danger’
In a video message released on social media, the former army chief’s brother-in-law, Naeem Ghumman, said Bajwa was “barefoot when he slipped and suffered a head injury”.
He added that nothing “suspicious came up” following his medical examination, and all necessary tests were conducted.
Ghumman stated that the former army chief is “100 per cent out of danger”.
Bajwa, 65, served as the 10th chief of army staff from Nov 29, 2016, to Nov 29, 2022, with an extension in his tenure granted in 2019.
Since retiring in late 2022, Bajwa has largely stayed out of the public eye.</p><small>2026-02-12 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1212300016c11e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972708/what-facilities-does-pti-founder-imran-khan-have-access-to-in-prison' target='_blank'><strong>What facilities does PTI founder Imran Khan have access to in prison?</strong></a><br><p>Advocate Salman Safdar formally submitted to the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday a seven-page report regarding incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s living conditions at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, amid concern from his party over his treatment.
The PTI lawyer, who was appointed amicus curaie to visit Adiala jail, told the media after submitting the report that he met the PTI founder and visited his cell. At the time, he refused to divulge details of the report to the media.
A copy of the report, available with Dawn, detailed the conditions of Imran’s confinement, including the facilities provided during his incarceration.
Daily routine and diet
According to the report, Imran’s daily routine varies between summer and winter.
“He takes breakfast at around 9:45am, followed by recitation of the Holy Qur’an from approximately 11:30am for about an hour,” the report said, adding that breakfast consisted of coffee, porridge and a few dates.
“He then undertakes physical exercise using the limited equipment available to him, including an exercise bike, two nine-kilogramme weights, and a bar,” the report said.
“At around 1:15pm, after showering, he is permitted to access the strolling shed within the secured compound, where he may sit or walk.”
According to the report, the PTI leader takes lunch between 3:30pm and 4pm — according to a meal plan selected by himself and financed by his family — and at 5pm he is again allowed a brief walk. The lunch plan consists “two days of chicken, two days of meat, two days of lentils (daal), and/or two days of ‘chaat’/snacks”.
“From approximately 5:30pm until 10am the following morning, he remains confined to his cell,” it said.
It added that Imran did not take a full meal at dinner, instead consuming “fruit, milk and dates”. He further said that bottled Nestle drinking water was available to him.
Confinement cell, hygiene
According to the report, Imran’s designated cell contains a chair, table, bed, and a hanger.
The report stated that “lighting and ventilation are sufficient during both daytime and nighttime”. Imran also informed Safdar that no utensils, crockery or cutlery were kept inside the cell.
Regarding cleanliness, the report shared that a mushaqati (convicted labourer) had been deputed to assist with washing and cleaning, including changing the bedding and maintaining the cleanliness of the cell as well as the washroom.
“He (Imran) expressed no complaint in this regard and stated that he is satisfied with the cleanliness arrangements,” the report said, adding that toiletries were provided to him “whenever demanded”.
Safdar reported that upon inspection of the cell, the bedding provided consisted of “one single-bed mattress, four pillows, and two blankets”.
A toilet was observed within the cell, measuring approximately four and a half feet by four and a half feet and partitioned by a five-foot wall. Outside the toilet area, it added, a wash basin with access to “both hot and cold water” and a mirror were present.
“With regard to cleanliness, some room for improvement in sanitary conditions of the toilet was observed,” the report said.
It also added that the cell had two openings of roughly two by two feet on opposite ends of the ceiling to allow for cross-ventilation. However, it called attention to the lack of an exhaust system installed in the cell despite the presence of the toilet.
The report further noted a carpet mat on the floor of the cell and several belongings of the ex-premier, including a prayer mat and counter (tasbeeh), personal care items such as a shaving kit and mouthwash, and “approximately 100 books”.
Safety and amenities
The report stated that Imran was given a “small-sized heater/blower” in his living cell during the winter months and that hot water was available at all times.
However, he said that during the summer months, his living conditions were “particularly difficult due to extreme heat and humidity” as well as insects and mosquitoes.
Despite an installed room cooler and mosquito repellent, the measures “do not sufficiently mitigate the prevailing conditions”, the report said. This, according to the ex-premier, affected his quality of rest during the summer period.
Notably, Imran also reported that there was no refrigerator provided in the confinement cell, and the cool box provided to him was “not always effective” during extreme weather. Imran expressed discontent in this regard and said that he had experienced food poisoning two to three times during the summer months.
Regarding his safety and security, however, Safdar reported “no concerns” from the incarcerated PTI leader, saying that there were approximately 10 surveillance cameras installed in the compound for monitoring purposes.
“He further stated that while one camera has coverage up to the shower area, there is no camera installed inside the room/cell itself,” the report said.
Overall, it said that the premier expressed no concern over his safety.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12122726b613d31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972709/canadian-police-identify-18-year-old-woman-as-suspect-in-mass-school-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Canadian police identify 18-year-old woman as suspect in mass school shooting</strong></a><br><p>The suspect in a deadly school shooting in western Canada was an 18-year-old woman with mental health issues who killed her mother and stepbrother before attacking her former school, police said on Wednesday, but investigators did not offer a motive for one of the worst mass slaughters in Canadian history.
The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia.
Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten.
On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago.



“Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said.
Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure.
“We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters.
Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days.
Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning.
“It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said.
McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home.
She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun.
Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital.
Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound.
“We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted.
Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths.
Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history
Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday.
In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote.
He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims.
“Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community.
“Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.”
McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision.
Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence.
Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests.
The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history.
In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station.
In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide.
“There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator.
“It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1210463784084a7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972701/in-pictures-millions-vote-in-bangladeshs-landmark-elections' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Millions vote in Bangladesh’s landmark elections</strong></a><br><p>Bangladeshis head to the polls on Thursday, with nearly 128 million people eligible to vote, in a key test of the country’s return to democracy after a popular uprising toppled long-time leader Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.
A recent opinion poll by the Dhaka-based Communication Research Foundation and Bangladesh Elections and Public Opinion Studies found corruption to be voters’ top concern.
Bangladesh has long ranked among the world’s worst performers in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.
Both the frontrunning Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its main rival Jamaat-i-Islami, have made tackling graft central to their campaigns, with Jamaat’s anti-corruption image helping fuel its resurgence.

The latest aid consignment was dispatched by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), with the support of Al-Khidmat Foundation.
This is the second aid consignment sent by Islamabad within the last week. Earlier, on Monday, the 28th consignment was dispatched.
Pakistan had sent the first aid consignment, including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023, days after the Israeli bombardment began.







The relief goods were dispatched through a chartered flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s Al-Arish airport for onward delivery to Gaza.
Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents.
Tel Aviv’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1211025831424ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election' target='_blank'><strong>Why is Bangladesh holding a national referendum alongside its general election?</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh will hold a national referendum on Thursday together with its first parliamentary election since violent protests ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.
The referendum will give people a chance to vote on reforms to state institutions. Here is a look at why the referendum is being held, and what it entails.
Why is a referendum needed?
The referendum focuses on implementing the ‘July Charter’ drafted after the 2024 uprising to establish good governance, democracy, and social justice through institutional reforms, and to prevent “recurrence of authoritarian and fascist rule”.
The interim government that took power after Hasina’s ouster approved the charter’s implementation order in November, saying public approval was necessary for key changes.

What are people voting on?
Voters will decide on four major reforms, including the creation of new constitutional bodies and the introduction of a bicameral parliament, whose upper house majority approval shall be needed for constitutional amendments.
Other questions cover the implementation of 30 charter reforms — including term limits for prime ministers and enhanced presidential powers, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments.
How is the referendum being held?
Each person will cast their vote by secret ballot.
If a majority votes in favour, a Constitutional Reform Council will be formed to complete the reforms within 180 working days from its first session.

Has Bangladesh held a referendum before?
Bangladesh held three referendums before the Hasina government abolished the provision in 2011. A High Court reinstated it in 2024 after she was ousted.
While the 1977 and 1985 referendums asked people if they had confidence in the then-presidents and their policies, the third, in 1991, asked whether Bangladesh should return from a presidential system to parliamentary democracy.
People overwhelmingly voted “yes” in all three referendums.
What do critics say?
The referendum has been criticised for denying voters the chance to decide on reforms individually, instead clubbing together multiple proposals to force a single yes-or-no answer.
Critics say this confuses voters by presenting a complicated premise and limits their ability to properly understand and debate the reforms.
The interim government and political parties have also drawn criticism for framing a “yes” vote as essential, which critics say shrinks space for dissent by implying voting “no” means rejecting reform altogether.

Over the past several years, floods have become a recurring test of who in this country is protected and who is not. According to figures compiled by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the 2025 floods claimed at least 1,000 lives and affected nearly seven million people across the country.
Punjab was the hardest hit, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, where crops spread over hundreds of acres were lost, homes were washed away, and entire communities were displaced.

 

Every time floods come, they bring with them a host of questions, all linked to their disproportionate impact: why do they affect some more than others? Why do some families lose everything while others rebuild within months? Why do they hit the same cities, same villages and same houses over and over again?
Because beyond the visible damage that floods wreak is a deeper truth that researchers have been highlighting for years: floods do not create vulnerability; they expose it. It is called social vulnerability.
What research says
Social vulnerability is not just about income. It reflects where people live, how secure their livelihoods are, whether institutions work for them, and whether they are included in decision-making. Vulnerability grows when exposure, sensitivity, and lack of capacity combine. That is a hard reality faced by millions in Pakistan every year.
Research across the world, and increasingly in Pakistan, shows that disasters are shaped by social conditions that exist long before hazards strike. Essentially, poverty, unsafe housing, weak services, poor planning, and lack of political voices determine who suffers most.
This is most evident in studies on Pakistan’s flood-prone regions. They expose how households with low education, poor housing, limited land, and weak access to health and social services experience the greatest losses and the slowest recovery.
Over one-third of households in flood-prone zones fall into high social vulnerability categories, research from both rural and urban areas shows. This means that even moderate floods can trigger long-term hardship. Informal settlements, which are often absent from official plans, mainly face the worst flooding and the least protection, despite housing essential urban labour.
These findings are not academic abstractions; they describe everyday realities.
When vulnerability turns into catastrophe
For Pakistan, the 2022 floods were a turning point. They affected over 30 million people, with economic losses exceeding $30 billion. Once again, the devastation followed familiar lines.
In Sindh, districts with poor housing, limited health services, and weak political representation remained under water for months — a reality that the coastal province, situated at the southern end, has lived with for years.
Studies later showed that women, small farmers, tenant cultivators, and landless households faced deeper and longer-lasting impacts, including debt, distress migration, and food insecurity. The floods did not just destroy homes; they reduced people’s ability to cope with future shocks.

 

When the floods returned in 2025, many families were only just beginning to recover from the previous disaster. In Punjab, prolonged river flooding, breaches, and overwhelmed drainage systems hit small farmers and daily-wage workers hardest. Many had already sold assets after previous floods. This time, there was nothing left to fall back on.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, flash floods and landslides struck mountainous districts where weak infrastructure and limited institutional reach turned rainfall into tragedy. In Gilgit-Baltistan, glacial melt and sudden floods damaged roads and homes, isolating valleys and exposing the growing vulnerability of mountain communities to climate extremes.
The lesson was clear: when vulnerability is ignored, and recovery is incomplete, disasters return — even if rainfall doesn’t.
The problem and the lesson
Vulnerability — the word holds more value than it is given. And Pakistan should definitely start taking stock of it because what the country lacks is not disaster authorities or policies, but a vulnerability-centred approach.
Disaster planning still prioritises physical infrastructure. Research shows that while embankments and roads matter, they cannot protect people who remain poor, excluded, and unsupported. Data gaps, weak coordination between institutions, limited local government capacity, and minimal community participation continue to undermine resilience efforts.
As a result, disasters are treated as temporary emergencies instead of symptoms of deeper governance failure.

 

Decades of vulnerability research point to one conclusion: resilience begins with governance. Reducing vulnerability requires institutions that are accountable, coordinated, and focused on people. Local governments must be empowered, land-use planning enforced fairly, social protection strengthened, and communities, especially women and the poor, should be involved in early warning, evacuation, and recovery.
Most importantly, vulnerability must be treated as a development issue, not just a disaster concern. When inequality is reduced and institutions work, disasters lose much of their power to destroy lives.
The floods of 2022 and 2025 were not just nature’s wrath. They were mirrors, reflecting how society is organised — who is protected and who is left exposed.
If Pakistan continues to rebuild infrastructure without rebuilding institutions, floods will keep returning to the same doorsteps. But if the country listens to what research has long shown and puts vulnerability reduction at the heart of governance, disasters can become survivable, recovery faster, and resilience real.
The rain will come again. The question is whether it will still find the same people waiting.

Spot gold edged 0.3 per cent lower to $5,063.11 per ounce by 04:53 GMT. It closed Wednesday with a more than 1pc gain.
US gold futures for April delivery lost 0.3pc to $5,083.90 per ounce.
“The stronger jobs report leading to a slight pare back in Fed rate-cut expectations may have played a role in gold’s lacklustre move,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at OCBC.
The US dollar index rose following the surprisingly strong employment report that suggested underlying US economic health.
A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced metals more expensive for other currency holders.
“Sensitivity to the dollar, yield repricing, and uncertainty around Fed policy should continue to pose two-way risks for gold in the interim,” Wong said.
US job growth unexpectedly accelerated in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3pc, though the largest increase in payrolls in 13 months likely exaggerates the labour market’s health, as revisions showed the economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025 instead of the previously estimated 584,000.
The US budget deficit will grow slightly in fiscal 2026 to $1.853 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office forecast on Wednesday, showing that on balance, President Donald Trump’s economic policies are worsening the country’s fiscal picture amid low economic growth.

Visuals released earlier on Wednesday after the Netanyahu-Rubio meeting showed them holding a document with Netanyahu’s signature on Israel joining the board.
Netanyahu said on X that he “signed Israel’s accession as a member of the ‘Board of Peace’”. He later discussed Iran with Trump.







A UN Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorised the board and countries working with it to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Hamas signed off.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board, with him as chair, would be expanded to tackle global conflicts.
The board will hold its first meeting on February 19 in Washington to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction.
Many rights experts say that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory’s affairs resembled a colonial structure. Israel’s presence on the board is expected to bring further criticism as the board does not include a Palestinian.
Countries have reacted cautiously to Trump’s invitation to join the board launched in late January. Many experts are concerned that the board could undermine the United Nations.
While some of Washington’s Middle Eastern allies have joined, many of its traditional Western allies have stayed away.
The ceasefire in Gaza has been repeatedly violated, with at least 580 Palestinians killed since it began in October, according to Palestinian and Israeli tallies, respectively.
The next phase of Trump’s Gaza plan calls for resolving complex issues like Hamas’s disarmament, which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
Israel’s invasion of Gaza has killed over 72,000, according to Gaza’s health ministry, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population.

Analysts say a decisive result is crucial for steady governance in the nation of 175 million, as the deadly anti-Hasina protests triggered months of unrest and disrupted key industries, including the garments sector, the worlds second-largest exporter.
It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.

The contest pits two coalitions led by former allies, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with opinion polls giving an edge to the BNP.
In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.
“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”
Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi deteriorate.
Unlike previous elections marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, more than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.

Voting in one constituency has been postponed due to the death of a candidate. At least 50 parties are contesting in total, a national record.
“This election is not just another routine vote, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of an interim government installed after Hasinas ouster, said this week.
The public awakening we witnessed against long-standing anger, inequality, deprivation and injustice finds its constitutional expression in this election.
In parallel, there will be a referendum on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and imposing a two-term limit on the prime minister.
Despite the crowded field and expectations of a close race, the campaign period remained largely peaceful, barring a few incidents.

The crucial test for Bangladesh now will be to ensure the election is conducted fairly and impartially, and for all parties to then accept the result, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant with the International Crisis Group.
If that happens, it will be the strongest evidence yet that Bangladesh has indeed embarked on a period of democratic renewal.
On election day, more than 100,000 soldiers from the army, navy and air force will assist nearly 200,000 police in maintaining law and order.
Early start, late finish
Polling opened at 7:30am (0230 GMT) and closes at 4:30pm. Counting will begin soon after, with early trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, Election Commission officials said.
Nearly 128 million people are registered to vote, 49% of them women. But only 83 female candidates are contesting.

Corruption and inflation are the biggest issues among voters, a recent survey found.
The two prime ministerial candidates are the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman. They are not related.
Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.
Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.
But some are determined to cast their ballots.
“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”
President Zardari hopes for peaceful process
President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.
“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.
He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.

Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation.
“Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources, combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee.
Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.”
He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.”
During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics.
Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States.
Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups.
When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere.
The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect.
The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests.
He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific.
Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence.
At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said.
Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people.
She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute.
Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable.
Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces.
“We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.</p><small>2026-02-12 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698d02d2a093b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972573/semblance-of-calm-touches-down-at-karachi-airport-after-bizarre-meltdown' target='_blank'><strong>Semblance of calm touches down at Karachi airport after bizarre ‘meltdown’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Had there not been all those videos on social media of international passengers at the Jinnah International Airport complaining about complete mismanagement and utter chaos in the departure area, one would not have believed the calm and orderly scene that lay before one at international departures there on Wednesday.  
It was only days ago that the airport was said to have turned into “a place of embarrassment for international travellers and daily humiliation for Pakistani citizens thanks to basic operational incompetence” where one officer was expected to manage three parallel lines at immigration.  
The passengers were constantly pointing out the problems to the airport staff, but there neither seemed to be the willingness nor the capacity to fix things.  
The bags which had already been passed through a scanner once were being scanned again before being sent to baggage, which was a complete waste of time and effort.  

PAA spokesperson admits immigration process remains ‘most frequently raised concern among passengers’

But was that an alternate universe where passengers also claimed that airport staff had demanded money from them in exchange for use of luggage carts? And what of those unending queues facing closed doors outside at international departures? Well, they aren’t there anymore.  
Seeing three travellers squatting near a pillar on Wednesday, one asked them if they had been waiting there for long. “Yes, we reached here about half an hour ago,” replied one of them as he eyed the electronic board to see if check-in for their flight had been announced. Another passenger en route to Jeddah said that he arrived four hours before his flight “because I always do that”.  
There was also no apparent shortage of luggage carts or trolleys at the passenger drop-off area, contrary to what had been reported earlier. Airport staff were seen bringing more freed up trolleys from the departure lounge which they had neatly lined up.  
A group wearing identical brown cross body bags gathered to say goodbye to family members who had come to see them off. All looked relaxed and happy as they loaded their bags on the trolleys, posed for pictures and enjoyed the sweetmeats being distributed among them by a family member.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said while occasional peak-hour pressures can occur in a high-volume gateway like Jinnah International, “the immigration process managed by the FIA remains the most frequently raised concern among passengers. Reports of any difficulties with trolley availability, on the other hand, have been very limited and appear to reflect an isolated occurrence rather than a recurring issue.

He was chairing a meeting at the Central Police Office to review the implementation of reform measures in the Punjab Police under the ‘Fast, Fearless, Transparent Justice’ initiative.
He said that panic buttons were being installed outside police stations so that citizens could immediately lodge complaints in case of any misconduct or lack of hearing.
He directed that at all police stations, offices, checkpoints, and Khidmat Marakaz, citizens should be addressed respectfully as “sir or madam” and “sahib or sahiba”. He said that counseling and training of officers and personnel would be arranged to improve the overall perception of Punjab Police’s conduct.

IGP also speaks to citizens through 1787 Complaint Centre

It was made clear that officials involved in corruption, abuse of authority, and misconduct would face immediate and strict accountability.
The IGP directed that CCTV cameras installed in all police stations be kept fully operational and backup systems be ensured.
A modern control and monitoring room was being activated at the Central Police Office for effective monitoring of police stations, while through the Safe Cities mechanism, direct monitoring of police stations, SHOs, moharrirs, and investigation rooms would be carried out.
He emphasised on making core policing, supervision, and the command system more effective for crime control and said that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was herself overseeing all police reform measures.
The meeting also issued instructions to strictly enforce traffic laws and to continue the crackdown against violations.
He said that the investigation process and the activities of citizens visiting police stations would be fully recorded and that key performance indicators (KPIs) scorecards would be implemented in practical terms. He said that he was himself calling applicant citizens from the Central Police Office to obtain feedback.
He directed RPOs and DPOs to initiate direct contacts and meetings for redressal of citizens’ grievances, while in cases of abuse, harassment, and violence, investigations involving affected women and children should be conducted within the bounds of complete civility and respect. Instructions were also given to resolve cases of women and children on a priority basis with the help of data from Virtual Women Police Stations and the Center for Child Safety.
Meanwhile, the IGP initiated direct contact with citizens through the 1787 Complaint Center and spoke with several citizens via phone calls. He obtained information about the duration of redressal of received applications and complaints, police response, and overall conduct.
Citizens also shared their feedback regarding the actions taken and responses by the police.
Mr Kareem directed RPOs, DPOs, and other supervisory officers to take immediate action on citizens’ applications and provide relief without delay.
He further directed that all complaints received via phone calls, SMS, email, and other channels be resolved immediately in accordance with the prescribed timelines and SOPs.
He urged citizens to register complaints on 1787 in case of any irregularity or misconduct by the police force.
The IGP received a detailed briefing on the 1787 dashboard and complaints from across the regions.
During the briefing, Punjab Additional IG Imran Arshad, Additional IG (Internal Accountability) Imran Mehmood, Additional IG (Logistics) Fawad-ud-Din Qureshi, AIG Inspection, AIG Operations, and other officers were also present.

LAHORE: A report by the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Deve­lopment and Transparency (Pildat) has highlighted structural barriers limiting women’s leadership roles despite constitutional guarantees, saying women are denied power despite ample representation.
Highlighting this disparity on the eve of National Women’s Day (Feb 12), the report titled ‘Women in Public Service in Pakistan: Barriers and Recommen­da­tions’ examined the structural and institutional barriers limiting women’s leadership despite constitutional guarantees and affirmative measures.
Supported by Interloop Limited, the report was presented at a dialogue in Lahore attended by women leaders from politics, the civil service, law, media, and civil society, along with Pildat President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob and Provincial Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment Nabila Hakim Ali Khan.

 

Participants emphasised that informal power structures, weak accountability, and inconsistent enforcement of laws continue to restrict women’s influence.
The report said women hold 22 per cent of seats in the National Assembly, yet only one is a federal minister in the 31-strong cabinet. Similarly, barely 10 per cent of standing committees are chaired by women lawmakers.
The findings showed that women comprised just 5.1pc of the federal civil service (mostly below BS-17), 3.2pc of the police service, and 18pc of judges overall — yet only 5.5pc serve in superior courts. While 85pc of respondents noted improved representation over the past decade, only 35pc felt women’s voices were adequately reflected in decision-making, and just 19pc believed women wielded genuine authority.
Nearly four in five respondents reported experiencing or witnessing barriers, including socio-cultural norms, work-life balance pressures, exclusionary networks, unsafe workplaces, and weak enforcement of equality and anti-harassment laws.

DEMOCRATIC Congressman Ro Khanna revealed six previously redacted names from the Justice Department’s investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, triggering international fallout from London to New Delhi, CBS News reported.
During his speech on the House floor on Tuesday, Khanna revealed the names of billionaires including Leslie Wexner, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Secret parent company, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the Dubai-based chief executive of the global logistics giant DP World.
The list also included Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov and Nicola Caputo.
Khanna and Republican congressman Thomas Massie had viewed the unredacted documents at the Justice Department on Monday.
While the newly disclosed records do not appear to allege specific criminal wrongdoing against the individuals named, Khanna criticised the department for withholding names “for no apparent reason”.
“And if we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3 million files,” he said.
The DoJ’s spokesperson defended the redaction process asserting that errors were inevitable within millions of pages and some redactions might have been accidental.
The scrutiny of the department’s handling of the files culminated on Wednesday during a heated House Judiciary Committee hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Congressional Democrats accused Bondi of conducting a “cover-up” regarding the Epstein records, Reuters reported.
Rep Jamie Raskin, the ranking member, criticised the pace of the release and argued the redactions violated the Epstein Files Trans­pa­rency Act, which mandates the disclosure of associates who are not victims.
Raskin further accused the dep­artment under Bondi of becoming President Donald Trump’s “instrument of revenge” by pursuing political opponents, AFP reported.
Separately, Raskin told Axios on Tuesday that searching the unredacted database for Trump’s name produced “more than a million results”.
Raskin clarified that he searched for the terms “Trump,” “Donald” or “Don” and could not verify that every result referred to the president. However, Raskin said he found a 2009 email exchange regarding Epstein that seemingly contradicts Trump’s claim that he removed Epstein from Mar-a-Lago.
International fallout
The release of the names has already triggered international business consequences. Reuters reported that the United Kingdom’s development finance agency and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, have suspended new investments with DP World. Files review showed CEO bin Sulayem corresponded with Epstein regarding business, sex and plans to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island.
British International Investment told Reuters it was “shocked by the allegations” and would pause investments until DP World took action.
Meanwhile, India’s oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, admitted to parliament that he met Epstein “three or maximum four times” while working at the International Peace Institute in New York, Reuters reported.
Answering questions from opposition leader Rahul Gandhi regarding emails found in the files, Puri denied any involvement in wrongdoing. He stated his interactions with Epstein were focused on connecting with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoff­man to discuss business potential in India.

GENEVA: The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that Israel’s plans to tighten control over the occupied West Bank pave the way for further settlement expansion and represent a step toward consolidating “illegal annexation”.
Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved measures allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and extending greater Israeli control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power.
The plan further grants Israel the authority to administer certain religious sites located in areas under Palestinian Authority control. The plans, which have sparked international outrage, modify the administration established under the Oslo Accords in the 1990s.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the decisions by Israel’s security cabinet were the latest in a string of measures to annex Palestinian lands.
“This is yet another step by the Israeli authorities towards rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible, in violation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” Turk said in a statement.
“If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements.”
Turk noted that these measures would further deprive Palestinians of natural resources and restrict their human rights. He stated the moves will “further cement Israel’s control and integration of the occupied West Bank into Israel, consolidating unlawful annexation”.

 

The UN official warned that these policies are part of a wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers and security forces, alongside a pattern of evictions, home demolitions, and land grabs.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said. “These decisions must be overturned.”
Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for a “firm response” from the United States and the international community. Speaking during a visit to Oslo on Wednesday, Abbas said he discussed the issue with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
“These serious violations require a firm response from the US administration and the international community because they hinder President Donald Trump’s efforts and constitute a violation of international law,” Abbas said.
Abbas also cited issues including Israeli settler violence and Israel’s freezing of funds intended for the Palestinian people.
Germany joined the chorus of criticism on Wednesday, with the foreign ministry calling the move “a further step towards de facto annexation.”
“Israel remains an occupying power in the West Bank, and as an occupying power it is a violation of international law to build settlements, including transferring certain administrative functions to civilian Israeli authorities,” a German foreign ministry spokesman said in Berlin.

Advocate Safdar, who was appointed amicus curaie to visit Adiala jail, told the media after submitting his report that he met the PTI founder and also visited his cell.
However, he refrained from divulging what he came across during his meeting or recommended in his report, saying his first responsibility was to submit his report to the SC.
On Thursday, a two-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, will resume the hearing of the case regarding living conditions of the ex-premier in Adiala jail.
Mr Safdar explained that PTI founder’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja “understood his compulsion that he could not talk to them about his report”, which was assigned to him by the court.
He made it clear that he did not inform any of them about the health or living condition of Mr Khan.
Advocate Safdar also denied making any statement on Mr Khan’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
Before the appointment of Advocate Safdar as ‘friend of the court’ on Tuesday, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan had informed the Supreme Court that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of Aug 24, 2023”.
The SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Mr Khan’s living conditions in jail, he said, adding that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order. “We had submitted a written report to the chamber on Aug 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report was also submitted.
Subsequently, the court appointed Advocate Safdar as amicus with direction to visit the Adiala jail and meet Imran Khan. In the court order, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the ex-premier was imprisoned in Attock jail in 2023. Hence, the court considered it appropriate that a report regarding the present living conditions of the petitioner in jail be submitted.

ISLAMABAD: The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Wednesday deferred the consideration for the elevation of two additional judges to the Balochistan High Court from the provincial district judiciary.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the consideration was postponed in view of a constitutional question concerning the nomination of the representative of the Balochistan Bar Council. The members of the commission stressed the need for comprehensive consideration of the issue before proceeding further.
Names of six serving district and sessions judges (DSJ) were under consideration of the JCP for their appointment to the BHC. They were: Jan Muhammad Gohar, Pazir Ahmed Baloch, Allah Dad Roshan, Abdul Qayyum Lehri, Inayatullah Khan and Rehmat Ullah.
On Tuesday, the JCP was requested on behalf of vice chairman of Balochistan Bar Council, Jadain Dashti, to postpone its meeting until the finalisation and notification of clear rules and procedures governing the removal or replacement of those members of the commission who have lost confidence of their respective nominating authorities.
The two-page letter said that lawyers of Balochistan were deeply aggrieved and have lost confidence in the member representing Balochistan owing to serious allegations and concerns regarding his conduct and integrity.
The prevailing situation has created dissatisfaction within the legal fraternity of the province and has undermined the confidence reposed by the nominating authority, the letter said, adding that in the absence of finalised rules addressing such circumstances, the continuation of meetings of JCP may give rise to ambiguity and institutional complications.
The letter further said the matter directly concerns the authority, confidence, and representation of the nominating authorities, including provincial bar councils and, therefore, requires clarity and resolution before any substantive proceedings are undertaken.
In these circumstances, it is earnestly requested that the scheduled meeting be deferred until the relevant rules are duly finalised and notified, so that the proceedings of the commission may be conducted within a clear, transparent, and undisputed legal framework, the letter stated.
Meanwhile, the CJP also presided over the commission’s meeting to discuss the proposed framework for framing rules governing interviews of candidates at the time of their appointment as judges. After preliminary discussion, the commission resolved to defer the agenda to enable members to undertake further in-depth deliberations on the proposed regulatory contours.
SJC meeting
Separately, CJP Yahya Afridi also presided over a meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and examined 59 complaints filed under Article 209 of the Constitution.
Among them were references related to IHC Justices Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, sources said. The complaint against Justice Khan was filed over his announcement of a judgement after reserving it for nearly three years.
Sources also said that a reference against former IHC judge Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri has been placed on the record as infructuous, as he had already been removed from office.
Insiders said that IHC CJ Sarfraz Dogar had recused himself when cases involving judges from his court were taken up. He was replaced by Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S M Atiq Shah for the relevant proceedings.
Sources also revealed that the SJC reviewed and filed to record references against the chief election commissioner, and other members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
According to an official statement, of the 59 complaints, 50 were ordered to be disposed of, six were deferred, and three were directed to be processed further in accordance with the law. The council also unanimously decided to defer the finalisation of draft rules on the code of conduct until its next meeting.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stepped in on Wednesday to seek a review of Nepra’s revised rules for rooftop solar users, while the power regulator simultaneously rubber-stamped a government plan to impose hefty fixed charges on residential consumers.
The premier also directed the Power Division to file a review petition against the regulator’s move regarding new solar regulations.
On Monday, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) revised the terms for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — on the pretext of rising solar penetration and the need to protect an expensive and inefficient state-run power network. The notification effectively ended the net-metering regime and shifted prosumers to net billing.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier had taken “immediate notice” of the matter, following criticism in the Senate from lawmakers across party lines, including ruling ally PPP and opposition PTI.







The PMO quoted the prime minister as directing the Power Division to file a review petition before Nepra “to ensure every possible safeguard of the existing consumer contracts”.
He was of the view that the “burden of 466,000 users benefitting from solar should not be put on 37.6 million domestic consumers” receiving electricity directly from the national grid. “Power Division should chalk out a comprehensive strategy in this regard,” he said.
The directives were issued during a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on the new Nepra regulations. The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Cheema, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and the prime minister’s adviser Muhammad Ali.
Speaking in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr Leghari defended Nepra’s move, saying it was aimed at easing the burden on consumers. “Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he would not step back. “This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained.
Stakeholders and policy experts have warned that the proposed Prosumer Regulations 2025 could undermine a decade of citizen-led expansion in clean energy.
Under the new regulations, registered prosumers will be immediately shifted to net billing in place of net metering, and their exported units will be credited for one month instead of the current three months. Other terms will remain unchanged until their seven-year contracts expire.
Under net billing, electricity generated by a prosumer is purchased by the relevant distribution company (Disco), and the consumer is billed for electricity imported from the grid at about Rs37-55 per unit (depending on the slab) after receiving credit for exports at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
The new rules bar prosumers from installing solar power systems for net metering beyond their originally sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Nepra approves fixed charges
Meanwhile, Nepra on Wednesday approved a government decision to impose about Rs132bn in fixed charges on more than 28.5m residential electricity consumers, at rates ranging from Rs200 to Rs675 per kilowatt per month of sanctioned load.
The regulator’s fast-tracked approval of the federal government’s Feb 4 decision will come into retrospective effect from February, increasing the effective unit price by up to 75pc for the lowest strata with a declining scale for higher consumption groups. The Rs132bn fixed charges do not include about Rs24bn general sales tax and other taxes, surcharges and duties.
This will adequately address cross-subsidy on industrial consumers, reducing their average tariff by Rs4.04 per unit as announced by the prime minister to make export products competitive in the global market. For the first time, the burden of cross-subsidy on the industrial sector has come to zero.
Given “the fact that the revised tariff proposed by the federal government is within the determined consolidated revenue requirement of all the XWDISCOs (ex-Wapda distribution companies) and already budgeted tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249bn for the calendar year 2026, the authority has no objection in approving the motion”, Nepra wrote in its decision to the government for formal publication in the Gazette of Pakistan.
The revised schedule of tariff shows that new fixed charges have been imposed on monthly consumption of up to 300 units, raised for the 400-600 unit slabs and slightly scaled down for higher users to discourage defection from the grid.
As a result, the average power tariff (including energy and capacity components) for both protected and non-protected consumers in the first 100-unit slab has risen by 76pc, or Rs8 per unit, and 73.5pc, or Rs16.5 per unit, respectively, following the imposition of fixed char­ges at Rs200 and Rs275 per kilowatt of sanctioned load.
More than 22m consumers fall into these two categories. “This is the highest-ever price hike for this consumer category since the creation of separate distribution, generation and transmission companies in the early 1990s,” a senior official told Dawn.
For protected consumers using 101-200 units, the average cost has increased by Rs4 per unit, or 31pc, due to a Rs300-per-kW fixed monthly charge, while the non-protected category in the same slab has seen a rise of Rs6 per unit, or 21pc.
Consumers in the 200-300 unit slab will face a Rs350-per-kW fixed charge per month, lifting their average price by 12.7pc, or Rs4.20 per unit. About 5.6 million consumers fall into this group.
The fixed rate for the 301-400 unit category has been doubled to Rs400 per kW from Rs200, raising average unit rates by 6.5pc, or Rs2.5 per unit, despite a slight downward adjustment in base tariffs. More than two million consumers are in this bracket.
Higher-consumption households will also face increases. The fixed rate for the 401-500 unit slab has been raised to Rs500 per kW from Rs400, and to Rs675 per kW for the 501-600 slab, resulting in a 5.8pc, or Rs2.30-per-unit, rise in average tariffs, even after a Rs1.25-per-unit cut in base rates.
For consumers using 601-700 units a month, the fixed charge has been reduced to Rs675 per kW from Rs800, while those exceeding 700 units will also pay Rs675 per kW instead of Rs1,000. Nevertheless, both groups will still see average-rate increases of Rs2 and Rs1.80 per unit, or about 5pc and 4pc, respectively.
Only time-of-use consumers with sanctioned loads above 5kW will benefit from an average reduction of about 7pc, or Rs3.30 per unit, after the abolition of their Rs1,000-per-kW fixed charge in view of peak rates of Rs47 per unit, excluding taxes and duties. Even they, however, will face a 6pc, or Rs2.5-per-unit, rise during off-peak hours.
An official said the Power Division had estimated that the fixed charges would generate an additional Rs132bn for distribution companies, although another calculation suggested the inflow could exceed Rs250bn because most residential subsidies had been eliminated.

The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation.
To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC).
A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes.
Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog.

LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds

Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn.
According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn.
The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn.
The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years.
The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives.
The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”.
Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records.
Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction.
A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025.
Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority.
The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million.
The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

Up until now, the minimum legal age for marriage in Punjab was 18 years for men and 16 years for women under the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.
This has changed with the promulgation of the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance 2026, under which offenders could face up to seven years in prison and fines of up to Rs1 million.
The law comes into effect immediately across the province and was promulgated under Article 128(1) of the Constitution as the Punjab Assembly is not in session.
Under the new legal framework, nikah khawans (marriage registrars) have been barred from registering child marriages and could face imprisonment of up to one year and fine of Rs100,000 in case of violations.
Similarly, adults contracting marriage with a child will face rigorous imprisonment of up to three years but not less than two years, as well as a fine of up to Rs500,000.
The ordinance also criminalises cohabitation resulting from a child marriage as “child abuse”, carrying penalties of five to seven years’ imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs1 million.
It also introduces strict punishments for child trafficking linked to marriage and holds guardians accountable for promoting or failing to prevent underage marriages.
It further stated that if a guardian or any other person in any capacity, lawful or unlawful, committed any act to promote child marriage, child abuse or permitted child marriage to be solemnised, or intentionally or negligently failed to prevent it from being solemnised, they will be punished with rigorous imprisonment between two to three years and will also be liable to a fine of up to Rs500,000.
All offences under the ordinance have been declared cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable, and will be tried exclusively by Courts of Session, with cases to be concluded within 90 days.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the ordinance is aimed at modernising child protection laws in Punjab, removing gender discrimination in minimum marriage age, and strengthening legal safeguards against exploitation and abuse.</p><small>2026-02-11 19:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6985fdf900ead.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971442/gardening-bright-lights-for-the-garden' target='_blank'><strong>GARDENING: BRIGHT LIGHTS FOR THE GARDEN</strong></a><br><p>

Red and yellow varieties of Swiss chard planted eight to 10 inches apart

 
Often referred to as ghaas phoos [grass and straw] in jest, leafy green vegetables are known as a healthy eating option, particularly for those facing weight issues or metabolic disorders such as hypertension and diabetes. 
Swiss chard, with its rich nutritious profile, is no exception. Its leaves are rich in vitamins A, C, E and K. Minerals such as magnesium, manganese, potassium, copper and iron contribute to its nutrient density. The consumption of Swiss chard provides considerable quantities of proteins, fibres and carbohydrates along with minimal calories, making it one of the best solutions to manage weight. 
Quercetin, an antioxidant present in Swiss chard, may have anti-cancer properties. The vegetable is also beneficial in diabetes management and keeps bones, heart and eyes in good shape. 
However, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions need to exercise caution while consuming it. Individuals on blood-thinning medications should consume Swiss chard judiciously due to its vitamin K content. The high oxalate content of Swiss chard can also cause kidney stones in prone individuals. Even with the widespread belief that boiling Swiss chard and removing the water reduces its oxalate content, prone individuals should still eat it in moderation and consult with their physician regularly. 

Swiss chard’s vibrant stems — in red, yellow and white — make it one of the most visually striking vegetables you can grow

Given these nutritional benefits, Swiss chard is worth growing at home. Here’s how to cultivate it successfully.
Swiss chard seeds, ranging from brown to dark brown, are available in “rainbow” mixes, containing red, yellow and white-stemmed varieties, often called Bright Lights. These colours refer to the stem and mid rib of the leaves. Some growers mix different-coloured varieties when planting.

In favourable conditions, the irregular, spinach-like seeds of Swiss chard are likely to sprout within one week to 10 days of sowing. Usually, one seed ball of Swiss chard has three to four seedlings growing out of it. With care, a seasoned gardener can separate the seedlings. An easier way, called thinning, is to remove relatively weaker seedlings and retain the strongest of the three to four seedlings. 
Initially, the seedling sprouts cotyledon leaves, which are distinct from Swiss chard leaves. The two cotyledon leaves are very thin, as shown in the photograph, without any mid ribs. They have a smooth texture and are oval-shaped. These leaves usually emerge at the beginning of the seed-sprouting phase, to provide the initial energy boost to the nascent seedling. 
At this stage, the seedling tray or the potting vessel should be exposed to three to five hours of early morning sunlight. The watering schedule should be adjusted to ensure that the sunlight-exposed soil surface remains moist, and not wet, throughout the day. 
The seedlings are extremely lanky at this stage and should be covered to protect them from birds. This can be done using a green net or installing mirrors to reflect sunlight.
The first true leaf of Swiss chard is likely to appear in about 10 days after planting. Once it has sprouted three to four leaves, the seedling should be transplanted at its permanent location. This may take anywhere between three weeks to one month. During this process, the sturdiness of the sapling’s stem also increases and the sapling reaches three to four inches in height. 



 
It is critical to transplant the sapling exactly at this stage as deviation — either too early or too late — can result in transplantation shock to the plant. Usually, the pot should be at least 11 to 13 inches in width and height. When planting in open ground, space saplings at least eight to 10 inches apart. 
One of the drawbacks of growing Swiss chard in pots is that the leaf is smaller than those from plants grown in the ground. Plant growth in pots is also slower.
