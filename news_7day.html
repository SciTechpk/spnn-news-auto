KARACHI: After sealing the entire motorcycle market on Akbar Road, authorities on Monday sealed the automobilespareparts market off M.A.Jinnah Road near Tibet Centre, as well as hundreds of shops in other parts of the metropolis.
The expansion of the drive against encroachments — from owners of roadside eateries to traders who contribute millions in taxes daily — raised many eyebrows.
Officials claimed that as many as 86 shops in the autospareparts market were sealed because vehicles parked in front of the shops for repairs encroached on the main road, causing traffic snarls.
A similar reason was given by the authorities for sealing as many as 115 shops in the Akbar Road motorcycle market, which remained shut on Monday, as well as dozens of other shops in the city’s business district.
Deputy Commissioner South Javed Nabi Khoso said that the shopkeepers at Tibet Centre had been given warning three times to remove encroachments in front of their shops.
He claimed that most mechanics and electricians who worked on the roadside in front of the sealed shops were hired by shop owners, seeking to grow their businesses. “Due to double parking of vehicles, the road had become too congested, affecting the flow of traffic,” he said.
Shopkeepers told to submit affidavit
A meeting held on Monday decided that any shopkeeper who does not submit an affidavit providing written assurance of compliance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) will not be allowed to open shops.
It was decided that shops which submitted undertakings to the DCs would be reopened in a phased manner and any establishment that violated the SOPs would have its premises sealed for three days.
The DC-South said that after the affidavit was submitted, any further breach of the SOPs would result in arrests and the registration of FIRs against the violators.
Officials said that the authorities had sealed as many as 196 eateries in different parts of the city during the past three days.
Karachi Commissioner SyedHassanNaqvi told Dawn that the city’s antiencroachment campaign would remain in force, and that no shop or eatery would be permitted to place articles or goods on walkways.
He said that the crackdown would continue to curb the growing trend of encroachments and obstructions on footpaths, roads and service lanes.
‘Action may harm economy’
However, traders dismissed the government action as unnecessary, warning that it would harm their businesses and the country’s economy.
Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, a former officebearer of the Motorcycle Dealers Association, said that showcasing automobiles and bikes in front of their outlets is a worldwide practice.
“Authorities should have marked a lane in front of the shops for displaying motorcycles,” he demanded.
“The whole exercise, under the guise of an antiencroachment drive, is simply aimed at raising rates,” alleged another bike dealer, without elaborating.

The meetings are crucial to the administration’s hopes of getting top US oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.
The three biggest US oil companies — Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron — have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s ouster, according to four oil industry executives familiar with the matter, contradicting Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, both before and since Maduro was seized.

 

“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources said on Monday.
The upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to boost crude oil production and exports from Venezuela, a former OPEC nation which sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be refined by specially designed US refineries.
Achieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.
It is unclear what executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.
The White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move into Venezuela.
“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.
Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump told NBC News the US may subsidise oil companies to enable them to rebuild Venezuela’s energy infrastructure.
Asked if the administration had briefed any oil companies ahead of the military operation, Trump said, “No. But weve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”
“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News.
“But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”
He told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies.
“I speak to everybody,” he said.
CBS News, citing an unnamed source, said executives from the three were expected to meet on Thursday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
One oil industry executive told Reuters the companies would be reluctant to talk about potential Venezuela operations in group settings with the White House, citing anti-trust concerns that limit collective discussions among competitors about investment plans, timing and production levels.
Big plans, big problems
US forces on Saturday conducted a lightning raid on Venezuela’s capital, arresting Maduro in the dead of night and sending him to the United States to face narcoterrorism charges.
Trump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars boosting Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to around a third of its peak over the past two decades due to underinvestment and sanctions.
But those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the countrys political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.
Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Exxon and ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalised by former President Hugo Chavez.
“I don’t think you’re going to see any company other than Chevron, who’s already there, you know, commit to developing this resource,” said one oil industry executive, who asked not to be named discussing the issue.
Conoco has been seeking billions of dollars in restitution for the takeover of three oil projects in Venezuela under Chavez. Exxon was involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country in 2007.
Chevron, which exports around 150,000 barrels per day of crude from Venezuela to the US Gulf Coast, meanwhile, has had to carefully maneuver with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country in recent years.
Investors were optimistic, betting Washington’s move against Venezuela’s leadership would allow US firms access to the oil reserves.
A US embargo on Venezuelan oil remained in full effect, Trump said.
The S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025, with heavyweights Exxon Mobil rising 2.2 per cent and Chevron jumping 5.1pc.</p><small>2026-01-06 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0608014981edf1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965403/despite-risks-most-muslim-states-still-back-gaza-force' target='_blank'><strong>Despite risks, most Muslim states still back Gaza force</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Despite deep reservations and fears of domestic backlash, most Muslim-majority countries associated with the Gaza peace process want the proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to succeed, arguing that only such a force can ensure the security and survival of Palestinians in the besieged enclave, diplomats involved in the discussions told Dawn.
“Israel has already killed [more than] 70,000 people in Gaza, and only an international force with a clear mandate can stop this genocide,” said a diplomat from a Muslim nation, directly associated with the process.
Another diplomat acknowledged that participation in the ISF would place contributing states in an extremely difficult position, but said the alternatives were even bleaker.
“We know we would be pushed into a very difficult situation if we joined the ISF,” he said. “But the alternative is even worse — uninterrupted bloodshed in Gaza, and that’s not acceptable to us.”

Diplomats say the choice is a difficult one; warn that Palestinian blood will continue to flow in the absence of proposed ISF

A third diplomat said governments were under no illusion about the political costs at home. “We realise it will not be a popular war. We will be criticised at home too, but we have to get involved,” he said.
The ISF is a central pillar of a US-backed plan for “Phase 2” in Gaza, aimed at stabilising the territory after a ceasefire, training a Palestinian police force, overseeing demilitarisation, and enabling limited reconstruction.
Several Muslim countries — including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Azerbaijan and Pakistan — are involved in discussions around the initiative, though most have stopped short of firm troop commitments.
Diplomats say broad conceptual support exists, but final decisions hinge on unresolved questions about the force’s mandate, authority, rules of engagement and command structure.
The ISF is expected to operate under UN Security Council Resolution 2803, which envisages enforcement of demilitarisation and provision of security, but details remain contested. Reports in the Western media have mentioned Indonesia and Azerbaijan as potential contributors, while Pakistan, Turkiye, Malaysia and Morocco have also shown interest.
Egypt and Qatar — both key mediators between Israel and Hamas — are engaged in talks on ISF’s command structure and have helped establish coordination mechanisms.

 

At the same time, resistance remains strong.
Israel has explicitly opposed the participation of Turkish troops, citing Ankara’s past political support for Hamas. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have reportedly declined to contribute forces, though both have attended planning conferences. Pakistan, for its part, has conveyed that disarming Hamas would not be its role.
Against this backdrop, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy shared with the media a series of assessments by its senior fellows, warning that without a credible ISF, Israel would insist on retaining broad freedom of military action in Gaza.
“If the ISF is not given a clear mandate and full enforcement powers, or if Hamas refuses to surrender its weapons, Israel will press for continued freedom of action against renewed rearmament efforts, a freeze on any planned Gaza reconstruction efforts beyond the yellow line, and freedom to remain in its current Gaza deployment zones until these issues are addressed,” said Neomi Neumann, an adjunct fellow at the institute.
Dennis Ross, a former special assistant to ex-president Obama, said demilitarisation would be the decisive test. “In the end, everything will likely hinge on implementing a credible approach to demilitarising Gaza — not only because Israel will demand it, but also because Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have made clear there will be no major Gulf investment in reconstruction so long as Hamas retains access to military weapons and infrastructure,” he said.
Mr Ross argued for a phased approach including the beginning of reconstruction in secured areas.
“Whatever the case, a comprehensive plan is needed that synchronises all of these moving parts,” he added.
Ms Neumann cautioned that many fundamentals were still unresolved.
“Still unknown, however, is which countries will agree to participate, under what conditions they will deploy, and at which specific locations,” she said, warning that the success of Phase 2 and the durability of any ceasefire would depend on “immediate security stabilisation, gradual disarmament, and the transfer of authority to a reformed PA — none of which are possible without a clear definition of the ISF’s mandate.”
Michael Jacobson, a senior fellow at the institute’s counterterrorism programme, said disagreements among US partners were also slowing progress.
“The United States, Jordan, and Egypt have each developed their own training plans, and Israel has yet to back any of them,” he said.
“To move forward, the Trump administration must get all of these governments on board with a consensus plan,” including clarity on command and control, formal authorities, and alignment between mission and capabilities.
Another unresolved issue is the future role of the Palestinian Authority.
Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the institute, said Washington faced a delicate balancing act. “Allowing for an immediate PA operational role would go against the US plan and signal that Washington’s demands for PA reform are not serious,” he said. “Yet completely excluding the PA would serve Hamas’s goals and may face opposition from Arab states.”
Mr al-Omari suggested a compromise under which the PA initially plays a limited, symbolic role, such as appointing a liaison to a governing body overseeing Gaza’s transition.
For now, diplomats say, Muslim states remain torn between political risk and moral urgency. Yet many privately argue that without an international force on the ground, Gaza faces the prospect of prolonged devastation — a burden they say they are increasingly unwilling to bear.

The images and information coming out about the failed attempt are enough to send shivers down the spine — 2,000kg of explosive material, packed into blue plastic drums and faux gas cylinders was found hidden under a pile of clothes on a ready-to-blow vehicle based improvised explosive device (VBIED).
The vehicle in question was a truck — known locally as a ‘Mazda’. Although VBIEDs are not often used by local terror outfits — given the logistical difficulty involved in preparing and transporting them — some of the deadliest attacks in the country’s history were perpetrated using them as a delivery mechanism.
The most obvious parallel can be drawn with the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, one of the deadliest attacks ever perpetrated in the capital.

Security analyst sees possibility of ‘operational synergy’ among groups such as the TTP, BLA and BLF as outfits shift focus back to civilian targets

I covered the aftermath of that bombing, which left a crater 34 feet deep and 59 feet wide at the main entrance to the hotel building.
At the time, I had interviewed a witness who told me that he was standing near the gate when a man started firing and at the same time a dumper appeared at the main gate. “I ran away from the scene to save my life but later heard an explosion.” The dumper caught fire and the security guards started extinguishing the fire. That was when the vehicle exploded.
The explosion had been heard clear across the city; there were casualties in Balochistan House — located across the road — and nearby PTV Headquarters as well.
Follow-up investigations revealed that around 1,000kg of explosive material had been used — a mix of ammonium powder, RDX and TNT, as well as mortar shells and artillery rounds.
Given the scale of that bombing, one can safely assume that if the attack on Karachi had occurred, the potential death and destruction it would have wreaked would have been off the charts.
The fact that the plot was foiled following a tip-off from intelligence agencies — a fact alluded to during the official CTD presser on Monday — is also a heartening development, indicating that security agencies are actively working to keep Karachi safe from terrorists.
In recent years, urban centres such as Karachi and Lahore had been largely spared any major attack on civilian targets, as was the norm in the late 2000s and early 2010s.
Over the past couple of years, terror outfits across the country had seemingly shifted their focus to security forces, targeting their positions rather than softer, civilian targets.
However, the discovery of the Karachi terror plot seems to indicate a return to form for these nefarious groups.
Talking to Dawn, security analyst Imtiaz Gul said that it was quite likely that militants would again start targeting civilians.
“If we believe the official version, that it was the BLA that planned this subversion, it makes things pretty obvious that they have chosen to inflict damage in non-Baloch areas so as to not to annoy their own population.”
This, he recalled, is what happened to the TTP, Ahrarul Hind and similar smaller groups after they targeted both civilians and the security apparatus — it generated widespread resentment and rejection among the masses and they were forced to change their tactics.
Given the scale and ambition of the terror plot, one of the theories doing the rounds alludes to a possible collaboration between multiple terror outfits, since it would be quite a challenge for any one group to assemble a VBIED of this scale and smuggle it into a well-guarded city like Karachi.
When asked about the possibility, Mr Gul said there was “very obvious operational synergy among groups such as the TTP, BLA and BLF who are believed to be the critical links in the externally-driven proxy terrorism that Pakistan is facing”.
This also means these groups and their handlers are imparting training and techniques for subversive activities, he noted.

The Balochistan Home Department issued a notification confirming the extension, which includes a ban on the display of weapons, public processions and the use of tinted vehicle windows.
The order prohibits public gatherings of five or more people. Authorities also banned the operation of unregistered motorcycles and the covering of faces in public using masks or mufflers. Pillion riding remains forbidden, though exceptions allow for the transportation of women and children. Violators will face legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the notification.

The dispute emerged in November 2020 when the CCP — an independent regulatory body established in 2007 under the Competition Act with an objective to ensure a level-playing field in markets by preventing anti-competitive practices such as cartels, deceptive marketing and mergers that may harm competition — issued identical show-cause notices to the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and different sugar mills across the country, accusing them of violating Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010, which bans cartelisation.
A four-member CCP panel after hearing the case had a split decision in August 2021 whereby two members, including then chairperson Rahat Kaunain Hassan, found the mills guilty and the remaining two members sought a fresh inquiry. However, the chairperson cast a deciding vote that resulted in the imposition of Rs44 billion fines on almost 72 sugar mills for alleged manipulative practices.
The sugar mills challenged that decision before the appellate tribunal, which in May 2025 ordered a new hearing by a member who had not signed either opinion. In September, the SC struck down the tribunal’s order and CCP’s casting-vote decision, and while annulling the fines referred the matter back to the ‘tribunal’ for fresh proceedings based on the original 2020 notices.
Instituted by senior counsel Asma Hamid, the review petition sought a clarification on the SC’s decision to remand the matter to the tribunal instead of the CCP for fresh hearing.
The review petition pleaded that the power to make an order on the basis of inquiries/show cause notices vests with the commission in exercise of its powers under Section 30 of the Competition Commission Act, 2010. It is in exercise of powers vested in the commission that the inquiries were conducted and show cause notices were issued, orders made and penalties recovered for the contraventions of the act committed by the parties (sugar mills), it argued.

The statement was made at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) summoned to discuss the recent developments in Venezuela. This is also the first meeting for the year of the UNSC, with Somalia in the chair.
The US had launched a shock military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with special forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a nighttime raid.
Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”.
He reminded Council members that the UN Charter bound states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to uphold sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes.

Ambassador Jadoon added that unilateral military action contravened these “sacrosanct principles” as well as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, warning that such actions set dangerous precedents and risked eroding the foundations of the global legal framework.
He cautioned that such actions also fuel instability, which, “as history has shown time and again, can lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes for years to come“.
Calling for de-escalation, the Pakistani envoy said that at this critical juncture, “the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy,” stressing that durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means and with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, free from external interference.
He expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised as a ‘Zone of Peace’, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards enhanced regional cooperation and improved prosperity.

Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation, and engage in dialogue, including by utilising sincere offers of mediation.
Jadoon noted that the offices of the secretary-general remained available for that purpose.
Concluding his remarks, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility for addressing threats to international peace and security by diffusing tensions, promoting pacific settlement and upholding respect for international law and the UN Charter.
“Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said.
UN chief concerned about instability in Venezuela, legality of US operation
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela after Maduro’s capture.
“I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo.







Guterres called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue, adding: “I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward.”
He also expressed concern that the US operation to capture Maduro in Caracas on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.Pakistan urges restraint, dialogue on Venezuela
‘Surgical law enforcement operation’
As UN officials and several UN diplomats sharply criticised Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, US Ambassador Michael G. Waltz defended the action before the Security Council as a justified “surgical law enforcement operation”.
“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this Charter as a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” Waltz asked.
The US envoy said Washington had acted to apprehend two indicted fugitives, naming President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, and insisted the operation did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people.
He described Maduro as a fugitive and the leader of a “vicious foreign terrorist organisation”, alleging links to international drug trafficking networks that use “illegal narcotics as a weapon”.

Waltz compared the action to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
Citing broader human rights concerns, the ambassador referred to allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions in Venezuela, and said more than eight million Venezuelans had fled the country.
China’s representative said his country was “deeply shocked by, and strongly condemns” what he described as the United States’ “unilateral, illegal and bullying acts” against Venezuela.
He accused Washington of “wantonly trampling upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests“, placing power above multilateralism and military action above diplomacy.
Warning of a grave threat to peace in Latin America and beyond, the Chinese envoy urged the United States to heed what he called the “overwhelming voice” of the international community and return to dialogue.
Russian Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia condemned the United States for what he called armed aggression against Venezuela in violation of international law, urging Washington to immediately release the “legitimately elected President” and his spouse.
Calling on Council members to abandon double standards, Mr Nebenzia warned against justifying “such an egregious act of aggression” out of fear of what he termed the “American global gendarme”.
He further accused the United States of seeking control over Venezuela’s natural resources, saying its actions were generating “fresh momentum for neocolonialism and imperialism”.
Following Maduro’s capture, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place”.
“We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.”

The rally was organised by All Parties Kech in collaboration with traders, the Doctors Association and civil society.
Marchers moved through main roads and streets of the district headquarters of Kech district, starting from Officer Bazaar, passing through various routes, reaching the Press Club and then proceeding to Shaheed Fida Chowk, where the march turned into a protest.
“The protection of citizens is the responsibility of the state and its institutions,” National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said while describing the situation in Kech as “alarming”.

Political leaders warn of district-wide strike

Demonstrators demanded the recovery of two recently abducted youths, Haseeb Haji Yaseen and Shah Nawaz Gul Jan, and called on state institutions to protect citizens.
Mr Malik, while demanding the recovery, warned that attempts were once again being made to push Kech toward instability, but said the people of Kech would resist such efforts.
He urged the district administration to provide protection to citizens and said that for the past month, affected families and political leaders had approached relevant institutions, but each continued to shift responsibility to others.
All Parties Kech Convener Nawab Khan Shambezai announced that a district-wide strike would be observed on Jan 7 if the two youths did not return.
The Kech Bar Association boycotted court proceedings in solidarity with the families of the abducted.
Advocate Syed Majeed Shah, the association’s president, condemned the kidnappings.
Business activities and daily life have been severely disrupted by the recent wave of crime, according to local leaders.
Mir Ghafoor Ahmed Bizenjo, a former minister, said that citizens were “living under a sense of fear” and called on the state to ensure public safety.
Human rights defenders and other speakers at the rally said the insecurity affects the entire Makran region, demanding an end to the kidnappings that have particularly targeted the business community.

In its first of the kind “Fiscal Risk Monitoring Framework for Contingent Liabilities of PPP Projects”, in line with commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ministry’s Debt Management Office reported a total of Rs472.3bn in such liabilities as of Dec 2025.
More than 71pc (Rs335.6bn) of the total pertained to contingent liabilities of the Sindh government, which has the largest portfolio of 17 PPP projects — almost half of 36 across the country.

Total liabilities exceeded Rs472bn by end of last month

The federal government’s total contingent liabilities against PPP projects amounted to Rs90.6bn, or 19.3pc of the cumulative amount, followed by Punjab at Rs26.5bn (5.6pc) and Rs19.6bn (4.2pc of the total) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
Balochistan has no such liabilities, although its five projects were among the 36 total PPP project portfolio across the country.
In its latest written commitment to the IMF, the government had promised to improve the risk monitoring framework of public-private partnerships, including those at the provincial level.
“We will subject PPP-funded projects to the same rigorous selection criteria applied to projects funded through other sources”, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said, adding that Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other stakeholders, was in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for quantifying contingent liabilities related to PPPs for publishing estimates by end-December 2025.
Contingent liabilities are those contractual obligations of the state for which public sector entities have assumed risks against these PPP projects and are calculated in nominal values calculated over the life of the contract.
Of the total liabilities, Rs368.3bn pertain to contingent fiscal responsibilities that may accrue due to minimum revenue guaranteed by the respective governments against a specific project, cost escalation, interest rate fluctuations or terminal liabilities, while another Rs104bn have been pitched as financial guarantees.
Cost escalation
The report suggests Sindh’s direct contingent liabilities because of cost escalation, minimum revenue guarantee and terminal liabilities stand at Rs255.5bn, accounting for close to 70pc of the Rs368.3bn consolidated national amount. Sindh’s largest risk exposure for contingent liabilities stems from cost escalation estimated at Rs146.6bn, followed by Rs61bn for minimum revenue guaranteed by the provincial government to private partners.
This is in addition to about Rs80bn in financial guarantees.
The federal government’s total PPP liabilities of Rs90.6bn include Rs83.7bn on account of termination liabilities and Rs7bn in financial guarantees. Financial guarantees are instruments issued against a financial commitment agreed to be undertaken by the public sector like viability gap financing support.
The report highlighted ‘high’ risk of these contingent liabilities becoming actually due on account of Rs150bn each for cost escalation and termination liabilities, Rs104bn on account of financial guarantees and about Rs66bn for minimum revenue guarantees, led by Sindh with Rs61bn.
IMF stipulation
The framework is required under the IMF programme to establish a consistent system for identifying, quantifying, and reporting contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects at both federal and provincial government levels.
This is because the PPP contracts can create fiscal exposures that do not immediately appear in budget or debt statements, but could materialise later through guarantee calls, revenue support mechanisms, indexation adjustments or termination-related payments.
The framework provides a uniform methodology to classify and quantify both direct and contingent liabilities and to consolidate these into a single national PPP fiscal exposure dataset managed by the RMU of the Ministry of Finance.

A two-member BHC bench comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Kamran Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen ordered the suspension of the provincial government notification during the hearing of a petition filed by senior advocate Rahib Khan Buledi, chairman of executive committee of the Balochistan Bar Council, challenging the provincial government move. 
Advocates Iftikhar Ahmed Langove and Abdul Baseer Kakar also filed similar petitions in the high court. 
In their petitions, the petitioners challenged the notification issued by the Balochistan government on December 30, 2025, under Section 22 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). 
The notification appointed all divisional commissioners, additional commissioners, deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners, and assistant commissioners as Justices of Peace within their jurisdiction. 
The notification also authorised them to perform functions under Sections 22-A and 22-B of the CrPC.
Counsel for the petitioners pleaded that the notification was issued unilaterally, without consultation or approval from the Chief Justice of Balochistan High Court, in violation of Articles 175(3), 202, and 203 of the Constitution. 
They pointed out that under existing law, sessions judges and designated additional sessions judges already serve as ex-officio Justices of Peace, and that granting such judicial powers to executive officers undermines the constitutional principle of separation of powers and threatens the independence of the judiciary.
They further contended that although Section 22 of the CrPC allows the government to appoint Justices of Peace in rural areas, such appointments must follow proper rules defining their powers and limitations. They argued that the impu­gned notification has effectively created a parallel judicial system by vesting judicial authority in executive officials.
The BHC bench admitted petitions for hearing and issued notices to respondents, and ordered that the notification would stay suspended until the next hearing of the case. 
It also directed that copies of the court order be sent to respondents and the office of the advocate general for information and compliance. The matter is expected to be taken up again after the winter vacation.

During the proceedings, Rehman refused to comment on previous statements by incumbent ministers and an ex-army official that touched upon the issue of missing persons, negotiations with rights activists and criticism of the military.
The statements were referred to by Chattha, who along with Mazari, cross-examined Rehman during today‘s hearing from the defence’s side.
Chattha and Mazari have been facing legal proceedings in the case on accusations of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The first information report (FIR) of the case, registered with the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka presided over the hearing of the case today, during which Hadi referred to a Dawn report dated July 31, 2025. The report carried statements by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and the Jama­at-i-Islami (JI) Emir in Balochistan Maulana Hidayatur Rehman.
The JI leader also led the Haq Do Balochistan Tehreek, which was the subject of Dawn’s July 31 report and had been carrying out a protest march from Quetta to Islamabad, calling for an end to humiliation in the name of security and the release of rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch and other detainees, among other demands.
The report said the Haq Do Balochistan had agreed to stage a protest camp outside the Lahore Press Club while a high-level federal government committee would hold talks with Maulana Hidayatur Rehman.
It said the announcement was made by Auragzeb, who assured the JI leaders that the Punjab government fully supported the legitimate demands of the people of Balochistan.
The report also quoted Maulana Hidayatur Rehman as saying that he hoped Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, who had previously raised her voice for Balochistan’s missing persons while in opposition, would continue that commitment as the provincial chief executive.
When Hadi asked prosecution witness Rehman to comment on the matter, he refused and said he would only offer an opinion if such a case came before him.
Chattha then cited statements attributed to Minister of State for Law Barrister Aqeel Malik carried in a report by Arab News regarding negotiations with Mahrang Baloch, who has vocal about the issue of enforced disappearances.
Chattha was apparently referring to a February 2025 report at that instance, which quoted Malik as saying that the government would engage with Mahrang and her Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) movement, provided it did not have an “ulterior motive“.
But, Rehman refused to comment on that as well.
Several videos were also played in the court, including one of Punjab CM Maryam’s speech. Slogans such as “uniform is behind terrorism” and “Bajwa is a thief” could also be heard in the clip.
When asked whether such an event would amount to opposing the state, Rehman said he would comment only after reviewing the video in an official capacity.
He also admitted that he was unaware whether enforced disappearances was a serious issue in Pakistan, whether a commission on missing persons existed, or what the state policy on the matter was.
A video showing an event of the outlawed Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi were also played during the hearing. Police were seen facilitating arrangements in the video.
But the witness also declined to comment on that, maintaining that he would respond only if the matter formally came to him.
He also claimed ignorance about the banned status of the two groups.

 

Then, a statement by former director general of Inter-Services Public Relations Asif Ghafoor regarding missing persons was played, but Rehman refused to comment on that as well.
During cross-examination, Rehman told the court that he had an MPhil degree in computer science, had undergone departmental training and attended workshops on Peca, cybercrime, and the Criminal Procedure Code.
However, he had not received any training or attended workshops related to enforced disappearance cases, the witness said.
When asked to define the term “state”, the witness said to his understanding, it referred to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
He was then asked to identify any X post by Mazari or Chattha containing “explicit anti-state content”. To that, Rehman responded that the posts’ subject “pertains to a narrative” and they had no mention of any “armed struggle” against the state.
Rehman also acknowledged using the term “disinformation vector” in his report regarding the case, but he failed to explain the term when pressed to do so. He said he could not elaborate on it “right now.”
The witness further testified that the content under scrutiny was based on “manipulation” and said that the individuals named in his report were those who had reposted Mazari’s posts.
At a later point in the hearing, he said he had not mentioned any person other than the relevant accused in his report.
He said to his knowledge, all posts under scrutiny supported the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other banned outfits.
However, when a specific post from the case file was read out, the witness conceded that neither the BLA nor the TTP was explicitly named, but insisted that the post was against the state.
The witness also admitted he could not recall the date when “Mahrang was banned”, though he said he had checked the National Counter Terrorism Authority’s website while preparing the report.
He asserted that sharing statements of banned organisations or individuals constituted a crime.
Following the completion of his cross-examination by Mazari and Chattha, the court adjourned the hearing until January 7.</p><small>2026-01-05 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05194401928dccb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965280/palestinian-embassy-in-uk-officially-inaugurated' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian embassy in UK officially inaugurated</strong></a><br><p>The embassy of Palestine was officially inaugurated in London in a short ceremony on Monday, hailed by its ambassador as a “profound milestone” in British-Palestinian relations.

Sporting a traditional black and white keffiyeh scarf, Zomlot told the ceremony this is “not merely a change of name”, but a “change of direction” towards Palestinian statehood.
“What a way to begin a new year together, marking a profound milestone in the British-Palestinian relations, and in the Palestinian people’s long journey to freedom and self-determination,” Zomlot said, before unveiling the embassy’s new plaque.
“This is a day of hope, a day of steadfastness, and a day that reminds the world that peace is not only possible, it is inevitable … when rooted in justice, dignity, equality and mutual recognition.”
The UK’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an AFP query on whether the UK planned to follow suit by opening a British embassy in the Palestinian territories.

Speaking just after Zomlot at a lectern flanked by Palestinian and British national flags, UK diplomatic representative Alistair Harrison said the occasion represented a “moment of hope”.
“This is the beginning of a step change in our bilateral relationship,” he said. “I wish you ambassador, and your team, a very happy stay in what is now your embassy, and congratulations.”

According to Senior Superintendent of Police (West) Tariq Illahi Mastoi, the water tanker driver was speeding on a street in Manghopir when he hit the boy.
The boy sustained critical injuries and died on the spot, he added.
Police apprehended the driver and impounded the vehicle, according to a statement issued by police.
The body of the minor was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medicolegal formalities.
Last week, a female motorcyclist was killed after being hit by a trailer. Quaidabad’s Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammad Ali Shah told Dawn that the driver of a 10-wheeler hit the 20-year-old female motorcyclist on the main Mehran Highway near MN Textile in Landhi.
A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year.
In its annual road accident report, the department recorded a noticeable decline in both fatalities and injuries, attributing the improvement to stricter enforcement, data-driven interventions, and closer coordination with transport stakeholders. According to official figures, 477 people lost their lives in traffic accidents during the first six months of the year, compared to 326 fatalities in the second half.</p><small>2026-01-05 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05175829b83e70d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965258/sindh-ctd-says-major-terrorist-plot-in-karachi-foiled-2000kg-of-explosive-material-seized' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CTD says major terrorist plot in Karachi foiled; 2,000kg of explosive material seized</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Monday that a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi.
Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city.
Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans.
He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region.
Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material.
He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid.
“We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture.
“The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

He said that raids were conducted on six sites on the information provided by the terrorist who was arrested, after which another two terrorists were captured, who were also in possession of explosive material.
He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested.
Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade.

The CTD official said that the additional interrogation and investigation was under way, and authorities were conducting raids to make more arrests. He further said that facilitators and handlers of this terrorist network were identified.
“All the planning regarding the attack was done from outside the country,“ he said. The CTD official said that the facilitators and the handlers involved had been identified, adding that several teams were working on their arrest.

He said that the explosive material that was shifted to the metropolis was “ready to go”, adding that this was a major achievement of all agencies that had prevented a major attack in Karachi.
He said that the explosive material seized was “a mix”, saying that some of it was an amalgam of commercial explosives and other items, while some of it was smuggled through Balochistan’s mountainous regions.
The CTD official said that more details on this would be shared at a later date.</p><small>2026-01-05 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05185701ef887c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964953/losing-the-peshawar-that-i-once-knew' target='_blank'><strong>LOSING THE PESHAWAR THAT I ONCE KNEW</strong></a><br><p>Landing in my birthplace always gives me the feeling of a tired child resting his head in his mother’s lap, the comfort that says I’m home. This time, the feeling was warmer, for I had brought with me the joy of my son’s wedding to share with my family and friends. It felt like returning to a celebration.
But joy in this country is always fragile, more so in the border regions.
The minute I touched down in Islamabad, news broke of yet another suicide attack — 12 killed, dozens injured. The headline cut through my heart before I even reached baggage claim. Still, I drove to Peshawar, to my roots. To the soil that has always known both happiness and heartbreak.


The walls of Peshawar’s old qahwa khanas tea houses, which once echoed with Rehman Baba’s verses and the faces of film stars, are now filled with Quranic calligraphy, reflecting a changing moral and social landscape.

When I reached home, the air was the same as when I left it. Dry, warm, filled with the scent of dust and bright sunshine. Children I once saw in school uniforms are now married. Cousins have grey hair. New faces sit where elders once did. But the streets have grown crowded, the tolerance thinner, the city restless. Yet, every corner still tells a story of life, and survival. And the unbreakable stubbornness of its people.

A native returns to his home in what was once known as the ‘City of Flowers’ and tries to make sense of its slow erosion, over decades, of culture, tolerance and joy. Where the city once pulsed with music, cinema, dance, poetry and coexistence, it struggles today under the weight of fear, radicalisation and silence. Is the old Peshawar just destined to exist only in his memory?

THE CITY THAT WAS
Forty years ago, Peshawar was one of the most vibrant cultural cities in South Asia. What Paris had in sophistication, what New York had in artistic energy, my city had in its own distinct, confident way.


A vendor on Peshawar’s Cinema Road pictured 30 years ago.

I still remember my teenage days in a small village near Peshawar in the early 1980s. Back then, the city was alive with colour and melody, cinemas showing Pashto, Urdu, English and Punjabi films, the sound of the rabab floating through Dabgari Bazaar, and wedding nights throbbing with dance, drums and currency notes being showered over performers. Peshawar was a city of art, of scandal, of tradition and temptation.
There were musicians’ streets, poetry festivals, bookshops and open-air performances that carried on late into the night. In the Saddar neighbourhood, Khyber Café served as the informal headquarters of Pakistan Television’s Peshawar Centre, where actors, poets, writers and producers gathered daily. A short walk away stood Saint John’s and Saint Cathedral churches, and beside them the historic Jamia Darvesh Mosque. A coexistence of faiths carved naturally into the city’s landscape.


A worshipper sits inside the historic Mohabbat Khan Mosque. Amid fading frescoes and worn marble floors, the centuries-old mosque remains a place of solitude and devotion.

In Kali Bari street, Muslim, Hindu and Christian families lived side-by-side in a harmony that felt permanent. Every year, the month-long Jashn-i-Khyber festival filled the night air with announcements and music from Peshawar Stadium’s loudspeakers. And in Dabgari Chowk, the celebrated Pashto ghazal singer Khyal Muhammad would perform all night in the middle of the road, surrounded by people who came for poetry, not politics.
That was the Peshawar I grew up in: confident, open, generous.

THE TRANSFORMATION
But then came the Afghan war and Gen Ziaul Haq’s call for ‘jihad’. Overnight, Peshawar became the frontline of a global game. It turned into a Kalashnikov capital, a smuggler’s paradise, a city of spies and sudden millionaires. To own a gun was to be powerful, to fire it in the air was to be feared.
Over decades, religious seminaries multiplied, public art vanished and cultural spaces disappeared or were muted. Suspicion replaced neighbourliness. Extremism was not an accident, it was a slow, deliberate recalibration of society, one that suffocated the city’s cultural lungs.


Supporters of a religious political party burn an American flag during a protest at Peshawar’s Martyrs’ Monument, erected in memory of members of the non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar movement killed by British forces. The moment underscores the contrast between a site rooted in peaceful resistance and later waves of political anger shaped by global events.

On my second day in the city, I photographed a young Islamist student wrapped in a white turban, wearing a light-brown Schott NYC US Army jacket. The irony hit me like a flash: an American brand on a madrassa [seminary] student. When I asked about it, he smiled and said it was his “trophy”. I didn’t ask more. He happily posed for a picture.
That single moment pulled me 30 years back, to 1996, when the Taliban had just taken control of Afghanistan. Back then, they walked freely in Peshawar’s streets. The city was their resting ground, their moral laboratory.


Tora Bora, Afghanistan: Foot soldiers rest during a pause in fighting. Some prepare for prayer, while one listens quietly to Indian songs on the All India Radio. Beyond labels such as Taliban or mujahid holy warrior, the image reveals the ordinary human contradictions of war — faith, fatigue, memory and music coexisting in a single moment.

And here I was again, 30 years later — the same story, the same spirit, just new clothes and a different brand. I didn’t ask this young man about his ‘trophy’. Not because I was afraid, but because I understood that, in our land, questions can sometimes be louder than answers.
History in this part of the world never moves forward — it keeps circling, dressing old beliefs in new symbols.
A WALK ON CINEMA ROAD
The afternoon light falls softly on Cinema Road, the street that once carried the heartbeat of the city. The air still smells of dust, tea and faint memories of songs that used to spill from cassette shops. My steps now echo where music once lived.


Near the Sethi House, Peshawar’s old streets still carry the elegance of carved balconies, fading paint and narrow passages that once shaped everyday life. Caught between neglect and survival, these lanes stand as quiet witnesses to a city whose architectural memory is slowly slipping away.

Inside a narrow tea shop, Jan Muhammad sits cross-legged beside his brass samovar. This was once the German Tea Shop, now everyone calls it Jan Muhammad Chai Khana. He pours boiling milk into cups, the sound of hissing steam blending with the low hum of conversation. He looks up and says, “Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah], the bazar is clean now, no obscenity, only business.”
The clang of kettles and the breath of steam are all that remain from a time when this road was alive with sound, posters and film lights.
There was a time when Cinema Road glowed every evening. Three proud cinema halls stood shoulder-to-shoulder: Picture House, Novelty and Tasweer Mahal. People knew them not by their official names but by what they looked like: Picture House was Makhamkh Cinema, the one in the front; Novelty was Manz Cinema, the middle one; and Tasweer Mahal was Pehla Cinema, the first one in the row.


At Picture House Cinema on Cinema Road in the early 2000s, film billboards were altered during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure, with female faces removed and only male actors left visible. The cinema itself has since been bulldozed, marking the physical erasure of a once-thriving cultural space from the city’s landscape.

Crowds of young men filled the street. Truck drivers, students and visitors from the villages of Khyber, Charsadda, Mardan and Kohat. They came for the films, for the laughter, for the noise that made this road feel like a fair. Music shops lined both sides: Sherbaz Khan Music Centre, Shalimar and Gul Sattar Khan. Their cassette racks glimmered under yellow bulbs, filled with Pashto, Indian, Persian and English songs. The road itself throbbed like a radio tuned between worlds.
The photo studios were tiny rooms where magic happened. A young man could pose and see himself printed beside Badar Munir, Musarrat Shaheen, Yasmin Khan or Suraya Khan — a small miracle made with scissors, negatives and glue. He would take that photo back to his hujra [communal space], proud and smiling, showing it as proof that he had met fame.
Now those same shops sell PVC boards and stationery — the film stars are gone, but the cracked walls still remember them. And through Photoshopping now, young men opt to be transformed into images of militants, guns in hand and a rocket-launcher on the shoulder.
A little ahead, the Tasweer Mahal lies buried under a 13-storey plaza. Novelty and Picture House have also been erased, bulldozed like memories no one asked to keep. Dust has replaced the crowd clamouring at the cinema gate, eager to get in. Only silence stands where the hero once leapt across the screen amidst applause from cine-goers.
Further down stands the Aina Cinema, its doors half-open to… whom? The ‘Ladies Gate’ sign still hangs above the narrow staircase.


Aina Cinema, once alive with music, colour and collective dreams, is now reduced to a parking lot.

The ‘Pay Box’ lettering survives, though a car now blocks the view. And above, the mural of dancers and musicians — colours faded — still hangs on through the years. This hall once echoed with clapping hands and Pashto film dialogue. Now it rents its floor to cars.
No one I ask says they miss those days. Maybe they have forgotten, maybe forgetting is easier. But for those who grew up in that sound and smoke, the loss runs deep — not just of cinemas, but of openness.


An image from 1996 that captures the tension between public piety and private curiosity.

There was a balance once. Faith and fun walking side by side. Falak Sair and Capital Cinemas in Saddar, the Takhtu Jumat mosque between them, Blue Bells Music Centre beside. Naz Cinema near Masjid Mahabat Khan and Cinema Road itself beside Madani Masjid of Namak Mandi. After Friday prayers, some men went to the cinema, some to Dabgari Bazar — both part of one rhythm that made the city move.


In Peshawar’s Dabgari Bazaar, musicians traditionally kept their balcony windows open so passers-by could see and hire them. During the MMA provincial government’s campaign against music, pressure from authorities forced these windows shut. In this image from 2003, two musicians cautiously peer onto the street — a quiet moment reflecting how fear and regulation pushed a once public art into the shadows

Evening falls again on Cinema Road. At Jan Muhammad’s shop, the kettles cool slowly and the tea tastes like nostalgia — thick, sweet and a little burnt. The steam curls upward like the city’s last song. The walls are cleaner now but quieter. We have built plazas and lost poetry, scrubbed away the music but not the memory.


During the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s (MMA) tenure in KP in the early 2000s, cinema posters along Cinema Road were altered as female faces were removed or blacked out

A CITY THAT WALKS THROUGH SMOKE
The morning sun in Peshawar was pale and kind. And then, that morning, a car bomb. A suicide attacker struck right in front of the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters — formerly the Frontier Constabulary — in the heart of Saddar.
The blast ripped through the stillness of an ordinary workday. A white Suzuki, packed with explosives, rammed the gate before a suicide bomber detonated himself. Within seconds, concrete dust, smoke and fear clouded the street. The echoes rolled beneath the overhead BRT [Bus Rapid Transit] track, bouncing between the concrete pillars that now bear the stains of shrapnel.
Three FC personnel were martyred on the spot, several others were wounded. Under the overhead bridge, men gathered in silence. Children clutched schoolbags. Bikers slowed to watch the police lift the burned car with a forklift, its tires dangling mid-air. A haunting image of another day gone wrong. Nearby, an FC soldier stood guard over a blood-soaked shroud, staring at what little was left of the attacker.
And yet, just a few hundred meters away, life went on. Shops re-opened, schools and offices stayed functional, and traffic crawled as usual. The people of Peshawar, hardened by decades of violence, carried on with that familiar numbness that only a city long at war can understand.
By noon, the road was cleared. The glass shards on the asphalt shimmered like tiny memorials in the sunlight. For outsiders, it was a terror attack — for Peshawar, it was Monday.

WALTZING WITH TERROR
This November, when my son was getting married in New York, my sisters in Peshawar insisted to have a traditional nakreezy — a henna night with music and dance — in my hometown. They wanted a Pashto singer, someone whose voice could bring back even a trace of the old Peshawar. Our friend, the renowned Pashto singer Sarfaraz Afridi, offered to perform along with his young son, Arman Faraz.
I wanted to host them on a stage worthy of artists, decorated with candles and roses. The way Peshawar once honoured its musicians. I visited 17 wedding halls. Everyone refused. “No live music,” they said. “It is a sin.” As if joy itself had become forbidden. As if melody threatened the order of things.
So I built my own stage. On the rooftop of our four-storey family home, in the heart of our village, we placed speakers on all four sides. Not to provoke anyone, but to remind them of what had been forgotten. Sarfaraz and Arman performed until dawn. Their voices floated over our neighbourhood like a small rebellion.
That night was my protest. My refusal to accept silence as the new normal.
For the main wedding, I had invited a Khattak dance troupe, a symbol of Pakhtun identity and pride. The FC, whose dancers I had invited, was burying its own after the bomb attack. I assumed the performance would be cancelled. But on the wedding day, the troupe arrived. Still grieving. Still shaken. But determined.
Their presence was more than entertainment — it was a declaration. A refusal to let terror dictate how people live, celebrate or express their culture. In front of 1,000 guests, their dance was a quiet but unmistakable act of defiance.
For a brief moment, I saw my old Peshawar again.


The dance troupe that performed at the wedding of the writer’s son. Just two days earlier, they had survived a bomb attack.

THE UNHEARD SONGS
In my father’s youth, in the 1960s, things were different. He told me that when women dancers were invited to weddings, they would first go to the women’s side of the house. Female hosts would welcome them with tea, speak kindly and drape a chador over their shoulders. A gesture of respect, of protection. Only then would the dancers step toward the hujra, escorted by male elders of the family.
Before the music began, an elder would raise his hand and declare: “She is our guest. She has come to bring joy to our celebration. Respect her as you would respect your own daughter.” Those few words were like a royal decree, an invisible shield. No one dared misbehave, no one dared touch. That was Pashtunwali — the old code of honour that balanced pride with protection.


A rabab-maker in Dabgari Bazar.

I grew up in the early 1980s, when the night air smelled of kerosene lamps in my village. In our villages, there was no cinema, no television, no theatre. Only the female dance party in the hujra. The night would go on — currency notes showered upon the dancers, tossed over the groom and his friends, laughter mixing with the music. The mehfil glowed until midnight, when it ended with bursts of gunfire in the air, a final announcement to the surrounding villages that the dance was over. Yet, within that fiery, fraught atmosphere, the dancing girls somehow felt safe.
They came from everywhere — from Swat’s Banr Bazaar, from Mardan, from Rawalpindi, sometimes from Lahore or from Dabgari Bazaar itself, the old red-light heart of Peshawar. Names whispered in gossip and admiration: Shamshad Begum known as Shamshado, Farzana, Shahnaz, Babli, Chanoo. Women who carried the rhythm of a culture and the shame of a society that refused to own them.
But that balance has been shattered. First by the Kalashnikov culture of the 1980s, then by the militancy and false piety that followed. The same land that once danced to the rabab began to tremble under sermons and gunfire. The same people who clapped to melodies now judge with verses.


During the MMA government, music cassettes, CDs, DVDs and VHS tapes were publicly burned in Peshawar’s Jinnah Park after Friday prayers. At the very spot where Quaid-i-Azam once addressed the city, flames replaced melody, marking a moment when culture was condemned and Peshawar began to lose its plural, joyful voice.

Today, a woman with a song is a threat. A woman who dances is fair game for anyone’s bullet. Her name was Muniba Shah. A name that most of Peshawar didn’t know until it was followed by the phrase “shot dead.” She was a damma, a Pakhtun dancer, an artist, a survivor of a cruel tradition that praises art but punishes the artist. She danced her last dance in the City of Flowers.
No protest. No statement. No civil society outrage. Only a few blurred photos on social media, her painted face frozen mid-smile… and a city moving on as if nothing had happened.
Muniba Shah is not the first. She joins a silent chorus: Shabana, the dancer from Swat, shot dead in 2009, her body dumped in a public square. Ayman Udas, singer and TV performer, murdered by her brothers for “dishonour”. Ghazala Javed, the nightingale of Peshawar, gunned down with her father in 2012. Sumbul, Sonia, Resham, Lubna, Khushboo — each killed for saying no, for performing, for living.
Eighteen names that are known. Countless others lost. No monuments. No memorials. No justice. Just Facebook comments asking what she wore, what she did, as if death needed justification. But if music is our soul, why do we keep killing our singers? We praise God for beauty but destroy the ones who carry it in their bones.
Muniba Shah will not perform again. Her anklets lie still, her music cut short. Somewhere tonight, another girl in Banr Bazaar may look at her picture and feel both wonder and warning — dreaming of the stage, fearing its price.


Cinema Road used to be alive with music cassette shops where film songs, ghazals and Pashto songs were bought and sold.

THE HIGH AND THE LOW
He was known in our streets as “Nasimy”. His real name was Nasim Maseeh, but names fade fast in the dust of forgotten lives. He was the man with the broom — a long jharroo in one hand, a small steel cart in the other — walking through Nothia Jadeed, Miskeen Abad, Judge Bungalow and Kotla Mohsin Khan every dawn.
A faded Palestinian-style scarf tied around his head, dark skin shining with sweat, white teeth flashing when he laughed. A laughter full of life and, at times, full of quiet sorrow. After sweeping, he would sit cross-legged on the ground, cracking jokes, calling out to the housewives in his broken Pashto: “Ay baaji, chai milay gi? Ay mory, aik paratha mere liye bhi! [Sister, can I get a cup of tea? One paratha for me too!]
Every woman in the neighbourhood knew him, respected him. And he, in return, respected everyone. Working and smiling, never demanding more than a greeting or a cup of tea.
But when someone threw waste food, plastic or burned trash on the same street he had just cleaned, Nasimy would laugh again. A deep, tired, saddened laugh, the kind that hides pain behind politeness.
A few days ago, I learned that Nasimy had died. Inside a blocked gutter at Darul Uloom Usmania, the very madrassa whose drains he was cleaning. He suffocated there, in the dark, doing the work no one else wanted to do. He died where the city’s conscience never dares to go.
I asked around: was he married? Did he have children, a home, a family? No one knew. There are thousands like Nasimy in Pakistan — most belonging to Christian and Hindu minorities, living without contracts, safety or respect. They clean the mess of millions, yet die in silence.
Sometimes I think we Pakhtuns, indeed the entire Pakistani nation, are among the most contradictory of people, with arrogance born out of the caste system. Those who cut our hair and make us beautiful, we call nai, implying a lowly status. Those who shape the clay into pots that feed us, we call kolal, equally lowly. Those who bring colour to our lives, we still treat as low.
We are blind to the truth that they — not us — keep the rhythm of life alive.
FROM KALASHNIKOVS TO TIKTOK
Forty-five years later, the story has not changed, only the platforms have. From Iqbaly and Dabangy to Tila Khan, Ayuby and Papu, these names ruled the underworld. They were legends of ‘badmaashi’ — gangsters, assassins, drug lords — until SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Sifwat Ghayur arrived with an iron will. One by one, his team took down the city’s crime lords. But in a cruel irony of fate, SSP Ghayur and his men would later be killed by the Taliban they once fought to contain.


Leaders and supporters of religious political parties address a public gathering during a rally in which Osama bin Laden was publicly portrayed as a “mujahid holy warrior”.

The gangsters of Peshawar are no longer hiding in dark alleys; they are performing on TikTok. They threaten, boast and mock each other in viral videos, before ending up dead in police encounters that everyone knows are paid for.
Just a few days ago, Malik Adam Khan, an Afghan-Pakistani figure once feared, was killed along with his companions. Rumours spread across the city that his rivals, Mumtazy “Two Feet”, Haji Habib and Breet Khan, paid the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for the ‘operation’. Hours later, Mumtazy threw a celebration, a night of dance and gunfire, mocking the death of his rival.
In the 1980s, Peshawar’s poison was heroin and opium — today it’s ice, crystal meth, a drug that burns young minds faster than war ever did. The city’s streets are no longer full of storytellers or musicians — they’re full of dealers, addicts and a lost generation.
And then, the ultimate tragedy. Videos surface of fathers selling their own children for food. Crying boys and girls under the age of 12, auctioned in shame because poverty has crushed the last pillars of Pakhtun honour. It was unthinkable once. It’s the reality now.
Guns, drugs, gangs and tears — the story repeats itself. But somewhere between the smoke of the Kalashnikov and the glow of a TikTok screen, the soul of Peshawar burns among its ashes.
WHAT REMAINS
I often say I lost my city. In many ways, I have. The Peshawar of my youth — diverse, artistic, tolerant — survives now only in memory and in scattered pockets of resistance.


Once a walled city entered through many gates, Peshawar has recently restored these gateways as symbols of its centuries-old identity. Kabuli Gate, the historic entry to Qissa Khwani Bazaar, stands again — marking the threshold where stories, trade and history have flowed for generations.

But I also know this: culture is resilient. Music finds cracks to slip through. Joy returns in unexpected places. It does sometimes on rooftops, sometimes on a wedding stage trembling after an attack. The extremists took much from Peshawar. But they have not taken its soul entirely. Not yet.
I carry that belief like I carry an old photograph — edges fading, centre glowing. And I hold on to it, because cities don’t die when buildings fall or when cultures are silenced. They die when their people stop remembering what they once were.
Until then, every Pakhtun must ask: what kind of flower garden are we, if we keep watering the soil with the blood of our own roses?

In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event “political colour” as the song mentioned “Qaidi No. 804” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist today, who appeared before the court.
Amjad’s counsel submitted that the petitioner has no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants at the cultural programme.
He further requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”.
After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail and sought the case record from the police.

 

The Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on January 3.
According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.”
The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order.
The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051349218fbd379.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965255/university-of-lahore-student-injured-after-jumping-from-varsitys-second-floor-police' target='_blank'><strong>University of Lahore student injured after jumping from varsity’s second floor: police</strong></a><br><p>A first-semester pharmacy student sustained injuries after she jumped from the second floor at the University of Lahore on Monday, police said.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran told Dawn that the student was originally from Narowal, adding that her parents had been asked to come to Lahore.
“She jumped from the second floor of the pharmacy department,” the DIG said, adding that for now, the incident appeared to be “a suicide attempt”.
However, he continued, police had yet to ascertain the reason behind the incident.
The official further stated that the student’s legs had been fractured, and she had been hospitalised. “Her condition is serious, but there is no severe head injury,” DIG Kamran added.
The director of emergency at Lahore General Hospital, Dr Yahya Sultan, also told Dawn that the girl was brought to the facility in a “serious condition” and she had sustained a minor head injury.
“There are profound chest injuries on the right side,” he said.
DIG Kamran said that according to the initial information collected thus far, it was discovered that the student was talking to someone on the phone around half an hour before the incident, but no further details were available yet.
“She jumped during the call,” he said.
The DIG said police had taken the girl’s mobile phone into custody, which was locked. “We are waiting for her medical treatment to end, following which we will ask her for her password so that the phone can be checked. Otherwise, we will get an analysis conducted,” he added.
The official said an investigation of the incident was under way and nothing could be said for certain at this point.
A first information report of the incident has not been filed so far.
DIG Kamran said it was up to the girl’s parents whether they wanted to file a complaint.
Meanwhile, the University of Lahore decided to suspend its on-campus classes.
A notice issued by the office of the varsity’s registrar on Monday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “It is hereby notified for the information of all concerned that, in order to secure the campus buildings and ensure the safety and well-being of students, all on-campus teaching activities of the University of Lahore shall remain suspended.
“Accordingly, all classes scheduled today are called off and all academic activities will be shifted to online mode from Tuesday, January 6, 2025 until further orders,“ it added.
DIG Kamran told Dawn that police had spoken with the university’s administration, which had decided to suspend on-campus classes.
He said the administration had conveyed to the police that they were also considering installing fences on every floor or deploying staff to ensure safety and prevent the occurrence of such incidents.
Today’s incident comes less than three weeks after a 22-year-old Pharm-D student died after jumping from the fourth floor of the University of Lahore’s building on December 19 last year.
Family and classmates claimed that the student faced humiliation after low attendance in one subject. They said his entire semester could have been wasted despite the payment of his fee.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0516552338009d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965268/greenland-says-no-more-fantasies-about-annexation-after-trump-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Greenland says ‘no more fantasies about annexation’ after Trump remarks</strong></a><br><p>Greenland’s leader declared “enough is enough”, and Denmark’s allies in Europe affirmed that the Arctic island’s future must be determined by its people, rebuffing renewed remarks by US President Donald Trump about acquiring the vast territory.
Trump spoke a day after the US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning raid, with Trump stating that Washington intended to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country. The US operation rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview: “We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.”
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.
“Threats, pressure, and talk of annexation have no place between friends,” Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook late on Sunday.
“Enough is enough. […] No more fantasies about annexation.”



On December 21, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. Landry has publicly expressed support for incorporating Greenland into the US.
Greenland’s strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site in the US ballistic missile defence system. The island’s significant mineral resources also align with Washington’s ambition to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.
Support for Denmark and Greenland came swiftly from Nordic and Baltic leaders following Trump’s latest remarks.
President Alexander Stubb of Finland posted on X late on Sunday: “No one decides for Greenland and Denmark but Greenland and Denmark themselves. Our Nordic friend Denmark and Statsministeriet (Prime Minister’s Office) have our full support.”







France also expressed solidarity, saying Greenland belonged to the people of Greenland. President Emmanuel Macron said last June during a visit to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, that the island was threatened by “predatory ambition”.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that US comments about needing to take over Greenland made “absolutely no sense”.
Protection of Greenland will be discussed within Nato if needed: Germany
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that Greenland belonged to Denmark and that the Nato alliance could discuss strengthening its protection if necessary.
Wadephul was speaking after US President Donald Trump made renewed threats to take over Greenland.
Speaking to reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro’s removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country’s future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the US would run the country.
On Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part of Denmark.
“And since Denmark is a member of Nato, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to Nato defence,” he said.
“And if there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.”
He did not elaborate on the nature of those discussions.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05100722be6329f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965240/pakistan-china-call-for-more-visible-verifiable-actions-to-eliminate-terrorist-groups-based-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China call for more ‘visible, verifiable’ actions to eliminate terrorist groups based in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China issued a joint communique on Monday calling for more “visible and verifiable” actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, and prevent them from using Kabul’s territory for militancy against any other country.
The joint statement came after the conclusion of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.







“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.
“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,” it added.
The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.
“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.
“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.
“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.
Both countries also expressed the readiness to continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue and the China-Bangladesh-Pakistan cooperation mechanism to “deliver new outcomes”.
Pak-China agree to enhance communication
According to the communique, during the dialogue in Beijing, the two sides engaged in a “thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including strategic and political cooperation, as well as cooperation on defence and security, economy, trade, investment, and cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.
Pakistan and China “agreed to enhance strategic communication, deepen strategic mutual trust, jointly safeguard their common interests, promote the economic and social development of the two countries,” it said.
They also called for the safeguarding and advancing “peace, development and prosperity of the region and beyond”.
Pakistan and China also marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with the launch of commemorative activities, the communique said.
It added that the anniversary was an “opportunity to consolidate China-Pakistan friendship and expand new areas of cooperation”.
Pakistan also congratulated China on the “successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan” under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Pakistan also lauded China for its “people-centred development philosophy”, the communique said, adding that Pakistan also believed that the “Chinese path to modernisation provided a new option and practical solution for other developing countries to achieve independent development”.
China also commended Pakistani leadership on “leading the country to achieve macroeconomic stability and to lay a solid foundation for national economic growth centred on Pakistan’s National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029) (URAAN Pakistan) and for its people to share the fruits of development and prosperity”.
Pakistan also reiterated its “firm commitment” to the one-China principle, stating that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China’s territory”, the communique said.
“Pakistan firmly supports every effort of China to achieve national reunification, and opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence‘ and any attempt to create ’two Chinas’ or ’one China, one Taiwan,” it added.
It also added that “Pakistan firmly supports China on the issues concerning Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea”.
The statement further added that China also “reiterated its steadfast support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”.
China also renewed its commitment to supporting Pakistan in “pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions and achieving economic prosperity”.
The country also vowed to support “Pakistan in firmly combating terrorism and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs”.
‘Upgraded version of CPEC’
The communique further said that the two sides also reached an agreement to “build an upgraded version 2.0” of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
They agreed to “further align their development plans and priorities”, the statement said.
According to the communique, the two nations outlined three key sectors: industry, agriculture, and mining.
They also called for pushing for the “building and operation of the Gwadar Port, smooth passage of the Karakoram Highway, and enhancing Pakistan’s capacity for sustainable development”.
The two nations pledged to “deepen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, information technology, science and technology, cybersecurity, technical and vocational training and education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges”.
During the course of the dialogue, it was also decided that the two countries will “take the year-round opening of the Khunjerab Pass as an opportunity to deepen two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges”.
They also agreed to “welcome third-party participation in CPEC cooperation that conforms with the modalities set by China and Pakistan”, the statement said.
The two countries also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking sectors, including extending mutual support at regional and international multilateral financial forums, the communique added.
“Pakistan appreciated China for providing support for its fiscal and financial sectors,” it said.
On their cooperation in the field of space, the two sides “expressed satisfaction at their expanding space cooperation and for the expected early entrance of Pakistani astronauts into the China Space Station”.
“They agreed to explore space in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner for greater economic and social development and prosperity,” the statement said.
In October, China announced it was going to arrange for a Pakistani astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions.
Agree to uphold UN Charter, oppose unilateral actions
The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment towards upholding UN principles and international law, vowing to “oppose the plotted resurgence of fascism and militarism”.
They expressed “support for the postwar international order underpinned by international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation and other principles of international law for the maintenance of world peace and security, and protect historical truth and international justice”.
They also underscored the significance of a South Asian “regional order underpinned by the UN Charter, international law, and the basic norms governing international relations”.
Pakistan and China also reiterated their “opposition to any unilateral actions, and reaffirmed the significance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the necessity of resolving all outstanding disputes through dialogue and consultation”.
During the dialogue, Pakistan informed China of the latest developments in occupied Kashmir, with the latter reiterating that the dispute should be resolved “properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.
According to the communique, the two countries “expressed readiness to conduct trans-boundary water resources cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit”.
They also “emphasised the imperative of fulfilling international legal obligations”.
The statement added that the “significance of the maintenance of international and regional security and stability was reiterated”.
Pakistan and China also “reaffirmed their readiness to further enhance cooperation under the frameworks of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilisation Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative”.
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment towards making the “global governance system more just and equitable, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for humanity”.
“Pakistan highly commended China’s efforts to safeguard developing countries’ right to sustainable development,” the joint communique said.
“The two sides expressed satisfaction over their cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),” the statement read.
On that note, they agreed to “deepen coordination and collaboration to safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice”.
Pakistan and China also renewed their “commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, their support for multilateralism and free trade, and their opposition to hegemonism, bullying behaviours violating national sovereignty of other countries, the forming of ‘small circles’ and bloc confrontation”.
The communique said that China commended Pakistan on its “outstanding performance during its UN Security Council presidency”.
It also voiced “full support for Pakistan to work as the rotating president of the SCO from 2026 to 2027”, the statement said.
Reiterate support for Palestinian state
On the issue of Palestine, Pakistan and China called for an “unconditional, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” and stressed the significance of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.
The two countries called for the “implementation of the two-state solution with the establishment of an independent state of Palestine”.
“The two sides also expressed their concern at the situation in the occupied West Bank, and urged the need for urgently addressing it,” the communique said.
It added that Pakistan and China also “expressed willingness to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts for peace and stability in the Middle East”.
During the meeting, Dar thanked his counterpart for the “warm hospitality accorded to him and his delegation”.
“The two sides agreed to hold the next round of Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Islamabad next year on mutually convenient dates,” the communique concluded.
Dar meets mining delegation, visits embassy
During his visit to Beijing, the foreign minister also met with a delegation from China Minmetals Corporation (MCC) led by its Vice President Xu Jiqing, the FO said on Monday.
The FO said that the pair “held productive discussions on MCC’s ongoing and upcoming projects in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, Dar reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong support for MCC in advancing mining investment and promoting value-added industrial development”.







Separately, Dar also met the Chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), Chen Xiaodong, where the pair “reviewed socio-economic development cooperation”.
During the meeting, they “lauded CIDCA’s contributions to Pakistan’s development”.
The pair also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation in education, space, livelihoods, IT, and disaster relief, including flagship initiatives to mark the 75th anniversary of Pakistan–China diplomatic relations.

Panjgur Assistant Commissioner Amir Jan said the IED was planted in a motorbike and added that three of the injured are in serious condition. “Two children are also among the injured.“
According to local police officials, a Frontier Corps vehicle, which was the probable target, escaped the attack and all personnel were safe.
A senior official of the local administration, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the motorbike laden with the IED was parked near a pushcart in the main bazaar.
Another police official elaborated that the blast appeared to have been carried out through remote control.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.

The demonstrations began last Sunday in Tehran when shopkeepers staged a strike over high prices and economic stagnation, but they have since spread to other regions and expanded to include political demands.
“I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency.
He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”.
Protests have taken place in 25 out of Iran’s 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 45 different cities, most of them small or medium-sized and concentrated in the west, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports.
At least 12 people have been killed since December 30 in localised clashes, including members of the security forces, according to a tally based on official announcements, and there have been media reports of episodes of property damage in the west.

 

The Fars news agency said on Monday that “the trend observed on Sunday night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geographic reach compared to previous nights”.
Local media’s accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.
The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, while double-digit inflation has been undermining Iranians’ purchasing power for years.
The rial was depreciating again on Monday against the greenback after strengthening in recent days, according to the informal black-market rate, which stands at around 1.4 million rials, compared with about 770,000 a year earlier.

 

Publicly, officials have struck a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while vowing to take a hard line against any chaos and destabilisation.</p><small>2026-01-05 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05162241750d61d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965262/mustafa-amir-murder-case-main-suspect-gets-bail-in-illegal-call-centre-case' target='_blank'><strong>Mustafa Amir murder case: Main suspect gets bail in illegal call centre case</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate in Karachi on Monday granted post-arrest bail to Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect in the Mustafa Amir murder case, in a case involving an illegal call centre and credit card data theft.
Amir, 23, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his friends — Armaghan and Sheraz — in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6, 2025. According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
A final charge sheet against Armaghan in the murder case was filed in August. Besides multiple other cases, Armaghan had also been implicated in the data theft case in a first information report (FIR) registered with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on April 16, 2025.
Judicial magistrate (South) took up Armaghan’s bail plea today. Advocate Khurram Abbas appeared as his defence counsel and informed the court that the investigation against the suspect had been completed in 2025.
“Not a single shred of evidence was presented against the suspect. Neither is there any complaint nor any private witness against the suspect,” the lawyer argued.
Subsequently, the magistrate approved Armaghan’s bail plea against surety bonds worth Rs100,000.

 

However, Armaghan will remain in jail as multiple cases against him are still pending in court. Besides the murder case, FIRs against Armaghan had also been filed over injuring policemen during a February shoot-out that resulted in his arrest, recovery of imported illegal weapons and money laundering.
In its FIR, the FIA had claimed that Armaghan was allegedly operating an “illegal call centre” in Karachi’s DHA. The FIA further alleged that the call centre was used for harassing people, engaging in fraudulent practices, identity impersonation, cheating, spoofing, phishing, and extortion.
It added that the employees of the said call centre were trained to impersonate officials from international agencies to extract sensitive information such as names, debit or credit details and social security numbers.
The FIA claimed that illegal transactions were carried out on the instructions of Armaghan alias Alex Boss.
Regarding the modus operandi, the agency stated that the suspect obtained financial information and processed it through the website www.oet.com to verify its authenticity. The credit cards were typically charged without any service being rendered, the FIA added.
In July 2025, the investigating officer (IO) of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed a judicial magistrate that Armaghan had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after Amir’s murder.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05165149e2f2159.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/opposition-leaders-appointment-pti-chief-whip-submits-documents-pertaining-to-omar-ayubs-cases-to-na-speaker' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition leader’s appointment: PTI chief whip submits documents pertaining to Omar Ayub’s cases to NA speaker</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, shared with National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday documents pertaining to the withdrawal of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub and again demanded Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairperson Mehmood Khan Achakzai’s appointment as the opposition leader.
The development comes around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a letter to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.







According to a post on the NA’s X account, Dogar presented the documents to Sadiq today, and the two also exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader.
Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai be appointed as the opposition leader, the post said, adding that Ayaz gave the assurance that “everything will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”.
The statement further quoted Ayaz as saying that he would share information with the house on the matter at the next NA session.
“The process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated afresh,” he said, adding that the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader were clear.
The post of the opposition leader in the NA has been vacant since the disqualification in August last year by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his conviction in the May 9 cases.
The same month, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had nominated Achakzai for the post of opposition leader and despite the PTI‘s insistence for his appointment, his notification remains pending.
Meanwhile, Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC). But, he withdrew his plea in October last year.
For his part, Sadiq had maintained regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.
“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.
‘No formal contact for talks’
Earlier today, NA Speaker Sadiq said that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.
He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.
“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.
Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.
On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.







“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.
He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.

 

However, the PTI later said that it would not engage in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had stated that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.
Bangladesh visit
The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the funeral of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had shaken hands during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.
“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.
He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.
Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.
He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.
He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05165036a578729.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965266/indias-top-court-denies-bail-to-muslim-student-leader-umar-khalid' target='_blank'><strong>India’s top court denies bail to Muslim student leader Umar Khalid</strong></a><br><p>India’s Supreme Court denied bail on Monday for former student leader Umar Khalid, who has been detained for more than five years on charges of conspiracy to trigger deadly riots.
Khalid, 38, was arrested in September 2020 under a sweeping anti-terrorism law and has remained in custody since, aside from brief releases to attend family weddings.
His case has become a touchstone for critics who say India’s more than 200 million Muslims face discriminatory treatment in the Hindu-majority nation.
Khalid was detained after the February 2020 sectarian riots in Delhi when 53 people were killed — mostly Muslims, but also several Hindus.
The Supreme Court in New Delhi dismissed his appeal for bail, saying that “prolonged incarceration” was not grounds to grant him release.

 

It also denied bail on the same grounds to another student activist, Sharjeel Imam.
But it approved bail for five others in the same case.
Khalid, a former student at Delhi’s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, was charged with rioting with a deadly weapon, as well as attempted murder, sedition and causing enmity between different groups.
He denies all charges.
Police also accused Khalid of delivering “provocative speeches” ahead of the riots.
In 2022, he published an open letter saying that “we can be kept in jail for years, without those framing us needing to prove anything”.
His partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, has said that Khalid “became the victim of the injustice that he always fought against”.
Amnesty International and six other rights groups issued a statement in September calling for the release of Khalid.
“Khalid’s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India, as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,” Amnesty said in a statement to mark Khalid’s fifth year in prison.

 

Khalid’s arrest came months after protests against India’s contentious Citizen Amendment Act (CAA).
The 2019 law makes it easier for persecuted religious minorities from three neighbouring countries to obtain citizenship, but not if they are Muslim.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/051437581930b45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259/bangladesh-orders-indefinite-ban-on-ipl-telecast-after-mustafizur-rahman-row' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh orders indefinite ban on IPL telecast after Mustafizur Rahman row</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh government on Monday ordered an indefinite ban on the telecast and promotion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) following the controversy surrounding the removal of Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad, The Daily Star reported.
The development comes after KKR said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.
On Sunday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said after an emergency meeting that it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.
A statement from the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it had “noted that no reason was communicated for the decision behind Mustafizur Rahman’s exclusion [from the IPL]” and that the development had “caused distress among the people of Bangladesh”, Daily Star reported.
“In this context, a decision has been taken regarding the broadcast of IPL matches,” the statement said, adding that the decision had been taken “in public interest”.
It was signed by the ministry’s assistant secretary Firoz Khan.
“There is no logical reason for this decision of the Indian Cricket Board and such a decision has distressed, shocked and angered the people of Bangladesh,” the government statement further said, according to India Today.
“A request has been made to stop the promotion/broadcast of all games and events of the Indian Premier League (IPL) until further orders,” the statement added. TV channels and streaming platforms have broadcast the IPL in Bangladesh since its inception in 2008, according to ESPN Cricinfo.
This is also the first time that the Bangladesh government has banned the telecast of an international cricket tournament, anywhere in the world.
BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“
Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.
But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.
Worsened relations between India, Bangladesh
The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.
Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.
Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.
On Sunday, cricket news site Cricbuzz reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.
The ICC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p><small>2026-01-05 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05140014cfbaffd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965250/kp-cm-sohail-afridi-calls-on-lawyers-to-stand-up-for-independence-of-judiciary' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi calls on lawyers to stand up for independence of judiciary</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday called on lawyers in Islamabad to stand up for an independent judiciary as he continued his efforts to rally support for the PTI’s street movement.
The KP CM made the remarks while addressing the legal fraternity at an event organised by the Islamabad Bar Association. After completing a three-day visit to Lahore, Afridi has announced Karachi as his next destination.
“If you do not stand up for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law and for an independent judiciary, then future generations will spit on us and you as well,” Afridi said.
He urged them to announce a lawyers’ movement, adding that the youth will support them. “Long live resistance,” the chief minister said.



“You must support the PTI founder [Imran Khan] against oppression and barbarity. Whose conscience is even one per cent alive will stand against the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, as well as unfair trials — whether of journalists or politicians — and will demand the release of all political workers who are wrongfully in jail,” Afridi said.
CM Afridi also stressed that Imran did not seek his release, but rather a fair trial. “A convicted person was received at the airport,” the PTI leader said, apparently referring to ex-premier Nawaz Sharif landing in Islamabad after he returned to Pakistan in October 2023.
During his address, Afridi also praised Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who was among the audience.
“Imaan Mazari has created a new history of resistance. The youth receive encouragement from her,“ Afridi said. He also mentioned that some journalists were recently sentenced after their “trials in absentia”.
“Arshad Sharif had to leave his country to save his life because he was not getting justice and security here, but he was not spared even abroad,” the KP CM said, referring to the journalist being shot dead in Kenya on Oct 23, 2022.
Afridi cautioned the lawyers that while the PTI was facing “oppression and fascism today”, it could be their turn tomorrow. “You will not be able to tolerate what the PTI has,“ he said.
Afridi once again lamented that he was repeatedly being denied a meeting with Imran, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
“Three judges [of the IHC] issued orders for [my] meeting with the PTI founder, but the Adiala jail’s superintendent threw that directive in the trash,” the KP CM said.
He said that Imran was “fighting our war in jail”, adding that “those who took cars from the Toshakhana were the rulers and the person who took items legally was in prison“.
“They have incapacitated you all,” the chief minister said.
CM Afridi further said that “people from all schools of thought” in KP believed that a military operation was not the solution to rising militancy in the province.
“But there are still preparations for an operation. This is not a functioning system but hooliganism,” the chief minister said.</p><small>2026-01-05 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0512242832179ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965246/we-can-revise-tariffs-very-quickly-trump-warns-of-higher-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>‘We can revise tariffs very quickly’: Trump warns of higher tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</strong></a><br><p>The United States could raise tariffs on India if New Delhi does not meet Washington’s demand to curb purchases of Russian oil, US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday.
“They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.







India’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The US doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent last year as punishment for its heavy buying of Russian oil. Despite the hefty tariffs, India’s exports to the US leapt in November.
Encouraged by the improved trade data, Indian officials have maintained a firm stance against US trade demands, signalling limited flexibility in areas such as agricultural imports, while data shows India’s oil purchases from Russia have declined.
India is asking refiners for weekly disclosures of Russian and US oil purchases, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week, adding that they expect Russian crude imports to dip below 1 million barrels per day as New Delhi seeks to clinch a trade deal with Washington.
Modi has spoken to Trump at least three times over the phone since he imposed tariffs, but the discussions remain inconclusive.

Pakistan is the world’s 5th largest remittance destination. The question is how much further it can climb.
Remittance flows are Pakistan’s most reliable source of hard dollars. Last year alone, we received more than $38 billion, the highest in our history. In many years, these flows have been steadier than exports, foreign direct investment, or debt inflows combined. As imports continue to gnaw at dollar reserves, these inflows are even more critical.
So how do we increase remittance flows?
By acting on a simple fact: people send more when it is easier and cheaper.

Remittances could be converted into dollar stablecoins, bridged into the Pakistani CBDC’s network, exchanged at market rates, and redeemed into rupees via Raast

One promising way is to use crypto-based settlement technology as the rails or plumbing. It’s like upgrading from dial-up internet to broadband: transfers become near-instant, run 24/7, and fees can fall below one per cent. More of each dollar arrives home.
The main way to enable all this is through stablecoins.
Stablecoin 101
A stablecoin is a crypto token where, for every stablecoin that exists, there is $1 deposited in a dedicated bank account tied to that token. When money goes into that account, more tokens are issued or “minted”. When money goes out, as many tokens are deleted or “burned”. In short, the tokens track the fiat backing one-to-one.
Although dollar variants are most popular, stablecoins can be backed by other currencies too: dirhams, euros, and potentially rupees.
Note that stablecoins do not increase the money supply. They are only a different format of money, with two added properties: programmability (rules can be coded into it) and 24/7 availability (always-on).
Those properties make stablecoins highly effective for speeding up remittances.
Two paths, and a practical middle
Overall, there are three ways to upgrade remittances through stablecoins.
At one end is the “simplest” approach. Imagine a Pakistani expat sends dollar-based stablecoins to Pakistan. Those stablecoins are converted into fiat dollars and settled into a Pakistani bank’s nostro account. To make the payment instant, the recipient is paid out from a pre-funded rupee account in Pakistan, while dollar settlement catches up in the background.

 

This works, but has downsides. It serves only people sending remittances in crypto. It also keeps the old pre-funding model alive, meaning trapped capital and exposure to foreign exchange swings.
Another way to upgrade remittances is via a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).
Once a CBDC is launched, this is how the plumbing works: each remittance is converted into dollar stablecoins, bridged into the Pakistani CBDC’s network, exchanged into the CBDC at market rates, and redeemed into rupees via Raast. Accumulated dollar stablecoins are also periodically unwound back into fiat, repatriating hard dollars for our reserves.
But a CBDC requires years of build-out: new infrastructure, wallets, governance, security, upgrades, and mass adoption. It’s an exercise in building and maintaining a sovereign digital financial ecosystem from scratch. Countries spend years and remain in pilots.
Thus, it is wiser to pursue a faster path, alongside longer-term CBDC ambitions.
The most efficient way to upgrade inward remittances is to use established blockchain settlement rails and pilot a rupee-backed token on them. It can start as a permissioned, custodial instrument limited to licensed participants.
To be sure, this is much smaller than launching a CBDC. It can be tested quickly and cheaply. It can interoperate with the American dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, dirham, or pound stablecoins from day one, boosting compatibility with global money flows.
What about control?
Stablecoins are often assumed to be hard to control. But in practice, they can be tightly controlled because they are programmable.
For the narrow use-case of inward remittances, a PKR-backed token need not be an open retail instrument. The safest way is a fully custodial token designed for one purpose: regulated remittance settlement.
Key guard rails can be enabled from the start: per-user limits, strict whitelisting of institutions, strong anti-money laundering and counter-financing terrorism checks at entry and exit, the ability to freeze or claw back suspicious funds, and emergency pause mechanisms (for example, during exchange-rate volatility).
Next steps
A “crawl, walk, run” approach is best. The first step can be a sandbox pilot focused on a single high-profile corridor, such as New York to Pakistan. We can stress-test inward remittances from New York over six to 18 months. Troubleshoot teething pains along the way. Scale gradually as operational stability is established.
Once integrated, this system will ultimately become the long-lived financial plumbing for Pakistan. So as the country explores stablecoin-based remittances, it must choose technology partners wisely.
Partners should be vetted for resilience to geopolitics and sanctions, and for a strong record of global regulatory compliance. This is of strategic consequence in an increasingly divided world.
For immediate gains at modest cost, stablecoin rails are the most practical way to modernise the country’s remittance machinery. They let us test quickly, gather evidence, and upgrade infrastructure without committing billions or waiting years.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 5th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-05 03:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695ada09f1cc5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965172/agriculture-the-hidden-cost-of-trade-shocks' target='_blank'><strong>Agriculture: The hidden cost of trade shocks</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s direct trade with Afghanistan, as well as transit trade through it to Central Asian states, has been suspended since mid-October, when the Afghan border was closed due to security concerns. As a result, Pakistan’s exports — particularly agricultural commodities — continue to be badly affected.
Several analysts and trade experts appearing on television talk shows over the past three months have repeatedly argued that the border closure would reduce the country’s overall exports by around $1.51 billion, which constitutes barely 4.6 per cent of Pakistan’s total exports, according to 2024 data from the International Trade Centre. They further contend that this loss — or even more — could be offset by rising remittances, especially given that nearly 700,000 Pakistanis went abroad for employment during 2025 alone.
However, a narrow focus on export percentages and remittance inflows obscures the larger reality of the agriculture sector. Under the famous supply and demand framework, the short-run inelastic supply concept has come into play here. It is worth noting that the supply of perishable agricultural commodities is highly inelastic; therefore, even small disruptions in demand — just 5–10pc — can create glut-like conditions in the domestic market, which may lead to sharp price declines that cause immense losses for farmers.
For instance, citrus exports to Afghanistan and the Central Asian states amount to around 170,000 tonnes (FY25), hardly 7.5pc of the total production of 2.3 million tonnes. Yet, the suspension of exports has slashed farm-gate citrus prices by 50–80pc. Similarly, Pakistan exports about 500,000 tonnes of potatoes (FY25) to these markets, just 5.5pc of total output — but the border closure has triggered a market crash. As a result, farmers are now receiving barely one-third of last year’s prices.

The suspension of exports has slashed farm-gate citrus prices by 50–80pc, while the inability to export potatoes is triggering a market crash

This is precisely what is happening to all fruits and vegetables that previously had significant exports to Afghanistan and the Central Asian states. If the situation persists, several other crops are likely to be impacted in the coming months. The real issue is not the decline in exports — which may be offset by remittances — but the massive losses farmers are incurring due to collapsing prices.
Take the case of potatoes alone. Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan and Central Asian states are worth barely $90m (FY25), yet their suspension has inflicted losses of at least Rs100,000 per acre on farmers, amounting to roughly $350m for 950,000 acres of crop. Such heavy losses will cripple farmers financially and reduce their ability to invest in subsequent crops.
This low investment will, in turn, depress yields, lower overall agricultural output, and put the country’s long-term food security at risk. This concern has become even more critical as farmers of several crops have already incurred losses in 2025 due to floods, climate change-induced yield reductions, rising input costs, and depressed prices of wheat, cotton, sugarcane, sesame, and other crops.
Moreover, the adverse effects of eroded farmers’ financial capacity are not confined to the agriculture sector alone; these losses will generate negative spillover effects that impair the performance of both manufacturing (durables and consumables) and services sectors.
Rightfully, national security must remain the government’s paramount priority and must never be compromised, especially when our forces are making daily sacrifices to protect the nation. Yet, strangely, both federal and provincial governments are watching this situation passively while farmers suffer devastating losses, crop after crop. Such a hands-off approach is indefensible by any standard.
Drawing lessons from global best practices — where countries swiftly shield farmers during rare disruptions such as pandemics, super floods, or geopolitical shocks — the federal and provincial governments must act to avert a deepening agricultural crisis. Border closure may prove temporary, but its damage to farm incomes and overall economic momentum could be profound and long-lasting, which will exacerbate poverty, currently standing at 44pc.
At a minimum, three targeted and immediate interventions are essential to protect vulnerable farmers.
First, potatoes represent the largest and hardest-hit crop. The federal government should incentivise potato exporters and enterprises engaged in potato value-addition by offering interest-free loans strictly for procuring and storing potatoes in cold storage facilities during the peak harvest window (20 January–1 March) for their year-round consumption. Procuring approximately 1m tonnes — well below Pakistan’s existing storage capacity of approximately 3m tonnes — would be sufficient to stabilise the market.
Second, vegetable cultivation — particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) — is largely dominated by smallholder farmers, whose exports to Afghanistan have been badly affected. For the upcoming cropping season, provincial governments should support these farmers by providing essential inputs such as fertilisers and quality seeds, similar to the assistance recently extended by the Sindh Government to wheat farmers under the Wheat Growers Support Policy.
Third, provincial governments should map the crops most vulnerable to the border closure and guide farmers, through provincial agricultural extension services and the Ministry of Commerce, to switch to alternatives that Pakistan currently imports in large quantities — such as chickpeas, oilseeds, and pulses — or to crops with strong export potential in existing non-Afghan markets.

Yet as the country accelerates its digital transformation, 2026 is shaping up to be a decisive year in which policy visions must confront hard operational realities.
A dual pressure — an epidemic of financial scams and a new wave of mandatory cybersecurity regulations — is forcing a hard turn from aspiration to implementation.
The scale of digital risk is no longer theoretical. According to the Global State of Scams Report 2025, Pakistan loses an estimated $9 billion annually to financial and digital scams, a figure equivalent to roughly 2.5 per cent of GDP and larger than the value of the recent $7 billion IMF loan programme. This “silent economic haemorrhage” stems from increasingly sophisticated fraud that exploits digital payment systems, social media, and telecom networks.
Fraudsters are using AI-polished phishing, fake investment platforms and scams impersonating banks, couriers and service providers, exacting a heavy toll on citizens and businesses alike. Some reports of mega frauds find space in the main daily newspapers, but details of many other incidents keep circulating on social media.

Given the rise in AI adoption and resulting misuse, the country has begun laying a strategic foundation for its digital future that involves setting up training centres and starting a national fund

Authorities have responded, launching major crackdowns such as Operation Grey, which led to hundreds of arrests, including foreign nationals. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) led this operation, with support from the Federal Investigation Authority and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.

 

But these efforts also underscore a critical vulnerability: rapid digital adoption has far outpaced the development of robust cyber governance and public awareness.
In direct response to the accelerating pace of digitisation and AI adoption, Pakistan’s regulatory landscape is undergoing its most significant transformation to date. The year 2026 marks a clear shift away from voluntary or advisory frameworks toward mandatory, legally enforceable requirements. For businesses operating across sectors, regulatory compliance is no longer a matter of best practice or reputational comfort; it is rapidly becoming a basic condition for continued operation and market access.
A central pillar of this shift is the introduction of the Pakistan Security Standards (PSS), which mandate compulsory adoption across all public and private sector information technology and cryptographic systems. Full compliance is required by June 1, 2028 (for defence-sector entities, the deadline was December 31, 2025). The implications for industry are substantial: future hardware and software procurement must explicitly specify PSS-compliant products and systems, and non-compliance risks operational disruption, regulatory sanctions and exclusion from government contracts.
Alongside the PSS, regulators are rolling out increasingly stringent sector-specific requirements. The State Bank of Pakistan’s Technology Risk Management frameworks now demand demonstrable technical and governance controls, formal board-level oversight of cyber risk, and integration of cyber resilience into overall operational resilience planning. These measures reflect a clear expectation that cyber risk be treated as a core enterprise risk, not a purely technical concern.
The telecommunications sector is also facing far-reaching change under the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s CTDISR-2025 framework, which mandates data localisation, 24-hour reporting of cybersecurity incidents, clear accountability through designated chief information security officers, and a move toward Zero Trust architectures.
Meanwhile, the anticipated Personal Data Protection Bill — once enacted — is expected to introduce strict data localisation rules and a 72-hour breach notification mandate, further raising the compliance bar for organisations that collect, process or store personal data within Pakistan.
As is evident from the above discussion, Pakistan has begun laying a strategic foundation for its digital future. The cabinet-approved National Artificial Intelligence Policy 2025 sets ambitious targets, including training one million people in AI-related skills, establishing national Centres of Excellence, and creating a dedicated National AI Fund. The policy signals intent, but its success will depend on execution and alignment with ground realities.
Early pilot projects already demonstrate how AI can address longstanding development gaps. In taxation, machine-learning models using satellite imagery are being deployed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab to identify previously unassessed properties and expand the tax base.
In environmental governance, AI-driven dashboards enable real-time smog monitoring and enforcement actions in Punjab. Urban planners in Lahore are using telecom data and AI analytics to map informal economic activity and migration patterns, offering insights that were previously invisible to policymakers.
Policymakers must accelerate institutional readiness. The establishment of a National Cybersecurity Authority should be fast-tracked to serve as a central coordinating body, while the National AI Council must prioritise “AI for development,” linking initiatives directly to measurable outcomes such as improved tax compliance, environmental enforcement and climate adaptation.
The public and media also have a critical role to play. Awareness campaigns must evolve from general warnings to practical education, helping citizens recognise AI-generated scams, phishing attempts and the importance of basic safeguards such as multi-factor authentication. Pakistan’s digital ambition cannot be separated from its digital security. The promise of AI and digitisation is real, but it rests on systems that are trusted, resilient and enforceable. As the National AI Conference approaches in early 2026, the national conversation must focus on this integration — harnessing innovation not just for growth but for secure and sustainable growth.
