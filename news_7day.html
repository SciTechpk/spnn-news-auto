The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief becomes the country’s tenth NSA.
A notification issued by the Cabinet Division on Tuesday said that Gen Malik would retain his role as DG ISI, a position he has held since September 2024.
“Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik HI(M), DG (I), shall hold the additional charge of the National Security Adviser, with immediate effect,” the notification stated.
His appointment marks the first time a serving ISI chief will concurrently serve as the NSA.
The posting comes amid heightened tensions with India following the recent Pahalgam attack.
The NSA position had remained vacant since April 2022, when the PTI government was ousted after former Prime Minister Imran Khan lost a vote of confidence. At the time, Moeed Yusuf was serving as the NSA.
The NSA holds the status of a federal minister and serves as the principal adviser to the Prime Minister on matters of national security, foreign policy, and strategic affairs.
The adviser also heads the National Security Division, based at the Prime Minister’s Secretariat in Islamabad.

“There was a deliberate and predetermined sch­e­me to take over IHC,”  feared Muneer A. Malik on behalf of five IHC’s judges who have  petitioned the SC on an inter-se seniority dispute.
The counsel will further dilate upon the aspect when the constitutional bench will meet again on May 7.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a set of petitions of five IHC judges namely Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz have moved a joint petition before the Supreme Court with a plea not to treat the three transferred judges as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
The senior counsel also furnished a 37-page rejoinder to rebut federal gover­nm­ent’s statement before the bench contending that judges were transferred to IHC after six high court judges wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Comm­­ission (SJC) on March 25, 2024 complaining instances of executive’s interference in their judicial functions and attempts to intimate them and conduct their secret surveillance.
 
 

On Wednesday while going through summaries initiated for the transfer of the three judges to IHC from different high courts, the counsel emphasised that these summaries were approved by the Prime Minister as well as the President on the same day. Such mode of approval indicated that there was no independent application of mind on part of the President contrary to what was held in the 2021 Qazi Faez Isa reference case.
To substantiate, the cou­nsel cited the second summary of Jan 30, 2025 rela­ted to the transfer of the Balochistan High Court judge to IHC and pointed out that the summary was approved by the President as well as the Prime Minister on the same day in the same manner.
Referring to the initiation summaries moved by the law secretary to the registrars of the three high courts, the counsel highlighted that these summaries suggest that the representation of judges from Punjab was disproportionate to the total strength of 13 judges in the IHC whereas there was no judge in the IHC from the rural Sindh. The counsel highlighted that these summaries were initiated by the executive and not by the judiciary.
At this, Justice Muha­m­mad Ali Mazhar acknowledged that Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz in the IHC belongs to Sindh, whe­reas Justice Salahuddin Panw­har reminded that the sum­mary has pointed out about the absence of any judge from the rural Sindh.
The counsel, however, reminded the court that Article 200 contemplated “meaningful and purposive” consultative process for the transfer of the judges from one high court to another.
As Justice Mazhar asked him to read out the concurrence of Chief Justice Yahya Afridi for the transfer of judges to the IHC, the counsel said he would not shy away from reading any document and then read out CJP’s approval for the transfer.
The chief justice in his Feb 1, 2025 opinion which was communicated thro­ugh the Supreme Court registrar had stated, “The proposed transfer of the three judges from the high courts of different federating units to IHC completely syncs with the spirit of the federalism as enshrined in the Constitution.”
“It is also in conformity with Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010.” “The thoughtful consideration behind the proposal illustrates resolve in providing an equitable share to linguistic diversity of our country and fair chance of representation to all the federating units in the high court of the common capital of the federation ie IHC.”
“Notice none of these summaries addresses the issue of oath or seniority of the judges to be transferred to IHC,” the counsel emphasised.
But Justice Mazhar rem­inded that we don’t know about summaries regarding opinions of the chief justices of the respective high courts, adding may be CJP had consulted with the respective chief justices through phone calls.
“How CJP could give his consent unless he asked first from chief justices of the respective high courts,” Justice Mazhar observed.
But the counsel emphasised that even in that process the issue of seniority and oath of the transferred judges were side stepped and not touched upon.
“I must reiterate that there must have been some consultation between the CJP and chief justices of the high courts may be on phone giving the fact that CJP had given ample reasons in his concurrence,” observed Justice Mazhar.
The counsel contended that it was after and not before the concurrence, the summary to the Prime Minister said that no fresh oath was needed under Article 200 of the Constitution rather it was for the first time that these issues were addressed.
Justice Mazhar reminded that the summary was referring to Article 200 and it was a matter of interpretation.
The counsel contended that in the process of transfer of judges under Article 200, the judiciary has to be insulated from the executive and ought to have been approved by the Cabinet since the transfer was an act of the executive.

And thereby hangs a tale.
It is, of course, abundantly clear that whoever carried out the massacre at Pahalgam or whoever backed the hideous killing of men by identifying them by their religion, helped the BJP’s divisive agenda under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch.
This was just as true of the killing of 40 troops in Pulwama in 2019. It too was turned into a communal incident.
A division of Indians along Hindu-Muslim lines inevitably helps negate the predominant social reality of caste, not only among Hindus but also for minorities, including Muslims. The killing of 27 men in Pahalgam, predominantly Hindu, by suspected Muslim gunmen, premeditated or not, was quickly turned into a Hindu-Muslim slugfest.

Pahalgam incident seen as helping ‘BJP’s divisive agenda’; quickly turned into ‘Hindu-Muslim slugfest’

“They didn’t ask one’s caste. They asked about their religion.” Pamphlets were put out on TV post haste within moments of the slaughter. The opposition said it was the BJP at work.
This was the currency that works sure footedly for political mileage. In Gujarat, too, almost moments after the burning of the train coach in Godhra in 2002, the Indian government blamed Pakistan before quickly turning its finger at well-to-do Muslims who had recently won the municipal elections in Godhra.
 
 

The “Mian Musharraf” slur continued to describe Gujarat Muslims to extract the last drop of political elixir. But poll-bound Bihar doesn’t respond quite so well to Hindu-Muslim mischief given its more entrenched, centuries-old social reality around caste.
Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav were part of the JP Movement, but belonged to different castes. (Nitish Kumar is the current chief minister of Bihar while Lalu Yadav is a predecessor).
The BJP too needs to move along the caste ruts while seeking to keep the religious pot boiling. When it overlooks the caste angle, its poll arithmetic is likelier challenged. That’s how a Dalit politician from the opposition could defeat the BJP candidate in Ayodhya in the general election last year.
Change of tact
When the full cabinet met under Mr Modi’s watch on Wednesday, the discussion was expected to be entirely on the India-Pakistan tensions. But the headlines were unexpectedly different, suggesting a more politically savvy preparation for Bihar than the Hindu-Muslim cliché.
No timeline was given and polls are due in the politically crucial state in October. The promise was made but the timeline was not provided about when the promise would be honoured. That’s what the newspapers focused on.
“With an eye on the Bihar elections, the Union government on Wednesday announced that a caste census will be conducted along with the decadal census,” The Wire reported.
Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw made the announcement at a cabinet briefing. “However, he did not provide any timeline for when the decadal census or the corresponding caste census will be conducted,” the report said.
The last population census was conducted in 2011 and the 2021 census, which was delayed by the pandemic, is yet to be conducted.
“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) has decided that caste enumeration should be included in the forthcoming census. This demonstrates that our government is committed to the values and interests of society and country.
“Like in the past, when our government had introduced 10pc reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society without causing any stress in any section,” said Vaishnaw.
A nationwide caste census has been a long-standing demand of the opposition parties and was a central issue during the Lok Sabha elections last year. Vaishnaw, while making the announcement on Wednesday, accused the INDIA alliance of using the caste census as a “political tool” and said that Congress governments have “always opposed caste census”.
The cynicism hasn’t abated on the communal front, though. Reports are coming of assaults on and beating up of Muslims in BJP-ruled states.
In Kashmir, where the police are controlled by New Delhi, the people helped arrest the slide. But, as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq noted on Wednesday, Kashmiris are being assaulted elsewhere.
“The physical and verbal assault on Kashmiri shawl vendors in Mussoorie (a hill station in Uttarakhand state), who had to flee when police refused to guarantee their safety, is very disturbing,” he said in a statement. “After large-scale detentions, demolition of homes, and crackdowns inside Kashmir, ordinary citizens, students, and small traders outside of J&K are being attacked and forced to return.”
Mirwaiz slammed the communal upsurge and the killings in Pahalgam in the same breath.
“Being themselves at the receiving end of all forms of violence and subsequent suffering for decades, Kashmiris’ condemnation, empathy, and grief for the victims of the Pahalgam bloodbath is straight from the heart, yet they are being vilified and targeted. I appeal to the people of India not to fall prey to hatred and media propaganda creating mistrust of Kashmiris, and reciprocate in ensuring their safety, as they have always done in times of crisis towards all visitors and tourists.”
Pahalgam has set a political agenda, however, in which caste calculations have surged to the fore. The delicate manoeuvre requires a balance between keeping the India-Pakistan border hot and not losing the state polls.

• Bushra Bibi’s appeal to be taken up by division bench next week
ISLAMABAD: In a major blow to Imran Khan’s hopes for a legal reprieve, the Islamabad High Court has signalled that his appeal against a 14-year sentence in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case won’t be heard this year — effectively keeping the former prime minister in legal limbo throughout 2025.
The report by the IHC registrar office was submitted to a division bench in response to an application, seeking the early hearing of an appeal against the conviction of the PTI founder and his spouse, Bushra Bibi.
As per the report, a criminal appeal filed in January 2025 by Mr Khan, sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, faces indefinite delays, with the court confirming that the case would not be heard during the current calendar year.
 
 

The report cited the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) recommendations, according to which the court had approved a ‘fixation policy’ in February 2023 to expedite pending cases, particularly the appeals filed by convicts. Key measures included designating special benches to resolve cases pending for over five years within two months. However, despite these directives, fresh cases like the 2025 appeal remain trapped in procedural limbo.
As per the report, 279 convict appeals are pending before the court, including 63 about the death sentence and 73 against life imprisonment. In 88 cases, the sentences are more than seven years and while in 55 cases, they are up to seven years.
The subject appeal, filed in January 2025, relates to a convict sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, said the report. Despite its recent filing, the case remains at the “motion stage”, requiring the preparation of paper books (mandatory legal documents) before admission.
“After [the appeal’s] admission, paper books are required to be prepared. So far, its fixation for regular hearing… is not in sight during the calendar year 2025,” the report stated, underscoring the procedural bottleneck. The report explicitly stated that due to existing priorities under the NJPMC’s policy—which focuses on older cases—the appeal of Mr Khan has “no sight of fixation for a regular hearing in 2025”.
Bushra’s appeal next week
During the hearing on the application for early hearing of this matter, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif scheduled Bushra Bibi’s plea for suspension of her seven-year sentence for hearing next week.
Barrister Salman Safdar, representing the petitioners, raised concerns over the court office’s handling of urgent applications. “For the third time, the PTI founder is in jail in this case, and our applications for suspension of sentence remain pending,” he told the bench.
He alleged that the registrar’s office was not processing the relevant applications and was instead prioritising other appeals unjustifiably.
Mr Safdar also emphasised that Bushra Bibi had no direct involvement in the case and requested immediate relief for her. He further urged the bench to fix the case for next Tuesday, citing travel arrangements from Lahore. In response, Acting Chief Justice Dogar remarked, “Let me tell you the day, I will see.”
Commenting on the development, advocate Faisal Hussain said that the delay has exposed the strategy of the PTI’s legal team. He said that the legal team should convince the court that this was not a routine case, and being its peculiar nature, the case should be heard on priority basis.

• India closes airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23; flights to GB cancelled for a few hours
• US Secy of State urges PM Shehbaz to help probe Pahalgam attack; tells New Delhi to work with Pakistan for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at calming tensions in the Subcontinent, fears of a possible military confrontation between India and Pakistan continued to persist on Wednesday.
Following a statement by Information Minister Atta Tarar in the early hours of Wednesday, where he warned of a possible incursion by India within the next 24-36 hours, a number of incidents of Indian aggression heightened tensions.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Pakistani security forces delivered a robust response to India’s unprovoked ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC), destroying an Indian checkpost after late-night aggression on April 29-30.
According to security officials, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked small arms fire in the Kiani and Mandal sectors, which was met with a prompt response.
Sources told APP that the retaliatory strikes destroyed several bunkers, including the Chakputra post in India-held Kashmir.
Reuters also reported that a conversation was held between top army officers from India and Pakistan — without naming them.
 
 

Separately, state media also reported that a “timely and swift response” by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had forced four Indian Rafale jets to retreat.
Quoting security sources, state-run PTV and Radio Pakistan said that the previous night, four Indian Rafales were detected patrolling over the territory of held-Kashmir. A timely and prompt action by the PAF forced them to retreat.
They said that Indian jets became flustered and retreated owing to the PAF’s prompt response.
Airspace concerns
With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
A Notam (Notice to Airmen) issued by New Delhi said the closure would be from April 30 to May 23, 2025.
While PIA flights to the Gilgit and Skardu airports were cancelled on Wednesday, two Airblue flights between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, sources said.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”.
However, the airspace closure ended after a few hours and flight schedules were restored.
One source told Dawn that the airspace closure was carried out due to certain exercises that were being carried out, but it was not clear if this was directly linked to the heightened tensions with India, or due to inclement weather, as rain and wind storms are predicted to sweep across the country’s northern parts from today.
Residents and visitors obviously faced difficulties, as alternative land routes are often less reliable and more time-consuming.
Diplomatic efforts
Meanwhile, the United States has urged both Pakistan and India to take steps to de-escalate tensions in the region.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed the message in separate calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “The secretary spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam. Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”
“The Secretary urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.
A separate readout of Rubio’s conversation with India’s foreign minister said: “[Secretary of State Marco Rubio] encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Rubio.
During the call, the prime minister condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and termed India’s escalatory and provocative behavior as deeply disappointing and worrisome, adding that these would only distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism.
He categorically rejected Indian attempts to link Pakistan to the incident and pointed to his call for a transparent, credible, and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
He urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar contacted leaders from European Union countries, apprising them that Pakistan was open to an transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack.
Mr Dar spoke with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi, briefing them on recent regional developments, including Indian propaganda and illegal unilateral measures against Pakistan, and placing Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of international law.
He also met with US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, who called on the foreign minister in Islamabad. Both leaders exchanged views on recent regional developments, a statement said.
In the meeting, Mr Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Ms Baker conveyed the US desire for de-escalation, adding that Washin­gton would stay engaged with both countries on the evolving situation.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.  Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and Modi granting “operational freedom” to his military.
The US has urged restraint and said it was planning talks with both sides to ease the crisis.
 


A statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office later today said the premier received a telephone call from the US Secretary of State
Marco Rubio in the evening during which Shehbaz “urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.
“Terming India’s escalatory and provocative behaviour as deeply disappointing and worrisome, the prime minister said that India’s provocations would only serve to distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism, particularly from militant groups, including ISKP (Islamic State Khorasan Province), TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) operating from Afghan soil,” it added.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz “categorically rejected” India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, highlighting his call for a transparent, credible and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
It said the prime minister shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Secretary Rubio.
“While condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the PM underscored Pakistan’s leading role in the war on terror and its sacrifice of over 90,000 lives and over $152 billion in economic losses,” the statement read.
“It is most regrettable that India chose to weaponise water, which is a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan,” the premier was quoted as saying, while also stressing that the Indus Waters Treaty had no provision for either side to unilaterally renege from its commitments.
The prime minister added that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute was the “only way to ensure lasting peace in South Asia”.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted to America’s top diplomat that Pakistan and the US had worked together closely over the past seven decades and there was much that both sides could cooperate on, including counter-terrorism and enhanced economic cooperation, particularly in the minerals sector.
“The prime minister also stressed that his government had undertaken major economic reforms over the past year, and consequently, Pakistan was now on the road to economic recovery,” the statement read.
“Secretary of State Rubio thanked the prime minister for the detailed conversation and emphasised the need for both sides to continue working together for peace and stability in South Asia,” it concluded.
The US State Department said in a statement that Rubio also “urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack”.
Rubio also spoke to Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, according to State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam, and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,” she was quoted as saying in a press release. “He also encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar for talks in which they exchanged views on recent regional developments.
Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Baker conveyed the United States’ desire for de-escalation, saying that the country would stay engaged with both Pakistan and India on the evolving situation.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi.
Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including “India’s inflammatory propaganda, illegal unilateral actions, and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a clear violation of international law”, the FO said.
The Omani FM underscored the importance of de-escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy to address issues.
FM Dar appreciated Oman’s efforts for Iran and US talks and conveyed best wishes for their success.
Separately, the Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concern regarding the escalating tension between Pakistan and India and the continued exchange of fire in the border areas.
“The kingdom calls on both countries to reduce tension, avoid escalation, resolve differences through diplomatic means, respect the principles of good neighbourliness and work to achieve stability and peace for the benefit of their peoples and the peoples of the region,” the statement said.
Indian Rafales patrolling above held Kashmir retreat after PAF scrambles jets
Earlier today, Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media reported.
PTV News and Radio Pakistan, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting “patrolling overnight” in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.
“PAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,” Radio Pakistan added.
“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” PTV News reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were “fully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India”.
India also shut its airspace to Pakistani airlines today. The ban on Pakistani aircraft will be from April 30 to May 23, according to a Notice to Airmen issued by the Indian government.
The developments come after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.
In a televised statement issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.
The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
FM Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Today’s incident also comes after the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, official sources said.
The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.
 
 

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the night of April 25.
Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) faced a major fall in intraday trade today.
Pakistan responds to unprovoked Indian firing on LoC
Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV reported that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC in AJK.

“According to security sources, on the night of April 29 and 30, India violated the ceasefire on the LoC. India opened unprovoked fire in the Kayani and Mandal sectors of the LoC,” PTV reported.
India used small arms in the unprovoked firing incident, the state broadcaster added.
“Security sources have confirmed that the Pakistan Army has responded forcefully and given a befitting reply to the Indian Army. The enemy has been silenced with an effective response,” the report said.
The state broadcaster cited reports of the destruction of several Indian bunkers due to the effective response of the Pakistan Army, adding, “Security sources have said that India’s Chakpatra post has been destroyed”.

“Earlier, India had also evacuated the border areas of occupied Kashmir while a crackdown against Muslims is underway,” PTV said, adding that the Pakistan Army was always ready to defend the integrity of the country.
PIA flights from Gilgit, Skardu cancelled
Amid heightened tensions, all Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights operating from the Skardu and Gilgit airports to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad — and vice versa — were cancelled today, according to PIA officials.
However, two Airblue flights destined between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, the sources added.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”. When the passengers reached the airports, they were told that the flights had been cancelled due to security concerns.
 
 

Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 also confirmed the cancellations of a total of 10 PIA flights and departures of the two Airblue flights.
Iqra Khan, a flight inquiry officer at Islamabad International Airport (ISB), also told Dawn.com that PIA cancelled its flights today from the federal capital to Gilgit and vice versa, citing “airspace security” as a reason.
Yesterday, amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities had refuted rumours of a possible closure of airports.
According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled earlier in the week.
The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
Ex-PM Imran says peace is ‘priority’, calls for unity
Amid the ongoing situation, the opposition PTI has proposed a multi-party conference with incarcerated former premier Imran Khan in attendance.
A statement posted on Imran’s X account, which is handled by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”
Recalling the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.
“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi sarkar is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.
 
 

He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a “nuclear flashpoint”.
“I have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,” Imran stressed.
“Needless to say, to win the war against an external enemy, the nation must first be united. It is high time to put a halt to all actions that are further polarising the nation,” he said, adding that the “state’s excessive focus on political victimisation at this critical time is deepening internal divisions”.
“Ironically, Narendra Modi’s aggression has united the people of Pakistan in one voice against Indian hostility,” the ex-premier noted.
India okays ‘operational freedom’ to army amid calls for restraint
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
India’s cabinet committee on security (CCS) — consisting of Modi and his interior, defence, home and finance ministers — is scheduled to meet later today, a government source told Reuters.
This would be the second such meeting of the CCS since the attack on April 22. In its first meeting, the committee had decided to take a series of measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. In the past few days, Dar has also spoken to the foreign ministers of China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary to brief them about Pakistan’s concerns.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday offering “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.
In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the PAF undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.

The sharp increase in imports was a reflection of businesses and consumers stockpiling foreign goods to get ahead of Trump’s sweeping trade levies, which went into effect earlier this month.
All three major Wall Street indices fell on the economic news, with the Nasdaq sliding more than 2 per cent before paring some losses, while oil prices extended their losses.
At a cabinet meeting in Washington, Trump insisted the growth downturn was the legacy of former president Joe Biden’s policies.
“That’s Biden, that’s not Trump,” he said.
Striking a more positive tone, he highlighted the “whopping” 22pc rise in gross domestic investment during the first quarter.
Annual economic growth stayed above 2pc in every year of Biden’s presidency, reaching 2.8pc in 2024.
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the world’s largest economy decreased at an annual rate of 0.3pc in the first quarter, after growing 2.4pc in the final months of 2024, according to Wednesday’s first estimate from the US Commerce Department.
 


This was sharply below the market consensus estimate of 0.4pc growth, according to Briefing.com, and marked the first quarterly contraction since 2022.
The Commerce Department said in a statement that the contraction was in large part down to an “upturn in imports,” aided by a decline in consumer and government spending.
‘A blaring warning’
In a statement, the White House called GDP a “backward-looking indicator.”
“It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “But the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering.”
The GDP figures were published on the 101st day since Trump returned to the White House, along with fresh data showing a slowdown in the US Federal Reserve’s favoured inflation gauge last month.
Trump’s introduction of sweeping tariffs against most countries sparked a selloff in financial markets, sending volatility to levels not seen since the Covid pandemic.
“This decline in GDP is a blaring warning to everyone that Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ failed MAGA experiment is killing our economy,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
‘Greater risk of recession’
Following the dramatic market movements in early April, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause to the higher tariffs for dozens of countries to allow for trade talks, while maintaining a baseline 10pc rate for most countries.
But the administration has also added to the tariffs on China, with the level of duties introduced since January now totalling 145pc — with some sector-specific measures pushing levies even higher.
Beijing has responded with its own steep, targeted measures against US goods.
At the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said China was getting “hammered” by the tariffs, and said he still hoped to make a deal with Beijing, whom he referred to as “the leading candidate for the chief ripper-offer” of America.
“Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” Trump said, arguing that the United States did not need many of the things China produced.
“And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,” he said.
Economists at Wells Fargo wrote in an investor note that the US economy is at a greater risk of recession now than a month ago, “but this 0.3pc contraction in Q1 GDP is not the start of one.”
“It reflects instead the sudden change in trade policy that culminated in the biggest drag from net exports in data going back more than a half-century.”</p><small>2025-04-30 20:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30235341b020514.jpg?r=004531' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907596/rising-militancy-democratic-backsliding-headline-hrcps-human-rights-report' target='_blank'><strong>Rising militancy, democratic backsliding headline HRCP’s human rights report</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Wednesday released its annual State of Human Rights in Pakistan report, which highlighted the country’s deteriorating security situation and democratic backsliding.
Amnesty International, in a statement last year, observed that human rights abuses remained “rampant” in Pakistan. Reports of extra-judicial killings, harassment of human rights defenders, mass arrests, military trials of civilians and violation of freedom of the press were some of the concerns listed by the rights group.
HRCP’s report was launched at an event held at a hotel in Islamabad, where the Commission’s Chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt, Co-chairperson Munizae Jahangir, General Secretary Haris Khalil and members Nasreen Azhar and Hina Jilani addressed the ceremony. The event was attended by journalists, human rights defenders, and transgender rights activists.
Butt highlighted the pressing human rights concerns in the country and called for “national reconciliation to steer Pakistan back on the right track under a democratic framework”.
“The country’s progress depends on upholding human rights, maintaining the rule of law, and improving the overall law and order situation,” he emphasised.
The report identified escalating violence, enforced disappearances, restrictions on freedoms and a breakdown in law and order among key issues Pakistan faced last year.
Butt highlighted the multifaceted crisis, stating, “Human rights have declined alarmingly, leading to widespread mental distress among the population due to inflation, joblessness, and blatant violations of the law.” He pointed out the poor state of law and order, with 1,166 terrorist attacks in 2024, resulting in 2,546 fatalities — a 66 per cent increase in fatalities compared to 2023.
“The state has failed” in its duty to protect its citizens, Butt asserted, citing the “Kurram battlefield” where 250 people were killed and a November incident that claimed 52 lives. Retaliatory violence further exacerbated the situation, leading to the deaths of 80 people, including 24 victims of mob lynchings, according to the report.
The report also shed light on the prevalence of alleged extrajudicial killings, with 108 police encounters reported. Sindh alone accounted for 3,856 encounters, resulting in the deaths of 341 suspects. The HRCP expressed grave concern over this alarming trend.
Another critical issue highlighted was the persistent problem of enforced disappearances. The report detailed instances of individuals being “kidnapped in the nights,” with families denied access and legal provisions to lawyers.
The HRCP emphasised the “profound mental anguish” inflicted upon the families of missing persons, describing it as an “unfortunate situation” with lasting consequences. The report unequivocally stated that “force disappearance perpetrators violate the constitution and international laws,” including the sanctity of private spaces.
The failure to produce arrested individuals in court within 24 hours, often followed by the discovery of their bodies, was strongly condemned by the Commission. The report acknowledged the treatment of growing movements in Balochistan and Sindh, such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).
Political leaders in Gilgit-Baltistan have also faced similar restrictions, with eight reportedly on the Exit Control List.
The HRCP report also raised serious concerns about the shrinking space for freedom of speech and expression. Restrictions on internet connectivity, including the social media platform X, were noted.
The report noted that journalists became increasingly vulnerable, with 162 incidents of attacks and 6 journalists killed by unknown individuals in 2024. The HRCP reminded the state of its constitutional obligation to ensure freedom of expression and freedom of faith.
The “misuse of religious material for blackmail and subsequent arrests by the Federal Investigation Agency,” often stemming from WhatsApp activity, was highlighted as a worrying trend.
Additionally, the 35 incidents targeting the Ahmadiyya community and the desecration of their graves, were documented. Five individuals from the Ahmadiyya community were killed, the report stated citing the Jamaat-i-Ahmadiyya press section.
The report further condemned the rise in mob lynchings based on allegations, citing incidents in Swat, Sargodha, Umerkot and Quetta, where only the intervention of law enforcement prevented further fatalities.
 
 

In 2024 alone, Pakistan witnessed 405 ‘honour’ killings, with 24 allegedly involving police personnel. The increasing prevalence of cybercrimes, with 321 cases reported, mostly in Punjab, also drew the HRCP’s concern.
In conclusion, the HRCP report paints a stark picture of a deteriorating human rights situation in Pakistan, urging the state to take immediate and concrete steps to address these critical issues. The Commission expressed deep concern and called for accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations.</p><small>2025-04-30 19:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/302344301cb38e6.jpg?r=234435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907595/govt-slashes-petrol-high-speed-diesel-prices-by-rs2' target='_blank'><strong>Govt slashes petrol, high-speed diesel prices by Rs2</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Wednesday slashed the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs2 per litre for the next fortnight.
The new prices are Rs252.63 for petrol and Rs256.64 for HSD, according to a press release from the Finance Division.
It did not mention any changes in the prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil.
The decision comes after the government last time burnt the midnight oil to block about a Rs10 per litre reduction in major petroleum products — petrol and diesel — by amending the Petroleum Products (Petroleum Levy) Ordinance 1961.
Government officials had aid the government was already charging the maximum permissible petroleum levy on petrol, HS) and high-octane blending component (HOBC) at Rs70 per litre, which is why a new law was required to keep the prices unchanged at the existing level.
This was done through an amendment to the petroleum levy law and an increase in the levy to Rs80 per litre. The government had decided not to let the petroleum prices decline further, which could trigger increased demand, encourage carbon emissions and cost higher foreign exchange.
In the global market, petrol and HSD prices had dropped by about $6 and $5 per barrel, respectively. The prime minister announced that funds raised through the increase in levy would be spent on road construction in Sindh and Balochistan, apparently to ensure political support from coalition partners.</p><small>2025-04-30 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30190536af61ea9.jpg?r=190648' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907585/ncrc-launches-first-ever-national-report-on-situation-of-children' target='_blank'><strong>NCRC launches first-ever national report on situation of children</strong></a><br><p>The National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) on Wednesday launched its inaugural State of Children in Pakistan Report 2024, the first report of its kind that highlights the situation children face in Pakistan.
In January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said over 22 million children are out of school in Pakistan, emphasising that out of the total figure, a disproportionate number were girls.
The report was launched at a ceremony in Islamabad, attended by Federal Minister for Human Rights Azam Nazeer Tarar, as well as ambassadors, UN representatives, parliamentarians, civil society representatives and child rights advocates.
This first-of-its-kind national report offers a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of the situation of children in Pakistan, covering key areas such as health, education, child protection, participation, and overall welfare.
 
 

Developed to address the persistent gap in consolidated child-focused data, the report draws from a wide range of credible sources to present a clear picture of both progress and challenges.
Key findings from the report highlight persistent issues such as “high numbers of children out of school, malnutrition, child labour, child marriage and the vulnerability of children with disabilities and those from minority communities”. The report also documents progress in immunisation, legal reform and awareness campaigns.
“While there are initiatives to expand access to education and accelerate learning, over 26 million children aged 5 to 16 are still out of school, and less than half of fifth-grade students can read or perform basic arithmetic, the report read.
The report concludes with practical, actionable recommendations to improve outcomes for children, including “investing in early childhood development, strengthening child protection systems and ensuring inclusive education and healthcare services”.
 
 

In her welcome remarks at the launch ceremony, NCRC Chairperson Ayesha Raza Farooq stated, “While segregated and fragmented data has always existed, there has never been a comprehensive national report built exclusively on a child rights-based framework that integrates data across sectors — education, health, child protection, justice, inclusion, and participation.”
She added that the report is designed to address the data gap and serve as a foundational resource for policymakers, researchers, development partners, and advocates.
“Importantly, this report is also timely in view of Pakistan’s upcoming review by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), scheduled for May 2025,” she noted. “We hope the Committee will view this report as a serious and constructive step towards accountability and transparency in fulfilling our obligations under the UNCRC.”
As part of the launch event, a panel discussion titled ‘Realising the Convention on the Rights of [the] Child in Pakistan’ was held, featuring prominent experts and practitioners.
Moderated by NCRC technical adviser Valerie Khan Yousafza, the panel included FIA Additional Director Amna Baig, Sahil executive director Dr Manizeh Bano, Unicef data and analytics manager Achraf Mohamed Mrabet, Justice Project Pakistan Executive Director Sarah Belal and Ministry of Human Rights Director General Muhammad Arshad.
The discussion highlighted critical intersections between policy, data, and action required to fulfil the rights of children in line with the UNCRC.
Baig emphasised the importance of forging strong partnerships with social media platforms to address cybercrime, noting, “Global policies often fail to reflect local realities, particularly in the context of transnational crimes, calling for greater contextualisation of international best practices.”
Belal, meanwhile, called for reworking the juvenile justice framework in the country, stressing that child victims “should not be criminalised and instead should be supported through diversion programs, rehabilitation centres, and an increased number of probation officers”.
Dr Bano spoke of the difficulties faced by civil society organisations in raising awareness around child rights and urged for stronger grassroots engagement, while Mrabet underscored the role of robust data in informing targeted interventions and understanding emerging trends in child welfare.
Meanwhile, Arshad reaffirmed the government’s commitment to using the study’s findings to “shape evidence-based policies and ensure the implementation of the UNCRC across all levels of governance”.
Jo Moir, Development Director at the British High Commission, said,“We are delighted to have supported Pakistan’s first Status of the Children Report supported by the UK’s ‘Aawaz II’ programme.
“The report provides robust evidence that will enable the Government of Pakistan to align its policies and services to respond to the needs of Pakistan’s children and youth more effectively,” she said, adding that the UK remains committed to building a better future for the children of Pakistan.
Speaking at the event, Tarar praised the NCRC’s initiative.
“With over 40% of our population under the age of 18, the wellbeing of our children is not just a moral imperative — it is a national priority,” he stated. “This report will serve as a critical tool in informing policy and guiding reforms.
“I want to reaffirm that the Government of Pakistan is actively working to strengthen child protection systems through enhanced coordination between federal and provincial departments,” Tarar added. “The Ministry of Human Rights is leading the efforts, from the policy level down to the grassroots.
“This report hopes to serve as an all-encompassing guide on the current situation and framework with regards to the future generations of Pakistan and how we can do better by them,” he said.
Last year, Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data revealed that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. Additionally, 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.</p><small>2025-04-30 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30191552300918c.png?r=212448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907576/pakistan-wont-initiate-but-will-respond-strongly-to-any-indian-escalation-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan won’t initiate but will respond strongly to any Indian escalation: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Amid rising tensions with India, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Wednesday that Pakistan will not initiate any escalation but warned of a strong response if provoked.
His statement came during a joint press conference in Islamabad with Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan, where they addressed recent border confrontations with India along the Line of Control (LoC) and accused New Delhi of supporting terrorism inside Pakistan.

What was said:

FM Dar says entire region facing serious threat to peace
Says Pakistan will respond very strong to any escalatory move
Says durable solution for India in focusing on internal problems
Raises questions about Pahalgam incident
FO spokesperson highlights irregularities in Pahalgam FIR registration
DG ISPR pokes holes in Indian narrative
Says India uses illegally held Pakistani prisoners in fake encounters
Says army monitoring the situation very carefully in all terrains
Says Pakistanis will defend territorial integrity and sovereignty at all costs
Says law enforcement agencies fully capable of taking on all threats simultaneously


Ties between Pakistan and India have hit a new low after the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 men, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults on civilians there since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, or The Resistance Front, initially claimed responsibility but later denied involvement.  New Delhi, without evidence, implied Pakistani backing, a claim Islamabad has strongly rejected. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has urged a neutral probe into the incident.
FM Dar said the entire region was facing a serious threat to peace and stability owing to the “politically motivated and highly provocative environment being created by India” in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
“The world leaders have been requesting the exercise of restraint in recent days. I have made it very clear, on behalf of the government and the nation, that Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move. However, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” he said.
“Let me start by reiterating that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. No cause or objective can justify taking the lives of innocent people. This is the national and Islamic policy: killing of a human being is tantamount to killing entire humanity as per the [Holy] Quran and saving a life is tantamount to saving entire humanity.”
The deputy prime minister said the targeting of innocent civilians was sorely condemnable and deplorable, adding that Pakistan had been raising its policy in this regard wherever it was happening in the world.
“We are concerned over the loss of life during the Pahalgam attack. We also extend our condolences. Being a victim of terrorism itself, no one can feel the pain of those impacted by this scourge like Pakistan,” Dar said.
On the other hand, he said: “India glorifies and even celebrates its assassination campaign and sponsoring of terrorism in Pakistan and other countries. No other country has sacrificed so much or suffered as much as Pakistan due to terrorism.”
 


Recounting the loss of over 80,000 lives and economic losses of over $150 billion, Dar said that in total, the overall loss incurred by Pakistan amounted to $500bn. Pakistan, he went on to say, had been working closely with the international community to address the common threat.
He said the sacrifices made by Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies and civilians had helped to address the threat of terrorism and contributed towards regional and international peace and stability.
“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism that has been planned, orchestrated and sponsored by India,” FM Dar said, adding that in such a backdrop, it was “preposterous to even suggest any kind of association of Pakistan with this [Pahalgam] incident”.
Dar pointed out that the furore and media hype created over “each and every incident in India seems to be deliberate and choreographed”, adding that it was “unfortunate that India continues to weaponise unsubstantiated accusations and allegations as part of its disinformation strategy for narrow political ends”.
 
 

He alleged it was not the first time that India had resorted to this practice.
“They have done it before and resorted again to the same to what they did in the Pulwama incident,” the deputy prime minister said, adding that it had become a “very familiar template aimed at diverting attention from India’s inability to suppress the inalienable right of Kashmiris to self-determination, its security failures in [occupied Kashmir] as well as its decades-long state terrorism and oppression”.
Dar asserted that India deliberately raised tensions with Pakistan to distract the international community’s attention from the “horrors” of what was happening in occupied India.
“A durable solution for India lies in focusing on its internal problems instead of pointing fingers at other countries. India has been deploying allegations of terrorism to achieve its strategic objectives for a long time,” Dar said, adding that India had a history of using the excuse of terrorism to introduce “draconian laws” to suppress Kashmiris in the occupied territory and to defy UN Security Council resolutions on the issue.
“India needs to explain why such incidents usually coincide with high-profile visits … The root cause of instability and conflict in South Asia is the unresolved and long-festering Jammu and Kashmir dispute. India’s illegal occupation … in stark violation of UNSC resolutions and grave violations of human rights, must remain a matter of grave concern for the international community.
“At the same time, all such incidents are used to whip up domestic political sentiment for narrow political gains. We remain extremely concerned at the very vitriolic, highly inflammatory and blatantly Islamophobic narrative being directed against Kashmiris and Indian Muslims.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He said the Indian media and political leaders were directing a similar discourse against Pakistan, which he criticised as a “highly irresponsible ploy for narrow objective gains” that was pushing the entire region towards “extreme instability”.
“India made allegations against Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack without an iota of evidence and with such dramatic speed. Pakistan has nothing to do with it and we have said so right from the beginning, and I repeat: Pakistan has nothing to do with the Pahalgam incident, period.
“We demand an independent and transparent probe by neutral investigators, as announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Any TORs (terms of reference) in this regard should be credible and mutually agreed upon.
“Pakistan has neither any connection … nor is the potential beneficiary. At a time when the economy is stabilising and we are making significant progress against terrorism, we need to question why this situation is being created by India all of a sudden and what is the motivation behind it.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Dar also mentioned that the recent actions and announcements by India after a meeting of its cabinet security committee were “illegal and highly irresponsible”.
“Holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty is unilateral and illegal. There are no such provisions in the treaty, it cannot be amended or terminated without consensus and in case of disagreements or issues, there are forums provided in the treaty which should be invoked,” he added.
The deputy prime minister added that the aforementioned actions demonstrated India’s “blatant disregard” for the sanctity of international treaties and set a dangerous precedent.
“It strikes at a fundamental ill of regional cooperation with profound implications for regional and global stability,” the foreign minister explained.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy, millions of people are dependent on the waters being regulated by this treaty. We gave up three rivers in this treaty and I can hardly find a water distribution treaty in the world whereby, a part of dealing with the distribution of water, the rivers could have also been given up.”
Dar said the National Security Committee had made it “very clear” that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan, as per the IWT and the usurpation of the rights of the lower riparian, would be considered an “act of war”.
“It is equal to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy. Other diplomatic measures by India are indiscriminate and unnecessary. India’s actions and inflammatory rhetoric over the last few days are highly irresponsible. Being a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan believes in restraint and remains committed to regional peace and stability.
“However, in case of any act of aggression, Pakistan remains determined to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in exercise of its inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter.”
Questions about Pahalgam incident
FM Dar said he wanted to raise some questions about the Pahalgam incident that needed to be considered.
“One, is it not time for the international community to hold India accountable for its transnational assassinations in different countries, including Pakistan? Two, is it not important to distinguish between the international community’s sympathies with the victims of the incident and the unwitting endorsement of Indian belligerence?
Three, is it not that Indian propaganda is aimed at fabricating a case for military adventure? Four, don’t you think that India’s blatant disregard for international law and whimsical approach towards its obligations would lead to a highly unstable and unpredictable regional order?
“Five, isn’t it high time for the international community to step in and condemn India and prevent it from targeting people on the basis of Islamophobia and religious hatred?
Six, can we deny that the dangerous Indian brinkmanship and efforts aimed at escalation can potentially lead to disastrous consequences in a nuclearised region and beyond?“
The foreign minister said Pakistan was cognisant of the developing situation. “We are very alert, the armed forces are alert, and the NSC resolve is very much there. We are vigilant, our armed forces are vigilant and the nation will thwart any misadventure, responding in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing,” he added.
Dar pointed out that it took no time for Pakistan to issue the statement expressing its condolences. “I was with the prime minister in Ankara on an official 36-hour visit. After we landed, the news came,  and the moment the meetings ended in the evening, for which we had gone, I was in touch with the FO and the foreign secretary, and the team and I finalised in consultation with the stakeholders, Pakistan’s statement on this incident,” the foreign minister said.
“So don’t tell me that Pakistan has not condemned. There are different forums of condemnation. Pakistan has condemned at the international forum where it is responsible, one of the 15 members of the UNSC. Pakistan’s highest security forum, which is the NSC, has condemned it.
“We have condemned terrorism in all its manifestations and forms. The prime minister has given a very clear condemnation statement when he offered an independent inquiry … by independent actors.
“So this is rhetoric which the other side has been playing that we did not condemn, that is all wrong.”
Irregularities with Pahalgam FIR
Following Dar’s remarks, FO spokesperson Khan highlighted irregularities in the registration of the first information report for the incident and criticised the speed with which Indian accounts began blaming Pakistan without offering any evidence.
“The timing raises serious questions about how information was processed so quickly,” he said.
Meanwhile, DG ISPR Lt Gen Chaudhry noted that the attack site was located far from the nearest town of Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, emphasising that Pakistan was presenting facts rather than engaging in baseless allegations.
“If the allegation is that the Pakistan-based so-called terrorists did this incident, then you need to be cognizant of where it lies, how deep within [occupied Kashmir]. If you see the terrain, you will see it is quite hilly, it is not the sort of terrain that is friendly and not the sort of terrain where all-weather fair roads exist. It’s mostly [four-wheelers] that travel,” he said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Showing visuals of the area’s geography, he said the distance from the incident site to the nearest police station was 30 minutes and questioned how an FIR could be registered in 10 minutes.
The military spokesperson poked holes in the Indian narrative, saying that the other side mentioned reports of indiscriminate firing, while also putting forward a stance on the act of terrorism carried out based on religion.
Link between Indian propaganda and terrorism
Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Indian social media account spreading propaganda against Islam and Pakistan had previously been linked to terrorist attacks in the country, including the November 4, 2023, assault in Mianwali and the October 6, 2024, attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi.
“There you see the collusion, how the choreography is carried out: first projecting and predicting where we will strike, then the attack happens, followed by its glorification on social media,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “If you observe the pattern, their electronic media jumps in within minutes. The same sequence was visible in Pahalgam.”
He said a similar pattern of hinting at a major incident, followed by a terrorist attack, was also observed in the Jaffar Express train bombing.
The military spokesperson said the questions raised by FM Dar were those being asked by common Kashmiris and Indians themselves.
“Is it the first time it is happening? No, there is a litany of using terror incidents for political ends. This is important — these terror incidents have a political objective. We saw last time, in Pulwama, how the terror incident in February was used for … change of status of Kashmir.
“We are seeing now that a terror incident that happened in Pahalgam is being used for the purpose of IWT, distracting [from] Pakistan’s continuously and hard-fought won war on terrorism and successful efforts in reviving the economy.”
He said another important fact that needed to be considered in the situation the region was facing today was the phenomenon of fake encounters using illegally held Pakistani prisoners in India.
“We have reports, the information that hundreds of Pakistanis held in jails in different locations by India are used in fake encounters projected as terrorists and infiltrators.”
Turning to India’s “state-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan, Chaudhry said the spokesperson of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) had appeared on multiple Indian news channels after the Jaffar Express attack, where he was openly glorified.

DG Chaudhry said Indian media was the first to show footage of the attack that was shot by the BLA.
He said the issue of Indian-sponsored assassinations and terrorism was transnational, affecting Canada, the US and Australia as well.
“Once we say that we have gotten nothing to do with Pahalgam and once we say that the only way out is an independent, credible transparent investigation, we have strong reasons, empirical evidence, and facts on the basis of which we are saying this.”
The military spokesperson further said: “We have credible intelligence that Indians post-Pahalgam have tasked all their proxies to undertake terrorist acts everywhere in Pakistan. Whether these proxies are operating in Balochistan or other parts of Pakistan.”
DG Chaudhry said the country had seen 3,700 terror incidents since January 24 with 77,816 operations, 1,666 terrorists killed and 3,896 casualties.
“This is terrorism that is being abetted and sponsored by India. It’s for the whole world to see, they feel it, its effects. We must be cognizant that Pakistan is the last bulwark standing against this scourge of terrorism.”
DG Chaudhry lashed out at India, saying that for the sake of its “short-term myopic objectives, it is facilitating this terrorism, it is abetting this perverted creeping ideology. Why? For short-term political objectives”.
Regarding the subsequent rhetoric against Islam and action against Muslims in India, the DG ISPR said: “I talked earlier that there is a planned and choreographed campaign of Islamist terrorism, but the acts speak differently.
“This is what some sane people are saying, the tourists who came in taxis belonging to Muslims, they stayed in hotels owned by Muslims, they ate food cooked by Muslims … and after the attack, they were covered and protected by Muslims. The first person to die was Muslim.”
He questioned why an effort was being made to label the whole community of Indian Muslims as terrorists. “Is this part of some agenda? is it part of that hate that is being systematically put into society?”
Chaudhry said that those questioning the Indian narrative were being clamped down upon.
“What the Indians are trying to do is … internalisation of external problems and externalisation of internal problems. Kashmir is an external problem and they are externalising it.
“Terrorism and extremism are an internal problem of India. Instead of handling it, and addressing it, they are externalising it. This cycle is manifesting itself in this Pahalgam incident.”
Pakistan response to escalatory moves
Questioned on Pakistan’s response and the options available to it, the DG ISPR said: “We are monitoring the situation very carefully in all terrains and accordingly, our responses and countermeasures in all domains are ready and as you must have seen in the NSC declaration, the statement of the government that came last night as well, that there will be decisive and assured actions.”
He said he would not elaborate on the details but “rest assured that the people of Pakistan, with its full resolve will defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan at all costs.”
Dar added: “Pakistan will exercise restraint for the purpose of regional peace, but and that is very clear, that if provoked, any action from the other side will be responded to in a befitting manner and in a stronger way.”
He further said: “The nation is united, the resolve of the leadership is in front of you in the NSC press release … I must compliment all political parties represented in the federation, all federating units, in the Senate … there is a unanimous resolution … the message is loud and clear.
“In terms of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no compromise and we are one united [nation] with a clear resolve that if provocation takes place then don’t blame us.”
The DG ISPR said Pakistani authorities would take up the case of India’s state-sponsored terrorism with all forums, including the international community.
Questioned about a fight on two fronts, the DG ISPR said law enforcement agencies were “fully capable” of taking on all threats simultaneously and effectively with full force.

“Terrorists are being hunted down. We are vigilant and watching everywhere,” he said with appropriate countermeasures in place for “fitting and decisive responses”.
Questioned about any need for mediation in the matter, FM Dar said: “There is a need for investigation, not mediation. Our friends have offered it and they must be trying. The need of the hour is, because both countries being nuclear, any escalatory move can go to a direction which would be unsustainable not only for the two countries but the entire region so it is my responsibility, of friends and regional actors to make sure India doesn’t make this mistake [of an attack].
“On behalf of armed forces, they’re alert, they’re ready and in a position to give a befitting response and we will choose the time and mode of our liking.”
Meanwhile, the DG ISPR confirmed that Pakistan and India’s military discussed ceasefire violations. He said the two sides held a routine weekly call in which Pakistan “raised the ceasefire violation issue” on Tuesday along the LoC.
Reuters earlier reported that despite the heightened tensions, India and Pakistan’s top military generals held their normal weekly phone call on Tuesday, according to two Indian military sources and a Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter.
“The Indian side objected strongly to unprovoked firing happening from Pakistan,” one Indian source said.
A Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the talks had happened, but gave no details.
The DG ISPR said this routine weekly contact was normally not made public. “We don’t know for what reason the Indians thought it necessary to make it public,” he said.
AJK president calls for international mediation
Meanwhile, AJK President Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called for international mediation and said that his administration was preparing a humanitarian response in case of any further escalation.
“There is a lot of activity going on and anything could happen, so we have to prepare for it. These few days are very important,” he told Reuters in an interview, calling for rapid international diplomacy to de-escalate the situation.
“We expect some mediation at this time from some friendly countries and we hope that that mediation must take place, otherwise, India would do anything this time,” he said. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates could be in a position to mediate, he added.
He also said he hoped major players such as the United States and Britain might also get involved.
He said activity along the LoC was “hot” and that Pakistan had shot down two Indian drones in the last few days.
“There had been regular firing by Pakistani and Indian soldiers day and night, though so far there had been no casualties,” he said, adding that Pakistan had also detected Indian Rafale fighter jets flying near the LoC, though they had not crossed.
He said he had not received intelligence on when and where India was expected to strike, but his administration was working with groups such as the Red Crescent Society to prepare extra medical and food supplies in case of any conflict.
“Red Crescent are working on it and we are working on displaced people in affected areas,” he said.
He added that the international community also needed to pay more attention to Kashmir’s long-term future.
“I think this is the right time for the international community as a whole and the UN to play some mediating role in Kashmir,” he said. “It’s been a very long time and the people of Kashmir have suffered a lot.”</p><small>2025-04-30 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30222010706aea4.jpg?r=222919' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907591/despite-wars-end-afghanistan-remains-deep-in-crisis-un-relief-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Despite war’s end, Afghanistan remains deep in crisis: UN relief chief</strong></a><br><p>Climate change, women’s rights, displacement, poverty: Afghanistan remains a priority as it faces overlapping crises, the UN’s relief chief Tom Fletcher told AFP on Wednesday, deploring “brutal” aid budget cuts.
“We’ve identified 17 crises across the world where our engagement is most urgent, most vital. Afghanistan is high on that list,” said the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs in an interview with AFP during a visit to northern Afghanistan’s Kunduz province.
Fletcher’s visit comes after US President Donald Trump’s decision to slash foreign aid sent shock waves across the globe.
 
 

Washington had been the top donor to Afghanistan, having spent $3.71 billion in humanitarian and development aid since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
“We’re in a period when we’re having to massively prioritise, take brutal choices … literally life and death choices, about where to operate and which lives to save,” Fletcher said.
“You can look at Sudan for the scale of the crisis, you can look at Gaza for the intensity, the ferocity of the killing there,” he added. “Afghanistan is a different kind of challenge, but it’s a huge challenge nonetheless.”
Climate change is hitting the country “particularly hard” and it “will drive the needs even more than conflict will in the period ahead”, he said. “You’ve got that combined with the existing levels of poverty and these decades of instability and conflict.”
‘Dialogue’ on women’s rights
The situation of women’s rights in the country adds to the layers of a “building up of crisis upon crisis”, Fletcher added.
The Taliban authorities have imposed restrictions on women that the UN has denounced as “gender apartheid”. Women and girls have been banned from education beyond primary school as well as many sectors of work and public spaces.
“I think this particular dynamic around women and girls is something that can surely cut through to even the most hard-hearted and cynical, transactional politician right now,” Fletcher said.
After meetings with Taliban officials this week in Kabul and the Taliban heartland of southern Kandahar, Fletcher noted the need for “dialogue in order to try and change the mindset” on women’s rights.

“It’s encouraging to me that people were willing to have the conversation and not have it in a purely defensive way,” he said.
Afghan women are particularly affected by humanitarian aid cuts, especially in the healthcare sector, which has been heavily dependent on foreign support.
In Afghanistan, maternal mortality rates of 620 per 100,000 births and infant mortality rates of 55 children under five per 1,000 births are among the highest in the world, according to Unicef.
“I challenge anyone who celebrates aid cuts to sit with a woman who has lost her child because she had to cycle for three hours while in labour to get the care that she needed,” said Fletcher, after having met Afghan women at a mobile health centre.
‘Humanitarian reset’
When Amina, a 28-year-old housewife, fell ill, she walked for an hour and a half to reach the centre in the rural countryside.
“There are no clinics, no doctors who come here, nothing nearby. We don’t even have electricity,” she told AFP.
The small facility, supported by the local non-governmental organisation JACK and UN agencies, is under strain.
Already overwhelmed, it now has to accommodate patients from US-funded clinics that had to close, as well as Afghans who have been expelled from Pakistan since early April.

“The reality with the cuts was that we didn’t see the impact straight away,” Fletcher said. “It’s now that we’re really coming to understand how brutal these cuts are going to be.”
Under these conditions, he said, “we’re in the process now of a massive humanitarian reset”.
“We’ve got to rediscover that sense of coexistence and care for the most vulnerable people on the planet. I don’t think that’s gone away just because of a few election results,” he said. “I don’t think you can put tariffs on humanitarian action,” he added, referring to the trade war recently launched by Trump.</p><small>2025-04-30 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30153641d041b27.jpg?r=153659' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907569/ccp-slaps-rs155m-fine-on-major-poultry-hatcheries-over-cartelisation' target='_blank'><strong>CCP slaps Rs155m fine on major poultry hatcheries over cartelisation</strong></a><br><p>In the light of cartelisation and price fixing of day-old broiler chicks (DOCs), the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) slapped a collective fine of Rs155 million on eight major poultry hatcheries, said a CCP press release on Wednesday.
Last week, the National Price Monitoring Committee showed concerns over the rising trend in perishable products, directing the Ministry of Food Security to develop a price control mechanism for poultry.
The CCP took suo motu notice of cartelisation in the DOC market, initiating an inquiry which found that eight major hatcheries were engaged in a coordinated effort to fix their prices.
The CCP named the following hatcheries: Sadiq Poultry, Hi-Tech Group, Islamabad Group, Olympia Group, Jadeed Group, Supreme Farms (Seasons Group), Big Bird Group, and Sabir’s Group.
Detailing the mode of operation of the cartel, the CCP noted that the hatcheries discussed the prices in a WhatsApp group titled “Chick Rate Announcement.” The group was administered by a senior Big Bird group official, while the Marketing Manager of Big Bird Group, Dr Shahid, coordinated the daily price updates.
It further noted that the cartel regularly announced uniform DOC rates for Punjab. With minor freight adjustments, it also influenced rates in Multan and Karachi.
It was pointed out that the group members discussed and shared next-day prices approximately 198 times from 2019 to 2021. The Price-Sensitive Information was exchanged 108 times via text messages and 87 times through WhatsApp, the CCP further noted.
The CCP observed that between March 2020 and April 2021, the price of DOCs rose by 346 per cent, from Rs17.92 to Rs79.92 per chick, contributing to inflated chicken prices.
Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) Hatchery Affairs Committee Chairman Abdul Karim, PPA Secretary retired General Major Syed Javaid Hussain Bukhari, along with other senior officials from the PPA were also present in the WhatsApp group.
As per the CCP, the eight groups are in direct violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010, which prohibits collusive arrangements to fix prices, control supply, or restrict production.
The CCP commented that such practices damage competition in the market and drive up food prices, calling it a shameful exploitation of society.
“Trade associations are meant to help develop their sectors, not to share price-sensitive information or facilitate cartelisation. Price-fixing through associations is a serious market distortion and an exploitation of consumers. Prices must be determined by free demand and supply forces,” said the press release.
Citing fresh complaints of price hikes, the CCP highlighted that the fair market rate of DOCs should be around Rs78 per chick as opposed to the recent price surge of up to Rs230 per chick.
The CCP encouraged anyone aware of anti-competitive activities by trade associations to file a complaint via the CCP’s complaint portal.</p><small>2025-04-30 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/301618284d72559.jpg?r=161901' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907572/iran-says-next-nuclear-talks-with-us-set-for-saturday-in-rome' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says next nuclear talks with US set for Saturday in Rome</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States will hold a fourth round of talks on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme in Rome on Saturday, Iran’s foreign minister said.
The longtime adversaries have held three rounds of talks aiming for a deal on the programme, which the West believes is intended to develop nuclear weapons — an allegation Tehran denies.
The talks, which began on April 12 and are mediated by Oman, are the highest-level contact in years between the two sides.
“The next round of negotiations will take place in Rome,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
The top diplomat said Iranian officials would also meet on Friday with representatives from Britain, France and Germany — all parties to the 2015 nuclear deal.
The deal called for the lifting of sanctions in exchange for curbing Iran’s nuclear activities, but fell apart when Washington withdrew from it in 2018 during Donald Trump’s first term as US president.
After France threatened that the European trio could reimpose sanctions, Iran’s UN mission said that “threats and economic blackmail” were “entirely unacceptable”.
“Genuine diplomacy cannot proceed under threats or pressure,” the diplomatic mission said in a letter carried Wednesday by Iran’s ISNA news agency.
Trump sent a letter in March to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused.
Since he returned to office in January, Trump revived his “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign, mirroring his approach during his first term.
Tehran has insisted that the ongoing talks should be solely focused on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions.
During the last round in the Omani capital Muscat on Saturday, both sides reported progress.
Iran hangs ‘high-ranking spy’ for Israel: judiciary
Iran has executed a man convicted of espionage for Israel’s Mossad spy agency and involvement in the 2022 assassination of a Revolutionary Guards colonel, the judiciary said.
Mohsen Langarneshin, described as “a high-ranking spy” who supported Mossad operations inside Iran, was hanged in the morning, said the judiciary’s Mizan Online news website.
The report did not specify when Langarneshin had been arrested or sentenced.
It said he was implicated in the killing of Guards colonel Sayyad Khodaei, who was gunned down by two motorcyclists on his way home in Tehran in May 2022.
According to The New York Times, Israel told the United States that it was responsible for the killing.
The judiciary accused Langarneshin of having “bought a motorcycle to monitor” Khodaei’s movements.
State television in Iran said Khodaei was a member of the Quds Force, the Guards’ foreign operations arms, and that he was “known” in Syria, where Tehran had provided military support for the government of now ousted president Bashar al-Assad.
Iran often announces the arrests of alleged spies, including operatives said to be aiding Tehran’s arch-enemy Israel.
A man was executed in December 2023 after he was found guilty of collaborating with Mossad. Four others were hanged a year earlier over alleged ties to Israel.</p><small>2025-04-30 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30140140f0597a0.jpg?r=140419' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907559/pcb-confirms-two-additional-mens-t20is-against-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>PCB confirms two additional men’s T20Is against Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday said that the Bangladesh men’s team will tour Pakistan in May for a five-match T20I series.
Pakistan last played international cricket against New Zealand earlier this month, where the Green Shirts lost both the One-day International series (3-0) and the Twenty20 International series (4-1).
The Pakistan Super League is currently ongoing in the country with the final set to take place on May 18.
 

The schedule for the series. — PCB

The PCB said in a press release: “The series, which is part of the Future Tour Programme (FTP), originally consisted of three ODIs and three Twenty20 internationals (T20Is).
“However, with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup scheduled for next year, both the boards have mutually agreed to replace the ODIs with two additional T20Is.”
The five-match T20I series will be played in Faisalabad and Lahore from May 25 to June 3, the PCB added.
Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, which successfully hosted the inaugural Champions One-Day Cup in September last year and National T20 Cup last month, will stage the first and second T20Is of the series, scheduled on May 25 and 27.
Iqbal Stadium, which has previously hosted 24 Tests and 16 ODIs between 1978 and 2008, will welcome back international cricket after a 17-year hiatus, the press release noted.
The historic venue’s last international fixture was an ODI between Bangladesh and Pakistan in April 2008.
Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium will host the remaining three T20Is, scheduled on May 30, June 1 and 3 with all five matches set to begin at 8pm.
The Bangladesh team will arrive on 21 May and will undergo training sessions at the Iqbal Stadium from 22 to 24 May, the press release concluded.
Bangladesh last toured Pakistan in September of last year for two tests, where they beat the hosts 2-0 to complete their maiden whitewash over Pakistan in that format of the game.

The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.
At 10:38am, the index declined by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.
By 1:50pm, more selling pressure ensued at the stock market as the KSE-100 index plunged by 3,255.42 points, or 2.83pc, from the last close.
Finally, the index closed at 111,326.57, down by 3,545.61 or 3.09pc, from the last close of 114,872.18.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.
He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.
“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, also credited the slump primarily on geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.
Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, albeit without proof.
On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.
Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.
Yesterday, the KSE-100 index had bounced back on the trading floor after the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
Pakistan dollar bonds drop amid rising tensions
Pakistan’s international bonds dropped more than 1 cent after the information minister’s statement.
The 2036 bond suffered the biggest decline, falling 1.3 cents to be bid at 71.85 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed, though bid-ask spreads of around 1 cent pointed to limited liquidity.
Indian shares flat as HDFC Bank offsets Bajaj Finance losses, Pakistan jitters
Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.
Both benchmarks swung between 0.2pc gains and 0.2pc losses in early trade.
“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Pahalgam, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack.
Six of the 13 major sectors declined on Wednesday, while the small- and mid-caps fell 0.6pc and 0.1pc, respectively.
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.

The incident took place in the vicinity of Saddar police station near Kot Adil.
According to Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, Station House Office (SHO) Waseem Sajjad and his personnel were on a routine patrol when two unidentified men opened fire on them.
“The policemen fired back at them, killing one of the attackers and injuring the other, who managed to escape from the scene,” he continued.
The official further said the SHO and a constable named Hayatullah suffered injuries and were shifted to the hospital. Both of them are out of danger.
The RPO said that he and Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kalachi immediately reached the hospital to enquire after the health of the injured.
“A police operation is under way to find the person, while the deceased attacker has been shifted to the hospital for identification,” he added.

The Rituraj Hotel, which had 88 guests when the fire broke out, is located in a congested business district of central Kolkata. About a dozen people suffered burn injuries and were undergoing treatment.
Building fires are common in India due to a lack of firefighting equipment and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
Last year, six people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Patna in the eastern state of Bihar.
The Press Trust of India news agency, which filmed images of soaring flames from the Kolkata building, reported that “several people were seen trying to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building”.
Kolkata’s The Telegraph newspaper reported that at least one person died when he “jumped off the terrace trying to escape” the fire.
Verma said the fire had been tackled and that “cooling operations are underway”.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the families of those killed. “May the injured recover soon,” his office said in a statement.

During a public hearing on Tuesday presided over by Chairman National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Waseem Mukhtar, representatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) said there was the possibility of increasing monthly fuel cost adjustments in the coming months given 20pc higher load demand and lower hydropower availability.
Responding to a question, a case officer of Nepra reported that the impact of about Rs52bn reduction in quarterly tariff adjustments would be about Rs1.52 per unit for the coming three months — May, June and July. Conveners representing export sector demanded that its application should come into force in April to June for which the prime minister had announced and on that basis they had booked export orders.
Nepra did not go beyond the earlier explanation of its application for May to July but it was evident that April bills were already out in some areas and could not be called back.

Consumers will not see relief in their April bills as promised by PM Shehbaz

The Nepra chairman disallowed representatives of Hyderabad, Multan and Quetta electric supply companies for the absence of their senior leadership and called for their explanations.
Mr Mukhtar also expressed displeasure over the absence of power division representation and directed that a letter should also be written to the federal secretary of power.
The CPPA reported about 4.4pc increase in power consumption in March over last year and sought about Rs1.52 per unit negative quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for the January-March 2025 period and another three paise per unit negative fuel price adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in March.
The Rs1.51 per unit negative QTA, involving a total of Rs51.5bn already overcharged by all Discos for the third quarter of FY25, was already made part of the tariff reduction announced by the prime minister for three months –April to June 2025.
The lower QTA stems from a combination of lower capacity charges, operations and maintenance costs, fixed costs on account of incremental sales and fewer system losses mainly because of relative stability in the exchange rate and decline in interest rates.
The decline in fuel cost is mainly because of substantially higher costs allowed by Nepra through a 20pc increase in base tariff effective July 1, 2024. About 75pc of the total power supply during March came from domestic fuel sources, almost 20pc of that at zero fuel cost.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for negative adjustment of fuel cost for March, said the power consumption was 4.4pc higher than the same month last year and almost 22pc higher than February. It reported that electricity delivered to Discos stood at 8,114 gigawatt hours (GWh) in March against 6,666 GWh in February.
The power companies have claimed in their petitions that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs9.22 per unit in March compared to Rs9.34 per unit in the same month last year.
The CPPA said about 8,409 GWh of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs79.5bn (Rs9.46 per unit) in March, of which 8,114GWh energy was delivered to Discos at a cost of Rs74.85bn (at Rs9.22 per unit). However, the reference fuel cost already charged in March stood at Rs9.256 per unit, hence a refund of three paise per unit.
Hydropower lost its top position with about 15.42pc share in the overall grid owing to unfavourable hydrological conditions. Last year, hydropower contributed 28pc electricity to the grid in March. Nuclear energy emerged as the largest electricity supplier to the national grid with 26.4pc share.
The third biggest share in the national grid came RLNG at 18.17pc, followed by local coal at 16.57pc. This was followed by 11.64pc share from local local gas. Imported coal contributed 6.5pc to the national grid.

The leakage in main supply line is set to add to water woes of residents in most parts of the city as they would suffer nearly 40 per cent water shortage for the next four days due to the ensuing repair works.
The affected neighborhoods include Chanesar Town, Jinnah Town, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad, Pak Colony, Golimar, Shershah, Old City Area, Landhi, Korangi, and PAF Base Masroor.
The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) will get 400 MGD water out of regular supply of 650MGD due to repair work on the Siphon No. 19, the 84-inch diameter pipeline that developed the leakage near Karachi University.
KWSC spokesman Abdul Qadir Shaikh said that the repair work was expected to be completed in 96 hours and water supply to different parts of the city would be partially suspended.

Campus inundated; repair work will take several days, says official

He said that the leak developed on Tuesday morning, prompting swift emergency action by the water utility. The repair would cause partial disruption in water supply in various areas of the city, he added.
He said that KWSC Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui had directed the relevant teams to begin repair work without delay.
He said that the water supply from the Dhabeji Pumping Station had been suspended immediately after the leakage and the repair work would start as and when the water receded. “To ensure the safety of repair crews and facilitate the operation efficiently, water pressure in the affected pipeline has been temporarily reduced,” he added.
The spokesperson said that the full-scale repair activities had already commenced and would continue uninterrupted around the clock.
The water utility advised the people to store water in advance and use it carefully to avoid any inconvenience.

Barrister Aqeel Malik, the minister of state for Law and Justice, told Reuters that the government was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, which is the treaty’s facilitator.
It is also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it could argue that India has violated the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Barrister Aqeel said, adding that a decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon”, and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.

Barrister Aqeel says issue will be taken up on multiple fronts; SCBA forms body to provide legal assistance in the matter

Indian officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request seeking comment.
 
 

New Delhi had last week held the World Bank-mediated Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 in abeyance after an attack in the Pahalgam tourist resort in occupied Kashmir, saying the suspension would last until “Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
Islamabad flatly denies any involvement in the attack, and in response to New Delhi’s actions, also suspended all trade and closed its airspace to Indian airlines.
Barrister Aqeel added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he told Reuters.
“The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is no provision within the treaty,” said Malik.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months and farmers, already hit by climate-change related water shortages, have raised concerns.
SCBA body to assist govt
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has constituted a committee to provide legal assistance to the federal government to help raise the issue of Indus Water Treaty of 1960 at appropriate forums.
The committee will be chaired by its president along with SCBA Secretary Salman Mansoor, Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Mir Attaullah Langove, Sindh High Court Bar Association President Barrister Sarfraz Metlo, as well as Barrister M.H. Subhani and Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar.
In a statement, the country’s apex body of lawyers said it remains steadfast in its role as a watchdog for the protection of fundamental rights, adherence to international treaties and the preservation of national dignity and sovereignty.
 
 

Beyond being a formal accord, the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 is essential to Pakistan’s very existence and prosperity.
The treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank, expressly asserts that none of its signatories can unilaterally terminate, withdraw from, or hold it in abeyance, the statement said.
Yet, India has suspended this very treaty in contravention of international laws, the statement said, adding that the association viewed the unilateral suspension of the treaty as an unnecessary move, aimed at disrupting the downstream water flow.

In an official statement issued on Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission condemned the latest attack, which took place at approximately 5:18am on April 27.
The assailant, identified by British police as Ankit Love, reportedly hurled stones and splashed saffron paint on the outer wall of the High Commission, shattering several windows and staining the building’s nameplate. He was apprehended shortly after the incident by the Metropolitan Police.
The High Commission linked the act of vandalism to a larger, more aggressive protest that occurred days earlier on April 25, involving members of the Indian and British Indian community.

UK minister calls for calm among diaspora communities

Protesters shouted anti-Pakistan and Islamophobic slogans, and clashed with law enforcers.
 
 

“We expect that the British law enforcement agencies would prosecute Ankit, as well as the raucous protesters detained on Friday, in accordance with the relevant British laws,” the statement said.
Expressing concern over the escalating hostility, the statement from the mission reminded the UK government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic missions. It also reiterated its demand for enhanced security at Pakistani diplomatic posts across the UK.
“This is not the first incident where the High Commission of Pakistan or our Consulates in the United Kingdom have been attacked,” the statement read.
The Pakistan High Commission confirmed it is in contact with British police to obtain further details about Ankit Love, whose nationality has not yet been disclosed.
Reuters adds: Meanwhile, UK Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has called for calm between Indian and Pakistani communities, after lawmakers voiced concerns that tensions over the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir could spill into the diaspora.
“These issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets  and we call on sides, all community leaders, all involved to call for  calm at a time of tension in the region,” Hamish  Falconer told parliament.
Falconer appeared in parliament to answer an urgent question  on the situation, where lawmakers raised concerns about media reports of  ill-tempered protests outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions in London.
The British government’s long-standing position is that India and Pakistan are responsible for finding a solution to the situation in held Kashmir that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he told parliament.
