<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231349386d961f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975192/another-meltdown-at-psx-as-kse-100-loses-over-5400-points' target='_blank'><strong>Another meltdown at PSX as KSE-100 loses over 5,400 points</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark index KSE-100 began another week on a low note, crashing more than 5,400 points during intraday trade on Monday.
The development led to the market being suspended as per the protocol.
The KSE-100 index declined 5,478.63 points, or 3.16 per cent, to stand at 167,691.08 points from the previous close of 173,169.71 points at 1:50pm.
This marks at least the third major meltdown at the PSX in the past two weeks, with KSE-100 losing 5,149.80 points on February 16 and 6,683 points — the steepest single-day decline in history — on February 19.
Last week, the PSX endured a difficult week as geopolitical strains between the United States and Iran, compounded by domestic political noise, triggered a significant sell-off, pushing the KSE-100 index below the 174,000-point level.
Analysts have been cautious but hopeful about the market’s near-term direction.
AKD Securities believed that geopolitical developments and the outcome of the upcoming IMF review mission, due to arrive next week, will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.
Additionally, the corporate results season may offer some upside, especially if earnings surpass expectations.

The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the FO said in a press release.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will hold a bilateral meeting with Sheikh Tamim, “covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership, and people-to-people exchanges”, the FO added.
“The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export.”
The FO highlighted that both countries shared a “longstanding partnership characterised by mutual trust and close coordination at regional and international forums”.







“The visit will also provide an opportunity for both leaderships to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest, reaffirming their resolve to work closely for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” the statement added.
“The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between the two countries and underscores their shared commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation,” the FO noted.
The premier will be accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other ministers, and senior officials, according to the FO.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
PM Shehbaz undertook two visits to Doha in September 2025 — one to express solidarity after Israeli attacks on the country and a second to attend a joint summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
He had held meetings with the Qatari emir on both occasions, reaffirmed Pakistan’s “all-out support and solidarity” for the Gulf state.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2311514103d92db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975189/another-tejas-jet-lost-as-indian-air-force-grounds-fleet-for-inspections-reports-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Another Tejas jet lost as Indian Air Force grounds fleet for inspections, reports local media</strong></a><br><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) has lost another Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Tejas light combat aircraft after it overshot the runway at a frontline airbase, sustaining major damage to its airframe, Indian media, including The Hindu reported.
The incident, believed to have been caused by a brake failure, took place on February 7, and the pilot ejected safely, according to The Times of India.
Following the accident, the entire fleet of about 30 single-seat Tejas jets was grounded to undergo comprehensive technical inspections, The Hindu added.
The latest mishap comes amid delays in the delivery of the Tejas Mk‑1A variant, according to Indian media outlets. HAL has faced repeated delays in supplying the jets, mainly due to GE Aerospace missing deadlines for engine deliveries.
The IAF has not released an official statement regarding the incident.
This is reported to be the third Tejas aircraft lost since induction. The first crash occurred near Jaisalmer in March 2024 after a firepower demonstration, with the pilot ejecting safely.
The second incident was reported in November 2025, when a Tejas jet crashed during an aerial display on the last day of the Dubai Airshow, the Middle East’s biggest airshow.
In February 2021, India’s Defence Ministry signed an INR480 billion contract with HAL for 83 Tejas Mk‑1A jets, followed by a separate INR623.7bn deal in September 2025 for 97 additional aircraft, Indian media outlets reported.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/230926362f4a3fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975150/security-forces-kill-five-terrorists-including-suicide-bomber-during-ibo-in-balochistans-pishin-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill five terrorists, including suicide bomber, during IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Pishin district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber Kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored Khwarij were hunted down and sent to hell.”
Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
The spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement.
He added that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”.
He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism.







Last week, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On February 5, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The operation was initiated as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across the province on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
During simultaneous operations, around 180 suspects were arrested and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized by Frontier Corps and police, officials said.

The leaders — Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mahmoodur Rasheed and Ejaz Chaudhry — jailed for involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots issued the statement through their lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar Umar, from Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore.
The statement said that a multi-party conference should be held immediately on the “Palestinian issue”, saying that sustainable peace was not possible in the region without a “two-state solution and justice”.
It called on all parties to reiterate their support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
“Since the ceasefire was announced through negotiations, more than 600 deaths have been reported in Gaza as a result of continuous ceasefire violations,” the statement pointed out.
“Israel’s decision to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, its unilateral actions to change the legal, demographic and historical status of the occupied Palestinian territories, its refusal to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip, its refusal to allow reconstruction work before Hamas disarms, and its continued obstruction of the uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid are all undermining the 20-point peace plan.”
The leaders further highlighted a need to discuss why four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) were not ready to be part of United States President Donald Trump’s new Board of Peace, ostensibly established to settle the Gaza conflict.
“Is it fair that Israel should be given membership of the Peace Board while the Palestinians are kept out?” they asked, pointing out that Israel’s violations of international law and the UN Charter had further escalated Middle East tensions.
The US president’s board met for its inaugural session in Washington on Thursday, with a number of countries pledging money and personnel for rebuilding, more than four months into a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. However, the meeting offered no timeline for Hamas to lay down its weapons or for Israel’s army to withdraw from the shattered enclave.
The statement also addressed the recently brewing conflict between the US and Iran, expressing concern that Tehran’s failure to reach an agreement with Washington within 10 days “could push the region towards war”. It highlighted the significant consequences of instability in Iran and its impact on Pakistan.
“Since there has been no meaningful debate in parliament on the Palestinian issue and the rising tensions in the Middle East, an urgent multi-party conference is the need of the hour to build a national consensus for peace and stability in Gaza and the wider region,” the statement concluded.
The UN said on Thursday that Israel’s increased attacks and forcible transfers of Palestinians “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it added.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699ba3bc7e66a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975091/us-pulls-troops-out-of-qatar-bahrain-as-iran-tensions-mount' target='_blank'><strong>US pulls troops out of Qatar, Bahrain as Iran tensions mount</strong></a><br><p>

• Trump asking why Tehran has not ‘capitulated’ in the face of military build-up, US envoy Witkoff says• Iranian commander claims ‘enemy’ movements being monitored round the clock• Talks expected on Thursday if nuclear proposal furnished ‘in next 48 hours’• Washington ‘offered’ opportunities for investment in Iran’s oil industry
DUBAI: The United States has evacuated hundreds of troops from key bases in Qatar and Bahrain in what is described as a precautionary move as tensions with Iran continue to escalate, according to a report by The New York Times.
The withdrawal, which involved personnel stationed at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and facilities linked to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, comes amid growing concern in Washington over the possibility of military confrontation with Tehran and the risk of Iran’s retaliatory strikes across the region.
Al Udeid, the largest US military installation in the Middle East, hosts around 10,000 troops and plays a central role in American air operations in the region. Officials said the redeployment was intended to reduce exposure of forces in the event of a sudden escalation.
The move has been widely interpreted as part of a contingency planning rather than a signal of imminent conflict.
US forces remain deployed across a network of bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE.
Meanwhile, US negotiators are ready to hold another round of talks with Iran on Friday in Geneva if they receive a detailed Iranian proposal for a nuclear deal in the next 48 hours, Axios reported on Sunday, citing a senior US official.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday officials of Iran and the US are expected to attend Oman-mediated talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, noting that there is still “a good chance” of diplomatic solution to Tehran’s nuclear ambition.
Later, Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi in a post on X confirmed “US-Iran negotiations are now set for Geneva this Thursday, with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalising the deal.”







Trump asks why Iran has not capitulated
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal. In a Fox News interview, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”

 

Witkoff’s comments come after Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days. Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
Iran monitoring ‘enemy’ movements
An Iranian commander said on Sunday that his country’s forces are monitoring “enemy” movements around the clock amid rising tensions with the United States, according to an Anadolu report.
“All enemy movements are continuously monitored,” Ground Forces Commander Ali Jahanshahi said during a visit to a military unit in the city of Piranshahr in West Azerbaijan province near the Iraqi border.
“Thanks to their advanced capabilities, our soldiers will not allow any hostile action against this land,” he added in his comments cited by local media.
Iran and the US have differing views over sanctions relief in talks to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday.
“The last round of talks showed that US ideas regarding the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief differ from Iran’s demands,” the official said.
“Within the economic package under negotiation, the US has also been offered opportunities for serious investment and tangible economic interests in Iran’s oil industry,” the official said. However, he said Tehran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and ordered non-essential vehicles off city roads from Sunday night to noon Monday, saying plows and emergency crews needed the streets clear as snowfall intensified.
The city is under its first blizzard warning since 2017.
City offices will close for in-person services, and non-essential municipal employees may work remotely. “I’m urging every New Yorker to please stay home,” Mamdani said.
New York City, the nation’s largest school district, ordered all public school buildings closed for a traditional snow day, with no remote instruction and all after-school programs cancelled.
The storm has already snarled travel along the East Coast from Washington to New England, with airlines canceling thousands of flights and officials urging people to stay off the roads.
Winter weather in the Northeast may also slow the processing, transport and delivery of mail and packages, the US Postal Service said.



Regional emergencies
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had activated 100 National Guard members to assist in Long Island, New York City and the Lower Hudson Valley — areas expected to bear the brunt of the heavy snow and coastal winds.
The storm also forced closure of the United Nations (UN) headquarters complex in Manhattan on Monday.
Parts of the Northeast could see up to two feet of snow and wind gusts could reach 70 mph, raising the risk of falling trees and power outages, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
In an update on Sunday, the agency said despite its ongoing funding lapse, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (Fema) disaster‑response work continues uninterrupted, including staff travel, emergency operations, and critical assistance for people affected by active disasters, with life safety and property protection remaining top priorities.
Last week, Reuters reported that US President Donald Trump’s administration had ordered Fema to suspend the deployment of hundreds of aid workers to disaster-affected areas around the country while the DHS is shut down.



Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey declared an emergency and told state workers to stay home. Connecticut barred commercial vehicles from limited-access highways Sunday evening, exempting only emergency and essential deliveries.
New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill declared a statewide emergency effective noon Sunday and urged residents to take the storm seriously. “People need to take this very seriously,” she told CNN.
Travel disruptions
Air travel was among the earliest casualties. Flight-tracking site FlightAware showed more than 5,000 flights already canceled for Monday.
Aviation analytics firm Cirium said more than 25,000 flights were scheduled to depart from the United States on Monday, with cancellations also rising for Tuesday, especially at major Northeast airports.
NJ TRANSIT suspended bus, light rail and Access Link service Sunday evening and halted statewide rail service by Sunday night, with operations resuming only when conditions allow.
In New England, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority said it would suspend all service — including its RIde paratransit program — from Sunday night through Monday and would announce plans to resume service only when conditions improve.

“Pakistan has always chosen the path of dialogue and peaceful coexistence. But when Afghan soil continues to be used for proxy attacks, we have no choice but to defend our homeland. National security is non-negotiable,” Chaudhry said in a statement.
The PML-N MNA affirmed that the people of Pakistan “stand firmly” with their armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
He urged the Afghan government to take “decisive action to prevent its land from being used for cross-border militancy”, warning that lasting peace in the region depended on the “complete dismantling of terrorist sanctuaries”.
Noting that the recent operation “successfully neutralised militants involved in attacks on Pakistani soil”, Chaudhry stressed: “This action was aimed solely at those responsible for violent attacks inside Pakistan. Every precaution was taken to protect innocent lives.”
He also pointed to Afghanistan’s emergence as a “sanctuary for multiple terrorist groups”. Referring to a United Nations report, he noted that militants from 21 terror outfits were operating from Afghan territory, posing a serious threat to regional stability.
He specifically called out India’s “continued support for terrorist networks”.
“India is actively funding and training these groups, equipping them to carry out cross-border attacks against Pakistan. Such elements deserve no concessions,” the parliamentary secretary asserted.
His remarks came after Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation targeting groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.
The strikes killed “more than 80 terrorists”, according to security sources.
The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur, and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians. Authorities described the operation as intelligence-based and proportionate, aimed solely at those responsible for the attacks.
‘Decisive struggle against terrorism’
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi asserted that the country will “not allow our soil to be destabilised by forces operating from across the border in Afghanistan”.
In a post on X, he said: “The citizens of Pakistan, especially the resilient people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our armed forces and security institutions in the defense of our homeland.”
He further said: “The sacrifices of our martyrs bind us together as one nation. In this decisive struggle against terrorism, Pakistan stands united, resolute, and unwavering.
“Our sovereignty is non-negotiable, and the people of this country stand shoulder to shoulder with the state to protect it at all costs.”

Thousands of party elites have packed the capital Pyongyang for a once-in-five-years summit of the ruling Workers’ Party, a gathering that directs state efforts on everything from diplomacy to war planning.
The congress offers a rare glimpse into the political workings of reclusive North Korea, and is widely seen as a forum for Kim to flex his grip on power.
Military top brass made a “pledge of loyalty” to Kim as delegates rubber-stamped his re-election as general secretary on Sunday, the Korean Central News Agency said.
The congress singled out Kim’s efforts to keep unnamed foes at bay by “radically” improving its “nuclear forces”.
“He has energetically led the work to turn the Korean People’s Army, the pivot of national defence and pillar of safeguarding peace, into an elite and powerful army,” read a party statement.
“And thus (he has) built the revolutionary armed forces capable of coping with any threat of aggression on their own initiative and fully prepared for any form of war.”

China’s President Xi Jinping hailed a “new chapter” in relations with North Korea after Kim’s re-election.
In a striking display of his elevated status on the world stage, Kim appeared alongside Xi and Russia’s Vladimir Putin at a military parade in Beijing last year.
Kim is expected to unveil the next phase in North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme later in the days-long congress.
Under Kim, North Korea’s nuclear arsenal has been transformed from a source of mild global concern to something treated as a genuine threat.
It has been more than eight years since North Korea’s last nuclear test triggered a man-made earthquake underneath the northern Hamyong mountains.
Pyongyang’s atomic scientists have worked since then to harness this power in portable warheads that can be attached to long-range missiles.
Kim unveiled a battery of huge nuclear-capable rocket launchers just days before the congress opened.
Friend or foe
Photos released by state media showed dozens of launch vehicles parked in neat rows on the plaza of Pyongyang’s House of Culture.
It is just the ninth time the Workers’ Party congress has convened under North Korea’s decades-spanning Kim rule.
The meeting was shelved for decades under Kim’s father Kim Jong Il, but was revived in 2016.
Analysts will scour photographs to see which officials are seated closest to Kim, and who is banished to the back row.

Particular attention will be placed on the whereabouts of Kim’s teenage daughter Ju Ae, who has emerged as North Korea’s heir apparent according to Seoul’s national intelligence service.
At the previous congress five years ago, Kim declared that the United States was his nation’s “biggest enemy”.
There is keen interest in whether Kim might use the congress to soften this stance, or double down.
US President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was “100 per cent” open to a meeting.
Kim has so far largely shunned efforts to resume top-level diplomatic dialogue.</p><small>2026-02-23 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23103806224a4fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975155/iftar-sehri-timings-for-ramazan-56' target='_blank'><strong>Iftar, Sehri timings for Ramazan 5/6</strong></a><br><p>Times for today’s Iftar (5th Ramazan) and tomorrow’s Sehri (6th Ramazan) for the federal and provincial capitals are listed below:

In some towns, tourists and residents were urged to stay indoors, while truckers were advised to take safe routes or return to their depots until the violence abated.
Several airlines, including Air Canada, United Airlines and Aeromexico, on Sunday cancelled flights to Puerto Vallarta, a beachside resort town where stunned tourists filmed plumes of smoke rising into the sky from fires.
The burst of violence across more than half a dozen states painted a familiar scene for Mexicans who have spent two decades watching successive governments wage war on drug cartels, ravaging broad swaths of the country.
A member of Oseguera’s Jalisco New Generation Cartel told Reuters that the blazes and sporadic gunfire were carried out in revenge for the government’s killing of Oseguera, and warned of further bloodshed as groups move to take control of his cartel.

“The attacks were carried out in revenge for the leader’s death, at first against the government and out of discontent,“ the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“But later, the internal killings are coming, by the groups moving in to take over.”
In Mexico’s Pacific coast, a five-hour drive from the military operation in the town of Tapalpa that took down the leader of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, stunned beachgoers on a pier in Puerto Vallarta took out their cell phones to film thick waves of smoke obscuring blue ocean views, showed a video shared with Reuters.
Daniel Drolet, a Canadian who has wintered in Puerto Vallarta for years, said in a phone interview that he was concerned about a new era of violence taking root in the typically placid resort zone.
“I have never seen anything like this before,” he said.
In the state of Jalisco, authorities reported that gunmen had attacked a base for the National Guard military police, and recommended guests remain inside hotels and suspended public transit.
Other scenes of criminal activity and military response were captured in videos shared by government security sources with Reuters: A green military tank made its way through a residential neighborhood in the state of Aguascalientes.
Roadblocks paralyzed the highly transited Mexico-Puebla highway. In the state of Colima, cartel members standing in pick-up trucks blocked a road.
A trucking industry group said in a statement it was “profoundly worried” by the highway violence and recommended that truckers keep to safe areas or return to their operating yards until conditions improved.

The state of Guanajuato, a CJNG stronghold, reported 55 incidents across 23 municipalities, with 18 arrests, but said by evening all incidents were under control.
Carlo Gutierrez, who lives in Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital, said that friends on WhatsApp groups were encouraging people to stay home.
“There is fear and a lot of caution,” he said of the city, one of three main Mexican venues for World Cup soccer matches this summer.
Former cop turned kingpin
Oseguera, a former police officer, founded and oversaw the rapid rise of the CJNG, named for the western state of Jalisco that is home to one of Mexico’s biggest cities, Guadalajara.
In recent years, CJNG has expanded into one of Mexico’s most powerful cartels, known for violent tactics including forced labor and forced recruitment.
Under El Mencho’s leadership, CJNG also became a highly diversified criminal enterprise, expanding from drug trafficking to fuel theft, extortion, human smuggling, and complex financial frauds.

The cartel pioneered use of drones in attacks against civilians in remote regions of western Mexico as part of its rapid territorial expansion.
Sunday’s raid was one of Mexico’s highest-profile blows against drug gangs responsible for smuggling billions of dollars of drugs - including fentanyl - into the US.
In recent years, the leaders of the rival Sinaloa Cartel - Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada- were captured alive. Both are now in US prisons.
President Donald Trump’s administration lauded El Mencho’s killing, but the domestic violence it triggered highlighted the political balancing act Sheinbaum must strike as her government escalates its cartel offensive.
Security experts were watching whether the raid and death of the cartel boss will fracture CJNG leadership and trigger bloody infighting.
“There will definitely be skirmishes between the various factions, and these spasms of violence could last for years,” said Carlos Olivo, a former US Drug Enforcement Administration assistant special agent in charge and an expert in CJNG.
Violence in wake of cartel arrests, killings
Authorities have not reported any casualties beyond several cartel members and officials killed during the military operation.
Previous cartel arrests and killings have led to outbreaks of violence - whether by members avenging their fallen leader or rival gangs muscling in on their territory — prompting Mexican authorities to hesitate before launching major campaigns.

In 2019, Ovidio Guzman, a son of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, was detained but quickly released, setting off widespread gun battles. His arrest in 2023 set off more violence.
The 2024 arrest of Sinaloa Cartel boss Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada triggered a bloody power struggle in the criminal group that continues unabated more than a year later.
“I’m watching the scenes of violence from Mexico with great sadness and concern,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who previously served as ambassador to Mexico, in a post on social media.
“It’s not surprising that the bad guys are responding with terror. But we must never lose our nerve.”
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum in a social media post acknowledged the violence, but struck a tone of calm.
“In most of the national territory activities are happening with absolute normalcy,” she said.
Killing wins US praise
Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, previously ambassador to Mexico, said Oseguera’s killing was a “great development” for the US and Mexico, as well as the rest of Latin America.

In January after the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said “the cartels are running Mexico,” and warned “we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels.”
Sheinbaum said she would strengthen efforts to cooperate with the US to fight cartels., but vowed to uphold Mexico’s sovereignty and warned against any unilateral military action by the U.S. in Mexico.
Sheinbaum, in a social media post on Sunday, said security officials would provide information on the operation.</p><small>2026-02-23 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23081657d8fa2d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975104/cm-maryam-unveils-free-land-scheme-for-farmers' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam unveils free land scheme for farmers</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced that free state land will be provided to peasants from April under the “Apna Khet, Apna Rozgar” initiative, in a major push to strengthen the province’s agricultural sector.
In a statement, the chief minister said that all cultivable government land across Punjab would be leased to peasants for 10 years, with each beneficiary receiving up to five acres free of cost. No lease charges would be collected, she added.
She said farmers will also receive financial assistance along with land allocation to help them immediately begin cultivation. The initiative aims to boost agricultural productivity and support the rural economy.
The scheme was first announced on February 4 during her address at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Rajanpur, where she stated that around 250,000 acres of land would be distributed among deserving and underprivileged individuals.

Cultivable govt land to be leased for 10 years ‘free of cost’

Detailed guidelines and the application procedure are expected to be issued soon.
Separately, speaking at the launch ceremony of the CM Green Tractor Programme Phase-III, the chief minister formally initiated the balloting process and congratulated successful farmers.
She said that while 20,000 tractors were distributed over the past 25 years, her government has provided 31,000 tractors in just two years, setting a new record.
During the ceremony, she personally called selected farmers, including Hamza Liaquat from Bahawalpur, informing him of his success in the draw.
The chief minister said the Green Tractor Scheme was transforming the Punjab’s agricultural landscape, adding that the provision of modern machinery would significantly enhance crop yields. She reaffirmed that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz remained committed to farmer-friendly policies and would continue to prioritise agricultural development.

An Indian army statement said three fighters were killed during a military operation in the high-altitude Kishtwar district after it received “credible intelligence of a rebel presence” in the area.
It added that security forces had recovered weapons from the site.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the youths were killed in the Chatroo forest area. It added that additional troops were deployed to the area. “All entry and exit points have been sealed,” it reported.
An attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Paha­lgam on April 22 last year resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the Indus Waters Treaty in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.

The change confirmed by the UK Home Office means British citizens who also hold another nationality will be required to present a British passport when travelling to the UK. Those without one must apply for a “certificate of entitlement” attac­hed to their non-British passport at a cost of £589.
The measure is part of a broader overhaul of UK border systems requiring most travellers to obtain prior permission before entering the country.
Similarly, from February 25, visitors who do not hold British or Irish citizenship and do not require a visa to enter the country will need an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), costing £16, before departure. According to the UK government, “Enforcing will mean that everyone who wants to come to the UK must have digital permission through either an ETA or an eVisa.”
The BBC reported that dual nationals cannot apply for an ETA and must have a certificate of entitlement instead, “with checks now carried out by airlines when departing en route back to the UK”.
Alarm among dual nationals
The changes have caused alarm among dual nationals, with some saying that they were unaware of the new requirements and now fear being stranded abroad. A British woman resident in Germany told The Guardian she was concerned her children could be affected, particularly her son, who was due to travel to the UK in the coming weeks.
“I’m really annoyed about being treated as Brexit collateral once again with this short-notice change of the rules,” she said.
Another long-term resident in Spain told the newspaper the requirement posed legal complications. Spain obliges non-nationals who naturalise as Spanish citizens to renounce their previous nationality. Although the UK permits dual nationality, presenting a British passport at a Spanish airport could jeopardise her Spanish citizenship.
“It seems a strange anomaly that while the UK is willing to recognise dual nationality, it refuses to recognise that a valid EU passport held by a UK citizen can give the right of entry,” she said.
The issue also affects British-born dual nationals who have never applied for a British passport. One London-born professional holding Italian citizenship was reported to have said he only recently realised he might be unable to return to the UK after a work trip because he does not possess a British passport.
A Home Office spokesperson said the policy forms part of a digitisation programme designed to create a seamless travel experience and strengthen border security.
Campaign group ‘The3million’ has called for a low-cost digital authorisation instead of the £589 certificate. With the deadline days away, dual nationals are scrambling to check passport status or begin applications amid fears that failure to comply could leave them stranded.

A day earlier, Trump said he was sending “a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there”.
But Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who heads the autonomous territory’s government, wrote on his Facebook page: “That will be ‘no thanks’ from us.”
“President Trump’s idea to send a US hospital ship here to Greenland has been duly noted. But we have a public health system where care is free for citizens,” he said.



Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen likewise told Danish broadcaster DR: “The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs.
They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark.” He added: “It’s not as if there’s a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland.”

Danish forces evacuate US submarine crew member

AI-generated hospital ship
In Greenland, as in Denmark, access to healthcare is free for citizens. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the one in the capital Nuuk serving patients from all over the territory, population 57,000.
Without explicitly mentioning the US proposal, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was “happy to live in a country where access to healthcare is free and equal for all. Where insurance or wealth does not determine whether one receives dignified treatment.”
Trump, in his Truth Social message on Saturday about the hospital ship, posted an AI-generated image of a US Navy medical vessel, USNS Mercy. “It’s on the way!!!” he added.







It was not immediately clear if that meant he was deploying that ship to Greenland.
The US president indicated the deployment was being carried out in coordination with Jeff Landry, appointed in December as the US Special Envoy to the Arctic island.
Aaja Chemnitz, who represents Greenland in the Danish Parliament, wrote on Facebook that, while Greenland’s health system had its share of problems, they were best resolved through cooperation with Denmark.
Denmark, she noted, “is one of the wealthiest and most educated countries, for example in the field of healthcare,” contrasting it with “the United States, which has its own healthcare system problems”.
US submarine
Danish forces evacuated a crew member from a US submarine off the coast of Greenland on Saturday after the sailor required urgent medical treatment, authorities said.
Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command, which oversees Danish operations in the region, said in a post on Facebook the crew member was flown to a hospital in Nuuk after a medical emergency on board the vessel.
Officials did not disclose the nature of the medical issue or give details about the submarine’s mission. Images posted online appeared to show the sail of a submarine surfacing in Nuuk’s bay.
Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has argued that Washington needs to control mineral-rich Greenland — an autonomous Danish territory — for American national security.
Last month, Trump backed down from earlier threats to seize the Arctic island after striking a “framework” deal with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
‘New normal’
Trump has repeatedly said he believes the United States must control Greenland to ensure US national security. Earlier threats he made to seize the territory, by force if necessary, have ebbed since he struck a “framework” deal with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
The defence minister, Lund Poulsen, told DR he was not aware of a possible arrival of the suggested US hospital ship. “Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics,” he said.

WORDS are never just words. They carry history, suspicion and memory. A single sentence, spoken casually in Washington or by an American official, can travel thousands of miles and land like a strategic signal.
When US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told podcaster Tucker Carlson in an interview that “It would be fine if they (Israelis) took it all (Arab lands),” he may have intended a theological remark.
But in Arab capitals and the broader Muslim world, it was heard as something else — an endorsement of the ‘Greater Israel’ vision, peddled by Israeli Zionists.
The reaction was not scattered, rather collective. Fou­r­teen governments — among them Pakistan, Eg­ypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Türkiye, Indonesia and the State of Palestine — joined hands with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, League of Arab States and Gulf Cooperation Council to denounce the remarks.
Their joint statement did not hide behind soft language, expressing “strong condemnation and profound concern” and affirming “categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.”
This is not how governments usually react to a casual gaffe by an official. This is how they react when they feel something foundational is being questioned.
The controversy began when Mr Huckabee referred to the biblical promise of land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. When asked if Israel had the right to that territory, he replied that it would be fine if Israel took it all.

 

The map implied by that verse in the book of Genesis includes not only the occupied Pale­s­t­inian territories but also parts of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Sovereignty and international law
There were several reasons for the sharp reaction from Arab and Muslim states.
Firstly, it relates to the core issue of sovereignty of other states. In a region that has witnessed occupation and annexation, even rhetorical acceptance of territorial expansion triggers deep anxiety.
The second reason is the long-running Palestine dispute as the two-state formula, though weakened, remains the diplomatic touchstone. Arab governments see the ambassador’s remark as undermining any claim that US still backs a political horizon for Palestinian statehood.
Thirdly, the fear of domestic backlash forced Muslim leaders to react promptly. Cairo, Amman, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh justify cooperation with the US on the understanding that the US guarantees their territorial integrity. But when a senior American official app­e­a­rs to bless expansion, that understanding fades.
Fourthly, the statement meant setting a precedent. Diplomacy works on signals. An ambassador’s words are not treated as personal musings; they are read as indicators.
International law is clear on the basic principle that territory can’t be acquired by force. The UN Charter rests on sovereign equality and territorial integrity.
“The ambassador’s remarks regarding Isr­ael’s territorial acquisitions in the Middle East are deemed unwarranted and represent a clear contravention of established international norms… Furthermore, as an accredited envoy, he is precluded from endorsing aggressive act­i­ons,” Ahmer Bilal Soofi, president of the Res­earch Society of International Law, told Dawn.
The dispute over West Bank or East Jerusalem, notwithstanding, there is no legal doctrine to validate scripture-based territorial claims. Borders in the modern state system can only be changed by treaty or mutual deal.
“Arab leaders don’t expect Israel to cross the Jordan River, but the real question is whether the West Bank will be fully annexed. The full annexation of the West Bank would be a problem for normalisation,” said Adam Weinstein of the Quincy Institute’s Middle East Programme.
That is why the joint statement framed the issue in legal terms besides noting that such remarks contradict the stated vision of de-escalation and a political settlement leading to an independent Palestinian state.
Implications for US policy
For Washington, the implications go beyond one interview.
American influence in the Middle East does not run on aircraft carriers alone; it is anchored in the carefully maintained belief that Washington, despite its tilt towards Israel, still values stability. Egypt’s strategic location, Jordan’s role, Saudi Arabia’s oil leverage and the Gulf states’ security partnerships, all rest on that understanding.
If the Arab public concludes that US quietly supports territorial expansionist visions, their governments will face a higher political cost in sustaining cooperation with Washington. The consequences may not lead to dramatic breakups, but may yield hesitation, reduced diplomatic flexibility, and greater openness to other powers such as China and Russia.
Trust in this region is thin and expensive. Once eroded, it cannot be easily restored.
Mr Huckabee later attempted to clarify what he said. He argued that Israel does not want such territory and that his remarks were theological, not policy-related.







On social media, he also denounced the so-called Khazar theory as an “odious conspiracy theory” and accused “Islamist accounts” run from countries like Pakistan and Turkiye of spreading false smears about Israel. In doing so, he reframed the backlash as the product of anti-Semitic disinformation. By naming Pak­istan and Turkiye, both signatories to the con­demnation, he personalised the dispute.
That may satisfy the domestic audience in US, but it will do little to calm the Middle East, or even wriggle his government out of the tight spot he has put it in.
“The Ambassador’s statement has placed his sending state in a precarious position. Should the government endorse… this irresponsible statement… [it] would potentially incur significant costs… Conversely, if the government disavows his comment… he would have demonstrably exceeded his authority as an envoy under the Vienna Convention,” Mr Soofi explained.
In such a scenario, dissociation from his irresponsible views would necessitate his removal as an envoy as a minimum measure,” he maintained.

The capital Kyiv, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified assaults amid freezing winter temperatures.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said of the attack on social media, adding that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway.” The intense barrage came the same day Hungary said it would block the EU’s latest package of sanctions against Russia, unless Ukraine re-opens a key oil pipeline that supplies the country.

Drone attacks prompt suspension of operations at Moscow airports for hours

Ukraine says the Druzhba pipeline that crosses its territory to deliver Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary was damaged late January by Russian strikes.

 

In Kyiv and its region, the Sunday overnight strikes killed one man and wounded a dozen more, among them four children, Ukraine’s national police said.
This news agency saw rescuers sifting through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Kyiv’s suburb of Sofiivska Borshchagivka.
“I felt the building shaking. It was clearly a hit, and the force (of the explosion) was strong. I jumped up because my dog got scared too,” Olga, a 48-year-old woman who lives in the settlement, said.
Anton, also from the area, said there were no military installations in Sofiivska Borschagivka. “Only people live here — schools, kindergartens, private houses — so it’s definitely not connected to any military facilities or any kind of industry,” he said.
Moscow airports
Moscow airports were back in operation on Sunday evening after hours-long suspensions imposed by aviation regulator Rosaviatsia over drone attacks which the city’s mayor said had been repelled.
Rosaviatsia said all major Moscow airports were open for arrivals and departures, subject to consultation with authorities.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, in a succession of posts on Telegram, said 20 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed or intercepted en route to Moscow from about 3pm.
‘Act of terrorism’
The Russian army said it had carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine’s military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
The Russian bombardment on Ukr­aine, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heigh­tened vigilance across the country, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine’s energy ministry said consumers in six eastern and southeastern region were without power after the strikes.
Authorities in Russia’s western Belgorod region, meanwhile, said two man died after a Ukrainian drone strike. Poland’s Operational Command said it scrambled jets after detecting “long-range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
In one attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western Ukrainian city near the Polish border far from the front line that has been largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break-in. Hours later, law enforcement said it had detained a Ukrainian woman suspected of carrying out the bomb attack, adding that an investigation was ongoing.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” mayor Andriy Sadovyi said. Ukraine’s interior ministry later said “there is every reason to believe that the crime was committed on the orders of Russia”.

ISLAMABAD: Amid alerts already raised by two key federal ministries, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has invited expert and public opinion on a rather quick and upfront four-year payback period for a $432 million government-to-government inve­stment bet­ween state-owned entities of Pakistan and Azerbaijan in the oil sector.
Ogra has scheduled a public hearing for March 2 and sought comments from stakeholders, including the general public, on “whether the proposed payback period of four years is justified” and whether the project would affect regional transportation costs compared to existing road movement.
The project has to mostly use local resources and dollar-based returns to cover full investment in four years, which has already been objected to by the Ministry of Finance.
The proposal involves a 20-inch, 256-kilometre pipeline from Faisalabad to Thallian (Section I) near Islamabad to carry about seven million tonnes per annum (MTPA), extendable to 10 MTPA.
It would then convert to a 12-inch line for 172km to Tarujabba near Peshawar (Section II) with a capacity of five MTPA, and an eight-inch, 9km line from Thallian to Faqirabad (Section III).
The cost of Section I has been put at $320m, followed by $94m for Section II and $17.5m for Section III. According to Ogra, the project life is 30 years.
The regulator has also sought public input on whether the claimed throughput volumes are fair and justified, whether the proposed capacities for the three pipeline sections can handle the intended volumes over the project life, and whether the proposed storage capacity — 60,000 tonnes each at Faisalabad and Thallian and 50,000 tonnes at Tarujabba — is appropriate for the projected throughput.
The project cost cleared by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet five months ago was $300m, while two ministries had raised reservations over guaranteed returns in dollar terms on the transportation of petroleum products.
The Machike-Thallian-Tarujabba white oil pipeline is to be developed on a government-to-government basis with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR, the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and Pakistan State Oil through a joint project company. The project, being pursued as a “strategic investment” from Azerbaijan, has long been pushed by the FWO through local resources.
The ECC had “approved the terms and conditions” proposed by the Petroleum Division to enable the launch of this strategic project, which was expected to strengthen bilateral friendship, trade and investment ties between Pakistan and Azerbaijan by the end of August 2025.
Power Minister Awais Leghari had cautioned against guaranteed return in dollar terms, saying the government should have learnt lesson from the experience of independent power producers (IPPs).
He advocated that “all aspects of the investment proposal should be checked thoroughly for cost and internal rate of return (IRR), keeping in view the instance of independent power producers”, according to official minutes of the meeting.
SOCAR had set a “ship or pay” condition for investment in the project on the pattern of “take or pay” in power purchase agreements with independent power producers that required full payment for the pipeline capacity (about 7-8 MPTA) even if petroleum products are unable to be moved for some reason.
Moreover, the Ministry of Finance raised questions over the upfront payback period and noted that “dollarised return was being considered only in the context of foreign investment and should not be applicable in the event that foreign investment does not materialise”.
There was a view that returns being secured for foreign investment could not be allowed on local investment, and payback should be of a longer term.
The Ministry of Finance also demanded rationalising the interest rate assumptions, a more rational weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and an increase in payback period to seven years instead of four to avoid a higher tariff impact at the early stages of the project.
It also wanted the Petroleum Division to finalise the technical details relating to inland freight equalisation margin and declaration of default mode of transport, instead of Ogra, considering the peculiar needs of the sector.
However, the Petroleum Division argues that such amendments would make the key project unattractive.
Therefore, the ECC has overruled the finance ministry’s demand for rationalising payouts and containing other liabilities as well as the power minister’s views and “observed that the project would open new vistas for future investment and hence, must be seen in a larger strategic perspective and be understood as an investment opportunity”, according to the official record.
The FWO had originally sought 14.6 per cent IRR and 25pc equity IRR.
The ECC has, nevertheless, agreed to the cautions to the extent that “dollarised return would be applicable only in the event of foreign investment coming into the project”.
At present, approximately 70pc of petrol and diesel is transported by road, whereas 28pc is being moved through an existing pipeline from Karachi to Machike and 2pc is carried by railway.
A revised version also provided for guaranteed quantities for oil transportation, for which Ogra would allow a transportation tariff. The tariff will be in US dollars with optimal utilisation of pipeline capacity in “default mode of transportation”.
Under this, all oil marketing companies would be bound to commit minimum annual pipeline volumes and shortfall would be covered against their inland freight equalisation margin.
According to the agreed mechanism, Ogra will design a regulatory framework to ensure optimal utilisation of the pipeline by declaring it a default mode of transportation.

A senior police officer said the armed men barged into the construction company’s camp in Mula area, some 60 km from Khuzdar, and kidnapped 11 workers including a project manager.
“Six labourers belonged to Sindh province who were working with the com­pany while five others are residents of Khuzdar and other areas of the province,” the police official said.
He said the armed men attempted to take away arms and ammunition of the police station but police personnel offered resistance, forcing the kidnappers to flee.
Six out of 11 labourers have been identified as Project Manager Gul Sher, Ghulam Sarwar, Abdul Malik Bugti, Maulana Bakhsh, Muhammad Irfan and Ikhtiar.
Security forces reached the area after getting information of the incident and launched a search operation in the area. However, no arrest of kidnappers or recovery of labourers was reported despite the passage of 24 hours.
The second kidnapping incident took place in Barkhan district where officials said over 30 armed men attacked the crushing plant in Dhola Nadi area and after damaging the plant they kidnapped three workers and fled from the area.
“Armed men abducted three labourers working at the crashing plant in Musakhail area,” Barkhan deputy commissioner Abdullah Khosa said, adding that the kidnappers also damaged the plant.
They also took away three police personnel posted at a check post along with their weapons.
Soon after the incident, SSP Barkhan Dr Saad Afridi reached the area along with a heavy police contingent and launched a search operation.
“Prompt response of the police forced the armed men to release the kidnapped police personnel and escape to nearby mountains along with three labourers,” the SSP said, adding that the operation is continuing in the mountainous area. “Soon the labourers will be recovered,” he said.

After a counter-attacking 63 by David Miller and some late hitting from Tristan Stubbs took South Africa to 187-7, the defending champions were all out for 111 in 18.5 overs, failing badly in their first chase of the tournament.
Left-arm quick Marco Jansen finished with 4-22, while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 as the South African bowlers exposed India’s fragile batting line-up.
“Great performance. Very different type of wicket to what we’ve had here, so great to see the boys assess that pretty early and adapt their skills to execute their plans,” said South Africa captain Aiden Markram.
“We’re really pumped for the bowling group. They’ve been working hard, started the comp a bit tough, but the way they rocked up tonight was a great effort.” Hot favourites to defend their crown on home soil, India will need to win their two remaining Super Eight games against Zimbabwe and the West Indies to have a chance of qualifying.
But the magnitude of the defeat means they will take a poor net run rate forward and that could prove pivotal if their Super Eights group is tight.
“We bowled really well, but we could have batted a little better,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav.

Fans silenced
“Sometimes you’ve got to think, if you’re chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it.
“We lost too many wickets in the power play.” Both teams were unbeaten in group phase and the game was a rematch of the 2024 T20 World Cup final in Barbados, which India won.
India’s unbeaten run in the tournament had stretched back to their defeat in the semi-final against eventual winners England in 2022.
South Africa struck immediately in India’s chase when Markram opened the bowling and dismissed Ishan Kishan with his off-spin.
Abhishek Sharma got his first runs of the tournament, after three ducks, with a four off Markram to get the 82,000 crowd on their feet in the cavernous stadium, which has a reported capacity of 130,000.
The joy of Indian fans was short-lived, and they were silenced as left-arm quick Marco Jansen had Tilak Varma caught behind for one in the next over and removed the left-handed Abhishek for 15.
India needed a partnership, but Corbin Bosch dismissed Washington Sundar and Suryakumar, who toe-ended to midwicket, as the hosts slumped to 51-5.
Left-arm spinner Maharaj took three wickets in one over to dismiss Hardik Pandya (18), Rinku Singh (0) and Arshdeep Singh (one) to shut the door on India.
Shivam Dube made 42 at the end, but it was too little too late, and when he fell off Jansen, last man Jasprit Bumrah followed the next ball.
Batting first after winning the toss, South Africa slipped to 20-3 before Miller and Dewald Brevis, who hit 45, put on 97, to guide South Africa to 187-7.
Tristan Stubbs had a late cameo that saw him crash an unbeaten 44 off 24 balls and launch the final two balls of the innings both for six off Pandya.
India’s Jasprit Bumrah took 3-15.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22094546e08ecf3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974894/over-80-terrorists-killed-as-armed-forces-strike-7-camps-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border' target='_blank'><strong>Over 80 terrorists killed as armed forces strike 7 camps along Pakistan-Afghanistan border</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani airstrikes on Afghanistan killed “more than 80 terrorists,” security sources said on Sunday, in a retaliatory operation against groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.
Pakistan struck seven “terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of [Fitna al Khwarij] and its affiliates and [the Islamic State-Khorasan Province] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting announced in a post early Sunday on the social media platform X.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Security sources said late Sunday evening that, “Last night, Pakistan’s intelligence-based airstrikes destroyed seven centres of Fitna al-Khawarij TTP in three provinces of Nangarhar, Paktika and Khost, in which more than eighty Khawarij have been confirmed killed, while more are expected.”
They added that the centres targeted included “New Centre No. 1 and New Centre No. 2 in Nangarhar, Khwariji Maulvi Abbas Centre in Khost, Khwariji Islam Centre, Khwariji Ibrahim Centre in Nangarhar, and Khwariji Mullah Rahbar and Khwariji Mukhlis Yar in Paktika.”
Per the information ministry, the action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad, one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan.”
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the ministry said.

 

It asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”.
“Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the ministry noted.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security.”
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, stated that the strikes by the “Pakistan Air Force were retribution for the innocent lives lost to terrorism”.
He maintained that the strikes were an “answer to the tears of every mother who has sacrificed her son for the homeland”.
Chaudhry issued a stern warning, stating that while “Pakistan desired peace, it would not make compromises on its safety, land, and people”.
“Whoever looks at us with evil intent, we will destroy them, and no one will be spared,” the minister said.







Kabul protests
Meanwhile, the Taliban regime in Kabul called the strikes a violation of its sovereignty, saying “an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”, Reuters reported.
The news agency quoted the Afghan foreign ministry as saying that it had summoned Pakistan’s ambassador over what it described as violations of Afghan airspace and the bombing of civilians, calling the strikes “a provocative act”.
A Taliban spokesperson also claimed the attacks had killed and injured dozens of people, but Pakistani authorities termed such claims a “false and malicious narrative designed to create cover for terrorist sanctuaries”.
They maintained that TTP terrorists routinely blended into civilian areas and used non-combatants as human shields, adding that Pakistan’s operational planning accounted for this, and forces took measures to reduce or eliminate any collateral damage.
They described the actions as a “limited, proportionate response to an ongoing terror wave”, which saw mass casualty attacks inflicted on Pakistani civilians and security forces.
Photos from Nangarhar’s Bihsud district – one of the locations Afghan authorities claim were targeted by Pakistan – showed people using a bulldozer to search to clear the rubble of a destroyed building, which was being guarded by Taliban fighters.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.

 

Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
Not the first time
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-22 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22195101c24db62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975003/claim-about-pakistan-paying-interest-on-external-loans-of-up-to-8pc-is-misleading-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Claim about Pakistan paying interest on external loans of up to 8pc is ‘misleading’: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Finance on Sunday dismissed claims that Pakistan was paying up to eight per cent interest on external loans as “misleading,” clarifying that public external debt interest outflows rose by 80.4 per cent between fiscal years 2022 and 2025, not 84pc.
The ministry issued a clarification in response to “recent press commentary” on Pakistan’s external debt, saying the figures cited needed context to provide an “accurate and comprehensive understanding” of the country’s debt and interest payments.
“Pakistan’s total external debt and liabilities currently stand at $138 billion. This figure, however, encompasses a broad range of obligations, including public and publicly guaranteed debt, debt of public sector enterprises (both guaranteed and non-guaranteed), bank borrowings, private-sector external debt, and intercompany liabilities to direct investors,” the statement said.
“It is therefore important to distinguish this aggregate figure from external public (government) debt, which amounts to approximately $92bn,” it added.
It said that of total external public debt, nearly 75pc comprised “concessional and long-term financing” obtained from multilateral institutions (excluding the International Monetary Fund) and bilateral development partners.
Only about 7pc of this debt consists of commercial loans, while another 7pc relates to long-term Eurobonds, it added.
“In light of this composition, the claim that Pakistan is paying interest on external loans of ‘up to 8pc’ is misleading. The overall average cost of external public debt is approximately 4pc, reflecting the predominantly concessional nature of the borrowing portfolio,” it stated
With respect to interest payments, it clarified that public external debt interest outflows increased from $1.99bn in fiscal year 2022 to $3.59bn in fiscal year 2025, representing an increase of 80.4pc, not 84pc as reported.
“In absolute terms, interest payments rose by $1.60bn over this period, not $1.67bn.”
The finance ministry also referred to the State Bank of Pakistan’s records, saying the total debt servicing payments to specific creditors during the period under reference were as follows: the IMF received $1.50bn, of which $580 million constituted interest; Naya Pakistan Certificates payments totaled $1.56bn, including $94m in interest; the Asian Development Bank received $1.54bn, including $615m in interest; the World Bank received $1.25bn, including $419m in interest; and external commercial loans amounted to nearly $3bn, of which $327m represented interest payments.
“While interest payments have increased in absolute terms, this rise cannot be attributed solely to an expansion in the debt stock.
Although the overall debt stock has increased slightly since fiscal year 2022, the additional inflows have primarily originated from concessional multilateral sources and the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) under the ongoing IMF-supported programme,” it maintained.
The finance ministry said that during 2022–23, Pakistan had faced heightened balance of payments pressures, which led to foreign exchange reserves falling below one month of import cover.
“In response, the government entered into an IMF EFF arrangement and mobilised financing from multilateral and other concessional partners. These measures played a critical role in rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and strengthening the country’s external account position.”
It further said that the increase in interest payments reflected prevailing global interest rate dynamics.
“In response to the inflation surge of 2021–22, the US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate from 0.75-1.00pc in May 2022 to 5.25–5.50pc by July 2023.
Although rates have since moderated to around 3.75 pc, they remain significantly higher than 2022 levels. This global monetary tightening has kept international borrowing costs elevated and contributed to higher external interest payments,” the finance ministry said.
It concluded that the government remained committed to prudent debt management, transparency, and the continued strengthening of Pakistan’s macroeconomic stability.
“Accurate representation of debt statistics is essential to informed public discourse, and stakeholders are encouraged to consider the full context of Pakistan’s external debt structure and evolving global financial conditions.”</p><small>2026-02-22 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/221639366419d07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974999/mqm-p-terms-resolution-passed-by-sindh-assembly-against-any-new-province-unconstitutional' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P terms resolution passed by Sindh Assembly against any new province ‘unconstitutional’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Sunday assailed the PPP-led Sindh government for moving a resolution in the provincial assembly against the creation of any new province, terming it “unconstitutional”.
On Saturday, the Sindh Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution declaring Karachi an “inseparable part” of the province and opposing any move that suggested otherwise.
Subsequently, on Sunday, MQM-P Convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui — flanked by Farooq Sattar, Mustafa Kamal and Senator Faisal Subzwari — addressed a press conference in Karachi on the development.
“Yesterday, a resolution against the Constitution of Pakistan was passed by one assembly of Pakistan,” Siddiqui said at the outset of his speech.
“A province had carried itself as if it were a separate country,” Siddiqui, also the federal education minister, said while referring to Sindh.
The MQM-P leader asked the public and the “intellectuals” of Sindh whether any province could pass a resolution that “went against the Constitution”.
“This [resolution] challenged Pakistan, its Constitution, its law and its state,” he remarked, noting that it was being done by the party that had been in power in the province for the past 17 years.



Siddiqui contended that Article 239 of the 1973 Constitution provided the procedure for establishing new provinces.
“This resolution is not against any demand of ours but against Pakistan’s Constitution, its state, presence and the PPP leader (Bhutto),” he said.
The MQM-P leader also referred to Articles 246 and 248 of the Constitution, which he said gave presidential powers for “extraordinary circumstances”.
He recalled that the MQM-P had demanded the empowerment of local governments even at the time of the 26th Amendment, when “the Pakistani state, government and democracy were in dire need of us”.

 

Siddiqui emphasised that the solution to the issue was “dialogue, not threats”.
“What fear made you table this resolution?” he asked, asserting that no demand ever made by the MQM-P was in violation of the Constitution.
“The incident and trauma that Pakistan suffered in 1970, a show of solidarity had to be made after that. Then what happened? The Punjab Assembly declared Urdu its provincial language. Sarhad (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and Balochistan also chose Urdu as their provincial language,” he said.
However, Sindh, he said, was the only province which didn’t do so because the ruling party here had “other dreams and intentions, which have been proved today.”
“As long as we are here, every dream of establishing Sindhudesh will be shattered,” he declared. “As long as we are here, we cannot let this happen.”
Speaking about Pakistan’s electoral history, he said that in the elections of the 1970s, there wasn’t a single candidate representing the PPP from West Pakistan, i.e. 55 per cent of the country, declaring itself a lingual party. Only 1.5 provinces had PPP representation.
“Today, a party with a manufactured majority has held control of Sindh since 1972. I want to ask the state of Pakistan: is there any other province where such segregation exists along linguistic lines? In 1970, the quota system was not merely an administrative arrangement; it was structured on the basis of language.”
Siddiqui then questioned the prime minister, the president, the state of Pakistan, the courts, and the nation at large, asking whether the kind of treatment meted out to Sindh’s cities has ever been seen in any other part of Pakistan. He said that whenever anyone raises their voice for their rights in Sindh, they are branded as traitors.
He further said that the MQM-P had “never made any demands that go against the interests of Pakistan,” adding that when their founding leader made remarks against the country, he was separated from the MQM, stressing that for the party leaders, it is Pakistan first, then MQM.
The resolution
On Saturday, the Sindh Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution declaring Karachi an “inseparable part” of the province and opposing any move that suggested otherwise.
The resolution, tabled by CM Murad and passed with a majority, stated that the House “unequivocally condemns and rejects any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”.
“Karachi is, and shall forever remain, an integral and inseparable part of Sindh,” it declared.
The chief minister’s move comes after MQM-P repeatedly called for the Centre’s intervention in Karachi, demanding that the metropolis be made a “federal territory”.
The resolution urged “all political stakeholders to refrain from divisive rhetoric or actions that threaten provincial harmony and national cohesion”.
It reaffirmed that the “unity, territorial integrity, and historic identity of Sindh are sacred trusts inherited from our forefathers and shall be defended through constitutional, democratic, and political means”.
The resolution stated that the Sindh Assembly stood “united — beyond party lines — in defence of Sindh’s integrity, dignity, and unbroken legacy”.</p><small>2026-02-22 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/221737033798efa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975000/nadra-to-issue-cnics-for-first-time-registrants-without-birth-certificate' target='_blank'><strong>Nadra to issue CNICs for first-time registrants without birth certificate</strong></a><br><p>The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) announced that it would issue Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs) to those seeking first-time registration without a birth certificate, a statement said on Sunday.
The time-bound facility for first-time registration would be valid until December 31, 2026, and would be subject to strict verification conditions.
“This facilitation has been approved under Section 5(1)(b) and Section 20 of the Nadra Ordinance, 2000, read with Rule 8 of the Nadra NIC Rules, 2002, which permit alternative verification mechanisms in specified categories”, the statement said.
It added that the CNIC issuance under this framework would be allowed only where identity was established through NADRA’s existing records and mandatory biometric verification of already registered immediate family members.
Per the statement, for a married woman aged 18 years or above, a valid local government Nikah Nama, a valid CNIC or National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) of either parent, a valid CNIC or NICOP of the husband, and biometric verification of one parent and the husband would be mandatory.
For an unmarried female aged 18 years or above, the husband-related condition would not apply; however, a valid CNIC or NICOP of either parent and biometric verification of one parent would be mandatory, it stated.
For a male applicant above 24 years of age, the statement said, issuance would be allowed only where either parent holds a valid CNIC or NICOP, and at least one sibling also holds a valid CNIC or NICOP, with mandatory biometric verification of one parent.
However, it added that where both parents or the husband were deceased, but their records existed within Nadra, the authorised officer might grant exemption from biometric verification, subject to record-based linkage and satisfactory verification checks.
“To further facilitate applicants, non-smart CNICs applied for under the normal category shall be issued under this framework without any fee,” Nadra said.
Once recorded in the National Identity System, parentage, date of birth and place of birth shall be irrevocable and non-changeable, it warned.
The statement, therefore, advised citizens to ensure the accuracy of all information at the time of registration.
Eligible applicants were also urged to approach the nearest Nadra registration centre to avail time-bound facilitation.</p><small>2026-02-22 12:44</small></div><hr>
