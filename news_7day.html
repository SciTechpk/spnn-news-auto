The Arctic region is on the frontline of global warming, heating up four times faster than the rest of the planet since 1979, according to a 2022 study in scientific journal Nature.
“The melting rate of the Greenland ice sheet by, from a preliminary analysis, a factor of 17… means the Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise is higher than it would have otherwise been without this heat wave,” one of the authors of the report, Friederike Otto, associate professor in climate science at the Imperial College London, told reporters.
“Without climate change this would have been impossible,” she said.
 
 

In Iceland, the temperature exceeded 26 degrees Celsius (79 Fahrenheit) on May 15, unprecedented for that time of year on the subarctic island.
“Temperatures over Iceland as observed this May are record-breaking, more than 13 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991-2020 average May daily maximum temperatures,” the WWA said.
In May, 94 per cent of Iceland’s weather stations registered record temperatures, according to the country’s meteorological institute. In eastern Greenland, the hottest day during the heatwave was about 3.9C warmer compared to the preindustrial climate, the WWA said.
“While a heatwave that is around 20C might not sound like an extreme event from the experience of most people around the world, it is a really big deal for this part of the world,” Otto said.
“It affects the whole world massively,” she said.
According to the WWA, the record highs observed in Iceland and Greenland this May could reoccur every 100 years.
For Greenland’s indigenous communities, the warmer temperatures and melting ice affect their ability to hunt on the ice, posing a threat to their livelihood and traditional way of life.
The changes also affect infrastructure in the two countries.
“In Greenland and Iceland, infrastructure is built for cold weather, meaning during a heatwave ice melt can lead to flooding and damage roads and infrastructure,” the WWA said.</p><small>2025-06-11 05:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/110949572ed49ea.png?r=095748' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916428/8pc-of-uplift-budget-for-climate-change' target='_blank'><strong>8pc of uplift budget for climate change</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a significant move to address growing challenges of climate change, the federal government on Tuesday allocated 6.9 per cent of the current budget and 8.2pc of the development budget for climate-related initiatives in the fiscal year 2025-26.
In addition, the finance minister announced during his budget speech that in order “to discourage use of fossil fuels” and create a funding source for climate adaptation and Green Energy Programmes, the government has proposed the imposition of a Rs2.5 carbon levy per litre of petrol, high-speed diesel and furnace oil, which will be  increased to Rs5 per litre from the next fiscal year.
 
 

Furthermore, a petroleum levy on furnace oil will be imposed as per the government announcement.
According to the Annual Budget Statement, the allocations reflect a strategic shift towards climate-resilient planning, with climate-responsive grants making up 0.2pc and nearly half of all subsidies geared towards climate-related objectives. These interventions aimed to equip the federal government with the tools to make more targeted and impactful decisions in response to climate risks.

Rs2.5 per litre carbon levy proposed on all fuels, will be enhanced to Rs5 next year

A key feature of this year’s budget process was the implementation of the Climate Budget Tagging (CBT) tool, which enabled the classification of climate-sensitive expenditures in line with the National Climate Change Policy. The government, through a consultative process involving multiple stakeholders, successfully tagged more than 5,000 cost centres across three primary categories, along with 40 sub-categories. This data had been integrated into the Sustainable Development Prog­ramme Achievement Program­me (SAP) system for streamlined accounting and reporting.
The budget statement noted that this tagging system would streng­then the government’s ability to monitor and track climate-related spending, with regular reports expected to improve transparency and guide future policy-making.
As per the detailed breakdown, Rs85.43 billion had been allocated for adaptation measures aimed at enhancing climate resilience, Rs603bn for mitigation efforts to reduce emissions and transition to cleaner technologies, and Rs28.33bn for supporting areas, including capacity building, institutional development, and research.
The enhanced climate allocations underscored Pakistan’s commitment to integrating environmental considerations into national development planning, ensuring that economic growth aligned with the country’s climate resilience and sustainability goals.
According to the statement, the federal government had adopted a climate budget as a governance system to mainstream climate considerations into policy decision making. Green budgeting will enable the government in prioritising climate by integrating it into budgeting process to ensure implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting across line ministries and departments.
Separately, Rs2.76bn has been allocated in the budget; from which a major chunk of Rs2.25bn will go to upscaling the Green Pakistan Programme. Besides, Rs325 million has been allocated for strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Climate Change.
Published in Dawn, June 11th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-11 04:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/110927346a05a58.png?r=092745' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916446/ambitious-goals' target='_blank'><strong>Ambitious goals</strong></a><br><p>THE budget for the next financial year, announced on Tuesday, seeks to deepen fiscal consolidation in order to pave the way for a successful second review of the $7bn IMF programme in September.
This is apparent from the significant reduction in the consolidated national fiscal deficit target to 3.9pc of GDP from the original target of 5.9pc. The provinces, which have often been criticised for adding to federal fiscal woes because of their increased share under the NFC award, will contribute cash surplus of nearly Rs1.5tr, up 50pc from the Rs1tr they were required to contribute this year to hold down the national deficit.
Indeed, the government has partially met the income tax relief demand from the salaried classes, but the fiscal space for this is basically provided by savings of Rs1tr in debt payments due to reduced domestic interest rates over the last year. These savings have also allowed the authorities to give relief to powerful real estate lobbies demanding tax concessions.
That said, the budget is disappointing for those who thought the economic stability achieved over the last year and a half would encourage implementation of deeper structural reforms for sustainable economic growth.
There is not much in the budget to give hope for such a structural shift. But that does not mean the document is devoid of good points. For example, it sets into motion long-standing tariff reforms that hopefully will end protections to some rent-seeking industries over the next five years.
 
 

It also seeks to bring non-filers into the net by imposing restrictions, such as on the purchase of securities above a certain threshold, purchase of autos above 850cc, etc. Moreover, it lays the ground for phased removal of sales tax exemptions for industries operating in ex-Fata/Pata to make the playing field even across the country.
Though the finance minister spoke of the hardships of the compliant corporate sector, his budget speech fell short of addressing the issue of inequitable corporate tax rates, a major obstacle to investment and export growth. While the controversial super tax has been reduced marginally, steps to enhance competitiveness and attract foreign investment are absent.
It is primarily because of unfair tax policies and the burden they put on industry, which forms 18pc of the economy but contributes nearly 60pc to overall tax revenues, that large-scale manufacturing has been contracting.
With the government wanting to boost exports to $100bn in five years under its Uraan programme, the goal is likely to remain elusive without increasing industrial productivity and attracting FDI. Many remain sceptical about the government’s ability to achieve next year’s growth target of 4.2pc, due largely to its failure to change the dynamics of a moribund economy. Stability has returned. Will growth follow suit?

In a statement, the ministry said that in continuation of illegal foreigners’ repatriation plan (IFRP), all illegal foreigners were being repatriated and deported to their countries.
It said that the repatriation of Afghan Citizenship Card (ACC) holders alongside unregistered and illegal foreigners commenced from April 1.
The statement further said that 216,103 illegal foreigners had been repatriated since April 1 this year, and the process continues. Under the ambit of IFRP since October 2023, 1,102,441 illegal foreigners were repatriated.
It said that returnees to their respective countries were being treated with dignity, and arrangements for food and healthcare for returning foreigners were already in place.
The ministry further said that those creating hurdles in the repatriation process or were found involved in extending employment, rental property or accommodating in hotels or engaging in businesses with illegal foreigners were liable to be dealt with strictly as per laws.

The government also introduced pension reforms, in a bid to reduce the exp­e­nditure under this head, as it eliminated multiple allowances and limited the family pension period to 10 years in case of the death of the actual beneficiary.
Interestingly, the government did not announce the minimum wage — currently at Rs37,000 — in the federal budget. Previously, the federal government would set a minimum wage threshold and provinces would also follow suit. Moreover, the differently-abled employees would be eligible for a monthly conveyance allowance of Rs6,000 — an increase of Rs2,000.
 
 

Although the budget document showed that the government had proposed a 6 per cent increase in the salaries of government employees, the budget speech by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced a 10 per cent pay hike.

Proposal puts end to multiple allowances, reduces family pension period to 10 years

“Besides reducing tax on salaried class and despite financial constraints, the government has decided to take relief measures for the government employees. Such as a 10 per cent increase in the salaries of government employees (from grade 1 to 22), 7 per cent raise in pension of retired employees, conveyance allowance for differently-abled employees has been increased from Rs4,000 per month to Rs6,000 per month,” the finance minister said.
“Following the constitution regarding equal rights, disparity in salaries is being eliminated and thus there is a proposal of 30 per cent disparity reduction allowance for eligible employees,” the minister said, adding that the country was facing acute security threats and armed forces of the country have rendered remarkable services for the defence of the country’s borders.
“In recognition of their services, there is a proposal of a special relief allowance for armed forces officers, soldiers and JCOs. These expenses will be met under defence budget of the year 2025-26,” he added.
Pension reforms
Talking about pension reforms, the finance minister said the government had introduced some reforms in the sector to diminish the burden on the exchequer. In the last few pension schemes, some changes had been made through executive orders that caused an extra burden on the exchequer, he claimed.
Listing the reforms, he said, “Discouraging early retirement; linking of pension increase with the Consumer Price Index (CPI); after the death of the life partner, the family pension period will be limited to ten years; abolishing of more than one pension; choosing any one of the two — pension or salary in case of re-employment after retirement.”
Mr Aurangzeb noted that there was a proposal to impose 5 per cent tax on pensioners below 70, who were drawing over Rs10 million yearly pension. However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners, he added.
Before the budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presided over the federal cabinet meeting and said that during the last one-and-a-quarter year, the nation faced a hard situation and challenges, but steering the country out of the quagmire was no ordinary achievement.
“The common man and the salaried class gave sacrifices,” the prime minister said, adding that the salaried class was asking the question that they had contributed about Rs400 billion to the national exchequer in the form of taxes and how much the wealthy and opulent had given?

• Military budget jumps to 1.97pc of GDP, up from 1.7pc last year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Tuesday proposed an allocation of Rs2.55 trillion for the country’s armed forces in the fiscal year 2025-26, marking the highest annual increase in defence spending in over a decade, amid heightened tensions with India and last month’s military clashes between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The new allocation represents a 20.2 per cent rise over the previous year’s budget of Rs2.122tr, pushing defence spending to around 1.97pc of GDP — up from 1.7pc last year — as it inches back to 2pc after years of incremental decline. The increase also contrasts with the decline in national spending on health and education in terms of GDP, with figures for the first nine months of the outgoing fiscal year well below 1pc.
The defence spending hike also means a rise in its share of the total federal outlay to 14.51pc, the highest in recent years.
 
 

Presenting the budget in the National Assembly, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb said, “The security situation in the country is precarious and the armed forces have rendered commendable service in protecting the borders.”
The military allocation comes against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions, including clashes with India in May 2025 and a concurrent 9.5pc increase in India’s defence budget to 6.81tr Indian rupees. Internal security operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have also contributed to the rising expenditure on security, though internal security spending is met from a separate budget head.
The Rs2.55tr defence allocation — about $9.18 billion — includes key hikes in operational and infrastructure expenses. Operating costs, which cover fuel, rations, training and medical treatment, are set to rise 37.22pc to Rs704.4bn. Civil works, such as infrastructure development, will increase by 37.4pc to Rs336.5bn.
A 3.8pc increase has been proposed for employee-related expenses, covering salaries and allowances for servicemen, with Rs846.03bn earmarked for this purpose. The finance minister said that officers, junior commissioned officers and soldiers would receive a special relief allowance, funded from within the defence budget.
 
 

Spending on physical assets — covering arms and equipment procurement — is set to climb 20.9pc to Rs663.1bn. Large-scale military acquisitions and funding for the country’s nuclear and missile programs are believed to be channelled through classified allocations not reflected in the published defence budget.
The employee-related expe­n­ses, which account for 33.18pc, remain the largest chunk, though dropping from 39pc in FY25. Operating expenses now take 27.62pc, up from 25pc in the outgoing year.
Physical assets, meanwhile, claim 26pc, which is a slight increase from 25.8pc in 2024-25. Civil works would receive 13.2pc, rising from 11.5pc, underscoring a growing emphasis on military construction and facilities.
Compared to the outgoing year, the share for employee-related expenses has declined by 5.82 percentage points, while operating expenses and civil works have gained 2.62 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, pointing to a reallocation of resources to address heightened security needs amid regional tensions.
Service-wise allocations are as follows: Army, Rs1.17tr (45.9pc of the total); Pakistan Air Force, Rs520.75bn (20.4pc); Navy, Rs265.97bn (10.4pc); and Inter-Services Organisations, Rs498.11bn (19.5pc). All services received around a 15.45pc increase, with the Army’s slightly higher 15.84pc rise.
A closer examination of the defence allocation of Rs 2.55 trillion reveals an unallocated amount of Rs 95.17 billion, as the combined allocation for the Army, PAF, Navy, and Inter-Services Organisations totals Rs 2.45483 trillion. This discrepancy suggests the unallocated funds may be directed toward operational costs not directly tied to specific services.
In addition to the defence budget, Rs1.055tr has been set aside for military pensions — a 4.04pc increase over the previous year. While not part of the defence budget, military pensions constitute roughly 6pc of the total Rs17.573tr federal outlay.
The latest figures suggest a continuing shift away from the decade-long trend of modest annual increases of around 11pc, with the 2025-26 hike being the third consecutive rise from what had become a routine annual raise.
The increase looks to be driven by Pakistan’s evolving security needs, regional dynamics and a push to modernise and maintain readiness across all branches of the military.
Despite the increase, Pakistan’s defence spending remains considerably lower than that of India, whose military expenditure stands at nearly nine times higher in dollar terms.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s April 2025 report, South Asia’s military expenditure continues to rise due to geopolitical rivalries and modernisation initiatives across the region.

• Climate campaigner says she was ‘kidnapped’ in international waters
CAIRO: Israeli gunfire killed at least 17 Palestinians and wounded dozens as thousands of displaced people approached an aid distribution site of a US-backed humanitarian group in central Gaza on Tuesday, local health authorities said.
Medics said the casualties were rushed to two hospitals, the Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, and the Al-Quds in Gaza City, in the north.
The Israeli military said its forces had fired warning shots at “suspects who were advancing in the area of Wadi Gaza and posed a threat to the troops”.
It added that it was aware of reports that several were injured, but said numbers released by local health authorities did not align with the information it had collected.
Separately, local health authorities said an Israeli strike on a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza Strip killed eight people, taking Tuesday’s death toll to at least 25.
The Israeli military said it had intercepted one rocket fired from northern Gaza towards Israeli territories.
Last week the army warned Palestinians not to approach routes leading to sites of the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) between 6pm and 6am local time, describing these roads as closed military zones.
There was no immediate GHF comment on Tuesday’s incident.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, overseeing a new model of aid distribution which the United Nations says is neither impartial nor neutral.
“Day after day, casualties & scores of injured are reported at distribution points manned by Israel & private security companies,” Philippe Lazzarini, the chief of the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), wrote on X.
“This humiliating system continues to force thousands of hungry & desperate people to walk for tens of miles excluding the most vulnerable & those living too far,” he said.
 






While the GHF has said there have been no incidents at its distribution sites, Palestinians seeking aid have described disorder, and access routes to the sites have been beset by chaos and deadly violence.
Thunberg deported
Meanwhile, Israel deported campaigner Greta Thunberg on a flight to Sweden via France on Tuesday, after detaining her along with other activists aboard a Gaza-bound aid boat.
Of the 12 people on board the Madleen carrying food and supplies for Gaza, five French activists were taken into custody after they refused to leave Israel voluntarily.
Israeli forces intercepted the boat, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, in international waters on Monday and towed it to the port of Ashdod.
They then transferred them to Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv, the foreign ministry said, from where Thunberg flew to France ahead of a scheduled flight to Sweden.
On arrival in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, 22-year-old Thunberg accused Israel of “kidnapping us in international waters and taking us against our will to Israel”.
“This is yet another intentional violation of rights that is added to the list of countless other violations that Israel is committing,” she said.
Thunberg, one of the world’s most prominent voices in the fight against climate change, has avoided air travel for years, and once sailed for a fortnight on a zero-emissions yacht to reach a UN summit in New York.
Five French activists who were also aboard the Madleen were set to face an Israeli judge, the French foreign minister said.
“Our consul was able to see the six French nationals arrested by the Israeli authorities last night,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X.
“One of them has agreed to leave voluntarily and should return today. The other five will be subject to forced deportation proceedings.

• Provinces’ contribution helps Centre outperform fiscal target, record lowest budget deficit in a decade
• Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc
• Reduced debt servicing drives expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr
• Generous tax relief, incentives for construction sector
• Fuel levy, electricity surcharges to rise next year
• Tough crackdown planned on non-filers, tax evaders
• Development spending squeezed to cut deficit
ISLAMABAD: Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors, in an effort to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.
At the same time, however, the government announced it was imposing a ‘carbon levy’ of Rs2.5 per litre on petrol, diesel and furnace oil in the upcoming fiscal year, to be doubled the following year. It also introduced a 5 per cent tax on large pensions, an 18pc tax on imported solar panels, and an increase in the debt servicing surcharge on electricity to finance not only interest payments, but also principal debt. Additionally, it announced the gradual elimination of tax exemptions for the tribal areas beginning this year.
Ambitious targets
Despite a record tax shortfall of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the current fiscal year, the finance minister set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr. This would include approximately Rs840 billion in additional revenue measures, on top of a Rs1.39tr automatic tax increase supported by projected inflation of 7.5pc and economic growth of 4.2pc and expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr (equivalent to 2pc of GDP), driven primarily by reduced debt servicing costs, and also at the expense of development and public welfare initiatives.
 


Not only the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), but the provincial governments, too, were unable to meet their commitment of maintaining a Rs1.22tr surplus for the current year. Still, they provided vital support to the federal government with a surplus of Rs1.01tr.
This contribution enabled the federal government to outperform its fiscal target and record a budget deficit of just 5.6pc of GDP (Rs6.44tr) — the lowest in a decade since FY2015-16 — compared to a higher projected deficit of 5.9pc (Rs7.28tr). This notable fiscal tightening was achieved through punishing additional taxation measures amounting to Rs2.2tr (1.8pc of GDP) alongside a reduction in expenditure as interest rates declined from a historic peak of 22pc.
Accordingly, the FY2025–26 budget sets an ambitious target to reduce the budget deficit to 3.9pc of GDP (Rs5.04tr), contingent upon a cash surplus of Rs1.46tr from the provinces. As a result, the primary budget surplus is projected to rise to 2.4pc of GDP, or Rs3.17tr, for the next year — up from this year’s 2.2pc of GDP (Rs2.5tr).
Relief for select groups
The government found sufficient fiscal space to offer some relief to the salaried class, who have been burdened by high tax rates, declining real incomes, and severe inflation over the past two years.
The finance minister proposed a reduction in income tax by half, to 2.5pc, on annual income between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. It is pertinent to mention that there was a discrepancy in the income tax rate for the lowest taxable bracket announced by the finance minister and the tax rate mentioned in the finance bill, which was even lower at 1pc.
 
 

Clarity is awaited on this matter. Similarly, the annual tax on a salary of Rs1.2m was proposed to be reduced to Rs6,000, down from the current Rs30,000. Mr Aurangzeb added that the income tax rate for those earning up to Rs2.2m per annum would be cut to 11pc, down from the current 15pc. Similarly, the tax rate has been reduced to 23pc from 25pc for salaried income between Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m. In addition, the finance minister acknowledged that oppressive tax rates were driving highly skilled professionals to migrate, contributing to a “brain drain”. As a corrective measure, he announced a 1pc reduction in the surcharge on annual incomes exceeding Rs10m.
Apart from this, a 10pc increase in salaries and 7pc rise in pensions was announced for government employees. The salaries of armed forces personnel would also be increased by 25pc, including a special relief allowance in recognition of their recent heroic performance in response to Indian aggression, the finance minister said.
At the same time, the government introduced a generous tax relief and incentives for the construction sector, including access to cheaper mortgage financing, in a bid to revive large-scale manufacturing, which has been contracting for the past three years due to unprecedented increases in energy and borrowing costs. To this end, the finance minister announced a reduction in the withholding tax on the purchase of real estate from 4pc to 2.5pc. The next two current withholding tax rates of 3.5pc and 3pc will also be reduced to 2pc and 1.5pc respectively.
Additionally, a 7pc federal excise duty imposed last year on the transfer of commercial properties, plots and houses has also been proposed to be abolished.
As a new initiative, the budget includes a tax credit on mortgages for homes of up to 10 marla (250 square yards) and flats of up to 2,000 square feet. This is in addition to a new scheme aimed at promoting mortgage financing. The finance minister also announced a reduction in stamp duty on property purchases in Islamabad Capital Territory, from 4pc to 1pc, and expressed hope that provincial governments would follow suit by reducing heavy taxation on immovable property.
The government also succeeded in persuading the IMF to exempt fertilisers and insecticides from taxation for the current year, in an effort to position agriculture as the engine of economic growth.
Tightening the net
On the other hand, the finance minister announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings. However, he clarified that this would not apply to small savers or investments in national saving schemes.
Similarly, digital marketplaces and online businesses are to be brought into the tax net through courier companies, it was announced. The minister also announced a 5pc income tax on pensions exceeding Rs10m per annum for pensioners under the age of 70. In a move to promote a cashless economy, non-filers will now be subject to a 1pc advance tax on cash withdrawals, up from the existing 0.6pc. Taxpaying businesses will be discouraged from making cash sales exceeding Rs200,000. Additional measures have also been introduced to encourage online transactions and digital payments.
 
 

Strict steps will be taken against non-filers. Only taxpayers who submit their wealth statements will be allowed to undertake large financial transactions, such as the purchase of vehicles, immovable properties, securities, mutual funds, or the opening of certain bank accounts.
Tightening the noose around unregistered traders, the finance minister proposed the freezing of bank accounts, restrictions on property transfers, and the sealing of business premises in cases of serious violations of sales tax laws, with the involvement of trade bodies. In the same vein, he also announced a notional 0.5pc reduction in the super tax for corporate firms with annual incomes between Rs200m and Rs500m.
Improved tax collection
The finance minister noted a rise in the tax-to-GDP ratio, which has historically been one of the weakest aspects of Pakistan’s economy, from 8.8pc in June 2024 to 10.3pc in the first nine months of the current year. This figure is projected to reach 10.4pc by June 30, 2025. Including non-tax revenue, the federal tax-to-GDP ratio has improved to 11.6pc, representing an increase of 1.2 percentage points, up from 0.8 percentage points last year. The consolidated tax-to-GDP ratio, the finance minister added, has reached 12.3pc, including a 0.7pc contribution from the provinces. “The 1.6pc of GDP increase in FBR revenue is not only the highest in Pakistan’s history, but is also rarely seen anywhere else in the world in recent times,” the minister boasted.
Balancing the budget
The government has set the non-tax revenue target for the next year at Rs5.15tr, slightly higher than the current year’s Rs4.9tr. This brings the total gross federal revenue (FBR plus non-tax) to Rs19.28tr, up from the current year’s original budget target of Rs17.8tr, which was later revised down to Rs16.8tr. After transferring Rs8.2tr to the provinces, the net federal revenue is estimated to be Rs11.07tr for the next year, compared to Rs9.8tr this year. This leaves a projected federal deficit of Rs6.5tr, a reduction from the current year’s budgeted Rs8.5tr, which was later revised to Rs7.44tr.
Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc to Rs1.19tr for the next year, down from Rs1.38tr in the current year. This is primarily due to a 13pc (Rs154bn) cut in power sector subsidies. The tariff differential subsidy for ex-Wapda distribution companies has been reduced by 9.7pc (Rs27bn) to Rs249bn, from Rs276bn this year. Meanwhile, the tariff subsidy for K-Electric has been cut by 28pc (Rs49bn), to Rs125bn from Rs174bn. An even larger reduction has been applied to the tariff subsidy for Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which has been reduced to Rs74bn from Rs108bn, reflecting a cut of 31.5pc.
The major non-tax revenue item is expected to be the petroleum levy on POL products, projected at Rs1.47tr, which is a 26pc increase from the current year’s Rs1.16tr. An even larger contribution is anticipated from State Bank of Pakistan profits, estimated at Rs2.4tr for the next year, though this marks a slight decline from Rs2.6tr this year.
The debt servicing cost for next year has been estimated at Rs8.2tr, representing an 8pc decline from actual repayments of Rs8.95tr, and 16pc lower than the original budget estimate of Rs9.78tr. Pension expenditure is expected to rise by around 4pc, reaching Rs1.06tr, up from Rs1.01tr this year. Military pensions are projected to grow by 12pc to Rs742bn, compared to a 10pc increase in civil pensions, which are expected to reach Rs243bn.
As a result, total current expenditure has been set at Rs16.29tr for the next year, slightly below this year’s figure of Rs16.39tr.

• There is a major gap between available jobs and skills of jobseekers
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan faces a significant unemployment challenge at 6.3 per cent, particularly impacting the youth aged 15-35, according to budget 2025-26.
Unemployment remains a complex issue and youth joblessness is particularly alarming, with 44.9pc of jobseekers aged 15–24, and female unemployment far exceeding male, the budget document says.
Pakistan, having a substantial domestic labour force of 71.8 million, holds the sixth largest workforce globally. Each year, approximately 2m young Pakistanis join the labour market, contributing to an expanding talent pool. There is a significant gap between the demand and supply of workers, especially, a serious mismatch between the jobs demanded and the supply of skills and trained manpower in the country. Pakistan’s labour market faces significant challenges, particularly concerning youth unemployment, gender disparities, and the need for skill development.
These trends are exacerbated by a mismatch between educational outcomes and labour market needs, especially in rural and underserved regions. It also reflects deep-rooted issues such as limited access to quality education, insufficient job creation, and gender inequality in economic participation.
Pakistan is a country of 241.5m population (Population Census 2023) with annual growth rate of 2.55pc echoes demographic expansion which may increase unemployment rate further. Pakistan’s population is characterised by a high proportion of youth, presenting both opportunities and challenges for its future. The latest labour force survey shows that the total youth population (15-29 years) is close to 62.58m (26pc) population. Additionally, 40pc of the population falls in the age group between 0-14 years, implying that the youth population will continue to rise. The Pakistan Demographic (2020) reports that by 2030 out of a total estimated population of 280m, 100m will be youth.
The budget document says that around 0.8m semi-skilled, skilled and highly skilled Pakistanis proceed abroad for employment annually.
The government has launched several initiatives to tackle these issues, including commitments to continued fiscal consolidation under the new IMF programme, planned privatisations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), reforms of power distribution companies, and an accelerated business regulatory reform agenda.

• Up to 80pc tax relief for salaried individuals earning Rs600,000-1.2m annually
• Minimal relief for top salary brackets earning above Rs4.1m
• 1pc surcharge reduction for income above Rs10m to curb brain drain
• Super tax cut by 0.5pc for companies earning Rs200m-500m
• Pensions above Rs10m to be taxed at 5pc
• Cash withdrawal tax for non-filers increased to 1pc from 0.6pc
ISLAMABAD: The government has announced sweeping tax reforms in the federal budget 2025-26, offering tax cuts of up to 80 per cent for low-income salaried individuals while limiting relief for higher earners to just 3pc. A new 5 per cent tax has also been proposed on high-value pensions exceeding Rs10 million annually.
The focus of the budget seems to balance sectoral rel­ief, expand tax scope, achieve equitable burden-sharing, and introducing strong enf­orcement measures. The government expects the digital taxation framework, carbon levies and tax enforcement on e-commerce and digital transactions to help Pakistan adapt to global financial regulation standards.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said tax relief measures total Rs60 billion for salaried individuals, Rs2.4bn for the corporate sector, and Rs60bn in exemptions for fertilisers and pesticides.
 
 

To achieve the proposed tax collection target of Rs14.131 trillion, the autonomous tax growth is projected at Rs1.34tr in FY26 based on the GDP growth target of 4.2pc and inflation rate of 7.5pc.
With the current year’s revenue collection of Rs11.5tr and autonomous growth of Rs1.345tr, revenue collection will reach Rs12.845tr in FY26 without any new tax or enforcement measures.
Tied to its commitments under the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF) programme, the government introduces additional revenue measures of Rs1.05tr, including new tax measures of Rs655bn and another Rs400bn through enforcement.
Enforcement measures
The Finance Bill also proposes Section 114C, which introduces a framework to restrict high-value economic transactions — such as purchase of vehicles, immovable property and securities — for individuals and entities, who have not filed income tax returns or cannot justify their financial capacity through formally declared resources.
By mandating that, only “eligible persons” with sufficient declared assets can engage in such transactions.
A new Section 175AA is proposed to be inserted into the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, empowering the FBR to share tax-related information of high-risk persons with scheduled banks.
This includes details such as turnover, income (including taxable income) for one or more tax years, identification data (including bank account numbers) declared in income tax returns, wealth statements, financial statements, or any other document submitted to the FBR, along with data-based algorithms as may be prescribed.
Salaried class
The salary exemption limit has remained unc­h­anged at Rs50,000 per month. However, the government has now proposed a reduction in tax rates for annual income up to Rs3,200,000 to provide rel­ief to people in lower- and middle-income brackets. Sim­ilarly, the surcharge rate has been proposed to be reduced to 9pc from 10pc for salaried individuals only.
Taxpayers earning between Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m annually will now face a 1pc tax rate, down from 5pc, offering up to 80pc tax reduction.
 
 

For annual incomes between Rs1.2m and Rs2.2m, the rate will drop to 11pc from 15pc (on the amount exceeding Rs1.2m), and the fixed sum reduced to Rs6,000 from Rs30,000. For a salary of Rs150,000 per month, this translates to a 48pc reduction in tax liability.
For annual salaries bet­ween Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m, the rate drops from 25pc to 23pc (on the income exceeding Rs2.2m) and the fixed sum to Rs116,000 from Rs180,000.
No percentage change was made for the remaining two slabs except reductions in the fixed sums.
Those earning between Rs3.2m and Rs4.1m per year will see their fixed tax reduced to Rs346,000 from Rs430,000, though the income exceeding Rs3.2m will still be taxed at 30pc.
For people earning more than Rs4.1m annually, the fixed sum has been reduced to Rs616,000 from Rs700,000, but the tax rate on income exceeding Rs4.1m will remain 35pc.
A 1pc surcharge reduction is proposed for individuals earning above Rs10m to discourage skilled professionals from emigrating. Meanwhile, pensioners drawing over Rs10m annually will now be taxed at 5pc.
Other key measures
The income tax and withholding tax exemption for the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions has been proposed to be extended to June 30, 2026.
Withholding tax on property purchases has been lowered across brackets — from 4pc to 2.5pc, 3.5pc to 2.5pc, and 3pc to 1.5pc — and Federal Excise Duty on commercial property transfers has been abolished (previously up to 7pc).
The interest income tax rate will rise from 15pc to 20pc, though national savings schemes are exempt.
Rent from commercial properties must be reported at a minimum of 4pc of fair market value unless proven otherwise to the commissioner.
Digital economy
A Digital Transactions Proceeds Levy will apply to all payments for goods or services delivered via digital platforms. Banks and courier services will act as withholding agents to capture the payment chain.
Withholding tax on cash withdrawals by non-filers rises from 0.6pc to 1pc. For specified services, withholding tax increases from 4pc to 6pc, excluding IT and IT-enabled services.
For non-specified services, a flat 15pc applies; for sportspersons, the rate increases from 10pc to 15pc. The tax rate on profit on debt has been increased from 15pc to 20pc. The dividend tax rate has been enhanced to 25pc and 15pc on dividend from mutual funds.
The government also proposes removing the Rs5m cap on profit from debt under the final tax regime for individuals and associations of persons  though companies will retain the adjustable tax.
Sales tax measures
The government also proposes an 18pc sales tax on the sales of imported solar panels.
Hybrid cars will also be subject to an 18pc sales tax, aligning them with petrol and diesel vehicles. A 10pc sales tax on goods will now be gradually imposed over the next five years in the sales tax-exempt provinces, i.e. ex-Fata region and Balochistan.
Under the proposed regime, payment intermediaries (banks, financial institutions, exchange companies, and payment gateways) will collect sales tax on digital payments, while couriers will handle tax collection for cash on delivery transactions. Additionally, the withholding tax rate is set to increase from 1pc to 2pc.
Sales tax has been extended to items like pet food, chocolates and cereal bars in retail packs. Rate on vermicelli and sheermaal has been increased from 10pc to 18pc. The 10pc tax on bun and rusk supply has been withdrawn.
The government has imposed 18pc sales tax on supplies, imports and import of plant and machinery by the industrial units located in the erstwhile Fata and Pata.

Still, stakeholders are complaining that it ignored many more demands that it had previously promised it would consider.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday acknowledged before parliament that the agriculture sector, responsible for 24 per cent of Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), had not performed well last year. He assured, however, that the government has extended it a helping hand not only to get it back on its feet, but to keep it up and running.
“Though [this is] a provincial subject, the prime minister has constituted a national committee for consultations with the provinces to [find ways to] improve it.”
Sectoral loans have risen from Rs1,785 billion in the first 10 months of the last fiscal year to Rs2,066 in the corresponding period of this year, the minister said. Keeping in view the rising demand, the federal government will be starting a ‘Clean Financing Facility’ to provide farmers up to Rs100,000 without collateral, with the money transferred directly to their e-wallets. The government has also planned a National Seed Development and Regulatory Authority that will help develop standardised seeds which can withstand climatic changes and improve yields.

Pesticides, fertilisers to remain exempt from sales tax, but reviving sectoral growth an uphill task

Though cotton, one of the most important crops, has suffered during the last few years, there was some improvement noticed during the outgoing fiscal year, the finance minister said. The government plans to capitalise on this improvement by allocating over Rs4 billion to 10 ongoing and five new schemes for agricultural improvement. Under the Green Pakistan Initiative, farmers will be helped in diversifying crops, meeting yield gaps, and gaining better access to markets. The government is also sending 1,000 agriculture graduates to China for training in modern agriculture; a batch of 300 students has already been sent under the programme, the finance minister said.
Farmers, however, are less impressed. Explaining their annoyance, Khalid Khokhar of the Pakistan Kissan Ittehad said the sector had registered a massive contraction in the outgoing year and its paltry growth (of 0.56pc) was attributable mainly to the livestock sector; otherwise, the final figure would have been deep in red territory.
Mr Khokhar wondered how the sector could grow by 4.5pc when the budgetary philosophy and allocations did not seem to support that target. “Seed improvement is a slogan, but where is the money to realise it?” he asked. “The government has pulled out of the market – refusing to fix procurement price and procure wheat, but where is the alternative arrangement? Are hoarders and stockists now the answer?” he added.
“Take it from me, next year will be worse if corrective measures, which are not visible in this budget, are not taken,” he concluded, adding that “not slapping GST on fertiliser and pesticides is a big relief, but it is not enough to help revive the sector.”
Separately, a Punjab government official regretted what he described as ‘federal insensitivity’, complaining that the budget had fulfilled only one of many promises. “The federation had also promised to cut duties on farm machinery, which is badly needed by the sector; reduce, as far as it could, fertiliser prices; and spearhead research and development initiatives. [Instead], it hid behind jargon and small concessions to escape responsibility, which can only be regretted. Avoiding GST on two inputs, however, is a welcome step,” he added.

The three-day visit will be the latest in a series of high-level exchanges between Islamabad and Washington amid a fragile regional security climate following last month’s military standoff between India and Pakistan.
Led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, the delegation includes senior Federal Board of Revenue officials and representatives of the energy and information technology sectors. They will hold meetings with counterparts at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, focusing on trade imbalances, tariff adjustments, and sectoral cooperation.
Diplomatic sources confirmed that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was scheduled to visit Washington by June 29. His visit would launch the first round of official discussions on the recent Indian military ‘misadventure’. Mr Dar is expected to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior officials to discuss regional security, post-conflict diplomacy, and broader strategic cooperation.

Commerce, IT, energy, FBR officials to be part of trade delegation due in US this week; PTI plans protests

PTI plans protests on 14th
While official dates for these visits are being withheld due to political sensitivities, the PTI, which has long opposed the current Pakistani establishment, has announced plans to stage large-scale demonstrations during the visit.
In a tweet posted over the weekend, PTI’s Secretary for Overseas Affairs, Sajjad Burki, called for a protest outside the Pakistan embassy in Washington on June 14, coinciding with the expected presence of senior Pakistani officials in the US capital. “Let the White House know that any deal with this government is not acceptable to the people of Pakistan,” Mr Burki posted, in a message that is also being distributed as pamphlets in Washington’s Pakistani-American neighbourhoods.
 






While the PTI announcement claims that Pakistan’s army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir would visit Washington around the same time, neither the US nor Pakistani officials have confirmed his visit. The ambiguity surrounding his travel plans reflects security concerns and diplomatic caution, especially given the protest plans.
In the wake of last month’s border hostilities, parliamentary delegations from both India and Pakistan visited Washington to present their respective positions. Islamabad has publicly thanked US President Donald Trump for helping arrange a ceasefire and has urged Washington to play a more active role in defusing regional tensions and reviving dialogue on the longstanding Kashmir dispute.

Moreover, the Finance Bill has proposed a tax on social media advertising in Pakistan by foreign e-commerce platforms.
The bill has proposed amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 to add the definitions of e-commerce platforms and “digitally delivered services”.
Under the proposed amendments, e-commerce would include the “sale or purchase of goods and services” through “websites, mobile applications or online marketplaces”.

In a consequential move, govt looks to tax foreign companies for selling goods, running ads in Pakistan

Meanwhile, digitally delivered services would include music, audio and video streaming services, cloud services, online software applications, telemedicine, e-learning, and online banking etc.
As per the proposal, local e-commerce companies will have to pay a tax on every purchase made from their platforms within Pakistan.
For digital payments, a tax rate of 1pc will be charged on payments not exceeding Rs10,000.
For payments between Rs10,000 and Rs20,000, the tax would be 2pc of the gross amount and 0.25pc for over Rs20,000.
If a customer pays for electronic items through cash-on-delivery payments, they will be charged 0.25pc of the gross amount as tax. For clothing items, the rate would be 2pc and 1pc for every other item.
The tax on digital payments will be charged by payment gateways when processing the transactions.
In case of cash on delivery, courier services will collect the amount, inclusive of tax, from customers. As per the law, courier services would include logistics companies, ride-hailing and food delivery platforms and delivery services provided by e-commerce platforms.
New rules for sellers
The bill has also proposed tightening the regulations for online vendors to bring them into the tax net.
“Every online marketplace or courier service … shall not allow any vendor to use its platform services to carry out e-commerce transactions unless such vendors have been registered under the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (VII of 1990) and this Ordinance.”
The provision essentially means that shopkeepers not registered under the Sales Tax Act will not be allowed to sell their goods on online stores.
Foreign vendors
The government has also introduced new taxes on goods purchased online from outside Pakistan.
The new measures, announced by Federal Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in his budget speech, included the promulgation of a new law titled the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025.
It aims to bring online marketplaces that sell to Pakistani customers but have little to no physical presence in the country.
Under section 3 of the proposed law, every foreign vendor with a “significant digital presence in Pakistan” will be charged a tax on goods sold online from outside Pakistan.
Typically, these vendors include online marketplaces such as AliExpress, Temu, and Amazon, among others.
Under the proposed law, customers would be charged 5pc of the amount paid to the vendor for the purchase of goods from a foreign marketplace.
The tax would be collected by banks, financial institutions, or payment gateways that facilitate transactions between customers and the online marketplace.
Customs have been empowered to ensure that goods purchased online from foreign marketplaces are not delivered to customers unless the courier companies provide evidence of tax payment.
Foreign marketplaces will not only have to pay taxes for goods sold to Pakistani customers, but they will also be charged for social media ads run in the country.
As per the proposed law, every foreign vendor who pays “social media platforms or any other online platform for online advertisement in Pakistan” will pay 5pc of the amount paid to social media platforms.
As per the law, payment intermediaries and social media platforms will file quarterly statements on tax deducted and deposited into the government exchequer.
Failure to submit these reports would result in penalties of Rs1 million every quarter.

As the session — chaired by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq — commenced, opposition lawmakers erupted into anti-government slogans.
Starting his speech, the finance minister said the budget 2025-26 was being presented at a “historic moment” marked by national unity and resolve, referencing the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
“The spirit with which we protected our national sovereignty, we need to ensure our financial security the same way,” he maintained, continuing his speech through the noisy session.
“Pakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous.”

Budget outlay
The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.

 


Current expenditure, interest payments, and defence
The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.
 


Interest payments, or debt servicing, have contracted by 16 per cent to Rs8,207bn, yet continue to consume almost half of the total budget outlay and becoming, like in the last few years, the government’s single largest expense.
 


 


Defence expenditure constitutes Rs2,550bn, 20.2pc higher than last year’s budget, making up 1.97pc of GDP, an increase from last year’s 1.71pc.
 


Expanding on the defence budget later during his speech, Aurangzeb stated that officers and junior-commissioned officers would get a special relief allowance from the budget “in light of the contribution of the armed forces to defending our borders”.
Tax collection
Aurangzeb said that it was unavoidable to aim for a 14pc tax-to-GDP ratio and added that achieving the national targets was “impossible without the transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).”
The government has set an ambitious tax collection target for the FBR at Rs14,131bn, a 9pc increase from last year’s goal.
Detailing that transformation, the minister listed B2B e-voicing, AI-based audit selection systems for sales and income tax, e-billing and faceless audits, and a new central control unit to centralise data collection, among other steps.

Expanding upon the results, he said 390,000 high-value non-filers of tax were identified through data integration, with Rs300m recovered. The minister further highlighted that there was a 100pc increase in the number of tax filers, which took the revenue to Rs105bn.
“For the first time, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has acknowledged Rs389bn revenues through law enforcement,” he said.
Speaking on tax revenues, he said the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 8.8pc in June 2024, which was raised to 10.3pc in the first nine months of FY2025, and would reach 10.4pc by the end of June.
The government’s revenue was now at 11.6pc, including the provinces’ 0.8pc contributions.
“The FBR has increased tax-to-GDP ratio by 1.6pc, which is historic not just in Pakistan but the world,” he asserted.
Aurangzeb also announced tax relief measures for the salaried class, stating that the government planned to reduce the tax slabs, “balancing inflation and take-home [income]”.
Those earning between Rs0.6m and Rs1.2m would pay a 2.5pc tax, those with income greater than Rs1.2m and less than Rs2.5m would pay an 11pc tax, with those earning above that and till Rs3.2m would need to pay a 23pc tax.

&

For the corporate sector, the minister said it was being proposed to reduce the super tax rate for corporations earning between Rs200m-Rs500m annually to 5pc.
The finance minister proposed that Balochistan and the merged districts in KP, which “had a leeway with taxes for the past seven years”, were now to pay sales tax starting from 10pc for five years.
 
 

He said an 18pc tax would be applied on imported solar panels, while online businesses and digital marketplaces would also come under the tax net.
However, noting that the agriculture sector was the economy’s engine of growth, Aurangzeb said no further tax on fertiliser and pesticides was being mulled.
He warned that those committing theft in sales tax would face strict punishments, with the right to appeal. An automated risk-based income tax adjustment would be introduced to prevent the misuse of the income tax system.
He further said that foreign vendors from countries having no bilateral tax agreements with Pakistan could be taxed. “A 5pc tax on items from foreign vendors has been proposed.”
Petrol, diesel and hybrid cars that were excluded from an 18pc sales tax would now be hit with the same tax as well, the minister said.
Aurangzeb said that the federal government’s non-tax revenue target would be Rs5,147bn, with pure earnings of Rs11,072bn.
He added that the total expenditure is aimed at Rs17,573bn, out of which Rs8,207bn would be for mark-up payments.
Announcing measures for the construction sector, Aurangzeb said withholding tax slabs for property buying would be reduced from 4pc to 2.5pc, from 3.5pc to 2pc, and from 3pc to 1.5pc.
He further said that construction loans and mortgage financing for low-cost housing, as well as a tax credit on 10-marla houses and 2,000 flats, would be introduced.
“To promote mortgage financing we want to get on with it, a guaranteer system will be introduced,” he said.
Expanding on the new classification system for income tax, Aurangzeb said the difference between filers and non-filers would end. Only those who file their tax returns would be able to carry out huge transactions, including the sale and purchase of cars, and bank accounts.
Major economic indicators
Announcing the government’s plan to create a “competitive economy”, Aurangzeb said that economic growth in the upcoming fiscal year was expected to remain 4.2pc.
 


Regarding the fiscal deficit, the government aims for a lower target of 3.9pc of the GDP — or Rs5,037bn — from last fiscal year’s target of 5.9pc. The primary surplus would be targeted at 2.4pc of the GDP.

The government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc for the next fiscal year.

Pakistan’s total revenue for fiscal year 2025 is budgeted at Rs19,278bn.
After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs8,206bn, the net revenue stands at Rs11,702bn, representing a 6.7pc increase from the previous year.
 


Tariffs and debt management
Detailing the steps to be taken under the National Tariff Policy, Aurangzeb said additional customs duties will come to an end in four years, regulatory duties will end in five years, Customs Act’s Schedule 5 will also be eliminated in five years, and customs duty will be structured in slabs, with the maximum being 15pc.
“Tariff reforms will be applied step by step so that businesses can adjust and challenges are reduced. This will apply to all economic areas, including pharma, IT, telecom, textile and engineering.”
Quoting the World Bank, Aurangzeb informed the NA that these instruments would lower the tariffs, bringing them to the same level as Vietnam and Indonesia.
He then spoke about improving debt management and said: “Our economy has been stuck in debt for two decades, paying back loans. Our debt-to-GDP ratio was 74pc two years ago. But now, it is below 70pc. We will lower it further.
“We are diversifying debt products, the Sukuk bond has been started and launching products is being considered.”
The minister stressed that reforms in loss-making state-owned enterprises were underway, along with steps being taken to reduce fiscal strain and invite investment.
“We will complete PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) and Roosevelt Hotel transactions this year,” he asserted.
Pensions, relief for govt employees
On pension reforms, the minister highlighted that the increase in pensions had been “linked” to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
 


He noted that pensioners below the age of 70 were getting over Rs100m collectively in pensions, so a 5pc tax would be applied to their income.
However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners.
The minister also detailed relief for federal government employees of Grades 1-20, saying they would get a 10pc pay raise. Retired government workers would get a 7pc pension hike, while disabled employees would receive a Rs6,000 convenience allowance.
Digital sector, IT, and SMEs
Speaking about the digital sector, Aurangzeb noted that Pakistan’s cybersecurity ranking was rising. “There has been $3.1bn in IT exports in the year’s 10 months, which is 21.2pc more than the previous year,” he said.
The minister proposed raising IT exports to $25bn in the next five years.
For the IT sector, he said the government had proposed Rs4.8bn for ongoing projects under the Uraan Pakistan plan. The schemes included TV modules, a Pakistan-Korea testing facility, and a printed circuit board facility.
Aurangzeb informed the parliament that the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority had launched a three-year plan for financing small and medium enterprises.
He said that under the SME risk coverage scheme, 95,000 SMEs had received Rs300bn in funding till May 2025.
PSDP
The government has allocated Rs4,223.8bn for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) in FY25, an 11.4pc increase from last year’s Rs3,792.2bn.
The total federal PSDP, which includes SOEs and public-private partnerships, has contracted with Rs1,354.8 billion, representing a 20pc decrease from last year’s Rs1,696bn.
 






Provincial PSDP allocation, on the other hand, has risen 36.9pc to Rs2,869bn, up from Rs2,095bn in the previous year.
 


The minister said a total of Rs18.5bn had been earmarked for those, of which Rs3bn were for the prime minister’s scheme to rebuild flood-damaged schools in Sindh.
“A total of Rs4.3bn [have been allocated] for the PM’s Youth Skill Development programme, under which 165,100 young people receive skills training,” he added.
On the health side, Rs14.3bn had been allocated for 21 schemes under the PSDP.
“Jinnah Medical Complex and Research Centre will get Rs4bn for a flagship teaching and treatment facility in the capital […] Rs1bn will be given to eradicate hepatitis,” he highlighted.

The minister added that Rs800m of these would be allocated for controlling and preventing diabetes, while Rs900m would be earmarked for a stroke centre at Pims Hospital in Islamabad.
Aurangzeb also detailed planned budget shares for AJK, GB and the merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Out of a total of Rs164bn allocated for development projects, Rs48bn each would be set aside for AJK and GB, while Rs68bn would be for KP’s merged districts,” he said.
On social protection, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to helping the underprivileged, stating that Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) helped over 11m children go to school.
He added that 1.5m pregnant mothers and children were given funds, while 250,000 were granted training on financial literacy.
The minister further detailed that Rs1,928bn worth of grants had been allocated for AJK, GB and KP’s merged districts, including for BISP and education.
The minister went on to announce that the government had made plans to “procure cheap energy”.  Noting the closure of costly power plants and reforms in the oil and gas sector, he said Turkish and other international companies were willing to invest in Pakistan.

Regarding the energy sector, the minister said that the government needed to ensure the provision of cheap energy.
He said that 47 schemes and Rs90.2bn were allocated to the energy sector, including Rs840m for the Tarbela 5th Extension, Rs10.9bn for the Dasu hydel project, Rs3.5bn for the 884MW Suki-Kinari Hydropower Project, and Rs35.7bn for the Momand hydel dam.
The allocations for other power projects included Rs4.4bn for the Allama Iqbal Industrial City grid station, Rs1.1bn for the Quaid-i-Azam Business Park, Rs1.6bn for the 100KVA and 200KVA transformers asset performance management system, Rs2.9bn for the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) advanced metering infrastructure, Rs1.8bn for the Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) getting, Rs1.9bn for the Hyderabad getting, Rs2.4bn for the Peshawar getting, Rs67.2bn for the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) clean electricity scheme, Rs3bn for five energy schemes of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, and 1.2bn for GB grids.
He also mentioned the Matiari-Moro-Rahim Yar Khan Transmission Line project to strengthen transmission.
Water policy
Referring again to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Aurangzeb stressed the need for the country to increase its water reservoirs and ensure water security.
Under the 2018 National Water Policy, he mentioned the goals of 10m-acre increase in water storage, 35pc reduction in water waste and 30pc increase in water-use efficiency.
He detailed that Rs133bn would be allocated for projects, Rs34bn for investment and Rs2bn for 15 key schemes, detailing the breakdown for various dams.
Other sectors
Aurangzeb said the Higher Education Commission (HEC) would be receiving Rs39.5bn for 170 projects, of which Rs38.5bn would be set aside for the provinces.
To bridge the illiteracy gap, the minister said Rs9.8bn will be allocated for 11 new Daanish Schools — four in Balochistan, three in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, three in GB and one in Islamabad.
He added that electric wheelchairs, laptops and other audiovisual aids would be distributed under the programme.
Speaking about the agricultural sector, which comprises 34pc of the economy, Aurangzeb said Rs2.64bn were earned in FY24-25, adding that the National Seed Policy 2025 and the National Agri Technology Policy 2025 had been “nearly approved”.
“Genetic improvement and post-harvest processes will be focused on,” he said, adding that a total of 1,000 agriculture graduates had been sent to China on government-funded programmes. He also announced five new livestock schemes.
The minister also spoke about the carbon levy that the government has been mulling for “fuel-consuming vehicles”, adding that there would be different tiers based on engine capacity.
Aurangzeb highlighted that the levy was not just to reduce pollution but to also encourage reducing fuel consumption.
According to Aurangzeb, the civil administration expenditure would be Rs971bn and power and other sectors Rs1.19bn.
The finance czar said that there was a 31pc reduction in electricity prices, as well as 50pc reduction in prices for protected consumers.
Mentioning the privatisation of some power distribution companies, he said: “Professional boards have been cleared of political corruption.”
He mentioned the $5bn investment pledge by Reko Diq and pointed out fuel price deregulation aimed to promote competition.
“Gold mines in Reko Diq are a key part of our future. The plan’s feasibility study was completed in January,” he noted.
“We expect $71bn in cash flows [as well as] $7bn in tax and $8bn in royalties,” he said, terming the project a “game changer”.
On the topic of overseas Pakistanis, he noted $31.2bn were remitted to Pakistan, recording a 31pc increase of $10bn.
He affirmed that the government was taking steps for overseas Pakistanis, including an online system, civil procedure laws to prevent fraud, a quota in chartered medical schools, and civil awards for the top 15 senders.
Pointing out that Pakistan was one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the minister underscored the need for foreign assistance in mitigation, noting the IMF’s $1.3bn climate fund.
PTI ‘rejects’ proposed budget
Meanwhile, the opposition PTI “rejected” the proposed budget, calling it an “attack on the country’s economy”.
“The finance minister, imported from the Netherlands, employed a very regrettable attitude while presenting the budget,” PTI Secretary General Sheikh Waqqas Akram said during a press conference in Islamabad.
Akram termed the proposed measures the “first unnamed budget”, rather than being presented as a “public-friendly or public-crushing” one.
“This desperate, frustrated finance team could not even give any name to this budget,” he added, calling the plan an “economic death gallow”.
MNA Zartaj Gul claimed the opposition lawmakers were not provided with copies of the “secret” budget. “The finance bill’s copies did not even come to our tables […] we now went to the [NA] office and obtained its copies,” she said, after the session.
She said that the economic growth for FY21-22, when ex-premier Imran Khan was largely in power, was 6pc, while the latter governments could “not even come close to us”.
 






‘What have the elite done?’
Before the session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following a meeting of the federal cabinet, questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country’s elite economic group, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.
“Today, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.
“The sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‘we are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury […] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?’,” he added.
“This is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,” the premier noted.
He further said, “Pakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,” adding that the country’s stability indicators were satisfactory.
“Be it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.”</p><small>2025-06-10 21:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10153009f20555f.jpg?r=155745' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916296/sindh-govt-bans-parking-on-karachis-wall-street-to-ease-traffic-flow' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt bans parking on Karachi’s ‘Wall Street’ to ease traffic flow</strong></a><br><p>The provincial government on Tuesday said it has decided to implement strict rules to improve traffic flow and prohibit parking on Karachi’s I.I. Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s “Wall Street” — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.
Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.
According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.
I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.
The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.
Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.
CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.
The Sindh government had recently approved a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.
The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.
Fine were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.
Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.
These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p><small>2025-06-10 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1023472067ec8b6.jpg?r=234749' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916323/budget-fy26-relief-for-salaried-group-as-govt-goes-after-solar-panels-e-commerce' target='_blank'><strong>Budget FY26: ‘Relief’ for salaried group as govt goes after solar panels, e-commerce</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the budget for fiscal year 2025-26 on the floor of the National Assembly on Tuesday amid a routine protest by the opposition.
Pakistan’s budget for the upcoming year aims for GDP growth of 4.2 per cent and sets an ambitious tax collection target at Rs14,131 billion.
Relief for the salaried class
Most awaited among the rumoured announcements was some relief for the country’s much-burdened salaried class across all income slabs, according to the finance minister.
“This relief will not only simplify the tax structure but will also ensure a balance between inflation and take-home pay by reducing the tax burden on middle-income earners,” he said.
The minister also announced a 10pc increase in salaries to government employees from Grade-1 to Grade-22.
 






Proposed changes in income tax:

People earning Rs600,000-Rs1.2 million: tax reduced from five per cent to 2.5pc

People earning Rs1.2m to be charged Rs6,000 instead of Rs30,000
People earning upto Rs2.2m: tax reduced to 11pc from 15pc
People earning Rs2.2m-3.2m: tax reduced to 23pc from 25pc
People earning above Rs10m: reduction of 1pc in 10pc surcharge applied to them

 
 

Aurangzeb said the salaried group’s relief was aimed at preventing brain drain from the country, stressing that the government was aware that the workforce was facing the highest taxes in the region and there was fear that the most talented individuals might emigrate.
“This move reflects the government’s commitment to make taxes fairer and reduce the burden on salaried individuals,” he said.
 






However, among the increases in income-related charges, the minister said there was a proposal to increase the tax on income from interest from 15pc to 20pc.
The minister said the government was introducing multiple measures to improve equality in the tax system and it was observed that the salaried and business classes paid heavy taxes, while people earning from non-traditional means relatively pay less taxes.
However, he said the above proposed tax increase would not apply to national savings schemes.
Change in pension structure:
Among the changes in the pension structure outlined by the finance minister are:

7pc increase in pension of retired government employees
Duration of family pension limited to 10 years after spouse’s death

Abolition of multiple pensions
Choice of pension or salary in case of re-employment after retirement.

5pc tax on those under 70 earning over Rs10m through pension income (no tax on those earning low to medium pension income)

 






Property taxation changes
The finance minister also outlined various changes in taxes related to property and land since he said heavy taxes had a negative impact on the construction sector.
He said the following reductions in withholding tax on the purchase of property were proposed:

4pc to 2.5pc
3.5pc to 2pc
3pc to 1.5pc

Aurangzeb further said there was a proposal to abolish the federal excise duty of up to 7pc, which was imposed last year on the transfer of commercial properties, plots and houses, to reduce the burden on the construction sector.
A tax credit is also being introduced on houses up to 10 marlas and flats of 2,000 square feet to encourage mortgages for the provision of loans on low-cost housing.
There was also a proposal to reduce the stamp paper duty on the purchase of property in Islamabad from 4pc to 1pc.
Sales tax changes
The budget proposed several measures relating to sales tax changes affecting multiple items from solar panels to e-commerce:

18pc tax levy on imported solar panels

Couriers and e-commerce logistic service providers to collect 18pc tax from e-commerce platforms

General sales tax of 18pc on vehicles with a tax rate lower than 18pc
Gradual sales tax on merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan from next fiscal year with 10pc
Addition of following imported items in retail packing to Third Schedule of the Sales Tax Act, 1990: pet food, coffee, chocolates, cereal bars (sales tax to be collected based on retail price at applicable rates as embossed on the packaging)
Withdrawal of reduced 10pc rate on local supply of vermicilli and sheer mal

Withdrawal of reduced 12.5pc rate on locally manufactured or assembled cars up to 850cc
Exemption of 10pc tax on local supply of buns and rusk


Rationalisation of mutual funds
Aurangzeb said there was a proposal to rationalise the tax rate on profits earned on mutual funds.
Tax rate on profit on debt has been proposed to be increased from 15pc to 20pc. The tax rate has been enhanced to 25pc & 15pc on dividend from mutual funds.
Notable measures
Some other major proposed measures in the minister’s budget speech are:

Increase in advance tax rate from 0.6pc to 1pc on cash withdrawals by non-filers to discourage undocumented cash transactions, said Aurangzeb during his budget speech.
Carbon levy at Rs2.5 per litre on furnace oil, high speed diesel and petrol — to be increased to Rs5/ltr in fiscal year 2026-27
Rent from commercial properties to be recognised at standard 4pc rate of fair market value


Restriction of major financial transactions — purchasing vehicles and immovable property, investing in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain bank accounts — to those who file returns and wealth statement
25pc rebate against tax payable by full-time teachers and researchers to be
restored retrospectively

Heavily armed police, a helicopter and paramedics descended on the Dreierschuetzengasse high school in Graz after the 21-year-old lone shooter struck, police said.
Nine victims were immediately confirmed, but a woman died from her wounds in the hospital later, an official said.
Seven of the victims were female and three were male, authorities said without specifying their ages. A 17-year-old French student was among the victims, his father told AFP.
Twelve people suffered severe injuries, and police said support was being provided to witnesses and those affected.
The suspect acted alone and took his own life in the school toilet, police said, adding his motive remained unknown.
Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker declared three days of national mourning to remember the victims, saying the country had witnessed “an act of unimaginable violence”.
According to police, the alleged perpetrator was an Austrian from the Graz region, who used two legally owned weapons.
He was a former student at the high school, but had not finished his studies, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told reporters.
‘Unheard of’
Bouquets of flowers and candles were placed in front of the school, which has around 400 students aged between 14 and 18, as nearby businesses closed.
One resident, originally from the United States, whose children attend a nearby elementary school and kindergarten, told AFP she was “shocked” and it was “a lot to take in” .
“In my home country, it happens more often, as we know, but that it happens here is unheard of,” she said, declining to give her name.
“Graz is a safe city,” said Roman Klug, 55, who said he lived close to the school that he said was “known for its openness and diversity”.
‘Deeply shocked’
After arriving in Graz, Stocker described the shooting as “a national tragedy”, adding that it was “a dark day” for Austria.
Condolences poured in from across Europe.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that “France extends its deepest sympathy to the victims’ families, the Austrian people and Chancellor Stocker during this difficult time.”
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said “our thoughts are with our Austrian friends and neighbours” following the “horrific” shooting.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban offered his “deepest condolences”.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said “the news from Graz touches my heart” while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her sympathies to the families of the victims following the “tragic news”.
Attacks in public are rare in Austria, which is home to almost 9.2 million people and ranks among the 10 safest countries in the world, according to the Global Peace Index.
While still less common than in the United States, Europe in recent years has been shaken by attacks at schools and universities that were not connected to terrorism.
In France today, a teaching assistant was killed in a knife attack at a school in the eastern town of Nogent.
In January, an 18-year-old man fatally stabbed a high school student and a teacher at a school in northeastern Slovakia.
And in December, a 19-year-old man stabbed a seven-year-old student to death and injured several others at a primary school in Zagreb, Croatia.
In December 2023, an attack by a student at a university in central Prague left 14 people dead and 25 injured.
A few months earlier, a 13-year-old gunned down nine fellow classmates and a security guard at an elementary school in Belgrade.</p><small>2025-06-10 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/102343158a7a81f.png?r=234451' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916324/india-a-belligerent-power-spinning-out-of-control-says-sherry-rehman-on-jaishankars-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>India a ‘belligerent power spinning out of control’, says Sherry Rehman on Jaishankar’s remarks</strong></a><br><p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman on Tuesday termed India a “belligerent power spinning out of control” as she responded to remarks by the latter’s Minister for External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on allegations of terrorism.
Pakistan and India have been at odds since a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while Pakistan strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Speaking in Brussels earlier today, Jaishankar said when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that “Operation Sindoor” was not over, it was a clear message that “we reserve the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.
Responding to the statement, Senator Rehman said on X: “Sorry, but these threats only suggest a belligerent power spinning out of control.”
The senator, who is also part of a high-level delegation presenting Pakistan’s stance to major world powers, stated: “This beating of the terrorism drum has become a caricature of a country now unable to contain its own political crises.
“Pakistan cannot be responsible for every attack in India, which is home to a dozen insurgencies,” she said, adding that “no lessons seem to have been learnt from the encounter with Pakistan, and no evidence provided”.
 






Similarly, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar — also part of the delegation — said that India had learned “no lesson from its recent illegal aggression, bursting of its conventional supremacy myth, downing of its jets and its credibility”.
On the other hand, she noted, Pakistan continued to “celebrate [the] ceasefire and seek lasting peace that can allow South Asia to breathe and prosper”.
 






Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.
Besiders Khar and Rehman, the delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
On its part, India’s all-party delegations have also visited its key partner countries, including the United States.</p><small>2025-06-10 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10163840cefc7e9.jpg?r=165306' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916305/pupil-stabs-teaching-assistant-to-death-at-french-school' target='_blank'><strong>Pupil stabs teaching assistant to death at French school</strong></a><br><p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday condemned a “senseless wave of violence” after a teaching assistant stabbed by a 15-year-old pupil outside a school in the east of the country succumbed to her wounds.
The secondary school student was arrested after attacking the 31-year-old assistant with a knife during a bag search in Nogent in eastern France, officials said.
France has, in recent years, seen a series of attacks on teachers and pupils by other schoolchildren.
“While protecting our children, a teaching assistant lost her life, the victim of a senseless wave of violence,” Macron wrote on X, commenting on the latest in a spate of such incidents at French schools. “The nation is in mourning and the government is mobilised to reduce crime.”
 






Education Minister Elisabeth Borne was on her way to Nogent “to support the entire school community and the police”.
“I commend the composure and dedication of those who acted to subdue the attacker and protect the students and staff,” she said on X.
 






The pupil is 15 years old and did not have a criminal record.
The teaching assistant received several knife wounds just as classes were starting and the alleged attacker, who gendarmes overpowered, “appears to be a student at the school”, education officials said.
‘Have had enough’
In March, French police started random searches for knives and other weapons concealed in bags at and around schools.
The teaching assistant was “simply doing her job by welcoming students at the entrance to the school”, said Elisabeth Allain-Moreno, secretary general of the SE-UNSA teachers’ union, expressing “immense pain”.
Allain-Moreno said that the attack “shows that nothing can ever be completely secure and that it is prevention that needs to be focused on”.
Jean-Remi Girard, president of the National Union of Secondary Schools, added: “It’s impossible to be more vigilant 24 hours a day. We can’t say that every student is a danger or a threat, otherwise we’d never get out of bed in the morning.”
French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denounced what she called the “normalisation of extreme violence, encouraged by the apathy of the authorities”.
“Not a week goes by without a tragedy striking a school,” Le Pen said on X. “The French people have had enough and are waiting for a firm, uncompromising and determined political response to the scourge of juvenile violence.”
 






At the end of April, after a fatal attack at a school in Nantes, the education ministry reported that 958 random bag checks in schools had led to the seizure of 94 knives.
After that knife attack, which left one person dead and three injured, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called for “more intensive checks around and inside schools”.</p><small>2025-06-10 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10190611c222e5b.jpg?r=190613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312/iran-says-new-round-of-us-talks-planned-for-sunday' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says new round of US talks planned for Sunday</strong></a><br><p>The sixth round of Iran-US nuclear talks is planned for Sunday, Tehran said as the two sides appear locked in a standoff over uranium enrichment nearly two months into the high-stakes negotiations.
Iran has said it would present a counter-proposal to the latest draft from Washington, criticised by Tehran for failing to offer sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
“The next round of Iran-US indirect talks is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement on Tuesday.
There was no immediate comment from mediator Oman, which has hosted some of the previous rounds, while Washington has said the talks could be held as early as Thursday.
The longtime foes have held five rounds of negotiations since April, the highest level contact since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear accord during his first term.
Trump has said the next meeting was expected on Thursday, although a source familiar with preparations said it would more likely be on Friday or Saturday.
Iran’s top negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, will be attending the annual Oslo Forum in Norway on Thursday, his office said.
On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal for an agreement, which Araghchi has criticised for its “ambiguities”.
Tehran has said the offer failed to include issues raised in previous negotiations including the lifting of sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
On Monday, foreign ministry spokesperson Baqaei said Iran would present a “reasonable, logical and balanced” counter-proposal.
‘National interests’
Trump said that the next round of talks could make it clear if a nuclear deal is possible to avoid military action.
In a key sticking point, Tehran has defended its right to enrich uranium as “non-negotiable”, while Washington called any Iranian enrichment a “red line”.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States and its ally Israel, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
In an interview published on Tuesday, Iranian deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said there was no “deadlock” in the talks, and that the next round would be the first in which the parties discuss “any written material”.
“Any negotiations with an international dimension come with their own sensitivities and require a great deal of patience for them to reach a result,” he told the official IRNA news agency.
“What matters to us is that we can safeguard the national interests of the country through these talks, and that is how we proceed.” In a statement issued on Tuesday, a group of Iranian lawmakers accused the United States of turning the negotiations into a “strategic trap” in coordination with Israel.
They said Washington’s “aim is to impose demands through coercion, adopting positions that are insulting and entirely incompatible with the legitimate rights of the Iranian people.”
‘Less than satisfactory’
On Monday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog began a Board of Governors meeting in Vienna that will last until Friday to discuss Iran’s atomic activities and other issues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency meeting followed a report issued by it criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch foe Israel.
On Tuesday, Araghchi reiterated criticism of a plan by European powers and the United States to adopt a resolution at the IAEA meeting that would accuse Tehran of non-compliance with nuclear obligations.
“Any ill-considered and destructive decision in the Board of Governors against Iran will be met with an appropriate response,” Araghchi said during a phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.
Iran has said it would reduce cooperation with the IAEA if the resolution passed.
On Saturday, Tehran announced it had obtained a trove of Israeli intelligence in a covert operation, including files related to Israel’s undeclared nuclear facilities and defence plans.
 
 

It said the information would enable Iranian forces to launch counterattacks should Israel strike the Islamic republic.
Israel — an undeclared nuclear power — has repeatedly threatened that it could attack Iranian nuclear sites in warnings that have escalated since Tehran and Washington began talks.</p><small>2025-06-10 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10184247e37f80c.jpg?r=184253' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916311/income-tax-calculator-2025-26-how-does-the-new-budget-affect-your-salary' target='_blank'><strong>Income tax calculator 2025-26: How does the new budget affect your salary</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026 in the National Assembly on Tuesday.

Sana Yousaf was shot dead at her residence in Sector G-13 in the presence of her mother and aunt by an unidentified man who fled the scene. Police arrested the suspect Omar Hayat within a few hours who police claimed murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances.
Inspector General Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said the suspect was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. A local court approved a 14-day judicial remand of the prime suspect to facilitate his identification parade.
Calling it a stark reminder of the violence women and girls face simply for asserting their rights, Aseefa extended her condolences to Sana’s family, the community in Chitral, and all those grieving this senseless loss.
“Sana was just a girl—with ambition, with dreams, with a life ahead of her,” Aseefa said in a statement. “She had every right to live freely and safely. What happened to her wasn’t just an act of violence — it was a punishment for saying no. And that should horrify every one of us.”
She highlighted that violence stemming from male entitlement is neither new nor rare—and must no longer be tolerated under the guise of culture or tradition.
“This mindset that a woman’s rejection is an insult, that her choices need to be controlled—it’s old, it’s cruel, and it’s killing our daughters. My mother, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, broke those walls with her own strength. She didn’t just lead—she opened doors for millions of women to follow. And we owe it to her legacy, and to young women like Sana, to keep those doors open.”
Addressing the wave of online abuse directed at Sana after her death, Aseefa rejected the idea that social media use or self-expression could ever be used to justify violence.
“There is nothing—no app, no photo, no video—that excuses murder. It’s disturbing to see people using Sana’s TikTok presence to explain away her death. If that’s the logic, are we saying millions of girls across Pakistan are also at risk? This kind of thinking is not just dangerous—it’s inhumane.”
She closed with a message of solidarity and defiance to young women across the country.
“To every girl watching this unfold—don’t let them silence you. You have the right to dream, to speak, to exist without fear. Don’t back down. If you do, they win. But if we keep pushing forward—together—we’ll shape a country where girls aren’t blamed for their own deaths, but celebrated for their lives.”
Teenager Sana Yousaf was well-known for her social media activities, with nearly 800,000 followers on her TikTok account and almost 500,000 on her Instagram account.</p><small>2025-06-10 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10163534a6a0a4f.gif?r=163540' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916176/another-kwsc-pipeline-bursts-at-karachi-university-amid-water-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Another KWSC pipeline bursts at Karachi University amid water crisis</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: While the city continued to face a severe water crisis on Eid holidays, the dilapidated and outdated water distribution and supply infrastructure of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) once again played havoc with the University of Karachi (KU) after a 36-inch supply line burst, submerging the access to the cemetery on the campus on Eidul Azha.
The leakage, being repaired, inundated a large portion of the road leading to the university’s graveyard. People were forced to wade through the ankle-deep water to reach the graves of their near and dear ones for paying homage, a common practice during religious festivals.
Residents of the KU staff colony said that they had timely reported the leakage to the water utility, but it did not take immediate steps to plug the leakage.
Had the water utility acted promptly, a large amount of water would not have been wasted, besides saving people from the ordeal they went through on the Eid days, the residents lamented.
Earlier in April, a burst water main near KU, an 84-inch diameter pipeline, had led to a water crisis and flooding in on the campus, impacting residential and academic buildings, and causing significant losses for the university. The repair work had caused a severe water shortage and disruptions in the city’s water supply for over 10 days.
Chief Engineer Water Trunk Man (WTM) of the KWSC Syed Muhammad Ijaz said that a leakage had been reported in the joint of the 36-inch diameter line. “The repair work has been started, which will be completed soon,” he added.
The KWSC chief engineer said that the damaged line supplied water only to Scheme 33 and the repair work would not affect the regular supply to any other area in the city.
He said that water had been supplied to Scheme 33 as usual on Sunday night and now the next supply would be made on Thursday as per the schedule.
“During this time, the citizens will not face any kind of trouble or shortage,” he said.
The chief engineer further said that the repair work on the damaged line was in progress on an emergency basis and the technical team of the water utility was present on the spot.
“The repair process is being carried out rapidly so that the line can be fully functional soon,” he added.

Moscow has kept up its attacks on Ukraine, which has hit back with strikes deep inside Russian territory, while peace talks held over the weekend failed to yield a breakthrough towards ending the three-year war.
Aside from an agreement to exchange prisoners, progress has stalled and Russia has repeatedly rejected calls for an unconditional ceasefire.
“Russia lies every day about its desire for peace and attacks people every day. Time to impose sanctions. Time to support Ukraine with weapons. Time to prove that democracy has power,” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, said on Telegram.
A 59-year-old man was killed in the Russian strikes on residential buildings in Odesa on Tuesday, and at least four others were wounded, said Governor Oleg Kiper.
“The enemy massively attacked Odesa with strike drones. There is damage to civilian infrastructure and fires,” Kiper wrote on Telegram.
“The Russians hit a maternity hospital, an emergency medical ward and residential buildings,” he said, adding the maternity hospital had been evacuated in time.
“Stay in shelters! The massive attack on the capital continues,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram, adding in a separate post around 3am (5am PKT) that “a new batch of UAVs (drones) is flying to the capital”.
Four people were wounded in the attacks that hit at least seven districts, he said, with buildings and cars on fire.
Prisoner swap
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest European conflict since World War II, forcing millions to flee their homes and decimating much of eastern and southern Ukraine.
Ukrainian cities are targeted by Russian air strikes almost daily. On Sunday, Russia launched a record 479 explosive drones at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.
Kyiv has also carried out attacks on Russian territory, targeting transport and weapons production infrastructure.
Russia’s transport agency Rosaviatsia said on Tuesday that flight operations were temporarily restricted at Saint Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport. Similar restrictions were imposed on at least 13 other airports overnight, with four in Moscow reopening on Tuesday.
Despite efforts by US President Donald Trump to reach a ceasefire agreement, a second round of peace talks in Turkey are at a standstill.
The only concrete agreement reached at the talks over the weekend was for release all seriously wounded or sick prisoners of war and those under the age of 25 — a deal that did not specify the number of soldiers involved.
While welcoming POW exchanges, Zelensky said last week said it was “pointless” to hold further talks with the current Russian delegation — who he previously dismissed as “empty heads” — since they could not agree to a ceasefire.
On Sunday, the Russian army also claimed to have attacked the Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk, which borders the regions of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, already partially under Russian control, a first in more than three years of conflict.
“Time for everyone to finally accept the fact that Russia understands only strikes, not rational words,” Ukraine’s Yermak said on Tuesday, in a thinly veiled criticism of the Trump administration.
As a condition for halting its invasion, Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede the territories Moscow claims to have annexed and forswear joining NATO.
It has also rejected a proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire sought by Kyiv and the European Union, arguing that it would allow Ukrainian forces to rearm with Western deliveries.
Ukraine is demanding a complete Russian withdrawal of from its territory and security guarantees from the West, describing Moscow’s demands as “ultimatums”.</p><small>2025-06-10 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10101922d6f0e94.jpg?r=111426' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916279/trump-administration-deploys-marines-to-la-vows-to-intensify-migrant-raids' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration deploys Marines to LA, vows to intensify migrant raids</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration on Monday ordered US Marines into Los Angeles and intensified raids on suspected undocumented immigrants, fueling more outrage from street protesters and Democratic leaders who raised concerns over a national crisis.
Some 700 Marines based in Southern California were expected to reach Los Angeles Monday night or Tuesday morning, officials said, as part of a federal strategy to quell street demonstrations opposing the immigration raids, which are a part of a signature effort of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Although their mission to protect federal personnel and property is temporary — filling the gaps until a full contingent of 4,000 National Guard troops can reach Los Angeles — the deployment is an extraordinary use of military force in support of a police operation, and it comes over the objection of state and local leaders who did not request help.
Meanwhile, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to carry out even more operations to round up suspected immigration violators, extending a crackdown that provoked the protests. Trump officials have branded the protests as lawless and blamed state and local Democrats for permitting upheaval and protecting undocumented immigrants with sanctuary cities.
The military and federal enforcement operations have further polarised America’s two major political parties as Trump, a Republican, threatened to arrest California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, for resisting the federal crackdown.
California sued the Trump administration to block deployment of the National Guard and the Marines on Monday, arguing that it violates federal law and state sovereignty.
The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reed, said he was “gravely troubled” by Trump’s deployment of active-duty Marines.
“The president is forcibly overriding the authority of the governor and mayor and using the military as a political weapon. This unprecedented move threatens to turn a tense situation into a national crisis,” Reed said.
“Since our nation’s founding, the American people have been perfectly clear: we do not want the military conducting law enforcement on US soil,” he said.
The announcement that Marines would be deployed was made on the fourth straight day of protests. Late on Monday police began to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who gathered outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles where immigrants have been held. Police said arrests were being made.
National Guard forces had formed a human barricade to keep people out of the building. Then a phalanx of police moved up the street, pushing people from the scene and firing “less lethal” munitions such as gas canisters. Police had used similar tactics since Friday.
Rare use of military
US Marines are known as the first American forces to establish and beachhead in US military interventions, and as the last forces to leave any occupation.
Though military forces have been deployed domestically for major disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the attacks of September 11, 2001, it is extremely rare for troops to be used domestically during civil disturbances.
Even without invoking the Insurrection Act, Trump can deploy Marines under certain conditions of law or under his authority as commander in chief.
The last time the military was used for direct police action under the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when the California governor at the time asked President George H.W. Bush to help respond to Los Angeles riots over the acquittal of police officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King.
Newsom contends it is his charge as governor to call in the National Guard, labeling Trump’s“ action as “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”
Trump in turn said he supported a suggestion by his border czar Tom Homan that Newsom should be arrested over possible obstruction of his administration’s immigration enforcement measures. “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it’s great,” Trump told reporters.
Four days of protests
The protests so far have resulted in a few dozen arrests and some property damage.
“What is happening effects every American, everyone who wants to live free, regardless of how long their family has lived here,” said Marzita Cerrato, 42, a first-generation immigrant whose parents are from Mexico and Honduras.
Protests also sprang up in at least nine other US cities on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco, according to local news outlets.
In Austin, Texas, police fired nonlethal munitions and detained several people as they clashed with a crowd of several hundred protesters.
Before the Los Angeles dispersal, several hundred protesters outside a detention centre chanted “free them all,” flew Mexican and Central American flags, and directed sometimes-vulgar insults toward federal officers.
At dusk, officers had running confrontations with protesters who had scattered into the Little Tokyo section of the city. As people watched from apartment patios above street level, and as tourists huddled inside hotels, a large contingent of LAPD and officers and sheriffs deputies fired several flash bangs that boomed through side streets along with tear gas.
Homeland Security said its Immigration and Customs Enforcement division had arrested 2,000 immigration offenders per day in recent days, far above the 311 daily average in fiscal year 2024 under former President Joe Biden.
“We conducted more operations today than we did the day before and tomorrow we are going to double those efforts again,” Noem told Fox News’ “Hannity.”
“The more that they protest and commit acts of violence against law enforcement officers, the harder ICE is going to come after them.”
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass opposed the clampdown, telling MSNBC, “This is a city of immigrants.” Noem countered that, “They are not a city of immigrants. They’re a city of criminals.”</p><small>2025-06-10 06:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1008091179f4b82.png?r=080924' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916157/economic-survey-2024-25-growth-stumbles-as-key-targets-missed' target='_blank'><strong>Economic Survey 2024-25: Growth stumbles as key targets missed</strong></a><br><p> 


• Major crops down 13.5pc amid water crisis, restricting agriculture and overall GDP growth
• Industry, services underperform; large-scale manufacturing struggles for third straight year
• Inflation drops to 4.6pc, a 60-year low, amid declining interest rates
• Finance czar calls it ‘a gradual recovery’, promises ‘turnaround’ next year
• GDP growth reaches 2.68pc, missing 3.56pc target
ISLAMABAD: “Next year will be a turnaround story,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised on Monday as he unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 (PES) document, which highlighted widespread slippages across major sectors of the economy in the outgoing fiscal year.
Reviewing the economy report card, the finance minister suggested that Pakistan’s performance should be evaluated in a global context rather than a historical one.
He stated that while global economic growth has been on a declining trend, expanding 3.5pc in 2023, 3.3pc in 2024, and 2.8pc in 2025, Pakistan had progressed from a contraction of 0.2pc in 2023 to 2.5pc growth in 2024, with a further rise to almost 2.7pc this year.
“This is gradual recovery, and the right way to ensure sustainable growth,” he insisted, adding that no one wanted a return to the boom-and-bust cycles of the past.
 
 

The current year’s GDP growth will clock in at 2.68pc; well short of the 3.56pc target, although slightly improved from last year’s 2.5pc. It is below the five-year average of around 3.3pc, and well below Pakistan’s long-term average of over 4.5pc.
Mr Aurangzeb noted that global inflation stood at 2.6pc in 2023, rose to 2.7pc in 2024, and is projected to reach 3.1pc in 2025. In contrast, inflation in Pakistan had fallen from 29pc in 2023 to 23pc in 2024, and now to a six-decade low of 4.6pc.
“So, this too has moved in the right direction,” Mr Aurangzeb remarked, noting that the benchmark interest rate had been reduced by a cumulative 1,100 basis points during the current year to 11pc, down from a peak of 22pc. Resultantly, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 68pc last year to 65pc, aided by the government’s buyback of approximately Rs1 trillion in debt, which created additional fiscal space, the minister said.
Missed targets
The Economic Survey data reveals that almost all major components of the economy missed targets. The finance minister singled out a 13.5pc contraction in major crops, which was estimated to have restricted the overall GDP growth rate by 0.6pc. The overall agriculture sector, which accounts for nearly 24pc of GDP, posted modest growth of 0.6pc this year, falling well short of the 2pc target and significantly below last year’s announced growth of 6.4pc. Major crops such as wheat, cotton, and maize contracted by 13.5pc, a sharper decline than an estimated 4.5pc.
This was primarily due to initial estimates of a 35pc water shortage, which were later revised down to 11-12pc. As a result, cotton ginning saw a 19pc decline, compared to last year’s growth of 0.1pc, and well below a targeted contraction limit of 2.3pc.
Meanwhile, the industrial sector was announced to have shown 4.8pc growth, surpassing the 4.4pc target. This triggered some pointed questions, however. A journalist commented that it seemed likely the industry’s performance would later be revised downward, given that an almost 1pc contraction had been reported for the first nine months of the current year.
Within industries, mining and quarrying contracted by 3.4pc against a growth target of 5pc, shrinking for the third consecutive year. Likewise, Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), which contributes nearly 8pc to GDP, contracted by 1.5pc, falling far short of the growth target of 3.5pc.
This also marked the third consecutive year of struggles for LSM, which saw a 10pc contraction in fiscal ’23, followed by less than 1pc growth in fiscal ’24 (that too, owing to a low base effect), and followed by an additional 1.5pc contraction this year.
The services sector, which makes up nearly 59pc of GDP, was said to have posted growth of 2.9pc, well short of the 4.1pc target. Within the services sector, wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage, financial and insurance services, and private services all missed targets, whereas government services, education and similar sectors that outperformed expectations.
Separately, the investment-to-GDP ratio improved to 13.8pc in fiscal ’25, up from 13.1pc in fiscal ’24, although falling short of the 14.2pc target. Private investment grew by 9.1pc, slightly below the 9.7pc target. National savings also saw an improvement, rising to 14.1pc of GDP, surpassing the 13.3pc target.
Indian meddling
Mr Aurangzeb said structural reforms aimed at transforming the foundations of Pakistan’s economy would have remained elusive without the ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme. The programme, he noted, had supported taxation reforms that raised the tax-to-GDP ratio to a five-year high and contributed to a reduction in power sector losses.
The minister described the recent release of a $1bn tranche by the IMF as a major success, achieved “against all odds.” For the first time publicly, it was revealed that India had actively opposed the move.
“Just as our armed forces fought for a victory, a similar battle was being fought on the economic front,” he said, claiming that the Indian executive director at the IMF had made every effort to keep Pakistan’s case off the board’s agenda, or, if it was included, to block both the second instalment of the EFF as well as a new $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility, which is crucial for Pakistan’s climate adaptation financing needs.
But Pakistan’s bilateral allies and multilateral partners stood by the country and offered their support, Mr Aurangzeb said, while also acknowledging that this outcome would not have been possible without the strength of Pakistan’s economic performance.
Reform-centric budget
Mr Aurangzeb also stated that reforms in public finance, including pension reforms, rightsizing of government, and privatisation of public sector entities, would be pushed through, and this would be evident in the budget to be presented on Tuesday (today).
The minister avoided multiple questions regarding the quality of data, and the use of May-June projections to calculate growth numbers instead of relying on actual data. However, he affirmed his support for the published data, stating that, as finance minister, he stood behind it.
He also expressed his support for the inclusion of members from the private sector on the board of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, which is responsible for the Economic Survey report.

• Alleges 30m people have fallen below the poverty line over the last three years
• Blames the agriculture sector decline on ‘anti-farmer policies’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Monday criticised the government over the economic survey of Pakistan, alleging it reflected a bleak economic picture and the government’s poor performance, which they said pushed 30 million people below the poverty line in the last three years.
At a press conference, the party’s information secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, flanked by Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, said the finance minister presented the survey “in an apologetic manner.”
“Those who used to criticise 6.5pc growth rate during the PTI’s tenure were trying to defend their performance, which was worst,” Mr Akram said.
Mr Akram said that while President Asif Zardari had promised to address the masses’ issues, poverty has instead increased. He claimed the total economic growth during the last three years was just 1.5pc.
He said people have moved to solar energy because they cannot afford to pay electricity bills. “Inflation is still 11.5pc, but the government claims it is decreasing,” he said, questioning why the finance minister did not begin the survey presentation with inflation figures.
Mr Khan asserted that, by contrast, the PTI government “had brought the energy sector under control.”
Focusing on agriculture, Mr Akram said the sector declined by 13pc while the government claimed livestock grew by 40pc. “How was it possible?” he asked, suggesting the decline resulted from “anti-farmer policies” as there were no major natural disasters.
“Thirty-seven percent of the population was dependent on agriculture and was suffering,” Mr Akram said, adding that the government’s claim of growth in small industries was “a pack of lies.”
Mr Khan said the growth rate was lower than in 1992. “Growth of all crops was negative, but the donkey population has increased,” he said.
The opposition leader also said that the purchasing power of Rs50,000 in March 2022 has plummeted to just Rs20,833 today. Citing the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, he said the price of tea has increased by 74pc.
Both leaders highlighted emigration as a major concern.
“People were leaving Pakistan because of the economic issues,” Mr Akram alleged, claiming that more people will leave in the near future.
Mr Khan said 3.2m people have left the country in recent years, worried about inflation, purchasing power and jobs. He claimed government lawmakers “were not able to face the masses” in their constituencies.
