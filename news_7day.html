Every month, millions of overseas Pakistanis send money home. These remittances are now a cornerstone of Pakistan’s balance-of-payments, hitting a record $4.1 billion during March alone.
“Workers’ remittances recorded an inflow of $3.2bn during July 2025,” a press release by the SBP read.
According to the data released by the bank, the inflows were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($823.7 million), United Arab Emirates ($665.2m), United Kingdom ($450.4m) and the US ($269.6m).
Last month, SBP’s data showed that workers’ remittances increased by 26.6pc to hit a record $38.3bn during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the corresponding period of last year.
It added that the workers’ remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.
FY25 proved to be a relatively successful year for the government on the external front, with expectations of a current account surplus and the SBP exceeding its foreign exchange reserves target of $14bn by closing at $14.5bn.
 
 

Remittances played a crucial role in maintaining exchange rate stability, enabling the central bank to accumulate reserves and make partial repayments of its external debt. While official figures have not been disclosed, interbank currency dealers estimate the SBP purchased over $8bn from the banking market during the year.
A study by the Asian Development Bank last year found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.
The study’s findings indicate that domestic and abroad economic activity is positively associated with remittances to Pakistan.</p><small>2025-08-08 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0817575255a67f5.jpg?r=175937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929546/security-forces-kill-33-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 33 terrorists in Balochistan’s Zhob district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 33 terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on Friday, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a large group of terrorists belonging to the “Indian proxy Fitna al Khwaraj”, were trying to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border when they were detected by the security forces in the Sambaza area of Balochistan’s Zhob district on the night of August 7 and 8.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added that the troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate, adding, “As a result of precise, bold and skilful engagement, thirty three Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
A large cache of weapons, ammunition & explosives was also recovered, it added.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.
Last month, 30 terrorists of an “Indian proxy” outfit were killed as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of KP’s North Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-08-08 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08175408d263aa1.jpg?r=175440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929530/peshawar-man-booked-for-online-harassment-cyberstalking-crime-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar man booked for online harassment, cyberstalking: crime agency</strong></a><br><p>A man in Peshawar was booked under the charges of cyberstalking and harassment on Friday by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) after he allegedly threatened to leak personal pictures of the complainant online.
In a statement, NCCIA said that the suspect — who was arrested from the Faqirabad area of Peshawar — was posting photos of the complainant on TikTok and had threatened to post photos of an obscene nature on the platform.
“The incident caused severe mental and social damage to the victim,” the NCCIA said.
A first information report (FIR) has been registered against the suspect under Section 16 (Unauthorised use of identity information), Section 20 (Offences against dignity of a natural person), and Section 24 (Cyberstalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, as well as Section 419 (cheating by personatation) and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The investigation officer, Sub-Inspector Mukhtiar Ahmed, said in a statement that strict action would be taken against those who are involved in such activities, calling it a “serious crime”.
According to a Digital Rights Foundation report, a total of 3,171 complaints of tech-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) were received from across the country in 2024.
A large number of women in the country across all age groups and classes continue to face violence and endure sexual, mental, and physical abuse despite improvements in education, according to a 2023 report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
On Wednesday, the National Assembly urged the government to ensure strict punishment to those involved in unauthorised video recording, cyber-harassment, and digital defamation.
In June, the national cybersecurity authority urged citizens to use social media responsibly and remain vigilant against cyber threats.
The body pointed out that women are “frequently targeted” with cyber harassment, identity theft and image-based abuse, risks that are “compounded by broader societal inequities”.</p><small>2025-08-08 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081635330aeb04b.png?r=163720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929536/india-pauses-plans-to-buy-us-arms-after-trumps-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>India pauses plans to buy US arms after Trump’s tariffs</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi has put on hold its plans to procure new US weapons and aircraft, according to three Indian officials familiar with the matter, in India’s first concrete sign of discontent after tariffs imposed on its exports by President Donald Trump dragged ties to their lowest level in decades.
India had been planning to send Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Washington in the coming weeks for an announcement on some of the purchases, but that trip has been cancelled, two of the people said.
Trump on Aug 6 imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods as punishment for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, which he said meant the country was funding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That raised the total duty on Indian exports to 50pc — among the highest of any US trading partner.
The US president has a history of rapidly reversing himself on tariffs, and India has said it remains actively engaged in discussions with Washington. One of the people said the defence purchases could go ahead once India had clarity on tariffs and the direction of bilateral ties, but “just not as soon as they were expected to”.
Written instructions had not been given to pause the purchases, another official said, indicating that Delhi had the option to quickly reverse course, though there was “no forward movement at least for now.”
India’s defence ministry and the Pentagon did not respond to Reuters’ questions. Delhi, which has forged a close partnership with America in recent years, has said it is being unfairly targeted and that Washington and its European allies continue to trade with Moscow when it is in their interest.
Reuters is reporting for the first time that discussions on India’s purchases of Stryker combat vehicles made by General Dynamics Land Systems and Javelin anti-tank missiles developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been paused due to the tariffs.
Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in February announced plans to pursue procurement and joint production of those items.
Singh had also been planning to announce the purchase of six Boeing P8I reconnaissance aircraft and support systems for the Indian Navy during his now-cancelled trip, two of the people said. Talks over procuring the aircraft in a proposed $3.6 billion deal were at an advanced stage, according to the officials.
Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics referred queries to the Indian and US governments. Raytheon did not return a request for comment.
Russian Relations
India’s deepening security relationship with the US, which is fuelled by their shared strategic rivalry with China, was heralded by many US analysts as one of the key areas of foreign-policy progress in the first Trump administration.
Delhi is the world’s second-largest arms importer, and Russia has traditionally been its top supplier. India has, in recent years, however, shifted to importing from Western powers like France, Israel and the US, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute think-tank.
The shift in suppliers was driven partly by constraints on Russia’s ability to export arms, which it is utilising heavily in its invasion of Ukraine. Some Russian weapons have also performed poorly in the battlefield, according to Western analysts.
 
 

The broader US-India defence partnership, which includes intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, continues without hiccups, one of the Indian officials said.
India also remains open to scaling back on oil imports from Russia and is open to making deals elsewhere, including the US, if it can get similar prices, according to two other Indian sources.
Trump’s threats and rising anti-US nationalism in India have “made it politically difficult for Modi to make the shift from Russia to the US,” one of the people said. Nonetheless, discounts on the landing cost of Russian oil have shrunk to the lowest since 2022.
India’s petroleum ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump’s statements that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
In recent months, Moscow has been actively pitching Delhi on buying new defence technologies like its S-500 surface-to-air missile system, according to one of the Indian officials, as well as a Russian source familiar with the talks.
India currently does not see a need for new arms purchases from Moscow, two Indian officials said.
But Delhi is unlikely to wean itself off Russian weapons entirely as the decades-long partnership between the two powers means Indian military systems will continue to require Moscow’s support, one of the officials said.
The Russian embassy in Delhi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-08-08 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08122930b70786d.png?r=155032' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929512/kkh-partially-blocked-by-river-flow-in-gbs-hunza-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>KKH partially blocked by river flow in GB’s Hunza: spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>River erosion and increased water flow caused a blockage on part of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Hunza Valley on Friday, according to a government spokesperson.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the flow of water in GB rivers had increased, because of which a part of the KKH had been blocked due to erosion.
“The chief minister of GB has ordered the restoration of the highway,” he said.
He added that relevant institutions were on their way to restoring the KKH in Morkhun.
Faraq also said that a search was underway for tourists who went missing after a boat capsized in Skardu on Tuesday.
“Due to the increase in the flow of water in the lakes, there is a ban on operating boats and Section 144 is in force,” he said.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
“Action is being taken against those who take tourists out on lakes by boat despite the ban,” Faraq added.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. GB has been among the hardest hit regions by the extreme weather.
On Monday, a search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in GB’s Babusar area concluded after 14 days, and the tourists’ funeral prayers were held in absentia.
Last month, thousands of people, including foreign tourists, were stranded at multiple locations in GB due to blocked roads, including KKH, due to landslides.</p><small>2025-08-08 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081509140e09db2.jpg?r=150922' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929528/govt-suspends-mobile-data-services-in-balochistan-until-aug-31-for-security-reasons' target='_blank'><strong>Govt suspends mobile data services in Balochistan until Aug 31 for ‘security reasons’</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind on Friday said that mobile data services in the province have been suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. In February, nearly 62 per cent of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.
The move came after a notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on Aug 6, seen by Dawn.com, ordered the immediate suspension of data services until Aug 31, citing the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province.
“It is, therefore, requested to please direct the concerned authorities for suspension/closure of 3G and 4G services in the entire province … to avoid any untoward incident,” the notification read.
“The service has been suspended because they (militants) use it for coordination and sharing information,” Rind said, according to Reuters.
The suspension follows the government announcement from last month banning Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from travelling by road from Quetta to Iran and Iraq due to national security concerns.
 
 

On March 11, the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express train became the target of an unprecedented hijacking, when terrorists fired on the locomotive and took over 400 passengers hostage.
Media reports said that security forces had surrounded the area and launched a clearance operation to rescue all passengers. Radio Pakistan reported that security forces had rescued 80 hostages held by the terrorists.
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the clearance operation, launched after the train’s unprecedented hijacking in Balochistan, ended with all 33 terrorists being killed.</p><small>2025-08-08 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08155110e5de01c.jpg?r=155432' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929509/pakistan-set-to-become-first-south-asian-country-to-ratify-unesco-underwater-heritage-convention' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan set to become first South Asian country to ratify Unesco underwater heritage convention</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to become the first South Asian nation to ratify the 2001 Unesco Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH), marking a significant step toward safeguarding its submerged maritime legacy, a statement from the Press Information Department (PID) said on Friday.
In recent years, underwater cultural heritage has attracted increasing attention from both the scientific community and the general public.
For scientists, it represents an invaluable source of information on ancient civilisations, maritime practices, human use of land and marine environments, and climate change, according to Unesco.
The announcement was made by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry during a meeting with Unesco representative Dr Cristina Menegazzi in Islamabad today. The two sides discussed collaborative efforts to document, preserve, and promote Pakistan’s rich underwater archaeological resources.
“Pakistan is set to become the first South Asian nation to ratify the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH), marking a significant step toward safeguarding its submerged maritime legacy,” the statement said.
Maritime archaeology, a specialised discipline that explores the relationship between humans and bodies of water through historical artefacts, is gaining prominence in coastal nations with rich nautical histories, as per the statement.
In Pakistan’s case, this includes shipwrecks, submerged landscapes, ancient maritime infrastructure such as piers and lighthouses, and historic trade routes along the Arabian Sea.
“We are committed to preserving our maritime cultural heritage and will soon ratify the 2001 Convention,” Minister Chaudhry was quoted as saying in the statement.
“This will position Pakistan as a regional leader in protecting underwater cultural heritage and strengthen our voice on international platforms concerning climate change and cultural preservation.”
The minister underscored the government’s focus on environmentally responsible exploration. “Any scientific activity in maritime archaeology must be conducted in a way that respects and protects marine ecosystems,” the minister was further quoted as saying.
“The use of non-invasive technologies like remote sensing, diver-based observation, and photogrammetry will be prioritised, while excavations will only be carried out under strict scientific guidelines.”
The statement added: “In line with efforts to preserve both submerged and coastal heritage, Chaudhry also requested Unesco’s assistance in registering historic maritime buildings in Karachi.
“These include over 70-year-old structures under the Maritime Affairs Ministry, such as the Marine Fisheries Department and the iconic Marine Lighthouse. The minister proposed establishing a maritime historical museum to house and exhibit this coastal legacy.
“Unesco possesses valuable digital archives and marine archaeological data from across the globe,” according to Chaudhry. “We wish to collaborate in scientific research and mapping of Pakistan’s underwater cultural heritage, which has been largely unexplored.”
The minister emphasised that Pakistan’s engagement in this field will not only highlight its cultural wealth but also align with global efforts to combat climate change. Submerged archaeological sites, he noted, serve as key indicators of past sea levels and climate patterns, offering insights into the environmental shifts that affect coastal communities today.
“Dr Menegazzi welcomed Pakistan’s intention to join the global community in protecting underwater heritage and expressed Unesco’s willingness to support technical and scientific cooperation in the area,” the statement read.
Last year, experts at Unesco-sponsored workshop at Mohenjo Daro said that while disasters cannot be stopped, preventive measures could be adopted to reduce the risk of destruction to heritage sites, monuments and museums, and minimise harm.
A Unesco delegation has also previously called on the Sindh government to discuss the restoration project of the world heritage Makli’s tombs of Shaikh Jiyo and others, which have been severely affected by rains, floods and other natural disasters.</p><small>2025-08-08 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/081117289d36976.png?r=111829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929503/arshad-nadeem-marks-one-year-since-historic-paris-gold-with-london-rehab' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem marks one year since historic Paris gold with London rehab</strong></a><br><p>A year ago to the day, Arshad Nadeem stunned the world with a monstrous javelin throw that propelled him to global stardom and salvaged Pakistan’s plummeting sports glory with its first individual gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics.
The javelin star sweetened the deal when his 92.97m throw shattered the Olympic record — not once, but twice, to the delight of a roaring crowd at Paris’ Stade de France.
But a year on from the historic triumph, Arshad is undergoing physiotherapy in London following surgery on his calf muscle.
The two upcoming Diamond League championships he was set to compete at this month have been scrapped from his sports calendar as he recovers in time for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September.
But there is no disappointment from Arshad or his coach Salman Butt, who doubles as his mentor, manager, and much more.
“Things are looking good for Tokyo,” he told Dawn.com in a call from London. “We’re hoping to accomplish a lot there.”
A gold medal at the World Championships will complete his trifecta after his gold in the Paris Olympics and the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Arshad made this year’s international debut in style when he won gold with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, in May.
Butt acknowledged that the scratched competitions are not ideal, and the aim was to compete at least four or five times ahead of the world championships.

“The thing is, sports and injury go together. That’s just how it is.”

He emphasised the importance of rectifying the recurring injury as they flew to Cambridge and underwent surgery within six days.
Contrary to any doom and gloom, Arshad is now pain-free and going full steam ahead with his training in London as he wraps up his last few physiotherapy sessions.
He’ll return to Pakistan soon, where he’ll continue training for the next six weeks before heading to Tokyo in an attempt to make history once again.
Arshad honoured by Pakistan High Commission in London
The Pakistan High Commission in London honoured Arshad with a shield to commemorate one year since his Olympic triumph.
“All officers and staff of [the high commission] were present to honour our national hero,” it said in a post on X.
High Commissioner Dr Muhammad Faisal said: “Arshad Nadeem’s achievement has highlighted the importance of track & field athletics to the youth of Pakistan.”

Extreme temperatures caused approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths annually between 2000 and 2019, with 36 per cent occurring in Europe and 45pc in Asia, the report said.
The health impacts of heat are especially severe in cities due to the so-called ‘urban heat island effect’ — the over-heating of dense city areas compared with their rural surroundings — which is magnifying problems as urbanisation continues, it was pointed out.
Amid rising 21st-century temperatures, the WMO underscored that July 2025 was the third-warmest July ever recorded, behind those in 2023 and 2024.
In this record-breaking July, heatwaves especially impacted Sweden and Finland, which experienced unusually long spells of temperatures above 30°C.
Southeast Europe also faced heatwaves and wildfire activity, with Türkiye recording an extreme new national high of 50.5°C.
In Asia, temperatures soared above average the most across the Himalayas, China and Japan in July, with extreme heat continuing into August.
In the week leading up to August 5, temperatures surpassed 42°C across West Asia, southern Central Asia, the southwestern United States, much of North Africa and southern Pakistan — with some areas exceeding 45°C.
Parts of southwestern Iran and eastern Iraq saw particularly severe temperatures above 50°C, disrupting electricity and water supplies, education and labour.
For the week of August 4, Morocco issued heat warnings for temperatures up to 47°C.
Korea also issued widespread heat warnings, as station temperature records were broken across parts of China.
In Japan, a new national temperature record of 41.8°C was set on August 5, breaking the previous record of 41.2°C set a week prior.
Looking to next week, the World Meteorological Centre in Beijing forecasts that heatwaves will persist across the same regions as well as the Iberian Peninsula and northern Mexico.
These regions are expected to see maximum temperatures between 38 and 40°C, with parts of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, North Africa and the southwestern US likely to exceed 45°C.
 
 

As Canada experiences one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, with 6.6 million hectares burned, smoke has polluted the skies and caused poor air quality across several provinces and northern states of the US in late July and early August.
Twice this summer, smoke from Canadian fires crossed the Atlantic, affecting skies over Western Europe from August 5-7 and over Central and Southern Europe in late June.
Elsewhere, Cyprus, Greece and Türkiye have battled wildfires that forced evacuations and caused fatalities. In the US, a wildfire in Arizona’s Grand Canyon National Park disrupted tourism at the iconic site.
“Extreme heat is sometimes called the silent killer, but with today’s science, data and technologies, silence is no longer an excuse. Every single death from extreme heat is preventable,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.
The WMO is working to strengthen heat early warning systems under the Early Warnings for All initiative. In collaboration with global and local partners, it is also helping countries develop heat-health action plans and ensure at-risk populations receive timely alerts.
WMO is also one of ten UN agencies supporting the Secretary-General’s Call to Action on Extreme Heat, which aims to boost global cooperation to reduce heat impacts through economic and social policy. A key focus is limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.
According to estimates from WMO and the World Health Organisation (WHO), scaling up heat-health warning systems in 57 countries alone could save nearly 100,000 lives annually.
“Our network is connecting science, policy, and action so that no community is left behind in the race to adapt to climate change that will continue to worsen extreme heat for years to come,” said Joy Shumake-Guillemot, lead of the WHO-WMO Climate and Health Joint Programme and co-lead of the Global Heat-Health Information Network (GHHIN).
“This is not just a climate issue, it’s a public health emergency,” she added.</p><small>2025-08-08 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/08123113a3b6af6.jpg?r=125800' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929508/2-terrorists-planning-to-attack-police-killed-in-mianwali-operation-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>2 terrorists planning to attack police killed in Mianwali operation: CTD</strong></a><br><p>Two terrorists planning to attack the police in Punjab’s Mianwali district were killed during an operation, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Friday.
The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.
In a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, “Punjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.”
It said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.
“During the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.”
According to the statement, the CTD recovered “explosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets” from the terrorists.
“The terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,” it said.
The CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.
Punjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism”, the statement added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
Last month, Punjab CTD killed five terrorists and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a “major counter-terrorism breakthrough”.
In April,  the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting 10 terrorists belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p><small>2025-08-08 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0713144597ad553.jpg?r=131734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927410/seeds-of-the-cosmos-how-a-pakistani-engineer-sent-wheat-into-space' target='_blank'><strong>Seeds of the cosmos: How a Pakistani engineer sent wheat into space</strong></a><br><p>Space, as all Trekkies agree, is the final frontier. It is mysterious, magnificent, mighty, and draws in earthlings who have long dreamed of exploring other worlds. In recent years, these dreams have crossed over from the realm of ambition to the reality of necessity. As billion-dollar companies and superpowers race toward the stars, a Pakistani engineer has crossed the Kármán line with nothing more than a handful of wheat seeds and a vision.
“As we speak, Pakistan-origin wheat seeds are on their way to space,” Mahhad Nayyar told Dawn.com. He and his colleague, Muhammad Haroon, successfully sent the first Pakistani payload to the International Space Station through the Kármán-Jaguar Earth Seeds for Space partnership.
The initiative brought together researchers and space leaders from four countries to explore how native crops respond to microgravity. Pakistan’s contribution, wheat seeds, was spearheaded by Mahhad.
 

Mahhad Nayyar works on the payload at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre before the launch.

The seeds took up one-quarter of the space in the test tube, equal to the Nigerian melon seeds, Armenian pomegranate seeds, and Egyptian cotton seeds. The test tube was aboard the SpaceX Dragon Capsule — mounted on a Falcon 9 rocket — which launched from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, on August 1.
“I was quite literally living a dream,” Mahhad gleamed. “Watching the rocket fire up and blaze into the sky, leaving behind a trail of smoke … all of it happened just within a few minutes. For me, though, it was the experience of a lifetime.”
But the flight from land to space, one that the 34-year-old had dreamt of for years, was long and riddled with challenges.
How it started
As a young boy, Mahhad was obsessed with the boundless horizon above him. At the time, the only way he knew to explore the skies was through flying, and, in what he describes as “quintessential fashion”, the engineer joined PAF College Sargodha, where he underwent five years of training and subsequently joined the Pakistan Air Force.
“My aim was to become a fighter pilot, but I fell short due to my short-sightedness and was hence sent towards engineering by the PAF,” he recalled to Dawn.com. In 2009, Mahhad enrolled in the aeronautical engineering programme at the PAF College, Risalpur, during which he secured a scholarship at the US Air Force Academy.
This is where his life took a turn. Mahhad went to the States with the intention of studying aeronautical engineering, but came back as an astronautical engineer. “It was here that I found my love for space; when I controlled, monitored and designed satellites.” But he couldn’t explain it to the people around him when he came back home, who thought it was a subject far-fetched, one that “didn’t even have an office here”.
For the next few years, he served as a flight engineer for search and rescue helicopters during the day and volunteered for astronomical societies in the evenings. Meanwhile, Mahhad immersed himself in the world of astrodynamics — his nights were occupied by documentaries such as ‘Cosmos: A Personal Voyage’ and ‘Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey’.
“I fell in love with how vast the space is. I could see all the possibilities of what could be done there,” he reminisced. As years passed by, however, he couldn’t help but wonder how Pakistan was losing out on the vast potential of the cosmos.
His disappointment further grew when, in 2020, Mahhad came across a research paper featuring a world map of countries that had participated in initiatives with the ISS. One conspicuous gap was hard to ignore: Pakistan was the only one of the world’s 10 most populous countries to not have taken part.
 


The image stayed with him, almost as if it were imprinted in his mind. “I realised that in two and a half decades, we were unable to send an experiment into space, let alone an astronaut. This was a matter of shame to me.” He resolved to change this and bring to life the idea that space should be accessible and meaningful for everyone, not just a select few nations or industries.
So when in 2024 he came across the Kármán Project, he knew exactly what he needed to do.
A journey into space
Mahhad applied to become a pioneer for the project, named after the line 100km above the ground from where space begins. By this time, he had retired from the PAF and was pursuing a PhD from Purdue University in the US.
“I got an email from the Kármán Project one day, wherein they were seeking proposals for sending a free-of-cost experiment to space, so I drafted a proposal with the help of my colleague Haroon, who is currently studying botany at the same varsity as mine,” he said.
Their proposal, for sending wheat seeds to space, was among the four that were accepted from across the world. These seeds, once back on Earth, will be examined at length to see the changes they underwent while in space.
 

Mahhad Nayyar poses with colleagues at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre.

“For me, just the fact that a Pakistani experiment is going to space matters the most, and the fact that we are finally on the ISS map,” Mahhad remarked. For him, it is a matter of national pride and a call to future Pakistani scientists, astronauts and aerospace engineers that nothing is beyond their reach, not even space.
The pride Mahhad talks about, he felt it the most when he visited the Kennedy Space Centre last week for the launch, making sure to keep a neatly folded Pakistani flag with him.

But Mahhad kept his excitement at bay because he knew entering the centre could be a lengthy process. It involved a lot of paperwork, and more so in his case, because Pakistan fell under the strictest criteria. A Nasa escort accompanied him throughout the visit. “Once inside, I worked with my Armenian, Nigerian and Egyptian colleagues on the final work required for the payload,” he recalled.
After a day’s delay that triggered Mahhad’s anxiety, the SpaceX Dragon Capsule finally took off from the Kennedy Space Centre’s Space Systems Processing Facility at 11:43am Eastern Time (around 8:43pm in Pakistan) on Friday and docked at the International Space Station just 15 hours after the launch.
There were many thoughts racing in his mind at the time, those of childlike wonder and pure fascination. “A rocket is essentially a controlled explosion and to put human beings on top of that and launch them to another realm of existence is not only thrilling but also leaves you in awe of how far science and technology has come for the betterment of humans.”
The science
As grand and groundbreaking as the project was, at first glance, it may seem too simple. Why wheat seeds? Isn’t that too ordinary for a space mission?
“For us, wheat seeds were a strong candidate because they’re a staple food in Pakistan and other countries,” said Haroon, the collaborator on the payload. Elaborating on the same, Mahhad told Dawn.com that the cultural and dietary significance of wheat made it a powerful symbol of sustenance, resilience and everyday life.
“Scientifically, wheat is also a strong candidate for space agriculture due to its relatively short growth cycle, high nutritional value, and adaptability to controlled environments. As space agencies explore long-duration missions and potential off-world settlements, crops like wheat will be essential to support human life sustainably,” he explained.

But most importantly, the crop serves as a bridge between nations, and while it has been studied in space before, this experiment focuses on a variety native to South Asia, cultivated in different climatic and soil conditions. Hence, both Mahhad and Haroon agreed that this could open the door to valuable comparative insights into genetic resilience and environmental adaptation under extreme conditions.
The scientific objective of the payload is to observe the effects of microgravity on the seeds. “One key focus will be on studying stomatal traits — the microscopic pores on the surface of leaves that regulate gas exchange and water loss. Stomata play a vital role in photosynthesis, respiration, and overall plant-water relations.
“By observing how these traits develop in a microgravity environment, we can better understand how space conditions may affect plant physiology at a structural and functional level. This could reveal critical insights into drought tolerance, water use efficiency, and stress adaptation,” Mahhad said.
Once the seeds come back to Earth, which is expected by the end of the month, they will be germinated under controlled conditions, and their physiological and anatomical traits will be studied.

“We will identify beneficial traits related to drought tolerance concerning stomata so these seeds won’t require extra water and will be good for both space and land. For sure they will have effect from space which will help us understand how this physiology is different from when they were sent to space,” Haroon added.
Moreover, if these traits prove to be beneficial, they could inform future breeding programmes to develop cultivars that require less water and are ideal for regions like Pakistan that are facing water scarcity or extreme climate stress. “The insights from this space-based study may help design crops that are not space-resilient but also more sustainable for vulnerable ecosystems on Earth.”
Beyond the science
But for Mahhad, the true impact of the payload goes far beyond the science behind it. Working with wheat — a staple food for millions across the globe — creates an opportunity for Pakistan and gives it a chance to connect space exploration with daily life in a way that feels intimate and real.
“It will open doors for young Pakistanis to understand, discover and fall in love with space,” he said, expressing the hope that the mission is remembered as a gentle but lasting turning point — a moment when space became a little more accessible, a little more culturally grounded, and a lot more inclusive. This also comes at a time when Pakistan, in collaboration with China, plans to send its first manned space mission to the latter’s space station
Personally, though, for Mahhad, this is just the beginning for him. A PhD student at Purdue University, Mahhad’s research revolves around space situational awareness, and his study has brought him face to face with some hard realisations.
“Emerging space economies such as Pakistan have a maximum of five objects in space; we have been unable to use the space medium adequately. Now this is not just a question of scientific exploration but also that of fundamental human equity. With developed countries now exponentially populating space with their objects, the space for countries like ours is shrinking every day.”
Mahhad wants to change this, for which Pakistan’s strategic geographical location is his biggest asset. “It is one of the best sites for looking into space traffic, and this data can be sold globally,” he said.
The benefits are not just monetary. A person going about their usual day may not even realise but space plays a huge part in their lives — from enabling smooth communication to navigating through traffic (basically Google Maps) and monitoring the climate. The benefits are endless.
“But all of this can only come through with situational awareness of the space environment,” the engineer stressed. He believes that this can only happen when Pakistan starts investing in a space programme, where students in universities, schools and colleges are encouraged to develop, launch and monitor satellites.
And to play his part, the 34-year-old plans to build a virtual mentorship lab to turn his story into a conversation starter, ultimately encouraging more experiments from Pakistan in space.
To prove his point, the engineer quotes his favourite astrophysicist and writer, Neil deGrasse Tyson: “Recognise that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centres of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life.
“So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That’s kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us.”

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has previously warned that the Assamese-speaking population “face the threat of attacks from the Bangladesh side, and even in their own villages”.
The northeastern state of around 31 million people is riven by multiple ethnic, linguistic and religious fault-lines, and was troubled by several bloody clashes in past decades.
Muslims make up roughly 35 per cent of the population, most of them Bengali speaking, according to the most recent national census in 2011, with the rest largely Hindus.
Sarma announced on Wednesday the introduction of a website “where indigenous people, who perceive a threat to their lives and reside in sensitive areas, can apply for arms licenses”. India has otherwise strict gun control laws, and critics and opposition leaders condemned the move.
“This will lead to gang violence and crimes based on personal vendettas,” said opposition Congress lawmaker Gaurav Gogoi on social media platform X.
“This is not governance, this is a dangerous step backwards towards lawlessness.”
Sarma is from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The move is part of a wider populist campaign by Sarma’s BJP government backing the majority Assamese-speaking people, including large-scale eviction drives against what he has called “illegal foreigners or doubtful citizens”.
It is widely seen as targeting Muslims speaking Bengali — the main language in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Six other suspects, including a surgeon, managed to escape during a pre-dawn raid, according to the police.
Earlier this month, Airport police had also unearthed a similar illegal operation in which a man was found undergoing a kidney removal procedure.
Police said on Thursday that Sub-Inspector Wasim Sarwar registered an FIR with the Rawat police, stating he and his subordinates heard screaming of an individual from inside a house during an anti-crime patrol at 12 o’clock midnight in Rafi Block, Phase VIII of Bahria Town.
He said an ambulance and other suspicious vehicles were also seen moving outside the house. “When the police reached the house located on the main road at 12:10am, they heard screams from inside,” the SI said.
He stated in the FIR that the police knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, but no one responded from inside. Considering human lives were at stake, they entered the house along with a lady constable and heard noises coming from one of the rooms.
 
 

As the police entered the room, they found a man fastened to a stretcher with pieces of rope. He was on a drip and shouting loudly: “Save me, save me.” Another person standing guard in the room attempted to escape.
The SI added that the police apprehended the man, who after interrogation revealed his name as Zafarullah Khan Cheema, a resident of district Hafizabad. Upon seeing the police, six individuals inside the house jumped over the walls and escaped.
According to the arrested suspect, the names of those who escaped were Imran, resident of Dhamial, Rawalpindi; Dr Manzoor (surgeon), resident of Hazro, Attock; Dr Aamir, of Mansehra; Gul Nawaz (assistant), Attock; Zeb (assistant), Attock, and Rafiq alias Fika.
It transpired later that the person on the stretcher was Hanan Zaid, resident of Sector I, Phase VIII, Bahria Town.
He informed the police that the suspects had called him for a job at the house. When he arrived, they gave him a glass of juice. After drinking the juice, he began feeling unwell and became semi-conscious. He said the suspects then took him to a hospital in the PWD area and conducted medical tests on him before he lost consciousness.
When he regained consciousness, he found himself tied to a stretcher in the same house, and said he was experiencing seizures.
When he asked why he had been tied up, they told him, “You’ve your medical done, and you have a damaged kidney that needs an operation. After that, you will get a job.”
He added that the suspects had forcibly kidnapped and detained him and intended to remove his kidney to sell it.
Zafarullah Cheema, now in police custody, told investigators that various people had been brought to the house, where their kidneys were removed and sold for transplants to both domestic and foreign clients.
Upon searching the rooms inside the house, police seized medical equipment and medicines used in the operation theatre. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the law, and an investigation is underway.

The demand was made by both treasury and opposition members during an assembly session chaired by Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi here.
Special assistant to the chief minister for housing Dr Amjad Ali said the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance was the root cause of unrest in the province, so the house should think about it.
“The house must think that the root cause of all this mayhem is the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance, 2019, so it should be abolished to prev ent further loss of public life and bring peace,” he said.

CM’s aide opposes military operations insisting they fuel terrorism

Mr Ali warned that there would be more chaos in KP and Balochistan if the ordinance remained in force.
He said he would never support more military operations as they fueled terrorism.
“At least I will not support military action even if the provincial government favours it because such actions fuel terrorism,” he said.
The aide to the chief minister said the people, who the military fought against, were trained, facilitated and launched by it against the USSR.
He said that the former rulers declared on record that 90,000 people were trained to fight against the USSR.
“Former military dictator General Pervez Musharraf and former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto termed mujahideen national heroes,“ he insisted.
Mr Ali said people questioned why terrorist infiltration into the country couldn’t be stopped.
He also said that Afghanistan shared a border with six countries but it was never heard that terrorists crossed from there into those countries.
Member of the opposition Awami National Party Mohammad Nisar Baaz said all the laws, which were being misused, should be abolished.
He said that when his party’s workers, office-bearers and lawmakers were attacked, many believed the target was just ANP, but the party
always termed the state’s “unwise” decisions the reason behind the poor law and order situation.
Mr Baaz said it was the PTI government that called the armed forces under Article 245 of the Constitution in aid of the civil power in the province.
He said that the PTI’s government extended the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011 to the entire province in 2019 but the same party obtained stay orders from the Supreme Court when the Peshawar High Court nullified that move.
“If the provincial government wants to abolish that ordinance, it should withdraw the stay orders it obtained,” he said.
The lawmaker said that even after two decades, peace could not be restored in the province and those responsible for maintaining law and order failed to fulfil their responsibilities.
He said that the armed forces were called in 2006 due to the law and order situation in Malakand region and even 21 years later, the armed forces were present in the province, with their expenses being paid from the provincial budget.
“It is a burden on our resources. If the house is serious about shrinking the armed forces’ role, the police and the CTD must be strengthened,” he said.
Mr Baaz requested the chair to call the provincial
police chief and additional inspector general of the counter-terrorism department to the house for briefing on investigation into the killing of ANP leader from Bajaur Maulana Khanzeb.
Adviser to the CM for communication and works Sohail Afridi said his leader and PTI founder Imran Khan dissolved assemblies and thought that elections would be held in 90 days but it took over a year for the electoral exercise to take place.
 
 

He said Imran was against drone strikes and military operations, so the PTI’s government would never allow any military offensive in the province.
“Terrorists come over and ask for a meal. If we refuse, we are killed by them and if we do not, we are killed by the security forces,” he said, wondering how terrorists reach residential areas.
Mr Afridi said terrorist movement in residential areas was an “intelligence failure” and that authorities “allowed” terrorist infiltration.
MPA Aurangzeb Khan said the situation would come under control only when people, security forces and police jointly fight against terrorists.
He said only people from the Orakzai tribal region decided not to allow any terrorists to operate in their area.
He said terrorists would be identified and their locations would be shared with law-enforcement agencies to see if any action was taken.
Member of the opposition PPP Ashbar Jan Jadoon said his party respected the military and judiciary as national institutions.
He said those calling the assembly seats reserved for women and non-Muslims unconstitutional must know those seats were allotted to parties and not individuals.
“You have been ruling this province for the last 12 years, what you have done so far against terrorism,” she asked the PTI members.
Mr Jadoon said attacks were a routine in the 2008-13 period, with the government funding terrorists.
MPA Obaidur Rehman said that from the previous Zarb-i-Azb military operation in the tribal region to the ongoing Sarbakaf action in Bajaur tribal district, the province had witnessed 22 such offensives against terrorisms, claiming 8,0000 lives, costing $140 billion and displacing 3.5 million people, but the government didn’t launch even a single project to rehabilitate those people.
“I ask state institutions how terrorists enter Pakistan, why they enter Pakistan only and why these Indian proxies don’t go to Punjab and Sindh,” he said.
The house unanimously passed MPA Asif Khan Mahsud’s resolution, seeking the renaming of South Upper Waziristan district as Mehsud Waziristan.
The chair later adjourned the sitting until Monday due to a lack of quorum.

The decision, announced through an official notification by the School Education Department on Wednesday, supersedes the previous directive to resume classes on Aug 14.
According to the notification, all district education authorities (DEAs) have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with the revised schedule. The extension comes amid ongoing extreme weather conditions in the province, though the notification did not explicitly cite a reason for the decision.
This marks the second adjustment to the academic calendar this summer. Parents and students are advised to note the revised date, while school administrations are expected to adjust their academic plans accordingly.
The Punjab government has not yet indicated whether the extended break will affect the overall academic year schedule or examinations.
Punjab School Education minister Rana Sikandar Hayat also tweeted about extension of summer vacations.
“Schools in Punjab will be opened from Sept 1,” he tweeted.

Speaking at a press conference along with Health Department Secretary Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Panizai and spokesman for the Balochistan government Shahid Rind, Mr Kakar affirmed that now the health department will not succumb to blackmail or pressure in the process of implementing structural reforms.
“With the adoption of mid- to long-term reforms and the integration of technology, we can resolve nearly half of our health sector problems,” Mr Kakar said, adding that administrative, financial and recruitment powers are being devolved to district levels, supported by the formation of divisional level committees.
The minister said that five new health-related laws have been passed to support reforms’ implementation and monthly performance review meetings have been initiated, focusing on underperforming districts.
“A centralised command and control centre has been established to directly monitor healthcare facilities in the province,” the health minister said, adding that for years, hospitals across the province have grappled with erratic medicine supplies and uneven deployment of healthcare professionals.
He said that promotions within the health department had been stalled since 2012 largely due to internal resistance, particularly from doctors who were unwilling to serve outside Quetta and this reluctance of doctors had left people living in rural areas critically underserved.
To address this major problem, the minister said, doctors admitted to medical colleges from various districts will now be sent to their home regions to serve the masses there. The government is now also constructing residential quarters and flats in remote areas of the province to improve living conditions and encourage doctors and other medical staff’s stay at their places of postings.

“The explosive device was planted near the outer railway signal and detonated shortly after the train passed, causing significant damage to the track but leaving the train unharmed,” a senior official told Dawn.
However, the railway track was badly damaged in the blast.
“A portion of the railway track was blown up in the blast,” railway police officials said, adding that train service has been suspended after the explosion and Quetta-bound trains stopped at Jacobabad station. The repair of the damaged railway line has started.
Following the explosion, security forces rushed to the scene to investigate. Preliminary findings revealed that the explosive device had been remotely detonated.

Through its systematic tracking, Fafen has identified 374 election petitions — 124 challenging the electoral outcomes in the National Assembly (NA) constituencies and 250 in the provincial assemblies’ (PA) constituencies.
So far, approximately two-thirds (62 per cent) of the petitions related to NA constituencies, and half (50 per cent) of those pertaining to PA constituencies, remain undecided.
According to Fafen update, between April 21 and July 31, 2025, election tribunals decided 35 election petitions related to the General Elections 2024 (GE-2024). With these decisions, the total number of resolved petitions reached 171, accounting for 46pc of the overall caseload pending before 23 tribunals across the four provinces.

Election tribunals only decided 35 petitions between April and July, report says

During the reporting period, 28 of the 35 decided petitions were from Punjab, three each from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and one from Balochistan. In Punjab, the four Lahore-based tribunals decided 15 petitions, the Bahawalpur tribunal decided nine, while the Rawalpindi and Multan tribunals decided two cases each.
In Sindh, the two Karachi tribunals decided three petitions. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Bannu tribunal decided three cases. In Balochistan, a Quetta tribunal decided one petition.
While Punjab tribunals have gained pace in deciding peitions, adjudication process in the remaining three provinces has slowed noticeably since April this year. As many as 12 out of the 23 election tribunals have not decided any petition since April 21, 2025.
Overall, Balochistan’s three tribunals collectively decided 44 out of 52 petitions (85pc) filed for NA and PA constituencies. Punjab’s eight tribunals resolved 94 out of 192 petitions (49pc). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s six tribunals decided 12 out of 43 petitions (28pc), while Sindh’s five tribunals disposed of 21 of 84 petitions (25pc).
Out of 124 petitions challenging NA constituency results, 47 (38pc) were decided so far. These include 30 from Punjab, nine from Balochistan, five from Sindh, and three from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Regarding PA constituencies, 124 out of 250 petitions (50pc) were decided, including 64 from Punjab, 35 from Balochistan, 16 from Sindh, and nine from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Out of the 171 petitions decided so far, 168 were dismissed, while only three were accepted. Among the 168 dismissals, 81 petitions (48pc) — including 24 related to NA constituencies and 57 to PA constituencies — were dismissed on grounds of non-maintainability. Another 22 petitions (13pc) — three from NA and 19 from PA constituencies — were dismissed after petitioners failed to prove their case during trial proceedings.
Independent candidates, supported by PTI, make the largest group of petitioners with 55pc of the total petitions filed by them, followed by PML-N candidates (13pc), PPPP candidates (8pc), unaffiliated independent candidates (7pc) and JUI-F candidates (7pc). As many as 16 other parties’ candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 12pc of the total petitions.
Around 65pc petitions of independent candidates, 54pc of PPPP, 54pc of PML-N, 40pc of JUI-F, and 38pc of PTI-backed independent candidates were disposed of till date.
The returned candidates belonging to PML-N make the largest group of defendants with 39pc of the petitions challenging their victory, followed by PTI-backed candidates (16pc), MQM-P candidates and PPPP candidates (13pc each), unaffiliated independents (6pc) and JUI-P (5pc). As many as 11 other defendant parties’ candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 8pc petitions.
So far, 84 verdicts of election tribunals have been challenged before the Supreme Court. Among these, three appeals were initiated by returned candidates against whom election petitions have been accepted.

This figure is more than double the 301,000 bales reported by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA).
Citing data from its Crop Reporting Service (CRS), a spokesperson for the department clarified on Thursday that the 609,000 bales of seed cotton were recorded up to July 31. In contrast, the PCGA’s estimate reflects only the cotton arriving at operational ginning factories in Punjab, irrespective of its origin.
The spokesperson emphasised that the CRS figures are based on internationally recognised, scientifically proven methods. These include randomised sampling, ground truthing techniques, and GPS-enabled tools, all of which are in line with FAO-endorsed methodologies. The CRS also utilises a real-time digital dashboard that ensures transparency and supports evidence-based policy decisions.
 
 

The department further argued that the PCGA figures fail to account for cotton held at the farm level, transferred to other provinces, or stored by stockists. “Persistent under-invoicing in recent years has distorted the accuracy of cotton reporting at ginning factories,” the spokesperson added.

Agriculture Department claims record yield, discrepancies with PCGA data

To clarify the situation, the department reiterated that the official record of national cotton production is based on estimates compiled by all provinces. As such, it suggested that comparisons with the fortnightly data on cotton arriving at ginning factories were not justified.
The department has also requested the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to implement a robust mechanism at all operational ginning factories to ensure real-time, accurate reporting of cotton received and processed.
“This step is essential for enhancing transparency, strengthening data integrity, and supporting coordinated efforts across institutions involved in cotton monitoring and policy formulation,” the spokesperson said.
This year, Punjab has seen significant success in cotton cultivation, with early planting carried out on 781,000 acres, contributing to a total sown area of 3.16 million acres.
Extensive support for the crop has included enhanced field services, active participation from universities, agricultural interns, and the private sector through the cotton campaign.

The auction of three remaining properties, owned by controversial real estate tycoon Malik Riaz, was shelved due to a “lack of qualifying bids”.
Although mediapersons were invited to cover the auction, they were not allowed to witness proceedings, which were held behind closed doors at NAB’s regional headquarters for Rawalpindi/Islamabad.
Following the auction, journalists seated in a separate committee room were handed a paper carrying brief details of its outcome.
Dozens of private vehicles were seen parked outside the NAB headquarters, ostensibly belonging to the bidders.
According to NAB’s advertisement, six properties were scheduled to be auctioned. However, only three were sold: Rubaish Marquee fetched Rs508 million, while the bureau received conditional offers of Rs876m and Rs881.5m for two of the property developer’s corporate offices.
NAB claimed that Rubaish Marquee was auctioned at Rs20m above its reserved price of Rs488m, while the other two properties were sold at the reserved prices set by the bureau.
 
 

A source in NAB told Dawn that the conditional offers for the two corporate offices were submitted as the bidders wanted to change the purpose of these premises in order to carry out other businesses at these venues.
The remaining three properties — Arena Cinema (reserve price Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn), and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), all located in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi — will be auctioned later.
No date has been announced yet for the next auction.
NAB documents stated that the properties were auctioned due to a default of a plea bargain amount in a reference filed against Zain Malik, Malik Riaz’s son-in-law and one of the owners of Bahria Town housing schemes.
Malik Riaz is currently abroad and is reportedly avoiding arrest in other references filed against him, including the high-profile £190m Al-Qadir Trust case and the Bahria Town Karachi case.
The auction followed the Islamabad High Court’s dismissal on Tuesday of petitions filed against the sale of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, thus allowing NAB to proceed with the auction scheduled for August 7.
Following the IHC go-ahead, Bahria Town approached the Supreme Court in a bid to restrain NAB from holding the auction.

The development came after a high-level meeting in Karachi where Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and MWM leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri addressed the media, confirming a seven-point agree­­ment.
The minister confirmed that the government would facilitate the extension of pilgrims’ visas for up to 60 days in coordination with the Iraqi government. He also assured the pilgrims that special discounted flights would be arranged for them.
 
 

The government will also ensure the refund of payments made to buses, transport companies and tour operators for land travel. Mr Chaudhry also emphasised that the Taftan-Rimdan border, a crucial route for pilgrims, would remain open, although the government has advised against land travel this year.
Allama Nasir pointed out that the travel restrictions caused immense difficulties for pilgrims. “But today, after successful talks and assurances from the government, we are end­ing our march,” he added.

• Met Office warns of more heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir
GILGIT: A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) from Shisper Glacier swelled the Hassanabad Nullah in Hunza, damaging infrastructure, and putting dozens of mountainside homes at risk in the mountainous region of Gilgit-Baltistan.
Officials said the heavy flood eroded the protective walls of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) and damaged farmland. Due to land erosion caused by the nullah, dozens of houses are at risk in case of such events in the future.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Manage­ment Authority (GBDMA), the flood damaged the newly constructed retaining wall and a portion of the Kara­koram Highway. Though the highway is open to all types of traffic, the damaged section has been sealed off for safety measures.
 
 

The authority said a significant area of cultivable land, along with standing crops and trees, had been wiped out in the flood, while the electricity supply to Hassanabad was also disrupted. Similarly, a property owned by the Forest Dep­artment had suffered damage while a portion of Frontier Works Orga­ni­sa­tion’s land adjacent to a bri­dge also sustained damage.
Locals said that four houses downstream were dismantled in time to save them from the flood. Last month, a similar Glof event damaged four houses, agricultural land, trees, and public and private properties.
The authority requested the National Highway Authority (NHA) to urgently visit the site to assess the damaged section and inspect other vulnerable parts of the road. Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committee members, GBDMA staff, and other volunteers were actively monitoring the situation on the site and supporting community preparedness and response efforts.
On the other hand, the Gilgit-Shandur Road remained closed off for the seventh day in Khotom village of the Phander valley, stranding thousands of people in the area.
Met Office alert
On the other hand, the Pakistan Meteorological Department on Thursday afternoon issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert, Dawn.com reported.

• Asad Qaiser demands transparent trial of Imran; Marwat seeks inquiry into ‘attack on parliament’
• Commerce ministry says $1 billion saved after US tariff reduced from 29 to 19pc
ISLAMABAD: As the PTI vigorously opposed any potential military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following a spike in terror incidents, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday said action against militants under the National Action Plan would continue, despite their objections.
The minister was responding to PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser in the lower house of parliament as the latter vowed to oppose any offensive in the PTI-ruled province to eradicate militancy.
Mr Qaiser warned against such attempts, saying they would put up resistance against such plans. His statement is consistent with PTI founder Imran Khan’s stance, who had asked the KP government to oppose such measures, as well as that of the tribal people who have expressed apprehensions against new military offensives.
In response, the minister ruled out a new operation but said measures under NAP would continue, adding that nobody can stop such measures.
Mr Chaudhry also urged the provincial authorities to fulfil their responsibilities to tackle the menace, saying Khyber Pakhtunkhwa received Rs700 billion under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award for counter-terrorism measures.
He, however, rued that the province had done nothing to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies.
“I know why you are disturbed,” he said while addressing Mr Qaiser. Chiding the PTI leadership for alleged resettlement of the TTP terrorists in Pakistan, he asked if they were with the militants or the state.
It may be noted that after initial action, a potential military operation had been postponed in Bajaur following successful talks between the Bajaur Aman Jirga and the banned TTP.
 
 

About the claims of Imran Khan being the most popular leader, he said popularity did not prove innocence, adding that monuments honouring martyrs had been desecrated during the May 9 violence in 2023.
Crackdown on PTI
Earlier, PTI leader Asad Qaiser also demanded a transparent and independent trial of Imran Khan. “We are referring to an ‘independent trial’ of cases against Imran Khan when we talk about his release”, he clarified.
He said that the PTI leadership had been struggling for the country’s sovereignty and fighting for the supremacy of the Constitution and law. He recalled that the PTI parliamentarians were whisked away from the Parliament House by unidentified men and now they were being disqualified on the pretext of the May 9 violence.
 






The opposition leader said the National Assembly had been turned into a rubber stamp, adding that he would ask his party members to boycott the proceedings of the house for being “unlawful”. He regretted that the gates of the house were closed for the PTI parliamentarians and a BPS-18 or BPS-19 officer humiliated them.
Disgruntled PTI member Sher Afzal Marwat questioned whether the PML-N and the PPP had signed the Charter of Democracy to misbehave with the leaders and parliamentarians of other political parties.
 






“Such an attitude is creating hatred in the political culture,” he said, adding that he would always remember the personnel of agencies and police standing outside the assembly. “I shall never tolerate these people outside the Assembly if I am given the authority of the speaker even for a day,” he remarked.
He demanded the constitution of a committee of the house for an inquiry into what he termed an “attack on Parliament House”. Mr Marwat was among several PTI lawmakers who had been picked up from the premises of parliament in a late-night raid in September last year.
US tariff
Earlier, during Question Hour, the house was told that the recent trade deal signed with the United States would boost Pakistan’s exports and positively impact the economy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the 19pc tariff rate offered to Pakistan was the lowest in the South Asian region.
Separately, the commerce ministry, in a written response, informed the house that the change in the US tariff from 29pc to 19pc saved Pakistan at least $1 billion.
“…instead of one billion dollars loss, Pakistan’s exports have the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market,” the response attributed to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said.
 






Lifesaving drugs
Responding to a calling attention notice, Parliamentary Secretary for National Health Services Nelson Azeem said that there was no shortage of lifesaving medicines, including insulin and cancer drugs. He admitted there was a shortage in May during tensions with India.
PPP’s Sharmila Farooqui, who raised the matter, however, noted that the parliamentary secretary was unaware of ground realities and insisted that there was an intermittent shortage in both urban and rural areas.
 






She regretted that about 100 key positions in the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan were vacant, affecting the performance of the authority responsible for controlling the prices and ensuring the availability of drugs.
She said, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the prices of these lifesaving drugs had been increasing by 17.5 per cent every year. According to the June price index, the prices went up by 13 and 15 per cent in urban and rural areas, respectively, she added.
