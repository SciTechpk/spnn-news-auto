Its leaders in both houses of Parliament have been sentenced to a decade in jail, along with over a hundred other members of their political party. They and seven other opposition parliamentarians have been removed from their elected offices. If you were to apply these words to any country on the planet, most people reading would immediately understand this to be a shameless power grab by an authoritarian status quo; the work of an insecure and dictatorial mindset that treats the will, dissent, and collective intelligence of its own people with ruthless contempt.
But I am intentionally making no such statement here. For now, I’d like to focus instead on one simple, apolitical, and logical question — what did the judgment actually say?
Even if you are not invested in law or politics, it is in your interest to keep an eye on how your judicial system treats others. Not just because that is how it could one day treat you, but because these judgments are representative of where we are as a country, to what extent our rights are enforced, and how we are viewed and treated by those in power.
The convictions in this case, no. 832/ 2023, were delivered by the Anti-Terrorism Court Faisalabad in a 71-page judgment on July 31 written in language far too long and technical to appeal to the average citizen. But I read it, so you don’t have to, and the following aims to be an objective, open-minded analysis.
The verdict
Much about the heart of this document is unravelled in its opening paragraphs. Consider the language it uses to describe how the May 9 protests began: “On the asking of leadership of PTI, the mob became furious …”. This was presented not as an allegation, but as fact. And there is more at play here than the assumption that people can develop emotions purely because someone “asked” them to (the possibility that fully grown adults might hold their own opinions didn’t even warrant consideration here).

A critical and complex legal question — to what extent can the leaders of a party be held responsible for the subsequent actions of its supporters, and how strong is the evidence for that link in this case — stood answered by the Judge before either side’s arguments were even addressed.

Further down, the evidence presented by the prosecution consists overwhelmingly of social media content, speaking of piles of screenshot printouts and USBs filled with YouTube and TikTok videos purported to be inflammatory. This point would have been much stronger if the witnesses had quoted the specific words spoken by the accused which constituted incitement to violence. In the absence of this, we are expected to trust blindly. To be fair, there is some strong evidence on the record as well, such as photographs of damages and injuries, the recovery of destroyed items, and eyewitnesses to firing, destruction of property, and violence against police officers. This establishes that property damage and violence was indeed done by some people on the ground. But it does not address the question of whether this was specifically ordered or pre-planned as part of a conspiracy. To deal with this point, enter witness 19.
The ‘witness’
He is a sub-inspector who apparently narrated a story of “instigation and abetment” committed at Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence during meetings on the 7th and 9th of May. This poses an obvious question — how did Mr Sub Inspector listen in to what was said at a high-level meeting between the former prime minister and his party leadership? In his own house? Twice?
One of the attendees of this meeting, former federal minister Hammad Azhar has claimed that the sole evidence relied upon here was that an officer was hiding under a table. And another was behind the curtains.
 






As ridiculous as that sounds, the story presented in the ATC’s judgment is even worse — absolutely nothing. We are explicitly told at paragraph 25 that two officers heard for themselves what was said during the Zaman Park meetings, but not a word as to how. They heard violent calls to anarchy, noted down the names of the 41 politicians in the room, and nominated all of them before the court. Simple.
The next evidence of a conspiracy presented to us is the report of “a secret meeting” that took place at the Rose Hotel in the motorway rest area of Chakri on May 4. At paragraph 24, we are told that an Inspector was informed of this meeting and told everything that was said in it by “a secret source”. Whether there could be a more flimsy and vague recount of evidence in a criminal trial is difficult to imagine.
On allegations of political victimisation
The judgment acknowledged that the people accused of hatching the conspiracy claim political victimisation; that they are being brutally harassed by the legal system from multiple directions, and that it is all to punish their party affiliation and break them into submission. It noted that they all plead not guilty.
And then it moved on to the 2023 film, ‘Money Back Guarantee’, starring Fawad Khan and Ayesha Omar. Fawad Chaudhry was busy attending the premiere, so he couldn’t have been at the conspiracy meeting. The rest of the accused apparently did not appear in court to present their defence. Whether it is more accurate to say did not or could not, I leave to you. But the priorities here appear clear.
 
 

Later in the judgment, it does finally address the claims of political victimisation. At the end of paragraph 27, it states: “If it was the case as asserted by present accused persons of abetment and conspiracy then why the all [sic] prominent leaders of PTI were not dragged for alleged conspiracy and abetment …”. One struggles to find polite words to address an argument as weak as this one. But to put it simply, if you are actively locking up 100 members of the country’s largest opposition party, it is not enough to say, “at least I’m not arresting the rest of them”. Serious claims of victimisation like those made here ought to be addressed by a court in appropriate detail, and not in a single dismissive sentence.
An ode to the Raj
From this point onwards in the judgment, law takes a backseat, and we are taken on a journey through subcontinental history and moral philosophy. In a strangely counterintuitive point to bring up, it recalls in paragraph 28 that the sections of the penal code it is currently using to lock up the opposition were inserted by Lord Macaulay, a British coloniser, to lock up his opposition. It then goes on to compare May 9 with “the famous mutiny of 1857”, using colonial language for a historical event that we ordinarily refer to as the first war of independence, and reminding us that following this, “mass violation of these laws was seldom made by the masses in their own countries …”.
One wonders why on Earth such a comparison would be inserted into a criminal law judgment, or whether its implications were truly understood. Is the ATC Faisalabad comparing PTI protestors to the brave freedom fighters of the subcontinent who revolted against their colonisers? Is it comparing itself or someone else to the British Raj? If not, what did it possibly gain, or what legal point did it strengthen by adding these thoughts?
 
 

A short and sweet paragraph 29 asserts that the fact that a huge number of events took place on May 9, in almost all major cities, “shows that these events were organised and minutely and carefully planned with well thought out strategy and intentional design”. But to assume that the existence alone of mass protest is enough to prove its meticulous planning is in defiance of both history and logic.
Did the massive and occasionally violent protests against the murder of George Floyd across all major cities of America have one mastermind meticulously planning them out? What about the uprising against Nicolae Ceaușescu in Romania? Or even, to use this judgment’s own example, the first war of independence in 1857? It is of course, not outside the realm of possibility that this or any protest could have a degree of planning involved behind the scenes that is not known to the public. But if this is to be proven in a court of law, and used to lock people up, it requires clear evidence. Not half-baked conjecture.
The fault with the PTI
In paragraph 31, the judgment goes into a broad and bizarrely philosophical critique of PTI as a political party — “the culture of nihilism was intentionally promoted with solipsistic approach and the workers were made to believe that they alone are laudable and all others are condemnable”. The word salad that continues for the next several lines is too long and verbose to reproduce here, but the paragraph ends with the conclusion that this political party has by virtue of its existence and beliefs, attacked all of humanity, civilisation, and “conscious human efforts, spread on centuaries, [sic] to create some practicable and effective political system”. His Lordship seems to have exercised great restraint by choosing not to declare PTI to be the real mastermind behind the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.
At this point, the question of “okay, but how is all of this relevant to a judicial order?” is so glaringly obvious that the very next paragraph seeks to address it: “Despite above discussion still the law requires sufficient proof for punishment of alleged offences and the convictions should be based on cogent and reliable evidence …”. Wonderful. On a side note, have you ever listened to a friend badmouth someone behind their back for hours on end, but they made sure to close it off with ‘but who am I to judge?’. That last line didn’t inspire a lot of confidence, did it?
 
 

Guilty by presence
Moving on to individual convictions, the judgment declares that everyone present during the allegedly conspiratorial meetings has been proved of abetment/instigation “beyond a shadow of doubt”. An Inspector adds that the presence of one gentleman, Makhdoom Zain Hussain Qureshi, could not be established at the meetings, and therefore he is acquitted.
This creates yet another bizarre legal position. Even if one were to assume that conspiracies were indeed being hatched during these meetings (for which no solid evidence has been provided), how can presence alone, in the absence of any proof of contribution to conspiracy be deemed a sufficient indicator of guilt? What if a party member attended, listened quietly, left, and went home? Does the law truly envision a 10-year prison sentence for the crime of silence? If stepping foot in the room was enough for the ATC to determine “beyond a shadow of doubt” that one is guilty of conspiracy, what about the people serving tea and biscuits at meetings like these? Should they too be locked up for a decade each?
Ultimately, through this judgment, the ATC Faisalabad has convicted 108 people and acquitted 77. The convicted maintain a right of appeal, but the Election Commission of Pakistan has been quick to disqualify all nine members of Parliament who were convicted, and their seats have been declared vacant. Vacant seats in Parliament are re-filled through by-elections. And this raises a new question — if the convictions are overturned in appeal, but a new MNA or MPA has already been elected on the vacated seat, who is to prevail?
The good news is that all of this can (and if we are to maintain any shred of hope in our justice system, should) be overturned in appeal. But much damage has already been done. This judgment is as bad at the law as it is at grammar. It makes no efforts to conceal its biases, choosing instead to flaunt them wherever it can, diving deep into explicitly political questions of who the people of Pakistan should or should not support, and doing so with an embarrassingly weak understanding of history, political theory, and the fundamental rights of free movement and association.
It is written in a style and tone that despite its inability to go two pages without a typo, assumes it knows better than you — consistently revealing a worldview that sees the people of Pakistan as easily influenced sheep, incapable of reaching their own opinions and undeserving of the freedoms inherent to a normal democracy. It treats its readers with contempt, and all but ensures that the feeling is mutual.
These are all conclusions that should matter to every Pakistani. Regardless of political beliefs or associations. Whether you like the person who was convicted or not. If a top politician can be locked up under legal reasoning that is so weak that a child could see through it, so can you. The principles at play here rise above politics and into the realm of individual liberties and the rule of law, which once chipped away, leave every single one of us more vulnerable. Yet oftentimes, developments like these are reduced to the  adversarial nature of political contention, where one side must support and the other must oppose. That is flawed.
Once you read the judgment, you realise it’s not just some politicians whose future is being attacked. It’s yours.</p><small>2025-08-11 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111425539fdfc07.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930179/rahul-gandhi-others-arrested-in-new-delhi-for-protesting-against-controversial-electoral-roll-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Rahul Gandhi, others arrested in New Delhi for protesting against controversial electoral roll: local media</strong></a><br><p>Indian Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, along with other Indian opposition members, was detained by police while marching to the Election Commission of India (ECI) headquarters in New Delhi on Monday, in an attempt to protest against a controversial electoral roll in India’s Bihar, the Press Trust of India reported.
In June, the revision of the voter rolls was announced ahead of the upcoming polls in the eastern state. The move, which requires that all potential voters in Bihar provide proof of citizenship by July 25, sparked nationwide fears of disenfranchisement after many voters were given only weeks to prove their citizenship.
Labelling the move “a murder of democracy”, the protesting members of parliament marched from the Parliament to the election regulator’s office, where they were stopped halfway through the march, reported PTI.
As the police attempted to thwart the protest, some MPs climbed up to the barricade — set up by the police ahead of the march — and chanted slogans against the ECI.
The protestors carried placards alleging “vote theft”, PTI said.
According to PTI, the protesting MPs included: T R Baalu (DMK), Sanjay Raut (SS-UBT), Derek O’Brien (TMC), Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, as well as other MPs from opposition parties like the DMK, the RJD, and Left parties.
Opposition leaders in the Indian parliament have repeatedly discussed how the move aims to “disenfranchise” voters in Bihar ahead of the election in September and have called for the rollback of the announcement.
Rahul, in a post on X, said the “Truth of vote theft is now before the country,” after he was detained.
He vowed to continue the “fight to protect democracy.”
 






As per the PTI report, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had written to the ECI earlier and asked them to hold discussions over the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls, among other issues.
“Thereafter, the MPs wish to collectively meet with the Commission on a host of issues, including but not limited to Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls being undertaken in Bihar and proposed to be undertaken in other states as well,” the PTI quoted him as saying.
“We look forward to meeting with the Commission, which will be in keeping with the highest tradition of our parliamentary democracy,” he said, according to PTI.</p><small>2025-08-11 09:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11123818001ffd6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930169/award-winning-al-jazeera-journalist-anas-al-sharif-3-colleagues-killed-in-targeted-israeli-airstrike' target='_blank'><strong>Award-winning Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al Sharif, 3 colleagues killed in targeted Israeli airstrike</strong></a><br><p>Prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas Al Sharif, who had previously been threatened by Israel, was among four colleagues killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, in an attack widely condemned by media and rights groups.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
Al Sharif, aged 28, was among a group of four Al Jazeera journalists and an assistant who were killed in a “directed assault” on a tent opposite Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and Al Jazeera said. An official at the hospital said two other people were also killed in the strike.
Calling Al Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”, Al Jazeera said the attack was a “desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza”.
The other journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, and photographers Ibrahim Al Thaher and Mohammed Noufal.
 






Israel’s military admitted it targeted and killed Al Sharif, alleging he had headed a Hamas cell and “was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians” and troops.
Al Jazeera rejected the claim and said that before his death, Al Sharif had also dismissed earlier claims by Israel that he was connected to Hamas.
The Qatar-based outlet held the “Israeli occupation forces and government responsible for deliberately targeting and assassinating its journalists”.
“This follows repeated incitement and calls by multiple Israeli officials and spokespersons to target the fearless journalist Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues,” it noted.
“Anas Al Sharif and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices in Gaza conveying the tragic reality to the world,” Al Jazeera said.
 






A press freedom group and a United Nations expert previously warned that Al Sharif’s life was in danger due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month that Israel’s claims against him were unsubstantiated.
 






Al Sharif was previously part of a Reuters team, which in 2024 won a Pulitzer Prize in the category of Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Amnesty Australia also recognised him with a Human Rights Defender Award in December 2024.
Al Sharif, whose X account showed more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform minutes before his death that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.
In a pre-written message released on his X account after his killing, Al Sharif lambasted those who remained silent and called on the world to speak for Palestine.
“… I never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing,” he said.
“I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland,” Al Sharif added.
 






Last October, Israel’s military had named Al Sharif as one of six Gaza journalists it alleged were members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, citing documents it said showed lists of people who completed training courses and salaries.
“Al Jazeera categorically rejects the Israeli occupation forces’ portrayal of our journalists as terrorists and denounces their use of fabricated evidence,” the network said in a statement at the time.
The Gaza government media office said 237 journalists have been killed since Israel’s onslaught started on Oct 7, 2023, of which 186 have been confirmed by CPJ as well.
Dawn, corroborating details from various credible sources, has compiled a list of over 250 slain journalists.
Media bodies slam Israel’s killing of journalists
Journalists’ groups and Al Jazeera denounced the killings.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which in July urged the international community to protect Al Sharif, said in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.
“Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,” said Sara Qudah, CPJ’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“Journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable,” Qudah added.
 






“Israel’s ongoing campaign of targeted assassinations of Palestinian journalists is a war crime, plain and simple,” said National Executive Director Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in a statement.
“The murder of these Al Jazeera journalists is not an accident or collateral damage — it is part of a consistent, documented policy of silencing media voices and hiding the truth of the genocide being carried out by Israel in Gaza,” Awad said.
The Freedom of the Press Foundation also condemned the killings, calling for international action to halt further attacks on the media, according to Al Jazeera.
“Everyone who has been angered by recent horrific images of starvation and suffering in Gaza needs to recognise that they wouldn’t see those images, and wouldn’t know about the atrocities their governments bankroll, without journalists risking their lives,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the New York-based nonprofit, said in a statement.
“That is exactly why Israel is targeting and killing them in violation of international law. Now, perhaps more than any other time since the killing began, the world understands how vital these journalists’ work is.
“The calls for the assassinations to end must be louder than ever, and we can’t let our leaders get away with mere expressions of concern or performative condemnations while the money and weapons Israel uses to exterminate journalists and other civilians keep flowing.”
US Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called on the United States to stop providing weapons for this genocide“ in Gaza.
“The Israeli military has killed more than 200 journalists and media workers,” Jayapal highlighted on X.
 






The Palestinian mission to the UN said the journalists had “systematically and dutifully exposed and documented Israel’s genocide and starvation” in Gaza.
 






Hamas said the killing may signal the start of an Israeli offensive.
“The assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,” Hamas said in a statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would launch a new offensive to dismantle Hamas strongholds in Gaza, where a hunger crisis is escalating after 22 months of conflict.</p><small>2025-08-11 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11130139b0584b4.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930172/pm-president-stress-protecting-minority-rights-hail-their-patriotism' target='_blank'><strong>PM, president stress protecting minority rights, hail their patriotism</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani leadership, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of minorities while hailing their services to the country on Monday, in celebration of National Minorities Day.
National Minorities Day is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion. The day aims to highlight the religious and socio-economic rights of minorities in Pakistan.
In separate addresses today, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz both reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding and advancing the rights of minorities while acknowledging their contributions to the country.
The president reaffirmed his resolve to continue efforts to promote interfaith harmony, brotherhood and unity to build an inclusive and prosperous Pakistan.
“This day reflects Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s vision of a Pakistan where every citizen lives in equality, harmony, and mutual respect,” he said, according to a press release.
 






The president said that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights to all citizens “irrespective of religion, caste, creed, or colour”, and that it safeguarded the political, economic, religious, social and cultural rights of minorities.
“Pakistan stands resolutely against all forms of discrimination, extremism, and religious intolerance,” he stressed. “We remain determined to build a society free from prejudice — one that embraces diversity as a strength and is anchored in mutual respect, interfaith harmony, and shared progress.”
He added that the day was also an occasion to acknowledge the contributions of the minority communities to nation-building, saying that they had served the country with dedication in the armed forces, judiciary, civil services, education and healthcare.
Their patriotism and service remained a “source of pride for the entire nation”, he added.
The president noted measures taken by the country for the welfare and empowerment of minorities, including the establishment of the National Commission for Minorities, allocation of a Minorities Welfare Fund, restoration and preservation of places of worship and provision of scholarships and financial assistance to minority students.
“We continue to promote interfaith dialogue and ensure meaningful participation of minorities in every sphere of national life,” he added.
In a separate address, PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the full inclusion of minorities in government institutions, Parliament and the national mainstream while appreciating their role in the country’s development and progress.
“The welfare and well-being of all minorities in Pakistan, be they Sikhs, Christians, Hindus (or) Parsis, is one of the priority duties of the government of Pakistan,” he said.
He emphasised the services rendered by minorities “in every walk of life”, including those who had sacrificed their lives defending Pakistan.
“We pay tribute to them from the bottom of our hearts,” he said. “Pakistan is proud of its minorities’ patriotism, professional hard work and attachment to national heritage and culture.”
The PM also stressed that protecting minority rights, aside from a constitutional obligation, was also a religious duty, saying, “Islam specifically advocates the protection of civil, religious and social rights of minorities. Ulema and religious leaders play a key role in protecting religious freedom.”
He called on all Pakistanis to practise unity and solidarity, mutual respect and tolerance.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also acknowledged National Minorities Day, appreciating the role of minorities in the development of the country.
“The true strength and beauty of Pakistan lies in its diversity,” he said in a post on social media, calling the safeguarding and respecting of minority rights an “unbreakable pillar of the country’s democratic vision”.
“Our struggle is for a Pakistan where no citizen feels isolated or unsafe due to their religion, but where bonds of brotherhood rise above prejudice.”
 






Statements were also made by Federal Minister for Human Rights Azam Nazeer Tarar and Chief Minister for Sindh Murad Ali Shah.
 
 

Tarar called the occasion a “solemn reminder of our shared responsibility to ensure that every citizen of Pakistan enjoys equality, justice, and respect, irrespective of faith”.
He echoed the messages of the PM and president, emphasising the vision of the country’s founding father for a state “where religion would never hinder the rights, dignity, or equal standing of its people”, as well as Islamic teachings to “uphold justice without exception”.
“Let us pledge to build a Pakistan where diversity is celebrated, unity is our strength, and justice remains our guiding principle”, the minister said.
Meanwhile, CM Murad condemned intolerance against minorities and reaffirmed the province’s commitment to peaceful co-existence.
“Our beloved Sindh has always been tolerant and progressive in terms of religious freedom,” he said while addressing a gathering at a Hindu temple in Karachi. During his speech, he compared the province to “intolerant” Western democracies.
“In our province, across the board, we condemn actions against minorities because we are the land of Sufis,” he said, adding, “The Sufis of Sindh have always given the same lesson, which is that we should all co-exist in peace and harmony.
“I am happy to see today that our Hindu, Sikh and Parsi brothers are standing and celebrating the day together.”
He reaffirmed that the government of Sindh would “always stand with minorities” and that action would always be taken against any “unfortunate incident” against minorities in Sindh.
On Sunday, the Sindh Workers Welfare Board decided to extend its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.
However, despite the leadership’s statements, religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of mob attacks, forced conversions and blasphemy cases, as noted by the European Union’s Sebastien Lorion.
Last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das acknowledged that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.
According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been approved by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.</p><small>2025-08-11 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111207008cf9b3f.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930162/7-dead-6-injured-in-gbs-danyor-as-landslide-hits-volunteers-restoring-water-supply' target='_blank'><strong>7 dead, 6 injured in GB’s Danyor as landslide hits volunteers restoring water supply</strong></a><br><p>At least seven volunteers died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and melting glaciers have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 deaths have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists missing.
Thirteen volunteers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.
“Thirteen volunteers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,” Gilgit’s Rescue 1122 said in a statement.
 
 

Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.
Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told Dawn.com that the bodies and injured had been moved to “various hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor”.
On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah inundated residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.
Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.
A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of volunteers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.
An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. “Our hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,” Faraq said.
Residents protest against govt ‘inaction’

Funeral prayers were later held for the volunteers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.
Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.
The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.
“The families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,” CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p><small>2025-08-11 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1112004131d5d63.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930167/govt-begins-2nd-phase-of-receiving-haj-2026-applications' target='_blank'><strong>Govt begins 2nd phase of receiving Haj 2026 applications</strong></a><br><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony has opened the second phase of receiving Haj applications for 2026, which will be accepted from August 11 to August 16, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Monday.
On Saturday, the ministry successfully completed the first phase for Haj next year, receiving more than 71,000 application submissions through its online portal and designated banks, the ministry’s spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt said in a statement.
“In the second phase, which will continue till Saturday, unregistered intending pilgrims can also submit their applications. The process of receiving applications will continue through the ministry’s online portal and designated banks,” the report said.
Overseas Pakistanis can also apply for Haj through designated banks via a close relative. “Those living abroad will be required to submit their medical fitness certificates upon arrival in Pakistan,” it said.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
Last month, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistic measures for the pilgrimage season.
Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf said during a presser that the Kingdom allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators — pending final confirmation by Saudi authorities.
“The government scheme will offer both the traditional 38–42-day package and a shorter 20–25-day option,” the minister said, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
He added that estimated costs would range between Rs1.15 to Rs1.25 million, depending on the finalised agreements with service providers.</p><small>2025-08-11 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111314551459a4f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930088/death-of-woman-fleeing-moral-policing-sparks-outrage-in-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>Death of woman fleeing ‘moral policing’ sparks outrage in AJK</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: The death of a young woman after falling from a cliff on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad on Saturday has triggered widespread outrage across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with demands for the harshest punishment for those accused of harassing couples under the guise of “moral policing” to extort money or valuables.
According to a police spokesperson, the incident occurred at about 1:15pm near Mera Tanolian village on Pir Chinasi Road, when Aqeel Ahmed and his tenant Fakhra Amjad — both residents of the Plate neighbourhood in Muzaffarabad — had stopped their Mehran car by the roadside while returning from a drive.
Three to four men, one of them a police constable in plainclothes, confronted the pair, deemed their presence “suspicious” and began beating Aqeel.
During the assault, Ms Amjad got out of the car and tried to flee, but fell approximately 100–120 feet down a mountainside into a ravine, sustaining critical head injuries.
Aqeel, also injured, tried to take her to hospital, but she died on the way. Police arrested Aqeel and Amir, son of Gul Zaman — a police constable from Mera Tanolian posted elsewhere — and were searching for the remaining suspects, the spokesperson said, adding legal proceedings had been initiated.
The incident sparked street protests and a wave of online condemnation of so-called “moral brigades” accused of harassing and blackmailing couples for extortion.
On Sunday, dozens gathered outside the press club, demanding to know under what law anyone could question people about their relationships or reasons for visiting tourist spots.
Shahid Zaman Awan, a civil society activist, said if police had done their job, there would have been no need for the protest.
“Instead of swooping on those who caused the girl’s death, they have arrested the boy who accompanied her. This is the worst example of traditional police tactics,” he said.
According to many netizens, such incidents had been occurring in this and some other areas as well for a long time, but most victims would avoid reporting them to the police or speaking out publicly.

The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) on Sunday announced that it would stage a protest outside Chief Minister House on Monday (today) over the police failure to provide protection to the legal fraternity.
Soldier Bazar police station SHO Waqar Azeem told Dawn that lawyer Nasir Malik, 38, had gone to meet his sister at Al-Fareed Apartment in Garden East on Business Recorder Road.
He was inside the parking area of the building when armed men opened indiscriminate fire on him and fled on motorcycles and in private cars. The lawyer sustained critical bullet wounds in the head. He was taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.

The officer said the murder appeared to be an outcome of personal enmity as the deceased had a property dispute with someone in the area.
He said the victim’s brother had nominated four persons in the FIR under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code and efforts were underway to arrest them.
Lawyers’ announce strike today
Speaking to Dawn, president of KBA Aamir Nawaz Warraich said the KBA would stage a protest outside CM House on Monday (today) and the legal fraternity would boycott judicial proceedings.
Mr Warraich said Advocate Nasir had been brutally murdered, while the police authorities had previously assured them that lawyers would be provided protection.
“In the past 10 days, three advocates have been attacked — two of whom have died while the third one is critically injured,” he added.
 
 

He said they demand that the government immediately issue arms licences to lawyers and arrest the culprits involved in the attacks on lawyers, including senior lawyer Khawaja Shams ul Islam.
Mr Warraich reiterated that a protest would be held outside CM House on Monday and lawyers would boycott judicial proceedings.
Meanwhile, the traffic police announced that Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road will be closed from 8am due to security concerns. They announced alternative routes for traffic going towards I.I Chundrigar Road.

Pakistan, who won the opening ODI by five wickets, posted a competitive 171-7 in 37 overs in a rain-truncated match but West Indies prevailed by five wickets to draw level in the three-match series.
Pakistan’s part-time duo of Saim Ayub and Salman Agha conceded a combined 66 runs in seven wicketless overs as West Indies cruised home.
“You could say our fifth bowler gave away too many runs but in recent years, Salman Agha and Saim Ayub have both bowled well for us,” Rizwan said after the match.
“Saim didn’t have the best day today, but he performed well in the T20Is. That’s just part of the game.”
Rizwan said they could not read the conditions and several rain delays did not help their cause.
“Honestly, the weather forecast has been completely different from expectations, and it’s hard to read.
“We’re keeping our options open and will finalise the XI after assessing the conditions.”

•  Federal committee, including GB leadership, meets today to discuss resolution
GILGIT: The ongoing sit-in on Karakoram Highway (KKH) has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass for the 22nd consecutive day on Sunday as deadlock between government and protesters persisted.
The federal committee constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet on Monday (today) to make recommendations for resolving the issue. GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza, PPP President Amjad Hussain Advocate, former GB chief minister and PML-N President Hafeezur Rehman have also been included in the committee.
Trade and travel between Pakistan and China, as well as business activities at the Sost Dry Port, have remained shut for the past 22 days.
The protest sit-in, called by the Tajir Ittehad Action Committee — backed by trade organisations, government and opposition parties, and religious groups in the region — is being staged at Sost, blocking trade activities between Pakistan and China in support of their demands.
Members of a committee formed by Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan to resolve the matter had met the protest organisers on Friday. They discussed the issues and prepared recommendations to present to the Prime Minister’s committee.
The protesters have given a two-point agenda to the committee. They demanded exemption of GB residents from income tax, sales tax, and other federal taxes on items imported from China through the Khunjerab Pass.  They also demanded Customs clearance of 280 consignments stuck at Sost Dry Port for over a year under a one-time amnesty scheme.
The protesters announced that they would not call off their protest until their demands are implemented.
Addressing the protest, Rehan Shah, PML-N Hunza president, said that the people of GB have long been demanding their constitutional and legal rights. He added that political, religious, and trade organisations — along with both government and opposition members in GB — support these demands.
He stated that GB has been deprived of constitutional and legal rights for the past seven decades.
Zahoor Karim, PPP local president, said the federal government should only collect taxes after giving GB representation in Pakistan’s National Assembly and Senate. He stressed that the “economic murder” of GB residents would not be tolerated.
“The FBR has introduced policies to deprive GB people of their economic resources. Trade between Pakistan and China has been closed for a year, and goods worth billions of rupees are stuck at Sost Port — some damaged by rain and others expired,” he said.
Protesters said that the majority of GB residents depend on cross-border trade between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.

He was speaking to the media at a local hotel on Sunday after paying his respects to revered Sufi saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai on the second day of his three-day urs celebration.
MQM-Pakistan district organiser Zafar Siddiqui, MPAs Nasir Qureshi and Rashid Khan, Sharif Khan and other party leaders accompanied the governor.
“You will see the old MQM performing again and there will be same old discipline that will be seen which is its hallmark,” he said, and added that MQM was weakened and now people were realising this injustice with the party.
“Everyone realises that MQM sends common man, and not waderas, capitalists and jagirdars, to elected houses,” he remarked.
Governor Tessori observed that for the last 17 years, no development had taken place in Hyderabad.
“Only ‘bhai log’ will ensure development because ever since MQM people started using ‘saheb’ with their name, things went awry for the party,” he viewed.
When asked by a questioner what he was alluding to in back-to-back double entendre in his speeches, he said he would not unfold everything, but hastened to add: “Apkay hosh urr jaey gey jo honay ja raha hay”.
‘World’s biggest fireworks’
“We have biggest digital stage in Bagh-i-Mustafa which is being built for last five days,” he said, and added that soon Rahat Fateh Ali Khan would again be here to perform. “Sindh’s iconic singer Abida Parveen is to enthral audience in Pucca Qila at a separate event soon,” he said. He also announced that ‘world’s largest fireworks’ spanning over 90 minutes would be held at Governor House as part of the ongoing celebrations in Karachi.
Governor unhappy with Sindh govt over protocol
Governor Tessori said that Sindh belonged to him and he didn’t talk about a division.
“When I went to Bhit Shah [today] to pay respect to Shah Latif Bhitai, the culture minister didn’t receive me, although he was present there to see off the Balochistan chief minister. But before my arrival, he [the minister] had left,” he said. He said this showed who believed in division.
Hyderabad package
The governor reiterated that Hyderabad was all set to receive Rs10bn development package, of which Rs5bn for the year 2024-25 had been transferred to the Pakistan Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (PIDCL).

“Rule the world” suggests the global hegemony, in which Anglo-American “special relationship” has shaped global institutions, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Nato, and promoted liberal norms and upheld a rules-based international order.
Although metaphorical and unofficial, this phrase has outgrown its UK origins to embody a wider European worldview that crystallised during and after the Cold War.
The West’s victory in the Cold War with the collapse of the Soviet Union not only affirmed liberal democracy and capitalism as the dominant political and economic models — famously framed as the “end of history”, but also deeply entrenched within the broader European mindset the belief that the transatlantic alliance between Europe and the US is the cornerstone of Western global supremacy.
 
 

This phrase remains the key to understanding the unique convergence of intellect and might that influenced the Allied victory in World War II, the establishment of the postwar world order and the globalisation of Western universalism after the Cold War. Within European political circles, this convergence has led to a deep conviction that the Europe-US alliance is not merely historically successful but geopolitically essential.

Enduring legacy of ‘America First’ is visible in Washington’s strategic posture: evaluating alliances through cost-benefit lenses, resisting open-ended security commitments and replacing moral leadership with pragmatic bargaining

Over time, this conviction has hardened into what could be termed a doctrine of “transatlantic indispensability”. This belief rests on three pillars: First, European security remains fundamentally tied to US military guarantees; second, the stability of the global rules-based order depends on US leadership and muscle, supported by Europe’s strategic insight and normative legitimacy; and third, transatlantic cooperation is not merely beneficial but structurally irreplaceable.
Based on this geopolitical asymmetry, it is not hard to understand why Europe, despite its economic size and global ambitions, often responds differently in negotiations with the US and with China. Even when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum, threatened European auto exports, and publicly questioned Nato, alongside pushing through a bilateral asymmetric and unbalanced deal, Europe’s core institutions and major powers did not retaliate with full force.
Instead, they chose strategic restraint with only verbal complaints, seeking to preserve the long-standing alliance and avoiding escalation. Europe’s acceptance of unfavorable terms indicates not just economic weakness, but strategic realism.
The US remains the exceptional enforcer of the liberal order and Western hegemony, a role cemented during World War II and the Cold War. This historical legacy continues to shape Europe’s strategic consciousness and dictate its policy choices.
A good example is the defence agreement approved by Denmark in June 2025, which grants the US’ unrestricted access to Danish air bases and stipulates that US military personnel will remain under US legal authority. This means they are, in many cases, exempt from Danish legal jurisdiction — especially regarding actions taken by US troops on Danish territory.
The agreement has sparked debate over possible conflicts with Denmark’s constitutional framework and concerns about the country’s capacity to hold US soldiers accountable for unlawful conduct committed within its borders.
In contrast, Europe has taken a much harder stance in trade negotiations with China, increasingly labeling it a “systemic rival”. The EU has imposed trade barriers, launched anti-subsidy investigations, and pushed for so-called reciprocity in market access and technology transfer. The rise of China is seen as not only challenging the global geopolitical status quo, but also undermining the fundamental assumptions that underpin the notion of transatlantic indispensability.
While Europe may view the transatlantic alliance as essential and rooted in shared interests, the Trump administration, together with a growing segment of US strategic thinking, sees it quite differently. This divergence in worldview poses a real challenge to the continued relevance of the phrase. For some in Washington during the Trump era, Europe is viewed not as a strategic partner but as a burden.
 


It is regarded as a group of wealthy nations benefiting from US security and market access without offering fair contributions in return.
What is rooted in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda is a departure from the post-World War II transatlantic consensus, in which US leadership was seen as a long-term investment in global stability and Western dominance. Instead, Trump’s foreign policy leans toward transactionalism, strategic retrenchment and even admiration for “spheres of influence” defined by great powers, echoing a 19th-century style balance-of-power realism.
Europe’s continued strategic deference is to a US that is no longer the stabilising, multilateral, or predictable power it once was. Under the Trump administration, “America­nness” has been irreversibly transformed.
The enduring legacy of “America First” is visible in Washington’s strategic posture: evaluating alliances through cost-benefit lenses, resisting open-ended security commitments and replacing moral leadership with pragmatic bargaining.
Yet Europe, caught between its deep fear of Russia and economic and technological pressure from China, continues to defer to US leadership without building real strategic autonomy.
This subordination is unlikely to yield security or influence; instead, it risks accelerating Europe’s fragmentation and decline. The vision of a strong, united, and prosperous Europe is fading, being replaced by dependence without leverage in a world driven by power, not principle — a reality actively championed by the US.
Without unity, credible defence capabilities and a coherent foreign policy independent of Washington, Europe will remain reactive. The “America First” doctrine has revealed that this alliance is no longer taken for granted in Washington.
The old logic of the transatlantic alliance is being challenged by internal disillusionment within the West itself. Whether Europe can adapt to a new era of emerging powers and strategic competition or give way to a more fragmented and transactional world order remains one of the most important geopolitical questions of our time.—China Daily/ANN

Both sides had held multiple rounds of talks earlier this year, but the dialogue did not move forward due to a stalemate on PTI’s demands, including the formation of a commission for the May 9 violence.
Speaking on a private TV show, the Senator said in democracies, the opposition uses constitutional and democratic ways, not violent protest. He termed the PTI’s plan to organise a protest on August 14 as the continuation of the May 9 mentality. “The government is not worried about the PTI protest call as the public had already rejected the party and showed no support to the PTI’s protest call on Aug 5,” he added.
He lashed out at incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for what he called ‘deviating from parliamentary and democratic norms’. He claimed the PTI was following its ‘undemocratic practices’ by boycotting the upcoming by-elections. He said that the PTI was already facing cracks in its ranks due to internal rifts and divisions.
He added all state institutions were functioning normally, saying the PTI was trying to paint a bleak picture of the government affairs.

Local residents and volunteers of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) told Dawn on Sunday that though displacement of residents from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund, including Tarkhoo, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanato and Zagai, began on Saturday, hours after talks between local militant commanders and Bajaur Amn Jirga for their return to Afghanistan hit a snag on Friday at their final meeting.
However, according to them, the exodus of people from these areas to different localities, mostly within the district saw a significant surge on Sunday, after members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga directed them to shift to safer areas on Saturday night.
 
 

Roads and pathways connecting 16 areas of restive Mamund tehsil remained congested with vehicles transporting residents and their belongings to safer areas throughout the day, said Sanaullah, a senior volunteer of Alkhidmat Foundation.

Significant rise in exodus seen after Bajaur peace jirga

According to reports, people of a number of areas of Mamund tehsil, including Damadola, Matoo, Inam Khooro Chinagi, left their homes on Sunday and moved to safer areas.
Most of the residents complained that  the government had not provided them transport and accommodation. We expected from the provincial government and district administration to provide free transport to us in this difficult time, but the government had failed to do so,“ they added.
Some fleeing residents also complained of being overcharged by transporters with fares reportedly much higher than usual.
’’A driver demanded Rs20,000 for a trip from Inam Khooro Chinagi to Sheikh Kalley in Khar tehsil, Rs16,000 more than the normal fare,“ said Haidar Khan.
There is no official count of the people displaced from their native areas over the past two days, but NGOs said around 2,000 families have been displaced since Saturday.
Taking to Dawn, they said that around 1,000 families have registered with their relief camps while as many families have shifted to other places without registration.
Sources in the district administration and NGOs  said that most of the displaced people had relocated within the district, with some taking shelter in homes, educational institutions and government buildings.
A district administration official told Dawn on Sunday, that 107 educational institutions, mostly in Khar tehsil, have been designated as shelters for displaced people, offering basic facilities.
Meanwhile, the district administration made arran­gements on Sunday to accommodate displaced persons with basic facilities.
According to a statement, the arrangements were finalised during a meeting of senior officials of the district administration with the representatives of NGOs in Khar.
It said the meeting was presided over by Assistant Commissioner Dr Sadiq Ali.
It further said that necessary directions were issued to participants of the meeting.  The participants were told to make proper arrangements for  the displaced families, adjusting them with their relatives, government facilities, private schools and at the sports stadium.
The meeting requested to the heads of NGOs to strengthen coordination to help maximum number of people in different areas.
The meeting also instructed the officials of the district education department, principals of colleges and private school owners to manage the influx of the families on priority basis.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet has already greenlighted plans for a major operation to seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of domestic and international criticism.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the eight nations said the decision “will only aggravate the humanitarian crisis” and further endanger the lives of the remaining prisoners.
They estimated the operation could lead to an “unacceptably high number of fatalities and the forced displacement of nearly one million Palestinian civilians”, according to a copy of the statement released by Spain’s foreign ministry.
They also warned that the planned offensive and occupation of Gaza City would be “a major obstacle to implementing the two-state solution, the only path towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace”.
Besides Spain, the statement was signed by the foreign ministers of Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia.
Foreign powers, including some of Israel’s allies, have been pushing for a negotiated ceasefire to secure the hostages’ return and help alleviate a humanitarian crisis in the strip.
Despite the backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Netanyahu has remained defiant over the decision to seize Gaza City.

In an interview to The Wire, Yashwant Shinde alleged the plot was a calculated bid to inflame communal violence and kill thousands, only for the sake of political power.
“This was a conspiracy by some people in the RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP with extremely vile and perverse mindsets, solely for the sake of power,” Mr Shinde said. “They wanted to set the country on fire so that power would always remain with them.”
“Politically in coma, they exp­loited Ayodhya for 82-84 seats in 1989, their eyes lit up and then Kashmir to repeatedly boost Atal Bihari Vajpayee to prime minister,” he said.

Says Hindu-Muslims riots, attacks in Pakistan, and Kashmir were part of a plan to gain political power

Mr Shinde accused RSS leader Indresh Kumar of spearheading the plan, introducing him around 2000 to a group from Nanded and that group also underwent weapons training from the army, and there were plans to send them to Pakistan to attack civilians.
He claimed this group was training to build time bombs, with inst­ructions to target public gatherings like Muslim weddings and they went and committed these acts.
Mr Shinde recalled a bomb they were preparing accidentally exploded in Nanded in 2006, killing an RSS member. He alleged that those involved in the conspiracy included Rakesh Dhawde and Ravi Dev. Mr Shinde claimed operatives such as Pragya and Purohit were “pawns” who could be sacrificed to protect the real masterminds.
Mr Shinde, who joined the RSS in 1994, claimed he tried to derail the conspiracy from within but could not oppose it openly for fear of being killed.
After the Supreme Court dismis­sed his petition seeking a new investigation, he decided to speak publicly.

“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”
Field Marshal Munir, who visited two US cities over the weekend, flew to Brussels, Belgium, on Sunday after completing his second high-profile trip to the United States in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country.
Attends Centcom ceremony
In Tampa, the army chief attended US Central Command (Centcom) change of command ceremony. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), his engagements included the retirement ceremony of General Michael E. Kurilla, Commander of CENTCOM, and the Change of Command in which Admiral Brad Cooper assumed charge.

His visit to US highlights military cooperation, diaspora outreach

The ISPR said FM Munir praised Gen Kurilla’s “exemplary leadership and invaluable contributions in strengthening Pakistan-US military relations” and expressed confidence that Admiral Cooper “would take this partnership forward to address shared security challenges”.
 
 

On the sidelines, FM Munir met US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine and chiefs of defence from other friendly countries, inviting Gen Caine to visit Pakistan and reaffirming Islamabad’s role as a key regional security stakeholder.
Meets Pakistani-Americans
The army chief’s most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa, attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.
The army chief described overseas Pakistanis as “a source of dignity and pride” and “a brain gain, not a brain drain,” crediting them with unwavering commitment to the homeland and quick mobilisation in national emergencies. He urged them to “remain confident in Pakistan’s bright future” and actively attract investment, highlighting untapped potential in mineral resources, energy, and emerging technologies.
He cautioned that social media, while powerful, was often exploited by anti-state actors to spread “manufactured chaos”. With 64pc of Pakistan’s population under 30, he said, the youth’s talent and energy would shape the country’s future.
Addressing the broader regional context, the COAS accused India of projecting itself as a “Vishwa Guru” while its intelligence agency RAW was involved in transnational terrorism — citing incidents in Canada, Qatar, and the arrest of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.
He condemned India’s “unprovoked aggression” across the Line of Control. Referring to the recent four-day war, he mocked New Delhi’s reluctance to admit battlefield losses. He thanked former US President Trump for his “strategic leadership” in preventing an India-Pakistan war and other global conflicts. He said held Kashmir was “not India’s internal matter but an unfinished international agenda”, vowing support for UN resolutions.
He told the Tampa audience that his second US visit marked “a new chapter” in bilateral ties, aimed at building a constructive, long-term partnership. He highlighted prospects for major investments from the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and China.
His trip came six weeks after his unprecedented lunch with President Trump at the White House — a privilege usually reserved for heads of state or government — which Bloomberg repo­rted may have influenced Indian PM Narendra Modi’s decision to skip a meeting with Trump during that period.

During negotiations of the Pakistani team with the US authorities on reciprocal tariffs, the US side has showed interest to invest in the mines and minerals, including copper, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan revealed in the latest report placed before the National Assembly.
As the US administration had imposed 50pc tariffs on import of copper, iron, steel and aluminum but subsequently refined copper was exempted from the 50pc tariff, “it will be more advantageous to export value-added copper (refined) to the US market”, the minister claimed.
Pakistan was endowed with substantial mineral resources, ranked fifth globally in terms of copper reserves, which had the potential to significantly reduce the country’s trade imbalance with the world, the minister said. He stated copper, a critical component in global technological advancements, especially in renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, was in high demand worldwide. But despite these vast reserves, the country has not fully capitalised on its mineral wealth due to a lack of investment in modern mining infrastructure and processing capabilities.

Geological Survey of Pakistan has been tasked with detailed geological mapping to identify untapped reserves, commerce minister says

At present, Pakistan exports raw copper ores primarily to China, while missing out on lucrative markets like the US, Europe, and the Middle East. “This underutilisation of its copper resources highlights the need for strategic development in the mining sector,” the commerce minister said, adding that Pakistan could enhance production efficiency and product quality by investing in advanced technologies for exploration and extraction, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the international market.
Mr Kamal reported that the government would play a crucial role in facilitating this transformation with the US investment and support. In this regard, the Geological Survey of Pakistan has been tasked with a detailed geological mapping to identify untapped reserves. The government would also be swiftly streamlining regulatory frameworks and addressing infrastructural gaps, such as mine access roads and dedicated power supply to attract private sector involvement and technological innovation.
The commerce minister said market reports suggested that global demand for copper would surge in the coming years, driven by its indispensable role in clean energy technologies. “Pakistan’s strategic development of its copper sector could not only meet domestic economic goals but also contribute to alleviating global shortages,” he said, adding that by focusing on value-added exports, such as refined copper, bars, rods, and alloys, rather than raw ores, Pakistan could capture greater economic benefits from its mineral resources.
 
 

“Through strategic investments and the adoption of modern technologies, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its mineral resources. This would not only boost its export earnings but also position the country as a responsible and reliable supplier in the international minerals market, contributing to both national development and global sustainability efforts,” he said.
In response to the United States’ announcement of reciprocal tariffs on all countries, the government engaged with the relevant US authorities for reaching an understanding and reversing and changing the decision of reciprocal tariffs on Pakistan’s exports to US market, he said.
“After hectic negotiations with US authorities, the US has agreed to a tariff rate of 19pc, instead of earlier 29pc, on Pakistan’s exports to the US, which is lowest amongst Pakistan’s competitors in the US market” which now had the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market.

Officials described the event as the most severe in the area since 2018. “The volume of today’s flood was the highest in the Nullah since 2018,” said Zubair Ahmed Khan, assistant director of the Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (GBDMA) for Hunza and Nagar.
The flood severed the main road link for much of Hunza’s population, with traffic diverted via the Sas Valley Road from Murtazabad, he said.
 
 

The torrent, fuelled by accelerated glacier melt, ripped through agricultural land, uprooted trees and damaged public and private property.
Houses damaged in Hassanabad
In Hassanabad, residents were left counting the cost. “The flood eroded land near multiple homes and put more than 50 houses near Hassanabad Nullah at risk,” Saleem Bercha, a local resident, told Dawn.
“Several homes have developed cracks. Ten houses were dismantled recently to try to save them from the water,” he added.
This latest destruction follows a similar Glof last month that damaged four homes and swathes of farmland.
Authorities said Sunday’s disaster struck after the Shishper Glacier’s water discharge was blocked for around an hour before bursting through, obliterating protective walls and damaging irrigation and drinking-water channels to Aliabad and nearby villages.
 
 

Elsewhere in GB, flash floods triggered by heavy glacier melt surged through Supultar Nullah in Nagar Khas, blocking the Hoper Valley road and cutting off a popular tourist destination.
The flood damaged irrigation systems, destroyed a bridge and severed the Hisper Valley road in Tokorkot village, where several homes are now under threat.
In Hunza’s Shimshal Valley, rising river levels damaged the only access road and the protective walls safeguarding it.
Across the region, restoration work on irrigation and water supply systems wrecked by recent cloudbursts, flash floods and Glofs remains stalled. Communities are facing acute shortages of drinking and irrigation water.
In Danyor, residents said the destruction of main water channels had left thousands without water.
“Crops and trees have dried up,” a resident said.
Volunteers are now working to repair the damage, as communities here depend almost entirely on glacier-fed water for survival.
Experts warn that unprecedented high temperatures and repeated heatwaves this year have accelerated glacier melt, making Glofs and extreme flooding more frequent.

This financing aims to ensure projects are well-prepared for ADB funding and implementation, potentially speeding up the process and disbursement of funds, according to the ADB.
The $8.32 million funding approved last week will contribute to the improvement of the irrigation infrastructure that that will enhance water availability and increase productivity of the agriculture sector in Punjab, and subsequently alleviating rural poverty, and improving food security and economic growth.
Agriculture production in Punjab has benefited from the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) that provides irrigation water to 15 million hectares of land, of which about 60 per cent lies in Punjab. The IBIS is the lifeline of the Punjab agriculture sector. However, deteriorated century-old structures and inefficient water management within irrigation schemes and on-farm resulted to the unreliable surface irrigation water delivery in the IBIS.

Move to accelerate disbursement of funds for priority projects

A document released by ADB privy to the project says some cultivable lands in Punjab remain outside of the IBIS and rely on unpredictable scarce rainfall or ground water that may lower the water table. Although the Punjab government has placed a high priority on improving irrigation infrastructure and its efficiency, additional efforts are required for improved agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency to achieve economic growth and food security in the province.
In 2019, the provincial government identified five priority projects to develop, rehabilitate and upgrade irrigation infrastructure that will enhance water availability and increase agricultural productivity. The national consulting firms had prepared feasibility studies for these priority projects, but the project designs fell short due to the lack of an integrated approach, lack of an analysis of alternative strategies for optimal use of water, lack of a comprehensive analysis of Punjab’s share of water, lack of project-specific climate change considerations and adaptation measures, and incomplete due diligence and economic evaluation.
The proposed projects were: rehabilitation and upgrade of Upper Jhelum Canal System; Dera Ghazi Khan Canal Irrigated Agriculture Improvement; remodeling of Rasul-Qadirabad, Qadirabad-Balloki, and Balloki-Sulemanki canals; second phase of Greater Thal Canal project; and harnessing of Hill Torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
Of the five priority projects, two are for the construction of new irrigation infrastructure and the development of existing irrigation infrastructure; and upgrade of water conveyance canals in the IBIS by remodeling of Rasul-Qadirabad, Qadirabad-Balloki, and Balloki-Sulemanki canals.

The clash occurred when troops advancing from Shawal Marrah area of North Waziristan into the Sirnarai area of Upper South Waziristan were ambushed by militants.  
During the clash, Sepoy Naveed embraced martyrdom and five other soldiers identified as Naik Amjad, Sepoy Abu Bakar, Sepoy Siyam, Sepoy Nasir and Sepoy Shaukat sustained wounds, sources confirmed. In the exchange of fire, security forces killed two terrorists and left three others wounded. 
The military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, has not yet issued a statement on the incident. 
The slain soldier and the wounded personnel were moved to a military facility in Razmak for treatment. 
Officials said clearance operations are continuing in the area as authorities gather intelligence to identify the assailants and investigate their potential links to a recent surge in militant activity. 
Security in the tribal districts of North Waziristan, Upper South Waziristan, and Lower South Waziristan has deteriorated sharply over the past year.  
Residents have expressed deep concern over a rising wave of violence, with reports of increased bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, and attacks on security posts. 
In the Birmal area of Lower South Waziristan, the security situation is particularly alarming and has severely disrupted daily life.  
According to local sources, armed groups have disabled Wi-Fi systems, creating significant communication and coordination challenges for civilians and law enforcement agencies.

On August 6, a message was posted on PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan’s X account, calling for the PTI to “take to the streets in full force against the ongoing fascism in our beloved homeland”. That message came in the wake of the PTI’s failed protests on August 5.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal’, Sanaullah said that he had no issue with the protest going ahead but raised concerns about the timing.
“Protesting is their right, but to do it on August 14 would be upsetting and against our traditions,” he stated.
“On August 14, the nation will celebrate [Independence Day] with zeal, but the opposition has planned something on that day. They should not have their movement or protest on August 14; do it on the 15th, 16th, or 13th.”
The PM’s adviser lauded the opposition parties for “standing united” and “having coordination”, but raised an issue with them launching protests on national holidays.
“August 5 was the Day of Exploitation,” Sanaullah said, referring to the day observed by Pakistan to mark the Indian government’s move to strip occupied Kashmir of its autonomy.
“The nation was standing with their Kashmiri brethren and paying tribute to Kashmiri martyrs that day. They (the PTI) announced a big movement, and nothing ended up happening,” he said.
 


On August 5, police detained PTI protesters across the country after party activists took to the streets to officially kick off a nationwide movement for the release of Imran, who has been in jail for two years now.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told Dawn.com: “More than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.” He denied reports of the police arresting hundreds of activists.
Meanwhile, PTI Balochistan President Dawood Shah Kakar claimed “several” PTI workers, including five leaders, were arrested after they gathered at a place in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest.
The Rawalpindi administration banned all assemblies and gatherings until August 10 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, citing an “imminent threat”.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai, MNA Shandana Gulzar and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned but they were stopped by the Punjab police, with the TTAP sharing a video of Achakzai’s exchange with the personnel.
 






PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser announced that the second phase of the PTI’s efforts would take place on August 14, after which the party planned to head to Sindh. “We will unite the entire country to rid ourselves of this oppressive government,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-10 17:37</small></div><hr>
