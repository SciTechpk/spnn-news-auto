On Friday, the Foreign Office (FO) had summoned Acting British High Commissioner Matt Cannell to receive a demarche over the “provocative” statements and “incitement to violence” against the military leadership.
Informed sources said the British government had formally been asked to identify, arrest, investigate and prosecute those who used UK soil to “issue direct threats” against Pakistan’s military leadership.
Sources said that a video posted on PTI UK’s official X account on Dec 23 showed demonstrators — outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford — openly threatening the military leadership while surrounded by people holding PTI flags. The post has since been deleted.
In a post on X early on Saturday, PTI UK said it had removed the post featuring a citizen’s “metaphorical remarks” against the military leadership.
“Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding, and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights,” it said.
It alleged that Pakistanis at home and abroad were facing “unprecedented repression”, calling on the government to prioritise investigations into these cases.
“Public frustration is high due to Imran Khan and Bushra Khan’s prolonged isolation in inhumane and undignified prison conditions, as endorsed by the UN special rapporteur on torture,” it said.
“Concerns about their health and well-being are real and the cause of anxiety and anguish for his family, party members and millions of supporters all around the world,” it added.
“While this global concern is understandable and completely valid, PTI does not endorse unlawful behavior of any kind. Independent citizens are also advised to measure their remarks to avoid any misunderstandings,” it added.
“PTI remains firmly committed to non-violence and the rule of law, in accordance with the guidance of Imran Khan,” it said.
“It is also pertinent to state that we hope that this citizen in question will not be subjected to any act falling under transnational repression and the British government will ensure her safety, well-being and her right to due process,” it added.
Pakistan demarches UK
On Friday, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andarabi confirmed that a demarche had been issued to the acting British high commissioner, demanding action against all those involved.
“The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. He urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”.
Subsequently, the UK advised Pakistan to share evidence with its police.
“Where a foreign government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation,” the spokesperson for the British High Commissioner said.
Earlier in the day, two ministers of state from the PML-N said the Pakistani government had written to UK authorities seeking action against what they described as “provocative” statements, particularly in reference to the video circulating online.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani had spoken to Geo News, with the latter specifically mentioning that the “head of the armed forces had been threatened” in the video.
Kayani had also named the opposition PTI for its “involvement” in the matter, unlike Chaudhry. He had termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”.
“We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” he added.
Separately, former PTI leader Imran Ismail, who is part of the National Dialogue Committee, had called on the party to issue an “unequivocal condemnation of the highly irresponsible and inflammatory remarks”.
“Such statements, which appear to incite violence and terrorism, are utterly unacceptable, deeply damaging to Pakistan’s national interests, and risk escalating an already tense political environment both at home and abroad. They also expose Pakistani diaspora communities to unnecessary scrutiny and jeopardize bilateral relations with host countries like the UK,” he said in a post on X on Friday.
“A prompt, clear, and unified condemnation from the party’s central leadership would not only uphold responsible political discourse but also demonstrate PTI’s commitment to non-violence and constructive opposition. Silence or ambiguity on this issue would be misinterpreted and counterproductive,” he said.
The development comes weeks after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions.
On Dec 4, the interior minister, in a meeting with the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, submitted extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja, who Naqvi said were involved in spreading “anti-Pakistan propaganda” online.</p><small>2025-12-27 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27112554468497b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963529/imf-sees-public-sector-development-programme-shrinking-as-defence-outlay-to-rise' target='_blank'><strong>IMF sees Public Sector Deve­lopment Programme shrinking as defence outlay to rise</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Amid impr­oving fiscal space, the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected a declining Public Sector Deve­lopment Programme (PSDP), rising defence spending and generally stabilising interest payments from the current year onwards through the fiscal year 2030.
IMF projections show that interest payments for the last fiscal year (FY25) were originally estimated at 7.7 per cent of GDP but ended at 7.8pc. For the current year, the Fund has revised its estimate to 6.5pc of GDP from 6.7pc in view of lower policy rates.
For the next fiscal year (FY27), markup payments are estimated to drop further to 5.9pc of GDP, to be followed by 5.2pc of GDP in FY28, 5.1pc in FY29 and finally settling at 4.8pc in FY30 amid falling policy rates and resultant lower debt payments.

 

In absolute numbers, interest payments are estimated to slightly decline to Rs8.225 trillion during the current year, down from Rs8.88tr at the close of FY25. This would remain almost static around Rs8.2tr in FY27 and FY28 and then increase to Rs8.8tr and Rs9.3tr in FY29 and FY30.

Lender projects interest payments to ease through FY30 as policy rates fall

The national economy, measured by nominal GDP, has been estimated at Rs126tr for the current year, Rs140.7tr next year, Rs156.5tr in FY27, Rs174tr in FY29 and then Rs194tr in FY30.
But despite these improving debt servicing-to-GDP indicators, PSDP would continue to struggle both in absolute numbers and as a share of GDP.
Based on detailed interactions with the government as part of the second review of its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility, the IMF said the PSDP expenditure, originally estimated at 0.9pc of GDP in FY25, had been contained to 0.7pc to make up for the revenue shortfalls. The PSDP has been estimated to stay uncha­nged at 0.7pc for the current year.
Alarmingly, the PSDP has been projected to fall further to 0.6pc of GDP next year and then stay unchanged through FY30.

 

Even in absolute terms, the IMF has worked out PSDP spending for the current year at Rs873bn for the current year against its original estimate of Rs1.065tr. It would remain around the same level, ie Rs885bn, in FY27 and slightly improve to Rs984bn in FY28, Rs1.1tr in FY29 and Rs1.2tr in FY30.
Conversely, the size of defence expenditure would make a comeback both in absolute terms and as a share of the national economy.
The IMF said the defence budget had declined from 2.4pc of GDP in FY21 to 1.8pc in FY24 and then slightly recovered to 1.9pc last year. For the current fiscal year, the defence expenditure has been projected to increase further to 2pc of GDP this year and then maintain this share all along until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the defence budget has been on an upward journey — rising from Rs1.3tr in FY21 to Rs2.2tr in FY25, showing a cumulative increase of 67pc in four years.
This will keep growing to Rs2.57tr during the current year, followed by Rs2.87tr next year and Rs3.2tr in FY28. The defence expenditure would further go up to Rs3.56tr in FY29 and then Rs3.96tr in FY30, showing a cumulative increase of more than 80pc against FY25 spending.
The government has been restructuring the PSDP portfolio on the IMF prodding to improve project selection, but even the Fund has been unable to restrict allocations for parliamentarians’ constituency schemes under the so-called Sustainable Develop­ment Goals (SDGs) Achie­vement Programme (SAP) that has claimed Rs70bn for the current year.
The government has given a commitment to the IMF to continue to improve project selection criteria and streamline the project pipeline to “better focus PSDP on long-term capital spending”.
“With careful reprioritisation, we have streamlined the PSDP pipeline by Rs2.5tr (around 25pc of the total). We will cap new project allocations to 10pc of the total in the FY27 budget,” the finance minister said in a written undertaking.
He also pledged further improvements to a scorecard-based system for project selection, including reducing overlapping criteria, introducing negative marking for projects with negative externalities and increasing the weight for climate-related criteria.
The IMF also noted that the government would reduce or postpone spending in response to lower revenues linked to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy. “As in the past, contingent and development spending are most likely to be affected,” it said.
This, it added, explained low development spending in the first five months of the current fiscal year (July-November), with utilisation at 9.2pc of the Rs1tr annual allocation amid fiscal rationing to meet IMF contingency measures against growing revenue shortfalls.
Development spending of Rs92bn in the current year was 20pc lower than last year’s Rs115bn for the same five-month period.
“PSDP utilisation in the current year remained low due to a significant reduction in expenditure by provinces, special areas and the Ministry of Railways,” the Planning Ministry said last week. “Development spending remained modest, with Rs92bn utilised against Rs196bn sanctioned, led mainly by infrastructure,” it added.

In a statement released late on Friday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan was closely following recent developments in Yemen.
“Pakistan expresses its full support for the diplomatic efforts being undertaken by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for ensuring peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen. We also commend the efforts of the United Arab Emirates in this regard,” it said.
“We underscore the need for upholding the unity and territorial integrity of Yemen, and express the hope that the Yemeni stakeholders will avoid any unilateral steps that may result in further escalation of the situation,” it said.
“We also call on all Yemeni parties to engage constructively and in good faith towards an inclusive, negotiated political solution based on the agreed parameters,” the FO said.
“Pakistan expresses its hope that the ongoing diplomatic efforts will result in concrete steps towards achieving lasting peace in the country, and in bringing an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people,” it added.







Yemen’s main southern separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south earlier this month.
On Friday, the UAE’s foreign ministry said it welcomed Saudi Arabian efforts to support security and stability in Yemen and remained committed to backing stability in the country.
Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that Yemeni separatists should return the territory seized recently, adding that it sought to de-escalate tensions within the government camp.

“﻿﻿﻿Both sides agree to maintain current troop deployments without further movement,” their defence ministers said in a joint statement on the ceasefire.

 

“Any reinforcement would heighten tensions and negatively affect long-term efforts to resolve the situation,” according to the statement released on social media by Cambodia’s Defence Ministry.
The agreement, signed by Thai Defence Minister Natthaphon Nakrphanit and his Cambodian counterpart Tea Seiha, ended 20 days of fighting that has killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides.
The clashes were re-ignited in early December after a breakdown in a ceasefire that US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of fighting in July.

 

For more than a century, Thailand and Cambodia have contested sovereignty at various undemarcated points along their 817 kilometre land border — a dispute that has occasionally exploded into skirmishes and fighting.
The latest ceasefire will be monitored by an observer team from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional bloc as well as direct coordination between both countries, Natthaphon said.
“At the same time, at the policy level, there will be direct communication between the minister of defence and chief of the armed forces of both sides,” he told reporters.
Trump intervention
Simmering tensions between the two countries came to a head in July this year, when the neighbours clashed for five days along some parts of the frontier, leaving at least 48 people dead and 300,000 displaced before Trump intervened to bring about a truce.
That ceasefire broke down in early December with the two sides accusing each other of moves that led to clashes.

 

Since the conflict restarted, neither Anwar — currently ASEAN chair — nor Trump was successful in stitching together another ceasefire, as fighting spread from forested regions near Laos to the coastal provinces on the Gulf of Thailand.
The renewed parleys came after a special meeting on Monday of Southeast Asian foreign ministers in Kuala Lumpur, followed by three days of talks between the warring sides at a border checkpoint, where the two defence ministers met on Saturday.
In their joint statement, the ministers agreed on the return of people displaced from affected border areas, while also underlining that neither side would use any force against civilians.
Thailand will also return 18 Cambodian soldiers in its custody since the July clashes if the ceasefire is fully maintained for 72 hours, according to the agreement.
Saturday’s pact, however, made clear that it will not impact any border demarcation activities underway between both countries, leaving the task of resolving disputed areas along the frontier to existing bilateral mechanisms.
“War and clashes don’t make the two countries or the two people happy,” Thailand’s Air Chief Marshal Prapas Sornjaidee told reporters.
“I want to stress that the Thai people and the Cambodian people are not in conflict with each other.”</p><small>2025-12-27 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27082446be1d0e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963462/conviction-under-child-marriage-law-doesnt-invalidate-nikkah-karachi-court-rules' target='_blank'><strong>Conviction under child marriage law doesn’t invalidate nikkah, Karachi court rules</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A sessions court has ruled that any conviction under the provision of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 does not render the marriage void or invalidate the nikkah.
“It is making clear that any conviction under the provision of Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 does not render the marriage void or invalidate the Nikkah from a personal law perspective. The Act is a restraint and penal statue and it does not contain provisions for annulment,” observed Additional District and Sessions Judge Zahoor Ahmed Chandio while sentencing a man to two years in prison for marrying an underage girl.
“The validity of the marriage contract (Nikkah) is a separate issue to be determined by the appropriate forum under the relevant personal law or the family courts and this court’s jurisdiction is limited to determining criminal liability under the penal sections cited,” observed the judge, who is also the presiding officer of Gender-Based Violence Court (South).

 

The court found Zulqarnain, alias Cheeko, guilty of the offence punishable under Section 3 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 and sentenced him to two years in prison.

Judge sentences man to two years in prison for marrying underage girl; observes that validity of marriage is a separate issue

He also imposed a fine of Rs25,000, on default the convict would serve additional imprisonment.
Regarding the co-accused, Qazi, and witnesses of the marriage, the court ruled that the file remained dormant against the absconding accused until their arrest or appearance.
According to state prosecutor Irfana Qadri, the accused was charged on three counts for offences under Sections 365-B (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage etc), 376 (3) (rape with minor) and Section 3 of the Sindh Marriage Act, 2013.
The prosecutor claimed that the accused had abducted the underage girl on April 26, 2023, and solemnised forcibly marriage (nikkah) and then committed rape with her.
However, the court exonerated the accused from two counts including abducting and raping the girl as the prosecution failed to prove charges against him.
Refereeing to the cross-examination of the complainant — mother of the girl — the court noted that she had admitted that when she met her daughter at the police station she (the girl) told her that no one had kidnapped her.
The girl also negated the prosecution version during her cross examination that “nobody abducted her and that her Nikkah with the accused was performed with her own will and consent, without any pressure”.
The court also mentioned that the prosecution also failed to prove that the accused had committed rape with the girl as it noted that “the victim (the girl) throughout the proceedings does not inspire confidence in the prosecution story. She voluntarily went to meet the accused, remained with him, executed a Nikkah [and] produced a freewill affidavit and did not raise any allegation of force or coercion before both the investigating officers. Even before the magistrate, it was established that she moved the application for recording her statement through her own counsel. Such conduct is wholly inconsistent with the version of forcible abduction and rape. The medical evidence also does not support the allegation of rape.”
Regarding the age of the girl, the court observed that she submitted that she was 18 years old while she had been married, however, as per medical evidence, the girl was between 14 to 15 years old and more towards 15 years.
“This is a professional scientific evidence strongly indicates that at the time of the test in May 2023, the victim was a child under 18,” the court noted, adding that the victim’s assertion in cross examination that she was 18 or 19 years old at the time of Nikkah which contradict to the medical evidence.

The Sikhs were finding it hard to follow the traffic regulation of wearing helmets and a Sikh man had approached Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz with a request for exemption.
The CM made the announcement the other day while addressing the minority community. A clip of her speech was shared on the PML-N’s X account.







“The Sikh community’s turban is their identity and their religious belief. With this respect in mind, the traffic department has, for the first time, been instructed to grant Sikh citizens an exemption from wearing helmets,” said the CM in her speech to the minority communities.
She said Punjab had made minorities a crown of its head.

Sir Robert Peel, widely regarded as the father of modern policing, articulated principles that continue to guide democratic police forces. His assertion that “the police are the public, and the public are the police” underlined the idea that police legitimacy flows from public consent rather than coercion. Accountability, restraint, proportionality, and strict adherence to the rule of law were the essential safeguards against the misuse of police power. The evolution of policing thus mirrored the development of the state itself, from coercive authority to regulated power, from force to legitimacy, and from unquestioned command to accountability.
While this modern policing model was taking shape in England, the British introduced policing institutions in their newly conquered Indian colony, beginning with Calcutta and Bombay. The uprising of 1857, however, fundamentally altered British priorities. A centralised, Irish-style constabulary was established with the primary objective of control and maintaining order, largely indifferent to public rights. Despite this, the organisational structure itself was built on principles of command and control.

 

Independent Pakistan inherited the colonial police architecture, an efficient law-enforcement machinery designed to control the population rather than to serve it. Tragically, successive political and later military rulers largely assumed the role of colonial masters and failed to undertake meaningful police reform. Despite repeated proclamations of intent, numerous committees and commissions, numbering nearly 30, produced reports that were ultimately unceremoniously consigned to archives.
It was only in 2002 that a military ruler, during an initial phase of reformist enthusiasm, enacted a law intended to transform the police from an instrument of enforcement into a service-oriented institution. During the drafting of this law, it was recognised that police strength had expanded in an ad hoc manner to cope with rapid population growth and unplanned urbanisation. The result was an unwieldy colonial police force with vast powers that was becoming increasingly difficult to manage and hold accountable.

Multiple police forces need to be established within each province under the existing legal framework.

The framers of the law correctly recognised the need for creating additional police forces to ensure effective law enforcement. Political considerations, however, prevented this structural reform. Instead, the proposed law attempted to compensate by introducing concepts of enhanced operational autonomy to the regional commanders and heads of police in the provincial capital cities and large urban police forces.

 

Regrettably, under sustained pressure from political elites, the same military ruler was compelled to dilute this progressive legislation. Core principles of depoliticisation, accountability, and civilian oversight were systematically weakened, restoring, and in some cases deepening, political interference in policing.
To address the growing demands of policing an expanding population and chaotic urbanisation, governments resorted to expedient but flawed solutions. Numerous so-called ‘specialised’ units were created outside the formal police structure, complete with standalone police stations and ambiguous lines of accountability. These units were showcased as panaceas for law-and-order problems, but in reality, they generated overlapping mandates. The result was the weakening of a disciplined, uniformed force trained to operate within defined jurisdictions and legal limits, thereby undermining the entire criminal justice system.
Specialised units should remain the exception rather than the norm. Their creation must be based strictly on professional needs assessments, embedded within the existing command and control structure. Such units must operate under rigorous oversight and explicit safeguards for fundamental rights.
Experience shows that ‘specialised units,’ when allowed to function outside established frameworks, often pursue narrowly defined objectives at the expense of the rule of law. Their prolonged existence fosters impunity, encourages lawlessness and violence, and risks dehumanising their members and turning them into ‘rogue cops.’
For meaningful, sustainable structural police reform, there is a compelling case for smaller and more manageable police jurisdictions. Today, Punjab has a police force of approximately 224,000 personnel, Sindh 160,000, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 125,000, and Balochistan 48,000. It is against all principles of efficient management for armed police forces of this size to be placed under single provincial commanders.
Attempts within the existing hierarchy to create empowered urban and regional commands failed because the Police Order 2002 was never implemented in its true spirit and was subsequently rendered ineffective through amendments negating accountability, oversight, autonomy and service. In these circumstances, there is no viable alternative but to establish multiple police forces within each province under the existing legal framework, with no single force exceeding 50,000 personnel.
The Central Police Office should be reconstituted as a Provincial Police Directorate, headed by a director general drawn from the senior police leadership. The directorate would be responsible for province-wide coordination, training, standardisation of equipment and transport, and the formulation of uniform operational procedures, supported by a robust system of monitoring and evaluation. Commanders of the newly constituted police forces must be granted guaranteed tenures, enabling them to exercise lawful authority, resist illegal external interference, and provide professional, field-oriented leadership.
This framework would enhance efficiency, transparency, and operational effectiveness, while progressively reducing reliance on paramilitary forces for routine policing and emergency response. At the same time, these police forces would remain subject to strong civilian oversight and continuous professional supervision through the Provincial Police Directorate.
This reorganisation is achievable within the existing provincial governance framework, without engaging in the politically sensitive issue of creating new provinces. It must, however, be acknowledged as an interim arrangement. Durable and optimal governance can ultimately be achieved only through smaller, empowered, and autonomous provinces. The sooner this reality is confronted, the better for democratic governance and effective policing.

As an eco­nomist, though, I was not surprised because the failure of our ‘economic model’ (whatever that is) has been known for long. Importantly, though, how did we end up with a ‘failed’ model? And, what does a ‘successful’ economic model look like?
I’ll address the second query first, partly owing to the recent award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to three economists (Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt) and also because it will give us a fair idea of the first query.

 

The recorded history of mankind’s economic activities shows that real income growth followed a pretty flat trajectory, but saw a remarkable uptick in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution picked up pace (the ‘hockey stick’ phenomenon). What factors underlay this stupendous transformation? The work of the three winners addresses this very question.
The two most famous long-term growth theories are that of Robert Solow and Paul Romer (both Nobel Prize winners). Solow identified population growth, savings, and technological change as the factors that drive economic growth. Of this, technology is the most important component since by itself, population and savings alone can drive growth to a certain level, but beyond that, as depreciation catches up, the economy reaches a ‘steady state’ beyond which returns of these two factors keep falling. It was persistent technological change that would keep the economy above its steady state level. However, for Solow, technological change was ‘exogenous’ (the ‘black box’) — determined outside the system.

The staggering number of talented individuals leaving Pakistan would trouble any serious policymaker.

Romer came up with his theory in his paper ‘Endogenous Technological Change’ (1990). He agreed with Solow’s contention that technological change is the most critical input in long-term growth. Where he differed was that it was determined within the system by the ‘intentional’ actions of innovators who had incentives to innovate in order to earn more than average earnings. One of his contentions, which he called the ‘most fundamental premise of his theory’, was that the process of technological innovation has a fixed cost, meaning that an innovator can build upon that knowledge with zero marginal expense. At the heart of his theory were two variables — high-quality human capital, and the endless possibility of profits with the expansion of the size of the market, which would mainly come courtesy of international trade.

 

Aghion and Howitt wrote their seminal paper ‘A Model of Economic Growth through Creative Destruction’ around the same time (1992) as Romer. They based their work on the idea of ‘creative destruction’, a term coined by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950) who hypothesised that the workings of capitalism are underpinned by “gales of creative destruction”; the most creative would survive but the less creative would not be so lucky.
If creativity also carries a destructive tendency, how did industrialised countries end up with steadily increasing real income growth? They answer this by pointing out that there are thousands of sectors functioning in an economy; creative destruction in one is usually balanced out by creative growth in another. There are countless examples: BlackBerry replaced by iPhones and Netscape replaced by Google. Or take stock of the fact that Google or Amazon were merely blips on the vast canvas of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of the 21st century (few had heard of Elon Musk). Now, these three are some of the largest companies on the planet.
Many companies and businesses vanished, but new were born, thus balancing out the destructive tendencies. This process critically depends upon innovators who take risks, and also an enabling environment.
Mokyr’s work is the most phenomenal in terms of the broad sweep of technological history. One of the most interesting queries he propounds, amongst countless others, is why England (and Europe in general) took the lead during the Industrial Revolution. His answer, for the most part, rests on the importance of traits like curiosity, knowledge diffusion and exchange, a tolerant environment and persistent push by curious innovators. The price incentive, so important in Romer, Howitt and Aghion’s work, is relatively subdued in his hypothesis. Gautier, the inventor of the hot air balloon in the 1870s, did so out of curiosity. Bacon and Newton helped foster a culture of ideas and exchange, carried out by various scientific ‘societies’ founded in England, without any price or profit incentive. It was a cultural revolution (the ‘Enlightenment’) from whose bosom sprang the Industrial Revolution.
In his writings, we again find the critical role of high-quality human capital (‘upper tail human capital’) as in Romer’s, Howitt’s and Aghion’s theories and why it is so important for long-term economic growth.
Although what I stated above does not do justification to the vast expanse of research of these three, it does give us a fair idea of the factors that constitute a ‘successful’ economic model. Now contemplate which of these factors are historically at play in Pakistan? None. For example, what of Pakistan’s ‘upper tail’ human capital? The staggering number of highly skilled individuals leaving this country for decades would deeply trouble any serious policymaker, except for those who revel in the prospect of more remittances.
And what of the tremendous opportunities afforded by the global economy, where the trade in goods and services stands at a staggering $23 trillion? What’s our share? Not even $100 billion. Can there be any bigger reflection of our calamitous failure?
But why take risks, for example, when it’s easy to make gazillions from export permits for commodities like sugar, create a shortage and then import the same at triple the price? Why incentivise upper tail human capital to contribute at home when pushing them out of the country would mean more remittances?
Suffice to say, economic growth does not rest upon accounting and PR gimmickry. Above all, any serious attempt at ‘successful’ long-term economic growth in Pakistan should begin with those in the state machinery sticking to their job requirements.

This Wednesday, the TTAP seems to have decided to take the PM up on his offer, while also reiterating its demand for a new charter of democracy aimed at addressing recurrent issues in politics and governance. Amidst the doom and gloom that has clouded the national mood in recent memory, this has been a rather unexpected development. It is, perhaps, the only silver lining in Pakistani politics at the moment. Yet, since matters are still in very early stages, much care is needed so as not to spoil the opportunity for a long-needed political rapprochement.

 

With the country’s civilian leadership finally prepared to make another attempt at breaking the political deadlock, the various stakeholders in the process must be measured in what they say. Diplomacy requires tact and the good sense to know what to say, and when. A careless remark or needless show of hostility here or there can set efforts back considerably, if not derail them altogether.
Therefore, the positions taken by the principal negotiators must always be articulated clearly and respected by the parties they claim to represent. In this context, it was quite unhelpful of PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram to declare during a TV interview, conducted shortly after the TTAP had announced its intentions, that his party would steer clear of any negotiations with the government on former PM Imran Khan’s orders. The statement muddied the waters.
To recall, Mr Khan’s trust in and respect for TTAP leaders Mehmood Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas had been declared on the former’s X account just weeks ago. The two are, respectively, also the PTI’s nominees for the vacant slots of opposition leader in the National Assembly and Senate. If the PTI has decided to trust the gentlemen, then why publicly express opposition to dialogue when they have already made a decision on this matter?
Mr Akram seems to have promptly realised that he was complicating matters, because he also conceded in the same breath that Mr Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir did have the authority to decide whether or not talks should be held. The two leaders are old hands who likely have a better understanding of how political disputes are negotiated. They must be allowed to make an attempt at reconciliation without being second-guessed publicly.
Immature statements will only complicate their task and perpetuate a conflict that serves no one. Any doubts or conflicts of opinion within each camp must be raised and addressed internally, rather than being announced to the public. This much is common sense.

He said the long-delayed LG elections would be held on a party basis.
The five-year tenure of the GB Assembly was completed on Nov 24, and caretaker Chief Minister Yar Muhammad was sworn in on Nov 26.
Addressing a press conference in Gilgit, CEC Raja Shahbaz Khan said the polling day for the GB Assembly elections had earlier been announced for Jan 24 next year and that of LG polls for Feb 14.
“However, on the demand of political parties, and in view of the harsh weather conditions in the region, the polling days for both the GB Assembly and LG elections have been delayed, and a new election schedule will be issued accordingly,” he added.
CEC Khan said the revised schedule for both elections would be issued in April or May 2026, both elections would be conducted simultaneously during this period. He said that according to rules, once the election schedule is formally issued, no federal minister and the prime minister would be allowed to visit the region without prior permission from the GB Election Commission.

Says long-delayed local bodies’ elections will be held on party basis

The CEC said that local bodies’ elections in GB had not been held for the past 21 years, depriving the people of their democratic right. He stressed that LG elections would be conducted at all costs to ensure the people’s right to elect their representatives, hoping that the elected bodies would address local and civic issues in the region.
“Under the GB Order 2018 and election laws, the authority to conduct assembly and local government elections rests with the GB Election Commission,” he said, reiterating that both elections would be held on a party basis.
CEC Khan said that according to the latest census, GB has a total population of 1,709,049.
He said the region has 163 union councils, 10 district councils, five town committees, eight municipal committees and three municipal corporations.
The total number of local government representatives in GB stands at 1,719, including 1,303 general members and 416 women members.
He said the Local Government Act was enforced in the region on July 18, 2023. Reiterating the commission’s commitment, he said the elections would be conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner, and appealed to the people to exercise their right to vote to elect their representatives.

Archaeologists carry out excavation at Bhir Mound remains on Friday.—Dawn

• Evidence pushes civilisation timeline beyond 6th century BC• Uncovered ruins reveal advanced streets and drainage systems• Pottery, seals, other items indicate thriving commerce before arrival of Greeks
TAXILA: An excavation team working at the ancient remains of Bhir Mound, recognised as the first city of the Taxila Civilisation, has made a major archaeological breakthrough, uncovering compelling evidence of a well-organised urban settlement that predates the sixth century BC.
This significant discovery holds the potential to rewrite the early history of civilisation in the region, suggesting that Taxila was a thriving city centuries earlier than scholars previously belie­ved, existing even before the emergence of Achaemenid or Greek influence.
Mr Dogar described the current discovery as one of the most important in recent decades. He said the evidence confirms Taxila’s role was not merely that of a centre of learning or military activity, but as a fully developed urban civilisation that flourished in the region’s earliest historical phases.
Officials from the Punjab Department of Archaeology, who are currently conducting the extensive excavation at the ancient site, told Dawn on Friday that the newly unearthed remains point definitively to continuous human habitation.
The findings reveal a sophisticated civic structure, placing Taxila among the earliest known urban centres of South Asia.
Archaeologists at the site have uncovered specific remnants such as stone and mud-brick walls, carefully planned stre­­et and an advanced drainage system. These structural findings clearly indicates an organised and forward-looking society.
Aasim Dogar, the deputy director of the Punjab Department of Archaeology, said that the current evidence points towards a much older timeline than traditional historical accounts suggest.
“Evidence of second century, fourth century and sixth century culture de­­p­o­sits are found, and the further deep tre­n­­ch may lead to discovery beyond the sixth century,” Mr Dogar said.
He explained that pushing deeper into the stratigraphy may rewrite the history of the first city of Taxila beyond the sixth century BC, creating a historical profile “resembling it to Harappa and Gandhara grave culture”.
Beyond the structural discoveries, a significant number of physical artifacts have been recovered from the site.
Mr Dogar revealed that the team has found finely crafted pottery bearing int­ricate designs, ancient coins, and seals dating back to the second century B.C. These items reflect established trade networks and include stone and metal tools used in construction and daily life.
These findings collectively demonstrate that the settlement supported a complex social and economic system long before the period traditionally associated with Taxila’s rise.
Mr Dogar noted that the site flourished during the periods of Achae­m­e­nid, Greek, and Mauryan influence and was occupied at the time of Alexander the Great’s arrival in 326 BC.
The deputy director provided a detai­led history of the exploration at Bhir Mou­­nd to contextualise the current success.
He noted that the first extensive archaeological investigations were conducted by Sir John Marshall between 1918 and 1934, work that formed the basis for the original chronological and cultural interpretation of the site. A later excavation was led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1944-1945.
According to Mr Dogar, Wheeler focused on stratigraphic clarification and introduced modern excavation techniques to the region. These methods heavily influenced subsequent archaeological work in Pakistan.
After a hiatus of nearly two decades, renewed archaeological work is now being carried out by the Punjab Department of Archaeology..
Mr Dogar believes the breakthrough will draw international scholarly attention and significantly enhance Taxila’s standing on the global archaeological map.
Mr Dogar said that for the first time in excavations in Taxila, the latest Japanese and Chinese software and hardware technology are being utilised. This includes advanced GPS technology and scanners, alongside the geo-mapping of the city through the use of drone technology.
“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Mr Dogar said. “There are likely many more layers of history buried beneath Bhir Mound waiting to be uncovered.”

THIS screengrab shows the moment an Israeli reservist runs over a Palestinian man praying on the side of the road with an ATV.

JERUSALEM: An Israeli reservist soldier rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man as he prayed on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, after earlier firing shots in the area, the Israeli military said.
“Footage was received of an armed individual running over a Palestinian individual,” it said in a statement, adding the individual was a reservist and his military service had been terminated.
The reservist acted “in severe violation of his authority” and his weapon had been confiscated, the military said. Israeli media reported that he was being held under house arrest. The Israeli police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Palestinian man went to hospital for checks after the attack, but was unhurt and is now at home.
Video which aired on Palestinian TV and was verified by Reuters shows a man in civilian clothing with a gun slung over his shoulder driving an off-road vehicle into a man praying on the side of the road.
This year was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries.
More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the UN In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.
On Friday, a Palestinian assailant killed two people in northern Israel, police said.

DESPITE Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s renewed offer of national dialogue, apparently directed at the main opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), no concrete steps have so far been taken by the government to initiate a formal talks process.
On the other hand, PTI leaders say they are waiting for the government to make the first move and establish contact to begin negotiations.
Meanwhile, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — a coalition of opposition parties of which PTI is an essential component — has welcomed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent invitation for talks.
Against this backdrop, PTI’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan appears to lack visible international support, either for his release or for opening a channel of dialogue with the rulers.
When contacted, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that no serious effort had been made. “Not yet. Haven’t witnessed any progress,” he said, responding to a question about efforts to initiate talks.
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah stressed that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations.
“Maybe once they clarify their position, they can respond to the PM’s invite,” Mr Sanaullah said while speaking to Geo News on Friday.
“The offer was directly initiated by the PM. Their (the PTI’s) response, which the media finds complicated, has been received. Once we get clarification from them, the PM will make a decision, either forming a committee or meeting with them directly,” he said.
There is a perception in political circles that the government’s dialogue offer was made in earnest and “is desired by the establishment”.
A senior PPP leader, who did not want to be named, said the prime minister would not have extended an offer of talks without the consent of “Rawalpindi”.
He suggested that recent international developments, which he said led to praise for Pakistan’s civil-military leadership, indicated that Western powers might be seeking Islamabad’s support for “something big”. He added that these powers might believe that political stability in Pakistan was imperative for achieving such objectives.
On the question of foreign support for Imran Khan, he said the PTI founder did have some backing abroad.
Responding to the observation that the government had not yet reached out to PTI, the PPP leader said that in such situations, parties rarely move directly to the negotiating table. “Otherwise, it weakens each other’s stance,” he said, adding that back-channel contacts were often employed in such circumstances and could already be in play.
Imran vs Zulfikar vs Nawaz
Political analysts say Imran Khan’s situation was quite different from that faced by former prime ministers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif during their respective periods of imprisonment.
They recalled that when Gen Ziaul Haq overthrew Mr Bhutto and the latter faced execution in 1979, several international leaders — including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, King Khalid of Saudi Arabia and Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi — appealed for clemency, but Gen Zia turned down all those requests.
Similarly, Nawaz Sharif began a period of exile in Saudi Arabia in 2000 after being released from prison by the military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf. His life sentence was commuted following an agreement brokered with the Saudi royal family, which acted as guarantor that Mr Sharif would stay in Saudi Arabia for 10 years and not return to Pakistan during that period.
Analysts argue that no such international effort has emerged in Imran Khan’s case, mainly because he allegedly failed to maintain cordial relations, even with states traditionally seen as friends of Pakistan.
‘Support is coming’
Speaking to Dawn, PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Amir Dogar, said the government had so far made no contact with the opposition for negotiations.
He said the government’s attitude towards PTI did not coincide with the prime minister’s public statements on dialogue. “If they are serious, they must allow relatives and friends of Imran Khan to meet him in jail and release elderly PTI leaders who were sent behind bars three years ago,” he said.
Asked whether Imran Khan had received support from abroad, Mr Dogar declined to provide details but said, “Support is coming.”
He added that Mr Khan was not ready to go into exile and was determined to face his cases. “He was offered to go abroad, not for 10 years but for five. But he refused.” Mr Dogar claimed.
Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said TTAP had responded positively to the prime minister’s offer, but described Imran Khan’s apparent stance as indecisive.
“We have seen in the past that Imran Khan allowed his party leaders to hold talks with the government but later refused to accept what his team had agreed,” he said, referring to previous negotiation attempts.
Mr Mehboob also noted that while opposition parties welcomed the dialogue offer, Imran Khan had simultaneously called for countrywide protests on Feb 8.
He stressed the need for both sides to open back-door channels to create space for formal talks.

PUTRAJAYA: Jailed former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was convicted on Friday on all charges of abuse of power and money laundering, in the biggest trial yet tied to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, a ruling with political repercussions for both him and the current government.
Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah found Najib, 72, guilty on all four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering.

 

The verdict addresses the al­­leged embezzlement of massive sums from 1Malaysia Deve­lopment Berhad (1MDB) while Najib served as prime minister, with the court ruling that the evidence overwhelmingly pointed to his culpability.
“The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him,” Sequerah said in his verdict.
“It pointed towards the ac­­cused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.”
Najib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, alongside fines up to five times the value of the misappropriated funds. He has been imprisoned since August 2022 after Malaysia’s top court upheld a conviction in a separate corruption case involving a 1MDB subsidiary.
Prosecutors successfully argued that Najib illegally received billions traceable to the fund. During the proceedings, the defence maintained Najib was misled by fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, into believing the funds were donations from the Saudi royal family.
Judge Sequerah dismissed this defence as “implausible.” He characterised letters allegedly proving the Arab donations as probable forgeries not corroborated by evidence, calling the narrative a “tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights.”
“The irresistible conclusion is that the Arab donation narrative is not meritorious,” Judge Sequerah said. “The evidence pointed unmistakably to the fact that the monies were, in fact derived from 1MDB funds.”
The judge added that testimony revealed Najib had an “unmistakable bond and connection” with Low, rejecting the claim that the former premier was a victim of rogue subordinates. Instead, the court found Low acted as Najib’s proxy in running the fund’s affairs.
Origin, plunder of 1MDB
The saga began with the cr­­eation of 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Berhad (1MDB) in 2009, a sovereign fund designed to bolster economic development, co-founded by Najib soon after assuming office.
He chaired its advisory board until 2016. However, US and Malaysian investigators allege the fund became a vehicle for industrial-scale theft.
Between 2009 and 2013, 1MDB raised billions of dollars in bonds ostensibly for inv­estment projects. In what the US Department of Justice des­cribed as its largest-ever kleptocracy investigation, auth­­orities say at least $4.5 billion was diverted to offshore bank accounts and shell companies.
Investigators say the siphoned funds were used to purchase high-end real estate, a private jet, a superyacht, jewellery and to finance the 2013 Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street.
At least six countries, including the US, Singapore and Switzerland, launched financial probes implicating high-ranking officials and global financial institutions. In 2020, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $3.9bn to settle investigations into its role in underwriting bond sales for the fund.
A tangled legal web
This conviction is the latest in a series of legal battles for Najib. In July 2020, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for criminal breach of trust and money laundering involving roughly $10 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit. A pardons board halved that sentence to six years in 2024.
Separately, Najib was acqu­itted in March 2023 of tampering with a 1MDB audit report.
In November 2024, a court granted him a discharge not amounting to an acquittal re­­garding the alleged misappropriation of funds meant for Abu Dhabi’s International Pet­roleum Investment Company, though prosecutors may recharge him later.
The ruling adds strain to Prime Minister Anwar Ibra­h­im’s governing alliance, which relies on the United Malays Na­­­­­­tional Organisation (UMNO), Najib’s party. Tensions have ris­en recently after a court denied Najib’s bid to serve his remaining sentence under house arrest.

A FEDERAL judge on Thursday temporarily barred the US government from detaining or deporting a British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke the residency of a critic accused of pressuring social media platforms to censor Americans.
According to BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick granted a temporary restraining order sought by Center for Countering Digital Hate’s Founder Mr Ahmed.
The ruling prohibits federal officials from detaining Ahmed, a US permanent resident, without a hearing while his legal challenge proceeds.
A complaint was filed by Mr Ahmed on Wednesday against Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pamela Bondi regarding the decision to sanction him.
The lawsuit challenges a State Department move to block the visas of Ahmed and four others over accusations that they sought to “coerce” technology companies into restricting free speech.

 

“I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online,” Mr Ahmed said.
Mr Rubio defended the administration’s decision online, saying the individuals were blocked due to concerns they organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and “punish American viewpoints they oppose”.
The sanctions sparked a backlash from European leaders, who argued the administration was targeting organisations dedicated to monitoring online hate speech and disinformation.
Ahmed, who holds a green card and lives in the US with his American wife and child, argued that deportation would forcibly separate him from his family.
His attorney, Roberta Kaplan, said the court’s swift intervention underscored the lack of legal footing for the administration’s actions.
“The federal government can’t deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn’t like what he has to say,” Mr Kaplan said.
The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC. However, a State Department spokesperson told the AFP that the US retains broad authority over entry.

His legal team has finalised a constitutional petition to contest the IHC’s December 18 verdict that declared his appointment unlawful on the basis of an allegedly invalid LL.B. degree, the sources said.
A division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan had issued a short order directing the law ministry to de-notify Justice Jahangiri. President Asif Ali Zardari subsequently approved the de-notification on the advice of the prime minister, and Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website.

 

Sources indicate the upcoming petition will argue that the IHC verdict was premature and violated principles of judicial propriety. A key contention will be that the Sindh High Court (SHC) had already suspended the Karachi University (KU) notification cancelling Justice Jahangiri’s deg­ree. The petition will assert that the IHC could not have delivered a final judgement on the validity of his appointment while the foundational issue regarding his degree remained sub judice before another high court.
The challenge is also expected to reiterate grave allegations of bias against Chief Justice Dogar. A day before his removal, Justice Jahangiri had filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against the chief justice. He accused CJ Dogar of violating the judicial code of conduct by discussing the pending case with him and suggesting that a post-dated resignation could help “prorogue” the proceedings. His application seeking the recusal of CJ Dogar and two other judges, citing a history of litigation between them, was rejected by the bench hours before the final verdict.
The IHC proceedings were marked by sharp controversy. During arguments in the degree case, Justice Jahangiri’s counsel, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, had strongly objected to the bench’s composition. He pointed out that Justice Jahangiri had earlier challenged CJ Dogar’s transfer to the IHC before the Supreme Court, creating an adversarial relationship that, he argued, disqualified the chief justice from hearing the case.
Justice Jahangiri’s legal team further contended that a superior court judge could only be removed through a reference to the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution.
The IHC bench, in its order, distinguished proceedings relating to misconduct from those concerning eligibility. It stated that “ample opportunity” had been provided for a response, which was not furnished. The bench concluded that without a valid LL.B. degree — a prerequisite for enrolment as an advocate — Justice Jahangiri was never eligible for elevation under Article 175-A of the Constitution, rendering his appointment “without lawful authority.”
Islamabad High Court Bar Association former president Riasat Ali Azad said that Justice Jahangiri had a strong case. He criticised the order as “tainted with malice” and questioned the bench’s composition. “It is unprecedented in judicial history that an unconfirmed judge was included on a bench examining the appointment of a judge who was third in seniority,” he said, referring to Justice Azam Khan, who is an additional judge.

LAHORE: Although Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi managed to reach Liberty Roundabout on Friday night, he was unable to deliver a planned speech at the venue as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to area by setting up pickets.
Videos posted by PTI on social media showed a large number of party supporters, including Imran Khan’s sisters, Aleema Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi, present near Liberty Chowk.







The chief minister, who was due to launch the PTI’s street movement from Lahore, had earlier spent the day greeting and addressing PTI supporters, who met him at different points en route to Lahore.
His convoy eventually entered Lahore around 4:30pm, from where he made a bee-line for the Punjab Assembly. The visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Addressing PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, he thanked the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighted his treatment at the hands of police during the journey to Lahore.
“Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.”
CM Afridi assailed the federal government for failure to handle the economy, brain drain and declining industrial growth.







“Farmers are being driven to suicide. And what are their priorities? Making sure the PTI cannot hold rallies, stopping Imran Khan from meeting his sisters and arresting our workers,” he stated.
He also met with Punjab parliamentarians at the Punjab Assembly and visited the residences of party leaders Latif Khosa, Advocate Haider Majeed and Nadeem Bara.
‘Oppression is about to end’
Earlier, speaking to the media, CM Afridi said that “oppression is about to end” and that PTI founder Imran Khan would soon be among the people of Pakistan due to what he described as a massive public struggle since the alleged regime change operation in 2022.
Mr Afridi said that he was in Lahore to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of Imran Khan, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism without making mistakes. “We will take Imran Khan’s ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ (real independence) movement to its logical conclusion, restore the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and revive an independent judiciary and independent media,” he asserted.







The KP chief minister lambasted the Punjab government for what he termed the unleashing of fascism against PTI workers and their families, claiming that hundreds of workers and supporters had been detained in a police operation that began on Thursday evening.
Lambasting the PML-N leadership, he said those who once claimed they would sell their clothes to serve the people were now selling Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) at throwaway prices.
In a separate media interaction, Mr Afridi said major industries had left Pakistan and that skilled and educated youth were feeling insecure and migrating abroad, resulting in a severe brain drain. He regretted that industrial growth had turned negative.

Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari welcomed Mr Afridi to Lahore, saying he was free to see the lights, enjoy local cuisine and explore the city. She remarked that former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur had previously been shown “the lights of Lahore”, and now CM Afridi should also witness Punjab’s progress and replicate its positive aspects in KP.
Ms Bukhari said Lahore was “the Europe of Pakistan” and added that if conditions in Peshawar were poor, visiting Lahore for learning and recreation was welcome. She said the KP chief minister had permission for tourism — political or informative — but would not be allowed to use abusive language, create unrest or spread chaos.
Foolproof security
The Punjab government has directed authorities to ensure foolproof security for visiting KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi during his stay in Lahore.
In a letter marked “most immediate”, the Punjab Home Department instructed the inspector general of police, inspector general of prisons, Lahore division commissioner and deputy commissioner to make comprehensive security arrangements for the KP CM during his three-day visit.
Today’s engagements
The PTI has shared the KP chief minister’s engagements scheduled at the Lahore High Court today (Saturday) from 1pm to 5pm.
According to the programme, CM Afridi will hold a meeting in the Lahore High Court meeting room with the family members of party workers currently languishing in military custody.
At the same venue, he will also meet party workers who, the PTI claims, faced torture and oppression after being arrested in cases related to May 9.
The chief minister will later participate in a lawyers’ convention organised by the Insaf Lawyers Forum.

Speaking at the graduation ceremony at the Kabul Police Academy, Haqqani announced that the doors for negotiations were open.
He said that his government continues to adhere to the commitments made under the Doha Agreement, not allowing Afghanistan’s soil to be used against any country, the Afghan Taliban’s official media reported.
However, despite earlier promises and the commitments made in the Doha Agreement, cross-border infiltration and attacks by militants continue in Pakistan.
Haqqani said that Afghanistan posed no threat to any country or region and that the Taliban leadership continued to strive to find ways for reasonable and durable solutions to end mistrust and misunderstanding of the international community. “The doors for negotiations to resolve current issues are not closed,“ he said.
Although Haqqani did not mention Pakistan by name, he appeared to refer to Pakistan’s long-standing demand from Kabul to rein in the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Relations between the two neighbours are strained following border skirmishes, which led to the closure of borders between the two countries since October 11, 2025.
Attempts by Turkiye and the UAE to broker an agreement between the two sides failed to break the ice, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of refusing to give a written undertaking to control the TTP, whose fighters, it says, continue to infiltrate through its 2600-km-long porous borders to launch attacks inside the country.
The remarks by Haqqani are significant in that the TTP owes its allegiance to him and has been operating from areas in Afghanistan that have been under his control since long.
It was precisely for this reason that Haqqani’s younger brother, Anas Haqqani, was part of the Afghan Taliban team negotiating with their Pakistani counterparts in Qatar and Turkiye.</p><small>2025-12-27 02:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/26174913eac738e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963373/pakistan-summons-uk-high-commissioner-after-provocative-bradford-demonstration' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan summons UK high commissioner after ‘provocative’ Bradford demonstration</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday summoned the United Kingdom’s acting high commissioner in connection with a protest outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford, where “provocative” statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership.
FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the acting UK high commissioner was summoned and issued a démarche.
“The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said.
The FO urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”.
Earlier, two ministers of state from the PML-N said that the Pakistan government had written a letter to the UK authorities, seeking action over “inciteful” statements, particularly in reference to a video that was circulating on social media.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani confirmed that development to Geo News, with the latter particularly mentioning that “the head of armed forces was threatened” in the video.
Kayani also mentioned the opposition PTI’s involvement in the matter, naming the party, which Chaudhry didn’t.
In the video, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags.
When asked about the video, Chaudhry said, “Pakistan has formally written to the UK, expecting them to act according to their laws and justice system.“
He maintained that Pakistan had the right to take legal action against those “targeting its institutions”.
Chaudhry recalled that there had been complaints before as well regarding the “use of social media platforms to incite hatred against state institutions and political figures”.
“The footage of the incident is available,” he added, referring to the video being discussed.
He added, “This is not a political matter, nor one pertaining to the freedom of speech.” It was a clear violation of international law and the UK law, he said, particularly mentioning the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.
“Every state is responsible for ensuring its citizens, or those who have taken asylum, or those residing there, don’t act to incite rebellion or violence against other sovereign states,” he stressed.
Chaudhry further noted: “What’s concerning is the specific mention of a car bomb blast, making it a targeted issue; it is not something generalised, it seems to be carefully planned.“
“Pakistan has raised these concerns,” he said.
“It appears as if there is a larger plan involved, and Pakistan has raised these concerns,” Chaudhry said.
He maintained that “inciting terrorism or provoking people was not akin to freedom of expression”.
“You can not have people in one state promoting terrorism against another sovereign state,” he reiterated.
He hoped that the British government would take action, adding that in case of non-compliance, “Pakistan has other options as well“.
Minister of State for Finance Kayani termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”.
“We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” Kayani said.
He added that the party had “crossed a limit” by “threatening the armed forces’ chief with murder under the guise of political protest”.
“That’s not politics[..] it’s unacceptable,” he said.
He termed PTI a “national security threat”, alleging that it had always used politics to cover for “violence”.
“Whether on May 9, using KP police to attack soldiers, and threatening the army chief […] if that’s not a national security threat, what is?” he said.
In response to a question on whether the Pakistani government would take action in the matter, he said, “First, we will urge the UK government to take immediate legal action and investigate the matter”.
However, he added that the government was open to “exploring other legal options”.
Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions.
When asked about criticism directed towards the army chief, Naqvi had said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them.“
On Dec 4, the interior minister, in a meeting with the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, submitted extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja, who Naqvi said were involved in spreading “anti-Pakistan propaganda” online.</p><small>2025-12-26 22:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/262246554279d6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963358/pakistan-uae-hold-substantive-talks-during-president-al-nahyans-first-official-visit-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE hold ‘substantive talks’ during President Al Nahyan’s first official visit to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Friday held “substantive talks” focused on further strengthening the longstanding fraternal relations between the two countries, said a statement after the conclusion of President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s first official visit to the country.
This is the second time the Emirati president is visiting Pakistan this year, having met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Rahim Yar Khan in January. However, Friday’s trip is his first official visit as president, according to the Foreign Office.

The two sides also reaffirmed their shared commitment to continue close coordination on matters of mutual interest and exchanged views on important regional and international developments.
The statement added that while expressing satisfaction with the positive trajectory of bilateral relations, the “two leaders reiterated their determination to continue to work together closely to advance the shared objective of peace, stability, and sustainable development”.
“The visit of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan will further consolidate the deep brotherly ties between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates and contribute to further strengthening of their strategic partnership,” said the statement.







During the discussions between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Al Nahyan, expanding collaboration in economic cooperation, investment, energy, infrastructure development, IT, technology and people-to-people exchanges was also discussed.
“They also agreed on the need to enhance bilateral trade, which had great potential for mutually beneficial growth,” added the statement.
The Emirati president was “greeted with the greatest warmth and cordial welcome upon his arrival”.
“A formation of JF-17 fighter jets escorted the Royal aircraft as it entered Pakistani airspace,” said the statement.
Earlier today, President Al Nahyan reached Islamabad and was received by PM Shehbaz at the Nur Khan airbase.

Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir greeted the Emirati president as well, televised footage showed. Also present to welcome the president was Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
Upon his arrival, President Al Nahyan was presented with a 21-gun salute from a contingent of the armed forces at an official reception held in his honour, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.







According to WAM, the president was accompanied by Advisers to the UAE President Sheikh Sultan bin Hamdan Al Nahyan and Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Tahnoun Al Nahyan, Ambassador of the UAE to Pakistan Salem Mohammed Al Zaabi and other ministers and senior officials.







According to FO, during the visit, President Al Nahyan was expected to review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations with PM Shehbaz and the pair will “exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest”.
“The visit will provide an important opportunity to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pak­istan and the United Arab Emirates,” the FO said in a statement.
The FO added that the visit reflects the depth of bilateral relations bet­ween both nations and their shared commitment to bolster collaboration in key areas, including trade, investment, energy, development and regional stability.
On Wednesday, the district administration of Islamabad announced a public holiday in the federal capital on the day of the visit (today).
“It is notified that Dec 26 (Friday) is hereby declared as a local holiday within the revenue limits of the Islamabad Capital Territory,” a notification issued by the magistrate’s office said.
It was posted on X by Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon.







Memon said that all essential services, including hospitals, police, city administration, Capital Development Authority (CDA), and utility services, would remain operational.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-26 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/262240400a26c5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963398/nigeria-signals-more-strikes-likely-in-joint-us-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Nigeria signals more strikes likely in ‘joint’ US operations</strong></a><br><p>Nigeria on Friday signaled that more strikes against terrorist groups were expected after a Christmas Day bombardment by US forces against militants in the north of the country, which it said was a joint operation with its military.
The west African country faces multiple interlinked security crises, with terrorists waging an insurgency in the northeast since 2009 and armed “bandit” gangs raiding villages and staging kidnappings in the northwest.
The strikes came after Abuja and Washington were locked in a diplomatic dispute over what US President Donald Trump has characterised as the mass killing of Christians amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts.
A Pentagon official told AFP that “the Department of War worked with the government of Nigeria to carry out these strikes” and that they “were approved by the government of Nigeria”, without saying whether Nigeria’s military had been involved.
US defence officials later posted a video of what appeared to be a nighttime missile launch from the deck of a battleship flying the US flag.
Meanwhile, Nigeria’s military said in a statement that its forces, “in conjunction with the United States”, had conducted “precision strike operations”.
Both countries said the strikes targeted militants linked to the Islamic State group, without providing details.
Washington’s framing of the violence in Nigeria as amounting to Christian “persecution” is rejected by the Nigerian government and independent analysts, but has nonetheless resulted in increased security coordination.
“It’s Nigeria that provided the intelligence,” the country’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, told broadcaster Channels TV, saying he was on the phone with US State Secretary Marco Rubio ahead of the bombardment.
Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: “It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the US. We are working with other countries as well.”
Targets unclear
The Department of War’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in the northwestern state of Sokoto.
Residents in the far-flung villages of that state told AFP they were shocked by the blasts. The strikes hit multiple locations, including a town that residents said was not a militant stronghold.
Which of Nigeria’s myriad, and well-documented, armed groups were targeted remains unclear.
Nigeria’s terrorist groups are mostly concentrated in the northeast, but have made inroads into the northwest.
Researchers have recently linked some members of an armed group known as Lakurawa — the main terrorist group located in Sokoto State — to Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), which is mostly active in neighbouring Niger and Mali.
Other analysts have disputed those links, and research on Lakurawa is complicated as the term has been used to describe various armed fighters in the northwest.
“We initially thought it was (an) attack by Lakurawa,” said Haruna Kallah, a resident of Jabo town.
That the explosions were in fact the result of a US strike “surprised us because this area has never been a Lakurawa enclave, and we have never had any attacks in the last two years.” Tukur Shehu, a resident of Tangaza, a neighbouring district, said two strikes targeted Warriya and Alkassim villages — known to house Lakurawa camps, from where they launch attacks and keep hostages.
Public opinion divided
Public opinion on the surprise strikes was split.
“America has made its way by force in our country, to kill our people,” said Sulaiman Ibrahim, an imam in Lagos.
Emmanuel Udoh, a member of the clergy at Living Faith Church, told AFP: “We are grateful with what the US has done. We are grateful with what the Nigerian government is trying to do.”
While the Nigerian government has welcomed the strikes, “I think Trump would not have accepted a ‘No,’” said Malik Samuel, an Abuja-based researcher for Good Governance Africa, an NGO.
Security analyst Brant Philip called the timing, on Christmas Day, “a symbolic start to official US operations in Nigeria”, adding: “The operational results of the strikes are not significant, but much is expected soon.” Tuggar said that Nigerian President Bola Tinubu “gave the go-ahead” for the strikes.
The foreign minister added: “It must be made clear that it is a joint operation, and it is not targeting any religion nor simply in the name of one religion or the other.“</p><small>2025-12-26 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/26214325fe9d55f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963396/at-least-8-worshippers-killed-in-deadly-blast-at-mosque-in-syrias-homs' target='_blank'><strong>At least 8 worshippers killed in deadly blast at mosque in Syria’s Homs</strong></a><br><p>An explosion killed at least eight worshippers at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of Syria’s Homs on Friday, state media said.
The attack during Friday prayers is the latest on the Alawite community, and the second blast in a place of worship since extremist authorities took power a year ago, after a suicide bombing in a Damascus church killed 25 people in June.
In a statement on Telegram, terrorist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunna said its fighters “detonated a number of explosive devices” in the Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib Mosque in the central Syrian city.
The group formed after the ouster last year of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, himself a member of the Alawite community, and had claimed responsibility for the June church bombing, though authorities blamed the militant Islamic State group.
State news agency SANA reported an explosion in the mosque in Homs’s Wadi al-Dahab neighbourhood and gave a preliminary toll of at least eight dead and 18 wounded, citing a health ministry official.
An AFP photographer saw security forces cordoning off the area around the mosque while inside, personnel stood guard as red tape encircled the blackened, debris-strewn corner where the blast went off.
Usama Ibrahim, 47, who was being treated in hospital for shrapnel wounds to his head and back, said he was at Friday prayers when he heard a loud explosion.
“The world turned red… and I fell to the ground. Then I saw blood flowing from my head,” he told AFP.
‘Shrapnel all around’
Syria’s interior ministry said in a statement that “a terrorist explosion” targeted the mosque and that authorities had “begun investigating and collecting evidence to pursue the perpetrators of this criminal act”.
SANA quoted a security source as saying that initial investigations indicated that “explosive devices planted inside the mosque” caused the blast.
As victims’ families gathered at the hospital, wounded bookseller Ghadi Maarouf, 38, told AFP that the explosion occurred “just before the imam was to ascend the minbar to deliver the sermon”, referring to the imam’s raised platform.
“It was a huge explosion, and I saw shrapnel flying all around me,” said Maarouf, whose leg was wounded in the blast.
Syria’s foreign ministry condemned a “cowardly criminal act”, saying it came “in the context of repeated desperate attempts to undermine security and stability and spread chaos among the Syrian people”.
The ministry statement reiterated its “firm stance in combating terrorism in all its forms”, vowing to hold the attackers accountable.
Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan condemned the attack.
Since Assad’s fall, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor and Homs province residents have reported kidnappings and killings targeting members of the minority community, while the country has seen several bloody sectarian episodes.
Detainees released
Syria’s coastal areas saw the massacre of Alawite civilians in March, with authorities accusing armed Assad supporters of sparking the violence by attacking security forces.
A national commission of inquiry said at least 1,426 members of the minority were killed, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor put the toll at more than 1,700.
Late last month, thousands of people demonstrated on the coast in protest at fresh attacks targeting Alawites in Homs and other regions.
Before and after the March bloodshed, authorities carried out a massive arrest campaign in predominantly Alawite areas, which are also former Assad strongholds.
On Friday, Syrian state television reported the release of 70 detainees in the coastal city of Latakia “after it was proven that they were not involved in war crimes”, saying more releases would follow.
Despite assurances from Damascus that all Syria’s communities will be protected, the country’s minorities remain largely wary of their future under the new authorities.
In July, sectarian clashes in southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province saw more than 2,000 people killed, including hundreds of Druze civilians who the Observatory said were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”.
In a speech this month marking a year since the fall of Assad, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa emphasised the importance of all Syrians unifying efforts to “to build a strong Syria”.
Despite major achievements in relaunching Syria’s foreign standing, Sharaa faces the major domestic challenge of maintaining security and unity nationwide.</p><small>2025-12-26 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2621283142bf6d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963395/pm-shehbaz-will-decide-on-talks-once-pti-clarifies-its-stance-says-rana-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz will decide on talks once PTI clarifies its stance, says Rana Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations.
PM Shehbaz on Tuesday extended an offer for talks with the opposition, but emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
The PTI outright rejected talks with the government on the directions of party founder Imran Khan, but Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), of which the PTI is a part, stated its openness to negotiate with the government.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the PM’s aide stated that 85 per cent of the TTAP is made up of PTI members, who have said they will not participate in negotiations at all.
“The remaining opposition includes [TTAP chief] Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s JUI-F,” Sanaullah said.
“We are hopeful that either the opposition as a whole will come to the table, or at least the 15pc who are open to talks will.”
Emphasising that the government’s goal is dialogue with the opposition, the PM’s aide said there should have been dialogue between political parties from the beginning and expressed reservations about talks with the PTI.
“On one hand, they will sit at the table, while on the other, they will prepare condemnations,” Sanaullah said.
“They will plan street agitation and a march to Islamabad. If they prepare to spread anarchy and hatred, then the law will take its course. These people (the PTI) will then run and say action is being taken against us, how can we sit at the table?”
The PM‘s aide added that if the PTI’s plan isn’t focused, then it will limit their path forward.
“Maybe once they clarify their position, they can respond to the PM’s invite,” he added.
“The offer was directly initiated by the PM. Their (the PTI’s) response, which the media finds complicated, has been received. Once we get clarification from them, the PM will make a decision, either forming a committee or meeting with them directly.”
Responsibility for talks lies with Achakzai: PTI’s Shafi Jan
The KP chief minister‘s aide on information and public relations, Shafiullah Jan, also appeared on the programme and reiterated the PTI’s stance of not engaging in negotiations with the incumbent government.
“Our strategy and stance are very clear: we will not engage in talks, because whether it be negotiations or condemnation, we want a result-oriented process,” he said.
“Imran Khan has granted responsibility in this area (talks) to Achakzai sahib and [MWM Senator] Allama Raja Nasir. You have seen that during the [TTAP’s] two-day conference, a draft was shared, and yesterday, there was a five-hour meeting where another draft was shared.”
“It clearly states that we will not start unconditional negotiations,” he emphasised.
Speaking about the conditions, he said they included a call for fresh elections under a new Election Commission of Pakistan, Imran Khan’s release, and the release of senior PTI leaders and his family members.
When asked whether these conditions were PTI’s or TTAP’s, Jan reiterated that Achakzai had full responsibility for negotiations or other actions, such as mobilisation and condemnation.
“Whatever decision he makes — negotiating, condemnation, marching to Islamabad or closing KP‘s borders — will be accepted and backed by the PTI,” the CM’s aide said.
“As far as negotiations are concerned, Achakzai sahib will lead those. He has the responsibility and we will accept every decision he makes,” Jan stated.
“Additionally, we are preparing a street movement. Why can’t we negotiate and mobilise at the same time?”
The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face a political crisis.
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The participants of the conference were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
Recently, a similar proposal was also made by five PTI leaders currently incarcerated in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. In a letter, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed argued that dialogue was the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises.</p><small>2025-12-26 16:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/261313199dbfc67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963369/lhc-cj-overturns-dc-led-committees-decisions-on-property-possession-in-10-punjab-districts' target='_blank'><strong>LHC CJ overturns DC-led committees’ decisions on property possession in 10 Punjab districts</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum on Friday overturned the decisions of deputy commissioner-led committees that granted the possession of properties to people in 10 districts of Punjab, deciding cases of land disputes.
Justice Neelum reversed the decisions after hearing petitions against the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act 2025, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
During the hearing, the chief justice remarked that had the “patwaris” (revenue officials) performed their duties promptly, such issues would not have arisen.
Rejecting a notion of prolonged pendency of civil litigation, the chief justice observed, “I am well aware of how many old cases are pending before courts.”
She asserted that commissioners and deputy commissioners had no authority to remove or restore possessions of properties on their own, and questioned how many laws the government would throw aside.
The chief justice regretted that deputy commissioners ordered the removal of possessions despite the fact that the matters were pending before the civil courts.
A citizen from Depalpur who had obtained possession under the new law also appeared before the court. However, the chief justice ordered him to give up the possession.
When confronted, a lawyer for the citizen conceded before the court that the deputy commissioner-led committee had acted beyond its authority.
Justice Neelum observed that since the lawyer himself had admitted that the DC had exceeded his authority, an action could be initiated against the committee members.
The lawyer asked where people would go if they did not get justice from the judicial system.

 

He added that the dispute resolution committee (DRC) had handed over possession of the property within 27 days.
However, the chief justice snubbed the lawyer, instructing him not to make sensational statements for the consumption of newspaper headlines.
The CJ observed that a DC could not pass such a decision as the power to decide was vested with the tribunals formed under the new law. She clarified that the issue before the court was not whether the petitioners were the owners of the property, but whether deputy commissioners had the authority to make such decisions.
Suspending the enforcement of the DRC’s orders for possessions, the chief justice referred the petitions to a yet-to-be-constituted full bench for further hearing.
Rana Saleem Latif, Muhammad Ali and others approached the court against the decisions of the DRCs in ten districts.
On Dec 22, Justice Neelum had suspended the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance, 2025 and announced that a full bench would be constituted to hear and decide the matter.
The next day, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed reservations about the LHC’s decision, arguing that the move would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”. Punjab Law Minister Malik Sohaib Ahmad Bherth, Information Minister Azma Bukhari, and treasury MPAs strongly defended the law as well in the provincial assembly.
On the other hand, on Dec 24, bar councils, irrespective of their political affiliations, endorsed the LHC’s decision. Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warraich stated that the enactment of the law questioned the jurisdiction of patwaris and “unlawfully” empowered assistant commissioners beyond their mandate.</p><small>2025-12-26 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/26210342070c60b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963393/police-armed-locals-kill-6-terrorists-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Police, armed locals kill 6 terrorists in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least six terrorists were killed and several others injured on Friday in a clash between police forces, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos and armed locals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat.
“The terrorists armed with sniper rifles and quadcopters attacked the police in the rural area bordering Bannu district and located within the limits of Shaheed Asmatullah Khan Khattak police station of Serai Naurang town,“ said a police statement.
“The attack triggered a fierce gun battle as the law enforcers returned the fire effectively,” it said.
As per the release, the terrorists also targeted the “houses of villagers with quadcopter strikes”, resulting in “civilian casualties”.
Although the official press release did not provide any details about police casualties, it stated that “during the armed clash, the law enforcers eliminated six terrorists and several of their accomplices were injured”.
“The casualties occurred as a result of explosive payload released by the quadcopters.”
Meanwhile, Additional Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Wazir, who visited the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Serai Naurang town, told media persons that ten injured had been brought to the hospital so far.
“Some injured have been referred to a hospital in Bannu while others were in stable condition,” he said.
“The district administration has declared an emergency at the THQ Hospital as all doctors and paramedics have been called to duty,“ he maintained, adding that doctors, along with a sufficient quantity of medicines, are available and standard treatment facilities are being provided to the injured people.
The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Ishaq, also confirmed that they had received “ten injured so far and three of them had been referred to a hospital in Bannu owing to their critical condition”.
The situation was tense, and security had been tightened in the remote rural area on the special instructions of Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bannu Sajjad Khan.
“The RPO and Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan are supervising the operation against Fitna al Khawarij terrorists as a large police contingent backed by the CTD personnel and volunteers of peace committees are present in the area,” added the release.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
It continued that the law enforcers had surrounded the entire area and a search and clearance operation was underway, while additional forces had also been put on “high alert” to counter any untoward eventuality.
“Police will continue operations against the terrorists and anti-peace elements to establish lasting peace in the region and protect people’s lives and properties,” the RPO affirmed.
Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Zulfiqar Hameed also praised the Bannu police and CTD for the successful operation against the terrorists.
“Such successful actions against terrorists would be further accelerated for the protection of public life and regional peace,” he stated.
A terrorist commander was also killed in an exchange of fire with police and a CTD team in the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat on Thursday.
On the same day, two wanted suspects, one of them wanted by the Punjab police, were arrested during a targeted operation in the district.
Earlier, the security forces and police had destroyed several hideouts of terrorists during an operation in the Bettani subdivision of Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-12-26 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/261923422831943.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963391/pakistan-u-19-captain-farhan-vows-to-respect-every-opposition-ahead-of-zimbabwe-tri-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan U-19 captain Farhan vows to ‘respect every opposition’ ahead of Zimbabwe tri-series</strong></a><br><p>Fresh from a widely-celebrated U-19 Asia Cup triumph, skipper of the Pakistan youth team Farhan Yousaf wants his side to show humility as they take on Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in the tri-series that starts in Harare on Saturday.
The series will act as a warm-up for the teams ahead of the U-19 World Cup, which is set to be held from January 15 in Zimbabwe and Namibia.
Pakistan won the U-19 Asia Cup title after beating an unbeaten India side by 191 runs in the final last week — the achievement sparking raucous celebrations back home with the national youth squad welcomed by a huge crowd at the Islamabad International Airport.
The decider saw Pakistan opener Sameer Minhas smash a scintillating 172 and pacer Ali Raza routing the Indian batting line-up with a four-wicket show under the mentorship of former national skipper Sarfraz Ahmed.
The achievement added star value to the Pakistan U-19 team, raising expectations ahead of the tri-series and the World Cup, but for Farhan, it is about focusing on what he believes are brand new assignments.
“The past is in the past, this is a new journey and a new chapter and we are preparing for it accordingly,” he said in a statement issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday. “The Asia Cup was a good win for us and the players showed great morale and intensity.
“The players are confident and excited as we head into the tri-series.”
Pakistan will take on Afghanistan in the tri-series opener at the Harare Sports Club before playing hosts Zimbabwe at the Prince Edward School in the capital on Dec 29.
The national side will clash against Afghanistan in the reverse fixture at the Sunrise Sports Club in Harare on Jan 2 and their last round-robin match, against Zimbabwe will be played on Jan 4.
The tri-series final is set to be hosted by the Harare Sports Club on Jan 6.
“Both teams in the tournament are strong and competitive and we respect every opposition as we look forward to a competitive event,” said Farhan.
The tri-series provides a valuable opportunity for all three sides to prepare for the U-19 World Cup, set to run until Feb 6. Pakistan are placed in Group ‘C’ and will play their group-stage matches in Harare from Jan 16-22.
The Super Six stage will take place from Jan 25 to Feb 1, followed by the semi-finals on Feb 3 and 4. The final of the 16-team tournament will be played at the Harare Sports Club on Feb 6.
Pakistan held their first training session on Friday ahead of their first tri-series match.
“The tri-series is very important for the players and will help us find the right combinations ahead of the U-19 World Cup,” Farhan noted.
“The conditions here are similar and will be beneficial for our World Cup preparations.”

The new date for submission of nomination papers is December 30.
In an application submitted to the ECP, Secretary Baldiat Committee Anjum Shahzad Tanoli requested the chief election commissioner to extend the deadline for the submission of nomination papers.
“With due respect, this is to draw your kind attention towards the schedule of Local Body elections in Islamabad, wherein the last date for submission of nomination papers has been fixed as 27th December. It is humbly submitted that the Government has announced a local holiday on 26th December, which will significantly affect the smooth process of nomination paper submission,” he stated.
“Islamabad comprises 125 Union Councils, and in each Union Council at least 9 councillors are required to submit their nomination papers. The announced holiday will create serious administrative and logistical difficulties for candidates, proposers and concerned offices, leading to unnecessary congestion and hardship on the final day,” he said.
Polling will take place on February 15, with the results being consolidated between February 16 and 19.
Despite fear of rigging, the PTI had decided to participate in the local government elections. In line with party policy, workers who have remained loyal to the party and its ideology and have made sacrifices during the last three years will be given priority in nominations.</p><small>2025-12-26 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/26161939e1db431.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963376/14-injured-in-japan-after-stabbing-liquid-spray-attack' target='_blank'><strong>14 injured in Japan after stabbing, liquid spray attack</strong></a><br><p>Fourteen people were injured in a stabbing attack in a factory in central Japan during which an unspecified liquid was also sprayed, an emergency services official said on Friday.
“Fourteen people are subject to transportation by emergency services,” Tomoharu Sugiyama, a firefighting department official in the city of Mishima in the Shizuoka region, told AFP.
He said a call was received at about 4.30pm (12:30pm PKT) from a nearby rubber factory saying “five or six people were stabbed by someone” and that a “spray-like liquid” had also been used.
Japanese media, including public broadcaster NHK, reported that police had arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder.
The seriousness of the injuries was unknown, although NHK said all victims remained conscious.
Sugiyama said at least six of the 14 victims had been sent to a hospital in a fleet of ambulances. The exact nature of the injuries was also unclear.
The factory in Mishima is run by Yokohama Rubber Co., whose business includes manufacturing tyres for trucks and buses, according to its corporate website.
Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan, which has a low murder rate and some of the world’s toughest gun laws.
However, there are occasional stabbing attacks and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.
A Japanese man was sentenced to death in October for a shooting and stabbing rampage that killed four people, including two police officers, in 2023.
A 43-year-old man was also charged with attempted murder in May over a knife attack at Tokyo’s Toda-mae metro station.</p><small>2025-12-26 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2612063791009ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963365/tajikistan-says-5-killed-in-armed-clash-on-border-with-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Tajikistan says 5 killed in armed clash on border with Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Tajik state media said on Thursday.
Citing a statement by the Border Troops of the Tajik State Committee for National Security, state news agency Khovar reported that three people crossed into the country late on Tuesday in the Shamsiddin Shohin district of the country’s southwestern Khatlon region, and were later located on Wednesday.
“The terrorists refused to obey orders from Tajik border guards to surrender and offered armed resistance. They intended to carry out an armed attack on one of the border posts of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan,” the statement said.
“As a result of the combat operation, all three terrorists were neutralised,” the statement said, adding that two Tajik border officers were killed during the clashes.
According to the statement, this was the third “armed attack, terrorist act, and border crossing” from Afghanistan in the past month.

 

It also accused the Afghan government of “demonstrating serious and repeated irresponsibility and non-commitment in fulfilling its international obligations and consistent promises to ensure security and stability” on the Tajik-Afghan border.
The Tajik statement additionally expressed hope that the Afghan administration will “apologise to the people of Tajikistan and take additional effective measures to ensure security on the border with Tajikistan”.
Afghanistan did not immediately comment on the development.
Earlier this month, Tajikistan said five people were killed and five others injured in two previous cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
On Wednesday, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon commissioned four new border outposts, as well as a training range for tanks at the Harb-Maidon training ground near the Tajik-Afghan border, as part of efforts to bolster border security amid growing concerns over cross-border attacks.</p><small>2025-12-26 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2611054852b4ef4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963362/hope-we-can-avoid-unnecessary-politicisation-ahsan-iqbal-on-speculation-about-disruption-of-his-ary-news-interview' target='_blank'><strong>Hope we can avoid unnecessary politicisation: Ahsan Iqbal on speculation about disruption of his ARY News interview</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal reacted to the speculation surrounding the brief disruption of his interview with ARY News’ Waseem Badami the previous night, saying, “I hope we can avoid unnecessary politicisation of this”.







On Thursday night, the minister joined ARY News programme ‘11th Hour’, which was being broadcast live, via a video link.
As the minister discussed the matter of talks between the government and the opposition, the conversation was disrupted when a person — not seen in the video — yelled in an aggressive tone, “Shut this”.
Following that, Iqbal’s call was disconnected.
It prompted the host to wonder aloud if Iqbal was alright.
“I hope everything is well. I don’t know what just happened,” he said.
Later, the minister rejoined the programme, confirming that “all was well”.
The incident sparked widespread speculation across social media, with many people suggesting that it was political in nature.
The planning minister, however, clarified on X early today morning that “a brief disruption occurred during a live broadcast when someone nearby, having an argument, was unaware that I was live on air.“
“I rejoined the interview shortly afterward,” he added, calling on people to “avoid unnecessary politicisation of this.”
The minister said this in a reply to a post made by journalist Ajmal Jami, who confirmed that he had spoken to Iqbal after watching the clip of the incident.
“He (Iqbal) said there was a family gathering at his Islamabad residence when children unexpectedly entered his study. He rejoined the show shortly after,” Jami’s post said.







Information Minister Ataullah Tarar also confirmed that he had spoken to Iqbal, stating that “kids came into the study running unexpectedly. All is well, and he has rejoined the show”.
