Pakistan assumed the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”
 






It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
According to a July 19 statement issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.
Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p><small>2025-07-21 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/687c2e012dc32.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925399/corporate-window-addressing-the-plastic-bag-supply-chain' target='_blank'><strong>CORPORATE WINDOW: Addressing the plastic bag supply chain</strong></a><br><p>Plastic pollution is one of the most severe forms of pollution because, once created, it takes hundreds of years to break down in the environment. It is also one of the few types of pollution that equally impacts land, air, and water.
The primary contributor is single-use plastic products, with plastic shopping bags being the most significant. In countries like ours, the low cost and the lack of equally convenient safe alternatives are the two main reasons for their ever-increasing use. Plastic particles suspended in the air are a major cause of air pollution and contribute to smog during the winter season. Additionally, the dumping of plastic bags into water bodies, which eventually flow into the sea, significantly harms marine life.
 
 

The world became aware of the disastrous environmental impacts of plastic pollution in the late 1980s, and many developing countries, including Pakistan, began efforts to control it in the late 1990s. However, they still continue to struggle to eliminate it from the market.
Before the 18th Amendment, the federal government attempted to ban single-use plastic bags by restricting their manufacturing based on thickness and size. These bans produced temporary results, but the long-standing habit of using cheap, disposable plastic bags soon resurfaced. After the 18th Amendment, each province has been grappling with efforts to ban this menace, but unfortunately, these efforts have largely been unsuccessful, often remaining confined to paper; the government has often been criticised for creating policies on paper that lack effective implementation in practice.

If the supply of plastic bags is banned, demand will naturally shift to the eco-friendly alternatives permitted to meet consumer needs

The efforts to ban plastic bags in Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, have faced significant challenges despite government initiatives. While the government has repeatedly attempted to enforce bans, various obstacles have consistently hindered progress. For instance, the Sindh government has been striving to ban plastic bags since 1998 but has largely faced setbacks due to peculiar reasons.
In the late 1990s, black plastic bags were banned in Sindh because of their cancer-causing substances. However, resistance from the hardware retail sector led to their continued availability in the undocumented black market, where plastic manufacturing operates unregulated.
In 2004, Sindh ambitiously imposed a ban on plastic bags thinner than 30 microns. Unfortunately, plastic bag manufacturers successfully opposed it, citing the potential loss of 60,000 jobs in the sector. Weak enforcement and a lack of consumer cooperation, driven by insufficient awareness of the environmental and health hazards of plastic bags, were the two primary reasons for the ban’s failure, and both issues were closely tied to the widespread availability of plastic bags in the market.
That said, theoretically, if plastic bags were entirely removed from circulation, consumers would likely adapt quickly, reverting to practices from the early 1980s when cloth bags and straw baskets were commonly used.
The recent ban on all types of plastic bags in Sindh is encountering familiar challenges, with the government striving to engage all stakeholders to ensure success this time. However, within just a week of the ban’s enforcement, resistance from the supply side surfaced, prompting regulators to seek a balanced solution that supports the ban while addressing the business interests of affected sectors. This approach aims to find common ground, fostering cooperation to achieve positive outcomes for all parties involved.
If the supply chain for plastic bags is completely eliminated, manufacturers would need to adapt to the non-availability of raw materials or face heavy taxes designed to reduce their profit margins. These manufacturers are key players, and as long as they resist a complete ban, efforts to eradicate plastic bags will continue indefinitely.
A straightforward solution would be to prohibit the production of plastic bags, compelling manufacturers to shift to eco-friendly alternatives. They often claim concern over the higher costs of these alternatives, arguing that they are unaffordable for the lower-middle-income group and poor consumers. In reality, their primary worry is the reduced profit margins, as it is well-established that eco-friendly alternatives do not offer the same high profitability as plastic bags.
Initially, eco-friendly products may have a higher per-unit cost due to lower production volumes. However, as demand grows and production scales, prices could decrease to more reasonable levels. This price reduction depends on the willingness of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to accept lower profit margins. Embracing these alternatives requires a collective commitment to sustainability over short-term financial gains.
Numerous research studies, both local and global, confirm that the primary resistance to plastic bag bans comes from the supply side, which has the resources to oppose such measures through various means. This is particularly evident in Pakistan, where plastic manufacturers frequently challenge bans in court when imposed by authorised entities.
In developing African countries, the failure to enforce plastic bag bans is largely attributed to plastic manufacturers, who are deeply entrenched in political and administrative systems. In Pakistan, the documented plastic bag manufacturing sector accounts for only 30 per cent of the market share, while the remaining 70pc is untraceable, potentially consisting of black-market operations, undocumented production, or illegal activities by documented manufacturers.
However, there is no verified data available to confirm the market share distribution of the plastic bag industry in Pakistan. This lack of reliable information creates ambiguity regarding who is manufacturing what within the country’s plastic industry.
If John Maynard Keynes were alive today, even he might struggle to determine who bears greater responsibility for the failure to ban plastic bags in Pakistan.
Supply-side economics faces pressures that discourage a shift to eco-friendly alternatives, often citing higher costs but primarily driven by lower profit margins. On the demand side, consumers, though not fully aware of the harms of plastic bags, have little choice but to use the convenient options available in the market.
If plastic bags are cheap, consumers will buy them readily; if they are expensive, consumers will use them more cautiously and for longer periods. It is misguided to blame the demand-side economy under the pretext that supply will persist as long as demand exists. Instead, the perspective should be reversed: if the supply of plastic bags is banned, demand will naturally shift to the eco-friendly alternatives permitted to meet consumer needs.

Superintendent of Police (SP) SCIW Syed Saboor Agha told Dawn.com, “Eleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.”
The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti announced on X that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.
According to a first information report (FIR) — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — registered by the Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta’s Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.
SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan’s Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.
“The victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,” the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.
Speaking to Dawn.com, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, “Owing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.”
Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‘immoral relationship’ (locally termed ‘Karo Kari’) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.
“The murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,” it added.
According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 302 (murder), 149 (unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 147 (rioting) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it “barbaric” and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called the suspects “beasts”, saying that they deserved no concessions. “I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).  “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a post on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”
He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also condemned the murder in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.
“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.
“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”
The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.
Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.
“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.
“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”
She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-21 07:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/19140100623a26e.jpg?r=140117' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924375/zer-zabar-pesh-the-case-for-teaching-diacritics-to-improve-urdu-reading' target='_blank'><strong>Zer, zabar, pesh: The case for teaching diacritics to improve Urdu reading</strong></a><br><p>It is 2pm, and a seven-year-old boy sits in an after-school Urdu remedial class, his fingers tracing the unfamiliar curves of the words before him. The sentence on the page seems simple enough: “Yeh Bano aur Mani kay nana hain.” He takes a breath and tries:
“Yeh Banoo aur Mani…”
The teacher gently corrects him. “Yeh Bano aur Mani…”
He pauses, puzzled. Why did the Urdu letter wow in Bano sound like “o” in go? He gathers his confidence and moves to the next line:
“Nana bazaar say aro laye hain.”
This time, he applies the same rule, reading aroo as aro, just like Bano. The teacher shakes her head. “It’s aroo.”
Confusion deepens in his eyes. Why did the same letter wow sound like an “o” in Bano but an “oo” (as in moon) in aroo? His teacher hesitates, offering a response that countless Urdu learners have heard before:
“That’s just how it is.”
The invisible barrier in Urdu literacy
This scene unfolds in classrooms across Pakistan every day. The struggle isn’t about intelligence or effort — it’s about a missing piece in how the Urdu language is taught. The confusion faced by children, like the one in the anecdote above, often arises from the lack of explicit and systematic phonics instruction.
Two distinct vowel sounds — for example, the “o” in go and the “oo” in moon — may remain indistinguishable to a young learner without the right approach to reading instruction. From a research lens, this aligns with findings from the Science of Reading, a body of research that emphasises the importance of phonemic awareness — the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the individual sounds (phonemes) within spoken words — and phonics as foundational for reading skills. Just as evidence-based methods are now informing and transforming early literacy in English, so too should they guide Urdu reading instruction.
While the core factors influencing reading skill development are generally similar across alphabetic languages, their impact can vary significantly depending on how closely the letters in a language correspond to their sounds. In languages with transparent orthographies (the rules and conventions of how a language is written, including spelling, punctuation, capitalisation, and the use of symbols), like Finnish or Spanish, the connection is direct and predictable.
 
 

Urdu, by contrast, presents a deeper orthographic challenge: letters and sounds do not consistently align, making decoding more cognitively demanding for early readers. Leading reading researchers such as Linnea Ehri or David Kilpatrick have noted that deep orthographies place an added burden on working memory and phonological processing, requiring instruction that goes beyond rote memory or guessing strategies.
Yet, Urdu instruction continues to overlook the foundational principles that make reading more accessible in complex writing systems.
What makes Urdu harder to read than it should be
Urdu is a complex and rich language, with 44 consonants, eight long oral vowels, seven long nasal vowels, three short vowels, and numerous diphthongs. While consonant sounds are usually taught through consistent sound-symbol cues and familiar examples — a practice that supports phonetic decoding — vowels are often left by the wayside, with far less systematic instruction.
In most Urdu curricula and published textbooks, only three long vowel sounds — like the “aa” in baat, the “o” in dost, and the “ee” in cheez — are introduced in the early stages. Few teaching materials or classroom practices introduce the remaining 15 or so vowel sounds later, and by that time, many students have already adapted to reading Urdu through contextual guessing rather than phonetic decoding — a practice that weakens their long-term literacy skills.
This makes the need for explicit phonics instruction in Urdu even more critical, particularly in teaching diacritic (a sign indicating a difference in pronunciation) vowel sounds. Urdu’s script includes diacritics, known as zabar ( َ), zer ( ِ), and pesh ( ُ), to represent short vowels. However, in most printed texts and early reading materials, these vowel markers are often omitted. Without systematic instruction in recognising and applying diacritics, children are left to guess at the correct pronunciation.
According to Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), over 55 per cent of Grade 5 students in rural areas cannot read a Grade 2 level Urdu text in Pakistan. Furthermore, over 40pc of Grade 3 students cannot even identify individual letters. These figures point towards a systemic issue in the teaching of language which is rooted not in student ability but rather in instructional design.
 
 

Taking the earlier anecdote into consideration, the letter “و” in Urdu can represent multiple vowel and consonant sounds. In the word Bano (بانو), it sounds like the “o” in go. In aroo (آرو), it shifts to the “oo” in too. Yet when it appears at the beginning of a word like vehshat (وحشت), it takes on the consonant sound — the “w” in wall.
For young readers trying to apply letter-sound patterns, these inconsistencies can be frustratingly difficult to navigate. This example is just one among many. Without a strong phonics foundation, students are left to guess at and memorise words, hindering their confidence and fluency. A structured approach to phonics, tailored to Urdu’s unique characteristics, can empower children to decode with greater ease and understanding.
Comparison with Arabic and why Urdu needs its own approach
Interestingly, Arabic was originally written without diacritics to continue the oral traditions of interpreting words through context. However, as Islam spread across the Arabian Peninsula and the need for preserving the exact pronunciation of the Quran surfaced, the diacritics were brought into religious and formal texts.
Since Urdu did not have the same religious impetus, it continued omitting the diacritics for most general texts. Some educators argue that omitting diacritics encourages contextual reading or reflects natural adult reading habits. This assumption fails to account for the cognitive demands placed on early readers who lack sufficient phonemic mastery to rely on context. For beginning readers, especially in early years or in multilingual environments, these omissions become cognitive roadblocks rather than bridges.
Arabic, having a morphological structure strongly based in root words, can afford to skip diacritics and still allow readers to use morphology to guess the correct pronunciation. Arabic readers can often infer meaning from familiar roots even without vowels, but Urdu readers do not have this advantage, as noted by linguistic experts.
Urdu’s reliance on phonetic differences for meaning means that even small vowel changes can drastically alter a word’s interpretation. The word ملی (mili — met) vs ملی (milli — national) are hard to differentiate without the diacritic tashdeed which signals gemination of the consonant ‘l’ to create meaning. Phonics instruction that highlights these differences is essential for building accuracy and comprehension.
Beyond the absence of diacritic instruction, Urdu readers face additional challenges that compound reading difficulties. These challenges are rooted in the script itself, its positional letter forms, and the limitations of digital text rendering. Unlike Latin scripts, many Urdu letters change their shapes depending on their position within a word (beginning, middle, or end).
For example, ب (be), ت (te), and ث (se) have similar forms that can confuse young readers. Without systematic exposure to these variations, children struggle to recognise words accurately. Additionally, Urdu’s traditional Nastaliq script is ornate and highly cursive. Script analysis points out that while this adds to its aesthetic appeal, it complicates decoding for young readers. Letters flow into one another, creating intricate, variable shapes. The lack of standardised digital fonts further exacerbates this challenge, with broken or incomplete text making learning even harder.
 
 

It is widely recognised that many digital platforms offer poor Urdu text rendering. Unlike Arabic and Persian, which benefit from extensive digital font support, Urdu often faces incomplete ligatures and missing diacritics, making reading on screens even more difficult. Addressing these challenges through thoughtful script design, technological improvements, and classroom adaptations can complement phonics instruction. A comprehensive approach to Urdu literacy would ensure that young readers have the support they need to develop confidence and proficiency.
A way forward — teaching for transparency
Although the problems are many, some solutions are still within reach. A slight shift in teaching practices, and a more supportive educational ecosystem can add much to the teaching of Urdu as a language. Textbook revisions, child-friendly fonts, and engaging children’s literature for all age groups are essential.
Most urgent is the need to embed phonics and diacritic-based reading strategies into teacher preparation programs and national curricula. Pre-service and in-service teacher training modules must include structured literacy approaches tailored to Urdu’s orthography. Without teacher capacity, reforms at the textbook level may not translate into classroom practice.
Urdu’s classification as a deep orthography is primarily due to its frequent use of ‘unvowelised’ text. However, preliminary research in this area suggests that when vowel sounds are systematically taught through phonics, Urdu’s reading challenges can be significantly reduced. By using diacritics consistently during early instruction, Urdu effectively becomes a shallow orthography — one where the connection between letters and sounds is more transparent.
This shift makes Urdu more accessible not only for young learners but also for individuals with dyslexia, non-native speakers, and those learning Urdu as a second language. Just as phonics has proven effective in teaching English and other alphabetic languages, the systematic teaching of diacritics can bridge the gap in Urdu literacy.
It is 2pm again, but this time, the boy is eagerly flipping through his favourite Urdu storybook. The same unfamiliar curves that once puzzled him now feel like old friends. With each sentence he reads, his confidence grows — because this time, he knows why ‘بانو’ sounds like Bano and ‘آرو’ like aroo. This transformation is what a robust phonics-based Urdu instruction can achieve.
Every child deserves that moment of joy in reading, and with thoughtful reforms in Urdu instruction, countless others will experience it too. For this to happen, collaboration is needed across textbook boards, teacher training institutes, software developers, and education ministries. A national phonics framework for Urdu — especially one that incorporates diacritics — can serve as a powerful equaliser in literacy instruction, particularly for underserved and multilingual learners.</p><small>2025-07-21 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2111452486d9469.jpg?r=114743' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925566/balancing-recovery-and-price-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Balancing recovery and price stability</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s economy is at a critical crossroads. In mid-July 2025, the government raised retail fuel prices sharply — petrol by Rs5.36 and diesel by Rs11.37 per litre — adding to already-rising inflationary pressures.
Petrol and diesel fuel most transportation and food-supply chains, and higher fuel costs quickly cascade into broader price rises. In sum, the recent fuel price shock is a classic cost-push inflation hit to Pakistani households.
These hikes come amid volatile global oil markets due to Middle Eastern conflicts and a weak rupee, compounding the inflation impact. Notably, Pakistan applies heavy taxes on fuel: almost Rs98 per litre is collected in levies. These petroleum levies raised Rs1.16 trillion in FY24, with a budget target of Rs1.47tr in FY25. In short, fuel is both a driver of inflation and a major fiscal revenue source.
As of late, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been easing policy aggressively to support growth but now likely faces a trade-off between stimulating activity and curbing inflation. Since mid-2024 the SBP slashed its key rate from 22 per cent to just 11pc.

Monetary easing and liquidity expansion have likely supported growth indicators, but they may create a risk of renewed inflation if not reined in

This rapid easing helped revive credit and investment, but it also increased the money supply. In early 2025, with headline inflation at historic lows (around 0.3pc in April 2025), the SBP even paused its cuts in March 2025, citing emerging price risks. By mid-June 2025 the SBP held the rate at 11pc, noting that global oil and commodity volatility and Middle East tensions posed upside risks to inflation.
After a period of low inflation, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) near 0–3pc in early 2025, forecasts expected inflation to drift up. The May 2025 CPI was 3.5pc year-on-year, still low by Pakistan’s standards, but it seems that factors like rising energy prices and currency pass-through could push it higher later in the year.
The SBP’s Monetary Policy Committee projected inflation returning to the 5–7pc target range by the end of FY26, but noted significant uncertainty. Recent SBP statements emphasise caution. The June 2025 hold was justified by risks of volatile inflation from ongoing conflicts and commodity swings.
Even if headline inflation is low now, persistent core and food inflation pressures call for a prudent stance. The SBP is likely to pause further rate cuts and may even reverse some easing if inflation heads up. Any visible jump in CPI numbers in the coming months — for example, due to these fuel hikes — will sharply limit the SBP’s room to manoeuvre, especially under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) conditionalities.
On the external front, record remittances have bolstered Pakistan’s foreign earnings, but the rupee has nonetheless weakened. Worker remittances hit an all-time high of $38.3 billion in FY25, up 26.6pc from $30.3bn in FY24. These inflows — driven largely by earnings from the Gulf, the UK, and the US — helped nearly balance the trade deficit and kept the current account modestly positive.
However, the Pakistani rupee is still sliding. In early July 2025 the interbank rate was around Rs284–285 to a dollar and about Rs287–288 in the open market, meaning the rupee trades above 280 per dollar much of the time. This depreciation partly reflects deliberate SBP policy.
According to the SBP, it bought over $8bn from the domestic market in FY25, intervening mainly in late FY25, supported by the remittance surge. This built gross reserves to roughly $14.5bn by the end of June 2025, from lows of around $11–12bn earlier; a 39-month high. Traders note the SBP also tightened dollar supply by limiting importers’ foreign exchange access, especially in Q4FY25.
All else equal, draining dollars and boosting reserves tend to weaken the rupee, because imports must now compete for fewer available foreign exchange resources. A weaker rupee immediately raises the rupee cost of dollar-priced imports. Analysts emphasise that this cost-push effect is already feeding inflation: a rupee slide from around Rs230–280 per dollar over two years has dramatically raised landed costs for fuel, medicines, industrial inputs, and food. Fuel is particularly sensitive, as Pakistan imports around 80pc of its oil.
A rise in the dollar rate translates very quickly into higher fuel prices at the pump, which then cascades into higher transport and food costs. In sum, the cumulative effect of currency depreciation is imported inflation. By June 2025, food inflation was already partly due to such pass-through.
Despite heavy imports, strong remittances roughly kept the current account nearly balanced in FY25. The SBP even achieved a small surplus through April 2025, aided by a $1bn IMF disbursement that lifted reserves. But the outlook is fragile: with domestic demand rising in FY26, imports may jump, and the current account could slip into deficit, exerting further pressure on the rupee.
In parallel with currency manoeuvres, the SBP has been injecting massive liquidity into the banking system. Three large Open Market Operations (OMOs) in June–July 2025 stand out. These injections responded to seasonal and structural liquidity demands, such as Eid-related cash needs and lags in external inflows.
However, such large injections flood the economy with rupees at a time when demand is already recovering. This massive rupee circulation from these OMOs only deepens inflationary pressures.
In practical terms, more liquidity combined with lower rates can fuel consumer spending and credit even as supply constraints due to fuel costs and low crop yields persist. With the policy rate at only 11pc, further injections risk stoking demand-side inflation.
In summary, monetary easing and liquidity expansion have likely supported growth indicators, but they may create a risk of renewed inflation if not reined in soon. Pakistan’s policymakers are balancing conflicting objectives. On one hand, supporting growth and shoring up reserves is vital. On the other hand, domestic price stability is under threat from the factors above.
A more coordinated and synced fiscal-monetary stance would help. On the monetary side, the SBP may need to pause any further rate cuts or even raise rates and withdraw liquidity if inflation accelerates. Tightening OMOs by selling government paper could soak up excess rupees. Such moves would signal inflation-fighting intent and help anchor expectations.
On the fiscal side, the government could moderate fiscal policy to avoid adding fuel to the fire. In practice, this could mean holding fuel taxes steady or reducing them temporarily to cushion households. For instance, when world oil prices fell in March 2025, the government froze fuel prices and used the savings to promise lower electricity tariffs. Continuing such relief measures, or at least not raising petroleum levies further, would relieve some inflationary pressure.
In conclusion, Pakistan’s economy stands at an inflationary crossroads. Rising fuel prices and a weakening rupee are putting new upward pressure on prices, just as policymakers have been loosening money and credit. Going forward, restoring credibility will require firm signals on inflation control — even as growth is nurtured. Transparent coordination, including possibly phasing in inflationary costs rather than abrupt hikes and judicious use of fiscal buffers, will be essential to navigate these challenges and stabilise both the economy and public confidence.n

Failing to meet the capitalisation requirements, Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari (KASB) Bank was sold to BankIslami for a price of Rs1,000. To this day, this transaction remains a topic of discussion among nerdy individuals and is surely an interesting nugget in the sector’s history.
While it may have been controversial, KASB was somewhat easy to manage, for it was among the few bad apples in an otherwise healthy industry. What should the regulator do when an entire sector — almost a trillion rupees of assets — is on the same path and refuses to show any signs of improvement?
This has been the predicament facing microfinance banking, which has recorded aggregate losses every year since 2019 and continued that ritual in Q1FY25 with a net income of negative Rs2.3 billion. As a result, its capital buffers have been depleting for 12 quarters straight and now stand at 1.2 per cent of total risk-weighted assets, well short of the 15pc required by the State Bank of Pakistan.
Unlike last time, this mess is not as simple to clean up, as the risks in microfinance are more systematic rather than company-specific. The big question is whether transferring the problem to another sponsor is really the solution. To paraphrase Professor Damodaran, why throw good money after bad?

Almost 141.5m total financial accounts have been opened in Pakistan between FY17 and FY24, of which two-thirds were branchless

Haaris Mahmood Chaudhary, President & Chief Executive of Mobilink Microfinance Bank, disagrees with this view and feels it requires a little more context. “Starting with Covid-19 and then the subsequent floods, the industry has indeed faced a number of serious shocks, which have put our customer profile, ie low-income communities and agriculture, in particular pressure. As a result, the banks have also felt the stress on the books,” he explains.
More importantly, Mr Chaudhary believes it’s not fair to assess microfinance purely from the lens of the bottom line. “Globally, the success of microfinance should be judged on the basis of how it affects social indicators. In Pakistan’s context, data shows that 56pc of all lending to agriculture has been through this industry. Similarly, almost half of all mortgages in the country are underwritten by microfinance. That’s despite our industry being not only much younger but also, as a whole, smaller than the top five banks individually.”
“We should focus on how the industry has contributed to our social indicators. Has poverty come down? How many women have we opened financial services to? Do people now have access to digital wallets?” he questions.
If that is our lens, Mr Chaudhary does have a point. According to a Data Darbar analysis, almost 141.5 million total financial accounts have been opened in Pakistan between FY17 and FY24. Of this, two-thirds were branchless, thanks to the two telco players that have historically leveraged their subsidiaries’ microfinance licences for deposits.

‘The biggest area of opportunity is opening up the inward remittances mandate for microfinance banks and bringing incentives on par with scheduled institutions’

Similarly, as far as advances are concerned, scheduled banking is absolutely no match for microfinance in terms of volumes, with the latter boasting 9.28m borrowers as of 2024, of which 1.7m were rural. In contrast, the former had 4.56m outstanding loans by the same period, despite having an asset base almost 55x as much.
Therein, Mobilink Microfinance Bank Limited (MMBL) is one of the industry leaders, accounting for more than 18pc of the total assets and net advances at Rs185.4bn and Rs74.9bn, respectively. Unlike its brethren in the license, it has somehow managed to tackle the sector’s troubles a lot better, as reflected by a capital adequacy ratio of 19.16pc by 2024. However, it hasn’t been immune from them and, for the first time in many years, recorded a red bottom line.
While the idea of social improvements is all mighty and good, sponsors are probably more concerned about monetary returns and would probably like to reap some dividends after years of investments. Can microfinance provide a pathway to that, notwithstanding the recent troubles? Mr Chaudhary seems to think so.
“Post Covid-19, we have seen two major shifts happen in the industry, ie the digitisation wave driven by wallets and the growth of nano loans. Though some banks have capitalised on these better than the rest, they present a general opportunity for anyone to generate sustainable, even if not mouthwatering, profit margins,” he says, adding, “Our own return on equity is 18pc, which is very reasonable.”
“However, for this to happen, the industry needs to improve its risk management and profiling practices,” he cautions. While the playbook for reform may be obvious, most of the existing sponsors haven’t shown a willingness to make the required investments in technology, systems and distribution and therefore continue to get dragged down further in the mess. No wonder then that the regulator is on the lookout to find new promoters and lately has pulled off the sale of Finca and Advans to Pakistani and Egyptian fintechs, Abhi (in partnership with TPL) and MNT Halan, respectively.
In all likelihood, they would follow the same prescriptions that Mr Chaudhary identified. There’s no doubt about the potential of combining wallets with nano lending in generating good returns, but what does that say about the future of the more traditional microfinance? Despite doing better on those fronts, MMBL continues to grow its branches, which reached 113. One reason is probably the wide gulf between the average deposit balances of a brick-and-mortar customer versus digital. To be clear, this is neither limited to microfinance banks nor Pakistan.
This reach of microfinance, be it through branches or branchless, can serve as a distribution arm for the scheduled banks. After all, the SBP’s latest financial inclusion strategy has set ambitious targets, which certainly won’t be achieved if the big boys of Chundrigarh Road maintain their status quo. For Mr Chaudhary, such partnerships are critical and can open up new monetisation opportunities.
“The biggest area of opportunity is opening up the inward remittances mandate for branchless and microfinance banks and bringing the incentives on par with scheduled institutions. This can significantly help the industry become a lot more stable,” he concludes.

KARACHI: Two teenagers were killed when a fast-moving water tanker hit their motorbike in the Defence area on Sunday afternoon.
Police said the incident sparked a violent reaction from the people who set the water tanker on fire.
DIG-South Syed Asad Raza said that the incident took place on the main Korangi Road near Kalapul at 3:30pm.
He said that three cousins were riding a motorcycle when the tanker hit their two-wheelers and ran them over.
They were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in a rickshaw where doctors pronounced two of them dead on arrival. The third one remained safe.
The police identified the deceased as Ayan Afzal Shah, 15, and Tauseef Sohail Shah, 13.
 
 

The tanker driver attempted to flee but other motorcyclists chased him and intercepted the vehicle. However, the driver abandoned the tanker and escaped from the scene, the police said, adding that the enraged people set the heavy vehicle on fire.
The DIG said that some persons who allegedly took part in setting the tanker on fire were detained.
Defence SHO Hukam Dad said the police approached the tanker owner who promised to hand over the driver responsible for the fatal accident to the police.
Later, the bodies were shifted to the residence of the deceased in Korangi’s Bilal Colony for burial after completion of medico-legal formalities at the JPMC.

Hyderabad received a second brief spell of monsoon rains in early hours of Sunday causing flooding of most major arteries. The rain started at around 6:15am and continued till 6:40am.
According to meteorological office, 18.6mm and 21.8mm of rainfall was recorded at its airport and city observatories, respectively.
The busy areas like Cloth Market, Fatima Jinnah Road, Makki Shah, Railway Station, low-lying lanes of Qasimabad, Wahdat Colony, Hussainabad and Latifabad were inundated. Most areas within the Hyderabad city were hit by drainage issue because of choked storm water drains that have not been de-silted for long. As many as 55 feeders of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) tripped amid the rain on Sunday, a spokesman for the utility said. These feeders were gradually re-energised, he added.

Two women, teenage boy electrocuted; seven-year-old drowns in pond

Most parts of Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts received several heavy and light spells of rain on Saturday night and Sunday.
Officials at the local Met office told Dawn that Larkana received 93.5mm and Mohenjo Daro 86mm of rain.
Two women, Razia Mugheri, 40, a resident of Yar Mohammed Colony, and Kaveeta Chachar, 22, a resident of Islam Chachar village, were electrocuted during rainfall.
They received fatal electrical shock while trying to switch on the water motor at their respective homes.
Sukkur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, and Khairpur districts of upper Sindh also received several spells of moderate rain that had started on late Saturday and continued till Sunday evening.
A 13-year-old boy, Imdad Ali Sarki, was electrocuted when he touched an electricity pole outside his home in the Garhi Sabayo area of Jacobabad. The area falls within the limits of the Saddar police station.
His family members rushed him to the Jacobabad Civil Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
Two young brothers, Rashid Ali and Abu Bakar, belonging to the Khoso tribe, drowned while bathing in a canal along Khuda Bakhsh Noorani village in Thull taluka of Jacobabad district.
A hectic search was mounted by their family after they went missing. Finally, their bodies were seen floating in the canal.
Separately, a seven-year-old boy, Misbah, drowned in a pond of rainwater while playing outside his home in the city.
Strong winds sweeping the entire upper Sindh region before and during the rainfall caused hours-long power outages and badly disrupted telecommunication network across the region.
The rains also caused flooding in urban and rural areas creating deep ponds of rainwater and sewage blocking people’s access to their homes as well as vital installations such as railway stations, bust stands, hospitals and workplaces. Drainage system in all cities and towns turned dysfunctional.
The roof of a vegetable shop owned by the Khairpur municipality and allotted to a tenant collapsed during the rainfall. No one was injured in the incident.
Jacobabad received a brief spell of downpour at about 3pm on Sunday.
Mirpurkhas district and its outskirts received intermittent showers leading to inundation of highway, main roads, streets and low-lying areas on Sunday.
Rainwater remained accumulated as the municipality failed to make any arrangement for draining it out.
In some low-lying areas, knee-deep water mixed with sewage was witnessed. The areas worst-hit by flooding and foul smell included Lalchandabad, Toorabad, Dholanabad, M.A. Jinnah Road, Station Road, Hameed Pura Colony, Hirabad, Nai Para, Bhansinghabad, Ismail Shah graveyard and colony, Panhwer Colony, Rajar Colony and Pak Colony.
Most areas of Mirpurkhas district also experienced prolonged power outages during the rainfall.

Passengers jumped overboard with lifejackets after the fire broke out on Sunday at the stern of the KM Barcelona 5, as it sailed to Manado, according to the Indonesian coast guard.
A video released by the Manado rescue agency showed a coast guard vessel spraying water on the ferry, which was emitting black smoke.
Indonesian authorities previously reported five people died in the accident, but later revised the death toll to three.
“Until now, the joint rescue team is still conducting the search and rescue operation because the data is still developing,” Manado rescue agency head George Leo Mercy Randang told AFP on Monday.
“Our post is still open 24 hours a day, in case families want to report about their missing relative.” At least 568 people were rescued from the ferry and water while three others were found dead, the national search and rescue agency said in a statement Monday.
 
 

The ferry’s log had only registered 280 passengers and 15 crew on board.
Local media reported that the ship had a capacity for 600 people.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in the Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards or bad weather.
Sunday’s fire came just weeks after another ferry sank off the popular resort island of Bali due to bad weather, killing at least 19 people.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra Island.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211007267323854.png?r=100801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925607/alaska-airlines-requests-grounding-of-fleet-citing-it-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Alaska Airlines requests grounding of fleet citing ‘IT outage’</strong></a><br><p>Alaska Airlines has requested a ground stop for all its mainline aircraft according to an advisory notice by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the company citing an “IT outage.”

The FAA status page showed all destinations being impacted by the ground stop of Alaska’s mainline aircraft.
It did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comment.
The incident comes more than a year after a door plug section of a newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight between Portland, Oregon and Ontario, California in January last year.
The 171 passengers and six crew members survived the rapid decompression, but the incident focused minds at the FAA, which grounded many Boeing 737-9 aircraft operated by US airlines.
Last month, US investigators said Boeing’s failure to provide adequate training to manufacturing staff was a driving factor in the near-catastrophic Alaska Airlines mid-flight blowout.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21094310f771e53.jpg?r=094321' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925571/mengal-barred-from-travelling-abroad-offloaded-from-plane' target='_blank'><strong>Mengal barred from travelling abroad, offloaded from plane</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal was barred from travelling abroad and offloaded on Sunday from a Dubai-bound plane at Quetta airport.
Immigration officials at the Quetta airport info­rmed Mr Mengal that his name has been placed in the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL), a temporary travel ban to stop people from going abroad.
After the incident, Mr Mengal issued a statement on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), saying he has been stopped from travelling abroad without prior notice or any explanation.
“Today I was stopped at Quetta Airport from flying to Dubai. Airport officials informed me that my name is on the PNIL. This decision was made without my knowledge and without any clear reason,” Mr Mengal wrote on X.
 






A BNP spokesperson condemned the move, calling it another example of political victimisation and an attack on democratic values.
The spokesman demanded that Mr Mengal’s name be immediately removed from the list and those responsible for the decision be held accountable.
No official reason has been given by the government so far for placing Mr Mengal’s name on PNIL.
BNP’s central information secretary, Agha Hassan Baloch, also condemned the travel restriction placed on the BNP president and termed the government move unconstitutional and politically motivated.
 
 

He said the action of the government was a clear violation of Mr Mengal’s constitutional right to freedom of movement and an attempt to suppress fundamental human rights.
“We demand an immediate explanation from authorities concerned. Such repressive tactics are unacceptable in a democratic setup. Political dissent and public representation must not be criminalised,” Mr Hassan said.
Sana Baloch, another BNP leader, said: “We demand a prompt explanation from authorities concerned and immediate removal of Sardar Akhtar Mengal’s name from the PNIL. These authoritarian measures are unacceptable. Targeting political opposition and elected representatives is incompatible with constitutional democracy.”

The report ‘Pakistan Energy Efficiency: Industrial Energy Efficiency and Decarbonisation (EE&D)’, outlines strategies, targeting the cement, steel, fertiliser, textile, and paper and pulp industries.
These plans aim to advance Pakistan’s energy conservation objectives and shape policy discussions between the WB Group and the government.
The strategies are based on a comprehensive study the bank conducted from mid-2022 to 2023.
While some manufacturers have already implemented EE&D technologies, the report identified major information, policy and financial barriers hindering wider adoption.
“Many companies in Pakistan believe that investments in energy efficiency raise production costs and erode competitiveness,” the report noted. “This wariness substantially increases when the term ‘decarbonisation’ is used instead of ‘energy efficiency’.”
Textile
In the textile industry, the dyeing and finishing stages are the most energy-intensive, offering the greatest potential for EE&D gains.
It can be achieved through multiple pathways such as energy efficiency and conservation interventions, fuel switching, electrification of heat, process improvement, implementing circularity and deploying innovative technologies.
According to the bank, the existing technologies can save 50pc to 60pc energy and cut emission by up to 13pc.
Cement, fertiliser
Several Pakistani cement plants have already implemented EE&D interventions, including installing waste heat recovery systems and adopting alternative energy sources.
The WB estimates that the industry can further reduce its emissions impact by 3pc to 35pc and decrease energy consumption by 6pc to 20pc by adopting existing and emerging technologies.
The fertiliser sector’s heavy reliance on natural gas makes it vulnerable to price volatility.
The report suggests that government policies providing a fixed and considerably low gas price for fertiliser manufacturers discourage investments in energy efficiency.
Steel, paper and pulp
All steel in Pakistan is produced from scrap metal in an electric induction furnace, the more efficient of the two applicable technologies.
The World Bank suggests that additional investments could reduce emissions from steel plants by 5pc to 12pc and lower energy consumption by 8pc to 10pc.
A better understanding of the financial impacts of decarbonisation could prompt more interest in these investments, the report added.
Paper and pulp industry has seen a compound annual growth rate of 7.2pc over the past five years. While some plants have invested in efficiency measures, the sector can further improve by adopting new technologies.

His reason for labelling them fictitious was because they are exchanged in markets, like any other commodity, even though their existence and creation is unlike all others, which are usually produced to be consumed.
Money is a creation of governments to facilitate exchange and has no actual use value beyond it. Outside of the most extreme examples, humans do not give birth to children to create more labourers. And no human creates nature, yet fields, forests, mountains, mines and even the seas are commodified through legal wizardry and bought and sold freely.
While much can be said about the complete degradation of human life to merely its worth as labour, and the corrosive role of money in shaping all aspects of life stripped of moral and ethical dimensions, it is the third fictitious commodity that weighs heavy on Pakistani lives today.
 
 

By latest estimates, over 100 people have died in monsoon rainfall incidents across the country these past few weeks. The tail-end of last week was marked by extreme flooding and devastation across the Potohar plateau, with towns and villages in Chakwal and Rawalpindi heavily impacted by several days of continuous rain.
As others point out, there are two aspects to this ecological carnage. One is the general impact of climate change across the world. Extreme weather events are now far more common. The amount of rainfall previously witnessed across one season now routinely takes place in a few days. While cloud bursts and rainfall-induced flooding was particularly devastating in 2022 in Sindh and Balochistan, each successive year has also seen significant loss of life and property in all four provinces.
Pakistani state authorities are quick to highlight the climate change aspect of monsoon catastrophes. This focus serves to underscore the country’s vulnerability to climate change, which is far higher than its historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and helps make its case for greater climate financing for mitigation and adaptation purposes.
Yet, this narrow focus also detracts from the other, and arguably more important, aspect of ecological carnage: the way in which nature is used and regulated in the country; or, in other words, the political economy and governance-based causes of climatic vulnerability.

It is during the monsoon months that the existential impact of real estate fever becomes truly apparent.

Anyone possessing an even cursory familiarity with Pakistani cities and towns will know how unchecked and unfettered urban expansion has dramatically altered the rural-urban frontier.
In the plains of Punjab, this has come at the cost of farmland and rural commons, via their conversion into low-density, plot-based housing schemes for speculative capital. Originating in the hinterlands of bigger cities like Karachi, Lahore and Faisal­abad, this rapid conversion is now commonplace acr­­oss second- and third-tier cities across the country.
 
 

The outcomes of this conversion are apparent for all residents. These cities have become dependent on privatised modes of transport, contributing to greater air pollution. The concretisation of large tracts of agricultural land has both destabilised food supply chains and raised average ground temperatures during the summer months. Even the electricity grid is afflicted by the development of low-rise, single-family dwellings which remain highly energy-inefficient and contribute to transmission losses.
But it is during the monsoon months that the existential impact of real estate fever becomes truly apparent. Paved surfaces become inadvertent reservoirs for rainwater, where in the past unpaved ground would have absorbed it. The underpasses and flyovers constructed to ease vehicular flows (and improve real estate values) block the natural flow of water, rendering the few remaining stormwater drains redundant.
These trends are highly visible in Lahore, where such real estate development remained the norm for decades, but they are now afflicting other cities as well. In the absence of meaningful regulation of urban growth that keeps water drainage and climatic factors in mind, images of submerged towns will become even more commonplace across the country.
This year, such images came in droves from the Potohar plateau, an area where the commodification of nature is of an even more extreme form. Rather than just eating into agricultural land, real estate developers in Rawalpindi and adjoining districts have built across seasonal river paths and floodplains, cut open and flattened hills, blocked natural drainage channels, and radically altered the local topography. It come as no surprise, then, that the most visceral impact of rainfall this past week was felt in areas that were built on the floodplain and river path of the seasonal Soan river.
DHAs and Bahria Towns remain the primary ‘protagonists’ of this transformation, enabled by their capture of laws and bullying of municipal authorities, but many others now draw inspiration from them.
 
 

Merely travelling towards Islamabad via the Motorway shows how drastically the landscape stands changed, with under-construction housing developments dotting the landscape all the way to the Salt Range. They are solely being built for the purpose of feeding the insatiable appetite of speculators, investors and profiteers.
In his writings, Polanyi was clear that the unchecked exploitation of human labour would eventually produce a ‘double-movement’. Humans would fight back against their immiseration and seek a better bargain to reassert their humanity in a world that treated them merely as labour. This bargain eventually took the shape of mid-20th-century social democracy, which offered better labour protections and greater welfare for workers.
In the same vein, climate change and ecological catastrophe can be seen as nature’s double movement against its immiseration and exploitation at the hands of capitalist development.
The stark reality, though, is that while overworked labourers can be placated by being offered better wages, past destruction to our natural landscape cannot be reversed. At best, we can hope that immediate course correction limits the extent of nature’s revenge in the future.

Expectations that Trump’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month would pave the way for a truce have not materialised. There was no breakthrough despite two meetings between them at the White House.
This has left Israel free to escalate its military onslaught on Gaza even as it continues negotiations with Hamas. Talks in Doha are aimed at reaching agreement on a 60-day ceasefire, exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, inflow of humanitarian assistance and the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. This is supposed to lead to negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, which Netanyahu still opposes.
The Doha talks are bogged down principally on Israel’s demand to retain control of large parts of the Strip as ‘occupation zones’. This is obviously unacceptable to Hamas, which also wants guarantees that any ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the war.
As disagreements persist over the withdrawal map, the Israeli military offensive continues to claim more Palestinian lives, aid remains sharply limited with Israel using starvation as a weapon and conducting daily bombings of schools serving as shelters, refugee camps, residential areas and hospitals. Over 58,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s war began in October 2023.
 
 

Among Israel’s most abhorrent acts is its soldiers shooting and killing hapless, starving Palestinians standing in line for food at controversial military-run aid distribution sites. Almost 900 people have been killed while seeking aid so far, many of them children. Israeli soldiers have told an Israeli newspaper that they are ordered to deliberately shoot at unarmed Palestinians waiting at aid hubs. Israeli forces have also attacked and killed children trying to get water at collection points as a water crisis takes hold in addition to the spread of famine.

Israel’s forced displacement plan will create concentration camps and depopulate Gaza.

To cap these crimes, Israel has unfolded a forced displacement plan to set up what will be a concentration camp in southern Gaza. An announcement by its defence ministry said most of Gaza’s population will be forced into a small and destroyed part of the Strip to be controlled and sealed by the Israeli military.
Demolition operations in Rafah that have levelled large areas show preparations are underway to implement this plan. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has declared that within 60 days of any ceasefire agreement, 600,000 Palestinians will be ‘relocated’ to Rafah to what he disingenuously called a “humanitarian city”. Eventually, Gaza’s over two million population will be transferred and confined to the ruins of this southern city. The city would be ‘locked’ with Palestinians not allowed to leave the area except if they “voluntarily migrated” from Gaza to other countries. Emigration, Katz asserted, would be encouraged as part of this plan.
 
 

The proposed plan has been widely denounced as “an organised act of genocide” and ethnic cleansing aimed at depopulating the Strip. It has outraged Gaza’s citizens and been condemned by the UN, members of the international community, human rights groups and several prominent Israelis including former prime ministers.
All of them see this as a dangerous scheme leading to the establishment of mass concentration camps for internment and expulsion. The Israeli move would clearly be a violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as a crime against humanity. Hamas has firmly opposed the plan and described it as the latest obstacle to the Doha talks.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNWRA), has slammed the move and said this will “create massive concentration camps at the border with Egypt for the Palestinians, displaced over and over across generations”. It would, he said, “deprive Palestinians of any prospects of a better future in their homeland”.
Two former Israeli prime ministers have also assailed the plan. Ehud Olmert said the project amounted to interning Palestinians into a concentration camp, and if Palestinians are deported to the so-called ‘humanitarian city’ it would be part of an “ethnic cleansing” operation. Former prime minister Yair Lapid also criticised the plan, pointing out that if “exiting it is prohibited, then it is a concentration camp”.
Meanwhile, a hard-hitting analysis in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz titled ‘Concentration camp, illegal orders and war crimes: Israel’s madmen have a grim new plan’ assesses the plan and its ramifications and leaves no doubt it would constitute a war crime. It also cites an open letter written to Katz by 16 top Israeli scholars of international law presenting legal arguments to establish that the plan represents a “manifestly illegal order” which soldiers should refuse to obey. The letter also says “Executing this plan … would represent a list of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and under certain conditions … the crime of genocide”.
In their recent meeting and earlier ones too, Trump and Netanyahu have discussed the relocation of Gazans to neighbouring states. Both have publicly stated that they are discussing this with “surrounding countries”.
Their reference to this as ‘voluntary’ does nothing to obscure the forced nature of such an exodus. In fact, the Israeli plan seeks to implement Trump’s vision of emptying Gaza of Palestinians to ostensibly build a ‘Riviera of the Middle East’. Trump has continued to refer to Gaza as a real estate site. After his recent White House meeting, Netanyahu again attributed his plan to relocate Palestinians to what he called Trump’s “brilliant vision”. All this suggests that not only is the US on board with the Israelis on the plan but it may also be the prime mover.
The question then is what is the rest of the world, especially Arab and Muslim countries, going to do to thwart this insidious move. Resort to more words but no action? Surely it is time for them to shake off their passiveness, show some spine and take collective measures to prevent this from happening. Inaction is complicity. The implementation of the US-backed Israeli plan will not just plunge the Middle East into greater turmoil but it would also be a perfidy perpetrated on the Palestinians.

According to the NDMA, over 200 lives have already been lost since late June, and the country has experienced 80pc more rainfall than average. This is climate change in motion.
The recent River Swat tragedy, where tourists were swept away by a sudden surge of water, and the glacial floods submerging villages in Gilgit-Baltistan show clearly how global warming is reshaping our landscape and our vulnerabilities with it.
The loss is not just human or environmental. It is also economic. Every year, floods and climate-induced disasters wipe out crops, destroy infrastructure, displace communities and derail economic activity. These are costs we can ill afford. Our economic recovery is fragile, and yet, the billions spent on post-disaster relief and reconstruction remain a growing burden.
The fiscal cost of inaction, year after year, is far greater than what preventive infrastructure, climate-smart planning and resilience-building would require. Moreover, climate change should be viewed as a national security concern. Unpredictable monsoons, water scarcity, glacial melt and population displacement risk triggering social unrest over dwindling resources. The security establishment, quick to deploy personnel for rescue efforts, must also recognise that climate resilience is integral to long-term stability — as vital as any defence imperative.
 
 

Each disaster also reflects failed governance — at both the centre and the local level. Disaster management remains overly centralised, while municipal bodies and district administrations remain underfunded, disempowered and paralysed by red tape dysfunction. Climate adaptation can only succeed when local institutions have the autonomy, resources and capacity to act decisively. It is also a generational betrayal.
Each year of delay condemns future generations to greater hardship, fewer resources and a degraded environment. The political class must be held accountable not only for current failures but also for endangering the country’s long-term future and compromising its development trajectory.
What Pakistan needs is not just preparedness, but a climate-resilient economic vision that entails sustainability in agriculture, urban planning, water management and energy. The Living Indus Initiative must become more than a talking point. It should anchor a strategy linking glacier dynamics, river systems and urban planning in every province. Pakistan has every right to demand compensation under the Loss and Damage Fund.
But waiting for global payouts while lives are lost is an abdication of responsibility. To ensure accountability, the federal government should publish an annual disaster preparedness scorecard for each province, making transparent who has planned — and who has not. More rains are expected. Will Pakistan continue to pay in lives, livelihoods, and economic stability, or will it finally invest in survival?

“I will try to save them, starting right now,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social, linking to an article about the Afghans held in limbo.
The pledge comes despite Mr Trump’s broader immigration restrictions, as the Republican president suspended refugee resettlement after taking office in January, while his administration terminated temporary deportation protections for thousands of Afghans in the US in April.
The UAE, a close US security partner, agreed in 2021 to temporarily house several thousand Afghans evacuated from Kabul as the Taliban seized power during the final stages of the US military withdrawal.
The evacuees have remained there since.  The number of Afghans still detained in the Gulf remains unclear.

A ceasefire announced on Saturday appeared to be holding after earlier agreements failed to end fighting between Druze and the Bedouin that spiralled to draw in the Syrian government, the Israeli military and armed tribes from other parts of Syria.
Journalists on the outskirts of Sweida city reported hearing no clashes on Sunday morning, with government forces deployed in some locations in the province to enforce the truce and at least one humanitarian convoy headed for the Druze-majority city.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that since around midnight (2100 GMT Saturday), “Sweida has been experiencing a cautious calm”, adding government security forces had blocked roads leading to the province in order to prevent tribal fighters from going there.
 
 


UN agency says over 128,000 displaced; ceasefire appears to be holding after earlier arrangements failed to end fighting

The Britain-based Observatory gave an updated toll on Sunday of more than 1,000 killed since the violence erupted a week ago, including 336 Druze fighters and 298 civilians from the minority group, as well as 342 government security personnel and 21 Bedouin.
Witnesses, Druze factions and the Observatory have accused government forces of siding with the Bedouin and committing abuses, including summary executions when they entered Sweida days ago.
Totally calm
The interior ministry said overnight that Sweida city was “evacuated of all tribal fighters, and clashes within the city’s neighbourhoods were halted”.
The Observatory had said Druze fighters retook control of the city on Saturday evening.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Saturday announced a fresh ceasefire in Sweida and renewed a pledge to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities in the face of the latest sectarian violence since longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December.
A spokesman for Syria’s tribal and clan council told Al Jazeera late Saturday that fighters had left the city “in response to the call of the presidency and the terms of the agreement”.
Another medic inside Sweida said on Sunday that “the situation is totally calm… We aren’t hearing clashes.” “No medical or relief assistance has entered until now,” the medic added, requesting anonymity due to the security situation.
State news agency SANA published images showing medical aid being prepared near the health ministry in Damascus and quoted Health Minister Musab al-Ali as saying assistance would be delivered to Sweida’s main hospital, where bodies have piled up.
Inside the city, where around 150,000 people live, residents have been holed up in their homes without electricity and water, and food supplies have also been scarce.
The United Nations migration agency said more than 128,000 people in Sweida province have been displaced by the violence.
Brutal acts
US special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said on Sunday that the country stood at a “critical juncture”, adding that “peace and dialogue must prevail — and prevail now”.
“All factions must immediately lay down their arms, cease hostilities, and abandon cycles of tribal vengeance,” he wrote on X, saying “brutal acts by warring factions on the ground undermine the government’s authority and disrupt any semblance of order”.
 






Sharaa’s announcement on Saturday came hours after the United States said it had negotiated a ceasefire between Syria’s government and Israel, which had bombed government forces in both Sweida and Damascus earlier in the week.
Israel, which has its own Druze community, has said it was acting in defence of the group, as well as to enforce its demands for the total demilitarisation of Syria’s south.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday urged the Syrian government’s security forces to prevent militants from entering and “carrying out massacres” in the south, and called on Damascus to “bring to justice anyone guilty of atrocities including those in their own ranks”.

Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, “are in contact with Iran to schedule further talks for the coming week”, the source claimed.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported that Tehran had agreed to hold talks with the three European countries, citing an unnamed source. Consultations are ongoing regarding a date and location for the talks, it added.
“Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. That is why Germany, France and the United Kingdom are continuing to work intensively in the E3 format to find a sustainable and verifiable diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear programme,” the German source said.

Putin meets top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader

Israel and Western nations have long accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran has consistently denied.
Strikes derailed talks
On June 13, Israel launched a wave of surprise strikes on its regional nemesis, targeting key military and nuclear facilities. Nine days later, the US launched its own set of strikes against Iran’s nuclear programme, hitting the uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, in Qom province south of Tehran, as well as nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz.
 
 

Iran and the United States had held several rounds of nuclear negotiations through Omani mediators before Israel launched its 12-day war against Iran. However, US President Donald Trump’s decision to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities effectively ended the talks.
The E3 countries last met the Iranian representatives in Geneva on June 21, just one day before the US strikes.
Kremlin meeting
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a surprise meeting in the Kremlin with Ali Larijani, top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader on nuclear issues.
Mr Larijani “conveyed assessments of the escalating situation in the Middle East and around the Iranian nuclear programme”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the unannounced meeting.
Putin had expressed Russia’s “well-known positions on how to stabilise the situation in the region and on the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear programme”, he added.
Moscow has a cordial relationship with Iran’s clerical leadership and provides crucial backing for Tehran but did not swing forcefully behind its partner even after the US joined Israel’s bombing campaign.
Snapback mechanism
While Iran and six world powers struck a deal in 2015 called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which placed significant restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, but the United States during Trump’s first presidency walked away from it.
European countries, however, recently threatened to trigger the deal’s “snapback” mechanism, which allows the re-imposition of sanctions in the event of non-compliance by Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi after a call with his European counterparts said the Western allies had no grounds for reactivating sanctions. “If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they (have) absolutely no moral (or) legal grounds,” Araghchi said on X.
 






But the German source insisted, “Snapback remains an option for the E3 if no solution is reached over the summer.”
Last week, Iran made it clear that there would be no new nuclear talks with the United States if they were conditioned on Tehran abandoning its uranium enrichment activities.

• Health officials say hundreds of people could soon die due to starvation
CAIRO: At least 115 people seeking aid were killed by Israel while they waited for UN aid trucks in northern Gaza on Sunday, Gaza’s health ministry said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders for areas packed with displaced Gazans, some of whom began to leave.
The ministry said dozens of people were also wounded in the incident in northern Gaza, in one of the highest reported tolls among repeated recent cases in which aid seekers have been killed. Six other people were killed near another aid site in the south, it said.
In total, health authorities said 88 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes across Gaza on Sunday.
After Israel’s military dropped leaflets urging people to evacuate from neighbourhoods in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah, residents said Israeli planes struck three houses in the area.
 
 

Dozens of families began leaving their homes, carrying some of their belongings. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans have been sheltering in the Deir al-Balah area.
Starvation on the rise
Much of Gaza has been reduced to a wasteland during more than 21 months of war and there are fears of accelerating starvation.
Palestinian health officials said hundreds of people could soon die as hospitals were inundated with patients suffering from dizziness and exhaustion due to the scarcity of food and a collapse in aid deliveries.
“We warn that hundreds of people whose bodies have wasted away are at risk of imminent death due to hunger,” the Palestinian health ministry said.
The United Nations also said on Sunday that civilians were starving and needed an urgent influx of aid.
Residents said it was becoming impossible to find essential food such as flour. The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 children had died of malnutrition during the war, and 60,000 others were suffering from symptoms of malnutrition.
Later on Sunday, it said 18 people have died of hunger in the past 24 hours.
Food prices have increased well beyond what most of the population of more than two million can afford.
Several people said they either had one meal or no meal in the past 24 hours.
“As a father, I wake up in the early morning to look for food, for even a loaf of bread for my five children, but all in vain,” said Ziad, a nurse.
“People who didn’t die of bombs will die of hunger. We want an end to this war now, a truce, even for two months,” he said.
Others said they felt dizzy walking in the streets and that many fainted as they walked. Fathers leave tents to avoid questions by their children about what to eat.
UNRWA demands more aid
UNRWA, the UN refugee agency dedicated to Palestinians, demanded Israel allow more aid trucks into Gaza, saying it had enough food for the entire population for over three months which was not allowed in.
 






Some Palestinians suggested the move on Deir al-Balah might be an attempt to put pressure on Hamas to make more concessions in long-running ceasefire negotiations.
Israel and Hamas are engaged in indirect talks in Doha aimed at reaching a 60-day truce and Israeli prisoners’ deal, although there has been no sign of breakthrough.
Pope seeks end to ‘barbarity’ of Gaza war
Pope Leo XIV slammed the “barbarity” of the war in Gaza on Sunday and urged against the “indiscriminate use of force”, just days after a deadly strike by Israel’s military on a Catholic church.
“I once again ask for an immediate end to the barbarity of the war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict,” Leo said at the end of the Angelus prayer at Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer residence near Rome.

The pope, who spoke by telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the morning after Thursday’s strike, spoke of his “deep sorrow” for the attack on the Holy Family Church.
The church was sheltering around 600 displaced people, the majority of them children.

This will be the first cabinet-level meeting since President Trump’s unprecedented White House lunch with Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir. Such senior-level contacts had remained dormant since 2016, marking this as a significant diplomatic reset.
Mr Dar is arriving in New York on Sunday afternoon to participate in Pakistan’s high-level engagements under its current presidency of the UN Security Council (UNSC), before traveling to Washington for bilateral meetings.
In New York, he will chair an open debate on “Promoting international peace and security through multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes.”

Foreign minister due in New York today

He will also preside over the quarterly UNSC debate on the “Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” and lead a high-level briefing focused on enhanced cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. He will also attend a conference on “Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution.”
Still, the most consequential part of his visit remains the upcoming meeting with Secretary Rubio — signalling a resumption of strategic dialogue after years of limited contact.
Mr Dar’s visit follows Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s meeting with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington where they discussed a long-anticipated trade and tariff agreement.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb called the talks “very constructive” and emphasised that the bilateral relationship must go beyond trade. “We have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative,” he said.
“For the Pakistan-US relationship to move to the next level, investment is the key — and we believe areas like minerals, AI, and crypto could be real game changers,” the finance minister said before returning to Pakistan on Saturday.

• Seven police officials abducted in separate incidents
PESHAWAR/ QUETTA: Security forces killed 13 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations in Malakand and Kalat districts, the military said on Sunday.
Nine terrorists were eliminated and eight arrested in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, while four others were killed in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in separate statements.
The four-day intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Malakand was conducted in coordination with police, Levies, the Counter-Terrorism Dep­art­ment (CTD) and the district admi­nistration in Malakand district. The ISPR said the operation was launched after reports of the presence of militants linked to what the statement described as an “Indian proxy”.
The troops surrounded and effectively engaged the militants’ location and killed nine and arrested eight others after intense and multiple fire exchanges, the ISPR said, adding that two hideouts used by militants were also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered.
“Locals of the area appreciated the operation and expressed their full support to the state’s counterterrorism efforts,” the statement read.
It said that sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other militants in the area, as the security forces and law enforcement agencies, in step with the nation, were determined to wipe out the menace of militancy from the country.
In Kalat, four terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation conducted by security forces, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
The ISPR said the operation targeted the reported presence of militants associated with the Indian proxy group ‘Fitna al Hindustan’.
“During the conduct of the operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense exchange of fire, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.”
President, PM commend security forces
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday commended the security forces and Levies for eliminating “Khwarij terrorists” in the Malakand operation.
In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, he said the nation was united in its resolve to root out terrorism and vowed that “terrorists of Fitna al-Hindustan” would be brought to justice.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the army, police, Levies, CTD and district administration for the successful joint operation against “Fitna al-Khawarij terrorists” in Malakand.
“This successful operation against terrorists is a great example of coordination between different agencies,” he said. “The entire nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism.”
He expressed the government’s resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Woman killed in ‘drone strike’
In a separate development, a woman was killed and two others injured in a suspected quadcopter drone strike, while seven police personnel were allegedly abducted in two separate incidents in Upper South Waziristan district on Sunday.
According to local sources, the drone strike occurred in Malikshahi, a locality in the Zhawar area of Shaktoi tehsil. The attack killed a woman on the spot, while another woman and a young girl were injured and shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
The incident sparked panic among residents, who condemned the strike as a blatant violation of human rights. Locals called on authorities to take immediate notice and ensure justice for the victims.
The district administration confirmed the incident and expressed support for the affected family. However, District Police Officer (DPO) Arshad Khan said the department had “no idea” about the source or motive behind the attack.
 
 

No official statement was immediately issued regarding responsibility for the strike, further fuelling fear and speculation in the area.
Seven policemen abducted
Meanwhile, seven police officials, including a sub-inspector, were reportedly abducted in two separate incidents in Upper South Waziristan.
DPO Khan confirmed that three policemen from Ladha police station went missing during routine patrol duty near the Chalerai area of Makin tehsil. Communication with the team was abruptly lost and their whereabouts remain unknown.
In a second incident, four more officers, including a sub-inspector, went missing from the Shahoor area within the jurisdiction of the Sararogha police station. The incidents have raised serious concerns among law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the region.
DPO Khan said a comprehensive investigation had been launched to determine all possible angles. Joint efforts by police, security forces and intelligence agencies are underway to locate the missing personnel.
The incidents have increased tensions and anxiety among locals.
Residents have demanded a transparent inquiry and swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The law and order situation in the tribal districts, particularly Upper and Lower South Waziristan and North Waziristan, has deteriorated significantly over the past year. The region has witnessed a sharp increase in militant activity, including bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom and coordinated attacks on security forces and police.
 
 

The increasing frequency of such incidents has instilled widespread fear among citizens, who are urging the government and security institutions to take swift and effective measures to restore order and ensure the safety of citizens.

A notification issued to deans of all 10 MTIs has sought details about the number of civil servants, filled and vacant posts in their respective hospitals and colleges as per directives of competent authorities.
The one-page letter doesn’t provide further details but sources say that the issue of civil servants has been the bone of contention between health department and architects of Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act (MTIRA). The latter wanted to expel all civil servants from MTIs as they were government’s employees and did not come under MTIRA, they added.
However, health department has been dragging its feet on the issue because repatriation of all civil employees would create a big problem.

Architects of MTIRA want to send back such employees to health dept

“If all the civil servants are sent back to health department, it will create a surplus pool as most of them cannot be posted in the department,” sources said.
 
 

They said that there re were scores of faculty members including assistant, associate and professors in clinical and basic science departments in MTIs. They are actually civil servants and working in the institutions well before the imposition of MTIRA.
In case of transferring out those faculty members from MTIs, the department has no institution to post them there. Therefore, they will be placed in surplus pool.
“They include highly experience faculty members like surgeons, physicians and other academic staff, whose services couldn’t be required in other hospitals because they are fit only in teaching hospitals with medical and dental colleges which have now become MTIs,” said sources.
They said that civil servants were employed by health department but now the MTIs wanted to replace them with their own employees.
There are other types of servants, who are called institutional employees. They have been recruited after 2000 by their respective teaching hospitals. MTIs have been asking civil servants to leave their positions and go to health department but such directives issued from time to time have fallen on deaf ears because the department has no institution to accommodate them.
MTIs have also been facing problems with regard to promotion of civil servants. Before the imposition of new law, the department would promote officials to senior grades in the same institutions but now there is no grading system and most of the civil servants cannot be promoted.
Civil servants on their part complained that MTIs were abolishing their posts approved in budget which affected their promotions. Sources said that MTIs transferred out several civil servants to health department and recruited their own employees.
They said that MTIs had already transferred bulk of nursing staff and paramedics to health department. They have been posted elsewhere in the hospitals but the main issue is the posting of clinical and basic science faculty members, who, if transferred, will find no place, and as a result, not only MTIs will suffer but a surplus pool will be created.
“However, pressure from the framers of MTIRA continues to swell on the department due to which the directives have been issued to identify the number of civil servants along with filled and vacant position,” said sources. They said that it was meant to send back civil servants to health department and fill their positions with the employees to be hired under MTIRA.

As of Sunday night, six PTI nominees and five opposition picks were in the running in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the upper house of parliament. Late-night reports suggested that two more ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates pulled out of the race hours after the exit of Mohammad Waqas Orak­zai and Syed Irshad Hus­sain. Khurram Zee­shan was the only disgruntled PTI member, till the filing of this report in the wee hours of Monday morning, vying for a general seat.
Proportional representation
Unlike the general elections, the ‘first past the post’ system (where the person receiving the highest number of votes is declared the winner) is not employed here.
Instead, the ‘single transferable vote’ system of proportional representation is used.
Under this system, voters cast a single ballot, which mentions all the candidates they would like to see elected, in order of their personal priority or preference (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on).
 
 

Each of these votes has a value. A quota calculated by the ECP determines how many votes each candidate needs to be considered elected.
The votes received by each candidate are tallied in each count. When a candidate receives enough votes to cross the quota, the extra value of his or her votes is transferred down to lower priority candidates (in the order mentioned by the voters).
The candidates who receive the fewest votes are eliminated and their votes are transferred to other candidates in the order of preference.
The process of transferring votes from successful and eliminated candidates continues until all vacant seats are filled.
How many votes needed?
Theoretically, for the KP Assembly — which has a total of 145 seats — a candidate for one of seven general seats requires at least 21 votes to succeed (calculated by dividing the total number of seats in the KP Assembly by the number of vacant seats being contested).
For each of the women’s and technocrat seats, this number is 72.
Currently, there are 92 PTI-backed members in the 145-member assembly, whereas the opposition’s strength has gone up to 53.

• PDMA says 135 killed in Punjab
• Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.
According to the PMD’s detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.
In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.
Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.
Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal­pindi, Murree, Gali­yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.
In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre­ady been reported from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.
The PMD said Mir­purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair­pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar­pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.
 
 

In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.
For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.
Rivers in high flood
A separate alert from the country’s  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  “moderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start” over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.
The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.
The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.
The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.
In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a “dual threat.”
“We are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,” Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.
The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.

The most recent final took place last month, when South Africa were crowned champions for the first time after defeating holders Australia at Lord’s.
Nearly 110,000 people went through the gates of the London ground.
India were reportedly keen to host the next final in two years’ time but England have been awarded the finals of the 2027, 2029 and 2031 editions.
At its annual conference in Singapore, the ICC noted England’s “successful record in hosting recent finals”.
“We are absolutely delighted that England and Wales has been chosen to host the next three ICC World Test Championship finals,” said England and Wales Cricket Board CEO Richard Gould. “It’s a testament to the passion that fans in this country have for this treasured format of the game and the willingness of supporters from around the world to travel here for these games.”

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023.
In May, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302B (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). After the ruling by the apex court, a presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
According to the letters, which are addressed to the hospital director at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from the superintendent at Adiala Jail, Zahir requires an opinion from a medical or psychiatric board before submitting a presidential mercy petition.
“The appeal of above mentioned Confirmed Condemned Prisoner (Zahir) was pending at [the] Supreme Court of Pakistan and the same has been dismissed,” the letter, dated July 8, read.
“Now the mercy petition of [the] subject cited Confirmed Condemned Prisoner has to be submitted before the Honourable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For that, the medical board and psychiatric board opinion is mandatory.”
The letter requested that a time and date be chosen for the medical and psychiatric boards to come to Adiala and examine Zahir.
The superintendent made the same request in another letter dated July 14.
 
 

In response to the first letter, Pims stated in a document seen by Dawn.com that Dr Shafqat Nawaz from the psychiatry department and Dr Amir Naveed from the neurology department will comprise the medical board.
Zahir was not only convicted of the murder, but was also sentenced to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs200,000 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the PPC.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the apex court to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years.</p><small>2025-07-20 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/202125390964fec.png?r=213352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925440/interior-minister-naqvi-discusses-counterterrorism-in-kabul-meeting-with-afghan-counterpart' target='_blank'><strong>Interior Minister Naqvi discusses counterterrorism in Kabul meeting with Afghan counterpart</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday discussed counterterrorism efforts in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.
The visit comes after a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the upgrading of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador. Both countries also held the inaugural round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism talks earlier in the month.
“Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi holds an important meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani,” the Interior Ministry said in a post on X.
 






Naqvi was warmly welcomed by interim Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani upon arrival at the Afghan Ministry of Interior, the post said.
“Discussion on bilateral relations, particularly counter-terrorism, infiltration, and the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban [Pakistan],” took place, according to the interior ministry.
Effective management of the Pak-Afghan border, prevention of narcotics, and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement were also discussed, the post said.
“Terrorist organisations are causing chaos and instability; We must stop them together,” Naqvi was quoted as having said to his counterpart.
“Pakistan has selflessly hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades; the doors are open for the legal entry of Afghan citizens,” the interior minister said.
The process of repatriation of Afghan citizens illegally residing in Pakistan was also a subject of the conversation between Naqvi and Haqqani.
Afghanistan’s Senior Deputy Interior Minister Ibrahim Sardar, Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior diplomatic officials were there as part of the country’s delegation. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Interior were also present on the occasion.
Earlier in the day, Naqvi arrived in Kabul on a day-long visit to Afghanistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






On his arrival at the Kabul airport, Naqvi was received by Afghan Interim Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Nabi Omari.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in Kabul.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he had arrived on a day-long visit for the signing.
On Wednesday, the UN special representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, proposed a ‘prioritised’ regional dialogue with Pakistan, Iran and Central Asian states to halt the disorderly return of Afghans and uphold the principle of voluntary, dignified and safe repatriation.
On Friday, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run PTV News reported.</p><small>2025-07-20 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/201920259f800d7.png?r=192040' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925431/kp-governor-administers-oath-to-opposition-mpas' target='_blank'><strong>KP governor administers oath to opposition MPAs</strong></a><br><p>Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa opposition were sworn into office on Sunday after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.
The oath-taking issue has risen once again after the recent redistribution of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.
 


Kundi delivered a press conference following the swearing-in ceremony, where he highlighted that the government reneged on an agreement it had made with the opposition.
“A formula of 6-5 was agreed upon and our opposition candidates withdrew,” the KP governor said. “All of them agreed that they will contest five seats — two will be contested by the JUI-F, two by the PPP, and the PML-N will for one.
“The PTI founder [Imran Khan] then made a decision, and their information secretary said, ‘our Senate candidates are not in our control’. If your Senate candidates are not in control, then how are the MPAs-elect in your control?” Kundi asked.
“The point is, we had a deal in place, we had an agreement. But their members were not completely on board.”
The KP governor highlighted that there are between 30 and 35 independent members of the assembly.
“We have spoken with them, and we are hopeful that we can move towards 6-5. As soon as the leader of the opposition briefs us, we will have a strategy ready for tonight and then we will contest tomorrow’s [Senate] elections,” Kundi said.
Earlier, the opposition MPAs could not take their oaths on reserved seats due to a lack of quorum in the provincial assembly.
At today’s assembly session, which had been called by the KP government, the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and minorities were expected to be sworn in. The session had assumed importance as the non-administration of oaths could lead to the postponement of Senate polls set for tomorrow for 11 seats from the legislature.
The session was scheduled for 9am but began with a delay of two hours and 20 minutes, with KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presiding over it. As soon as the session started, MPA Sher Ali Afridi of the ruling PTI pointed out a lack of quorum, leading to the session being adjourned till July 24.
Upon Afridi’s remarks, PML-N’s Sobia Shahid contended that a lack of quorum could not be pointed out between the recitation of the Holy Quran and the oath-taking. “You (KP government) have been making a joke out of this province for a year,” she said.
Swati asked her to point out the legal provisions for her argument instead of giving a speech.

Ahmad Karim Kundi, the PPP’s parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly, also spoke on the floor of the assembly, backing Shahid. He asserted that the administration of oath was “mandatory”, citing Article 255 of the Constitution.
The speaker also asked Ahmad to state the relevant provisions requiring so and issued a ruling to count the MPAs in attendance, at which it emerged that only 25 lawmakers were present.
Addressing PML-N’s Dr Ibadullah, Swati said: “Opposition leader sahib, there are 25 members present. The quorum is incomplete; ring the bells.”
The opposition lawmakers then came to the front of the speaker’s dais to protest. Swati then adjourned the session, saying: “As the quorum is incomplete, the sitting is adjourned till 2pm on Thursday, July 24.”
Governor to administer oaths after PHC order
The ECP had approached the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday, requesting that Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect under Article 255(2) (oath of office) of the Constitution.
Subsequently, after today’s session, the PHC registrar issued an order by Justice Shah that accepted the ECP request and nominated Governor Kundi to administer the oaths “at the earliest”.
It stressed that the governor should ensure that the oaths are “administered in the manner prescribed and proper record be maintained in accordance with the official procedure”. The judge also directed the KP Assembly secretary to facilitate the newly notified MPAs to sign the Roll of the Members.
A notification by the KP Governor’s secretariat, seen by Dawn.com, said Kundi would administer the oaths to the MPAs-elect at 6pm today.
The ECP has changed the timing for the Senate elections from 9am to 11am.
 






Earlier in the day, the ECP had issued a statement announcing that Kundi will administer the oaths at 9am tomorrow at Governor House. It ordered KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed, the chief secretary and the Federal Constabulary IG to ensure foolproof security arrangements for the ceremony.
Speaking outside the KP Assembly after the session, Ibadullah said he would approach the courts against the delay in the oath-taking, assailing the PTI government.
“Do not hand over whatever political space is left to others,” he said. “No one can stop these oaths […] at which forum will they (PTI) challenge it?” the PML-N lawmaker said.
Ibadullah stressed that the opposition’s women and minority members had not had representation in the Senate for one and a half years, since the 2024 general elections.
Terming the PTI “politically immature”, he pointed out that it was the PTI government’s “responsibility” to ensure a proper quorum, given their majority in the KP Assembly.
Before the assembly session, the PTI held a parliamentary party meeting, in which it decided that none of its MPAs would attend the proceedings, calling the oaths a “theft of its right”.
 


Oaths an insult to public’s opinion: Barrister Saif
In a statement, PTI’s Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, public relations adviser to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, called it a “black day for parliamentary politics” and a “murder of democracy”.
“The oaths of opposition MPAs on reserved seats are an insult to the public’s opinion. […] The opposition is dissatisfied despite winning, while the PTI is satisfied even after losing as it has the public’s support,” Saif said.
 
 

The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. After the latest notifications by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while the PPP holds 10 seats.
The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats, while two seats were to be decided through a separate draw for each.
The PTI treasury and the joint opposition alliance had also agreed on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats will go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition.
Party will take action against ‘disgruntled’ Senate election candidates: Gandapur
KP Chief Minister Party Ali Amin Gandapur said that his party will take action against “disgruntled” Senate election candidates.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, Gandapur said, “Rejecting PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision is a defiance of his position as party founder.”
He added that the alliance with the opposition is only till the Senate elections.
Earlier, an agreement was reached with the opposition on the formula of PTI receiving eight seats and the opposition getting three in the upcoming Senate elections, he added.
“We suffered losses due to our candidates not withdrawing their papers,” he added, saying, “Now, we will get six seats and the opposition will get five seats.”
