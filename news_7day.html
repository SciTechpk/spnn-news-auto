According to a statement issued from the office of Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, the gun battle took place in the Spin Tangi area of Chashmi, Bannu.
Bannu CTD personnel Assistant Sub-Inspector Benyamin Khan, Constable Inam Khan and Constable Musawar were martyred. Two constables, Wafid Khan and Imran, were wounded.
He said two khawarij — a term the state uses to refer to terrorists — were killed and another two injured in police firing, and their accomplices took bodies and injured with them.
“Weapons, ammunition, IEDs (improvised explosive device) and hand grenades were recovered from the terrorists, which were seized by the police,” the spokesman said.
As soon as the incident was reported, RPO Khan, Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kalachi, and CTD Superintendent of Police reached the CTD hospital where they visited the injured personnel and inquired after their well-being.
They also issued instructions to the hospital staff for the best treatment of those injured.
RPO Khan said that all available resources will be utilised for the best treatment of the injured personnel.
“We will soon avenge our martyred brothers and engage the terrorists with an iron hand till the very end,” he said.
A large contingent of Bannu police and CTD police have cordoned off the area and are engaged in search operations. Raids are being conducted on the hideouts of the terrorists, the spokesman said.
In March, two officials of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s CTD were martyred at Tanda Dam in Kohat district in a gun attack carried out by unidentified assailants.
In January, an official of the police’s CTD was martyred when unidentified persons opened fire at him in Mirali Bazaar.</p><small>2025-05-01 05:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/01095217fa4f929.jpg?r=095223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907647/body-of-boy-who-died-in-india-reaches-karachi-after-mishap' target='_blank'><strong>Body of boy who died in India reaches Karachi after mishap</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The body of a 23-year-old Quetta resident, Aryan Shah, who died in Chennai, India, last week while undergoing cancer treatment,  arrived in Karachi on Wednesday after a delay caused by an airline  mishap.
Aryan Shah, who had been receiving treatment for several months in a  hospital in Chennai, succumbed to the illness last week. He had travelled  to India with his parents for medical care.
Following his death, Shah’s mother appealed to Balochistan Chief  Minister Sarfraz Bugti for financial assistance to repatriate the body  as the family could not afford the costs.  Chief Minister Bugti arra­nged financial  support and contacted the Pakistani ambassador in India through the  Foreign Office to facilitate the transfer.
The parents travelled to Karachi via an international airline with the coffin. However, upon arrival, they discovered that the body had been  mistakenly left in Colombo.
“I have received the body of my son  from Colombo,” Shah’s mother said. “The Indian government or hospital  did not extend any help in shifting the body of my son.”
Pakistani  authorities contacted the airline, which subsequently flew the body  from Colombo to Karachi, where it arrived on Wednesday.
Officials  in Quetta said the family has arranged to transport the body to Quetta  by ambulance. They departed Karachi late on Wednesday evening and are  expec­ted to reach Quetta early Thursday morning.

KARACHI: Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday expressed confidence that the global situation following the imposition of US tariffs is manageable for Pakistan.
The minister, speaking at the leadership of the business community during his visit to the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Karachi, said Pakistan already has constructive engagements with US authorities on the sidelines of World Bank and IMF summer meetings, while the premier has also announced the decision to send a delegation to the US to negotiate tariff issues.
Pakistan’s exports to the US are aro­und $5 billion and the volume of imports from the US is nearly $2bn, while average tariff difference is three per cent, he said, adding that this difference could be balanced with trade of cotton, soybean and other such commodities.
Referring to the recent visit to the US, he said the Pakistani delegation had over 70 meetings with the executives of World Bank, IMF, Asian Development Bank and other multilateral and bilateral partners and think tanks and counterpa­r­­­ts from friendly and supporting countries.
Highlighting the turnaround in economic conditions and significant improvements in inflation and current account, Mr Aurangzeb said the current account is expected to remain surplus this fiscal year, while expenditures are also under control owing to the efficient role played by all stakeholders, including the provincial governments.

• Says commodity trade may offset tariff disparities  • Opposes further increase in taxes on salaried, business classes  • Efforts underway to simplify tax return forms

The finance minister said that a steep decline in inflation is a major achievement which allowed a 1,000 basis points reduction in the policy rate, while the next meeting of the SBP Monetary Policy Committee is due in the next week.
He said that it is the 24th IMF programme for Pakistan and the prime minister and his entire cabinet had resolved that it would be the last one as “we are carrying forward economic and structural reforms agenda for the betterment of our country”.
The government is striving to transform the tax administration in consultation with all the stakeholders by simplifying the procedures, utilisation of data and minimising human intervention, Mr Aurangzeb said, adding that it is a very focused effort this time and there was no question of exemptions anymore.
Salaried and business classes were already under the heavy burden of taxes which could not be increased, he noted and stressed the need for easing the lives of salaried class.
The finance minister said that efforts were also underway to simplify the tax return forms so that the majority of taxpayers could file their returns conveniently without assistance of any lawyer or tax adviser. He said energy sector reforms is another important agenda of the government that focuses on improvement in all the phases from generation to transmission and distribution of electricity and those measures resulted in reduction of power tariff. He hinted some more good news in coming months.
Higher costs of financing, energy and taxation were major challenges for business and industry in Pakistan, he said, but added that now policy rate reductions brought the financing cost lower and some respite has also been observed in power tariffs, while rationalisation of tax rates in the upcoming budget was under consideration as well.
The minister said the government had started the consultation process for budget making early this year and proposals submitted by the chambers and trade associations were being reviewed in detail.  He said the government is also working on segregating the tax policy office from the FBR and bringing it under the ambit of the finance ministry. From next year, all the stakeholders’ proposals will be considered by the tax policy office, while the FBR will be responsible for tax collection, he said.

Addressing a press conference, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir, despite the presence of 700,000 Indian troops, was a glaring testament to the Modi government’s failure. “Fom Afzal Guru to Pahalgam, every Indian allegation against Pakistan has been debunked, and India has consistently failed to provide credible evidence,” she said.
Even Indian army generals had admitted that several attacks were “staged and fabricated”, yet the Pakistani nation and its armed forces remained resolute, she said, adding that the enemy cancelled its planned exercises after Pakistani jets took to the skies, demonstrating Pakistan’s readiness.
“Pakistan will thwart every enemy plot and protect every inch of its territory,” she said, adding that findings of incidents like Jaffar Express tragedy would soon be made public.

Pakistan’s readiness compelled India to cancel exercises, says Azma; Sharjeel warns war would be ‘political and military suicide’ for India

On the other hand, she also hailed Lahore’s achievement of being globally recognised as one of the safest cities in the world.
‘Suicide for India’
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon told the media in Karachi that if India imposed a war on its neighbouring nuclear power, it would amount to political and military suicide for India.
The nation stood fully prepared to defend its sovereignty, he said. “Pakistan possesses one of the finest armies, navies, and air forces in the world, and every citizen is ready to protect the motherland,” he added.
The minister said the nation along with the armed forces had consistently condemned all forms of terrorism and successfully dismantled terrorist networks sponsored by India. “Presence of an Indian agent like Kulbhushan Jadhav has already exposed India’s true face,” he said.
Pakistan had been a victim of terrorism, with over 70,000 citizens having lost their lives in this ongoing struggle, he said. Former PM Benazir Bhutto herself was a victim of terrorism, and that people of all ages, children, youth, and elders had made immense sacrifices in this fight, he added.
Describing the Pahalgam incident as false flag operation or a complete failure of India’s security agencies, the minister said that so-called democratic India after the incident blocked Pakistani media outlets and YouTubers.
He categorically rejected the Indian allegations, based on falsehoods, and its attempts to mislead the international community to wrongfully portray the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination as terrorism. “The Pahalgam incident is yet another example of this pattern,” he said.
Accusing India of consistently violating UN resolutions, the minister said India was perpetrating atrocities and oppression against the people of occupied Kashmir. Kashmiri leaders had been imprisoned on fabricated charges, innocent youth had been martyred, and attempts were being made to change the demography of the occupied valley, he added.

• Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Jaffarabad, Sohbatpur, Nasirabad identified as hotspots
ISLAMABAD: The United Nations has launched a comprehensive ‘Heatwave Contingency Plan’ for Pakistan, targeting areas most vulnerable to extreme heat.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which prepared the plan, anticipatory action efforts in Pakistan are closely aligned with the ‘Inter-sectoral Heatwave Contingency Plan’ and are being further reinforced through OCHA’s coordination role.
By working in close collaboration with provincial disaster management authorities (PDMAs) and humanitarian partners, the OCHA is facilitating joint planning, mapping of heatwave response efforts and fostering collective preparedness.
In 2025, pre-arranged fuel funding amounting to $829,728 has been secured to support the readiness and activation phases of heatwave response activities. These interventions aim to reach around 776,000 people across 12 high-risk districts in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Anticipatory actions will be triggered based on pre-agreed thresholds and guided by established action plans.
 
 

The ‘Global Climate Risk Index’ has ranked Pakistan as the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change, highlighting its high exposure to extreme weather events and the resulting economic and human impacts. This ranking indicates that Pakistan is significantly exposed to the effects of climate change, particularly extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves.
A mild to moderate heatwave occurs when the daily maximum temperature is three to five degrees Celsius above the normal maximum temperature for a duration of three to five days, which can lead to physical and mental health issues like fatalities and hospitalisation, according to UNOCHA.
Local factors such as humidity, wind speed, air pressure, population sensitivity and acclimatisation play a role in determining the influence of a heatwave. Urban areas with populations over one million are typically one to three degrees warmer than surrounding areas.
Urban areas — particularly Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur in Sindh and Jaffarabad, Sohbatpur, and Nasirabad in Balochistan — are at high risk and require heat management strategies and public awareness to protect vulnerable populations.
Under the contingency plan, a total of 38 districts will be targeted in all the four provinces with an estimated affected population of 36.08 million. Sindh will be most affected by the heatwave, followed by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Based on the 2024 heatwave situation, the UNOCHA has observed that despite recurring heatwaves, urban areas like Karachi lack effective early-warning systems to mitigate heat-related deaths.
The absence of affordable cooling technologies, public cooling centres and hydration points exacerbates heat risks in urban settings, it said, calling for subsidies for affordable cooling technologies, public cooling centres in high-density areas, and water kiosks in urban and rural locations.

• Says India has no legal authority to unilaterally revoke IWT
• Lawmakers slam repeated Indian ceasefire violations, unprovoked firing at LoC
• India will face defeat if war is imposed, warns Muqam
MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly on Wednesday strongly condemned India’s false flag operation in Pahalgam and the immediate, baseless accusations against Pakistan, as well as the anti-Muslim and anti-Kashmiri propaganda pushed by Indian media in its aftermath.
In a unanimous resolution jointly tabled by members representing almost all parliamentary parties, the House decried the arrest of over 2,500 civilians, demolition of homes, and other oppressive measures in India-held Kashmir.
The lawmakers also denounced the decisions of India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, terming them a deliberate attempt to malign Pakistan and discredit the indigenous freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir without any investigation.
The resolution asserted that India had no legal authority to unilaterally revoke the Indus Waters Treaty, which was guaranteed by the World Bank.
Any such move by New Delhi, the House warned, would be seen as a deliberate attempt to push the region toward instability and war.
Fully endorsing the “bold stance and decisions” taken by Pakistan’s National Security Committee, the assembly called it a fitting response to India’s expansionist and aggressive posturing.
The lawmakers also condemned repeated ceasefire violations and unprovoked firing by Indian occupation forces along the Line of Control (LoC), while paying tribute to Pakistan’s armed forces for responding with strength and professionalism.
“This House salutes Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir for his principled and unambiguous stand on the right to self-determination of Kashmiris, for exposing India’s Hindutva agenda, and for highlighting the human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir,” the resolution read.
Reaffirming their full support, the lawmakers declared that the people of Jammu and Kashmir stood shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan’s armed forces in the defence of the country and were ready to make any sacrifice for its security and stability.
They termed India’s expansionist ambitions a threat to international peace and security, and condemned the ongoing persecution of religious minorities — particularly Muslims — in India, including attacks on their places of worship, enforced conversions, and state-backed violence.
Paying tribute to the martyrs of occupied Kashmir and the resilience of its people, the House reiterated that the people and government of AJK would continue to stand with them in their just struggle.
The resolution pointed out that the Kashmir freedom movement aligned with international law and United Nations resolutions, and that no Indian action could change the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir.
It urged the UN and international community to hold India accountable for implementing the relevant UN resolutions and to take notice of the serious human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.
Unity across political lines
During the session, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq called for unity across political lines to confront the prevailing situation, urging all sides to remain prepared for any eventuality.
He announced that the assembly session would continue until the situation returned to normal, and reaffirmed that the Kashmir cause remained the government’s top priority.
Expressing their views, lawmakers from both sides of the divide noted that India was putting the lives of millions in the region at risk. They made it clear that the Kashmiri struggle was against fascist ideology and an oppressive military, not against India’s Dalit and other minority communities who themselves faced systematic persecution under the Modi regime.
They stressed that the people of AJK would be at the forefront, alongside Pakistan’s armed forces, in the event of any aggression.
Meanwhile, at one point during the session, the speaker asked the government to restrict tourist movement to Neelum Valley in view of the current war-like situation. He said the threat of Indian aggression made it necessary to prevent tourists from becoming stranded or endangered, and asked the administration to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all visitors.
Meanwhile, federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam on Wednesday said that the people living along the LoC were not alone — the entire nation, the government, and Pakistan Army stood by them.
Addressing a “Solidarity with Kashmir” rally in Sharda, located in the upper belt of Neelum Valley, he said Pakistan had always desired peace, but if India initiated a war, the entire nation would stand shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan Army to defeat it. “No power in the world can defeat the passion of the Pakistani nation and the commitment of its armed forces,” he declared.
The minister reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to playing an active role at every forum to secure the Kashmiri people’s fundamental right to self-determination and vowed never to backtrack on the cause of their freedom.

Led by Sanjay Kumar, a PPP minority member of the Balochistan Assembly, the rally included men and women carrying placards and banners with anti-Modi and anti-India slogans.
The protesters marched through various roads and streets of the provincial capital before gathering outside the Quetta Press Club.
Chanting slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, protesters rejected any involvement by Pakistan in the Pahalgam attack.
“The Hindu community in Pakistan stands united with the country’s armed forces. If India dares commit aggression, over 10 million Hindus in Pakistan will stand behind our military,” Sanjay Kumar said while addressing the gathering.
 
 

Other speakers, including several women, also condemned the Indian government’s actions and rhetoric. They criticised India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a violation of international agreements.
“India cannot unilaterally suspend the treaty signed in 1960 without the consent of other stakeholders,” protesters said.
The protest ended peacefully after the speeches.

Titled “Free speech and public interest journalism under siege”, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.
 
 

“The existential threat is serious as such a situation is seen rare in Pakistani media history. This situation is threatening the very foundation of democracy and the state is more brutal now than it was before to tolerate hard questions,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, as the report launch coincides with World Press Freedom Day being commemorated globally on May 3 every year.
Authored by Adnan Rehmat, the report provides an overview of the freedom of expression and media freedoms in Pakistan prevalent during May 2024-April 2025.

Freedom Network says crisis has been triggered by amendments to Peca; KP emerges as the most dangerous for journalists, followed by Islamabad and Punjab

“These challenges reflect the broader shrinking space for media freedoms in the country. Such a declining media space means citizens will have little access to information they need to know,” co-author Iqbal Khattak said.
Five journalists were killed during the period the report covered. Three journalists were killed in Sindh and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while at least 82 journalists and other media professionals had faced different types of threats during the same period.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa emerged as the most dangerous province for journalists where 22 cases were documented while Islamabad recorded the second highest number of 20 cases against journalists and followed by 18 cases in Punjab. Four cases were recorded in Balochistan and one in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The report said at least 14 journalists faced legal cases, mostly under Peca law while in eight cases journalists were arrested or detained in pursuance of legal cases.
Growing censorship, legal restrictions, violence against journalists, impact of disinformation on media and its practitioners’ integrity, challenges for women media practitioners, effects of political polarisation on media freedom and safety of journalists were key areas the report identified as main reasons for the current situation facing the freedom of expression and media freedom.
The women’s representation in the country’s media has improved over the time, but significant disparities remained in the period under review.
“Even though inadequately represented in media in quantitative terms, women are active in various forms of media, including print, television, radio and digital platforms,” the report says.
It recommended “national movement to protect and pursue the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression and the right to express dissent with policies and state action that impinge on the fundamental rights of citizens”.
The report also seeks inclusion and engagement to mobilise public and civil society actors to make “the national movement” stronger and working.
A national consensus of key stakeholders for a new charter on digital rights of the citizens of Pakistan that “guarantees the same constitutional guarantees online as offline, and ensure internet access for all, quality internet and digital rights including the right to digital freedom of expression”.

The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief becomes the country’s tenth NSA.
A notification issued by the Cabinet Division on Tuesday said that Gen Malik would retain his role as DG ISI, a position he has held since September 2024.
“Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik HI(M), DG (I), shall hold the additional charge of the National Security Adviser, with immediate effect,” the notification stated.
His appointment marks the first time a serving ISI chief will concurrently serve as the NSA.
The posting comes amid heightened tensions with India following the recent Pahalgam attack.
The NSA position had remained vacant since April 2022, when the PTI government was ousted after former Prime Minister Imran Khan lost a vote of confidence. At the time, Moeed Yusuf was serving as the NSA.
The NSA holds the status of a federal minister and serves as the principal adviser to the Prime Minister on matters of national security, foreign policy, and strategic affairs.

“There was a deliberate and predetermined sch­e­me to take over IHC,”  feared Muneer A. Malik on behalf of five IHC’s judges who have  petitioned the SC on an inter-se seniority dispute.
The counsel will further dilate upon the aspect when the constitutional bench will meet again on May 7.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a set of petitions of five IHC judges namely Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz have moved a joint petition before the Supreme Court with a plea not to treat the three transferred judges as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
The senior counsel also furnished a 37-page rejoinder to rebut federal gover­nm­ent’s statement before the bench contending that judges were transferred to IHC after six high court judges wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Comm­­ission (SJC) on March 25, 2024 complaining instances of executive’s interference in their judicial functions and attempts to intimate them and conduct their secret surveillance.
 
 

On Wednesday while going through summaries initiated for the transfer of the three judges to IHC from different high courts, the counsel emphasised that these summaries were approved by the Prime Minister as well as the President on the same day. Such mode of approval indicated that there was no independent application of mind on part of the President contrary to what was held in the 2021 Qazi Faez Isa reference case.
To substantiate, the cou­nsel cited the second summary of Jan 30, 2025 rela­ted to the transfer of the Balochistan High Court judge to IHC and pointed out that the summary was approved by the President as well as the Prime Minister on the same day in the same manner.
Referring to the initiation summaries moved by the law secretary to the registrars of the three high courts, the counsel highlighted that these summaries suggest that the representation of judges from Punjab was disproportionate to the total strength of 13 judges in the IHC whereas there was no judge in the IHC from the rural Sindh. The counsel highlighted that these summaries were initiated by the executive and not by the judiciary.
At this, Justice Muha­m­mad Ali Mazhar acknowledged that Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz in the IHC belongs to Sindh, whe­reas Justice Salahuddin Panw­har reminded that the sum­mary has pointed out about the absence of any judge from the rural Sindh.
The counsel, however, reminded the court that Article 200 contemplated “meaningful and purposive” consultative process for the transfer of the judges from one high court to another.
As Justice Mazhar asked him to read out the concurrence of Chief Justice Yahya Afridi for the transfer of judges to the IHC, the counsel said he would not shy away from reading any document and then read out CJP’s approval for the transfer.
The chief justice in his Feb 1, 2025 opinion which was communicated thro­ugh the Supreme Court registrar had stated, “The proposed transfer of the three judges from the high courts of different federating units to IHC completely syncs with the spirit of the federalism as enshrined in the Constitution.”
“It is also in conformity with Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010.” “The thoughtful consideration behind the proposal illustrates resolve in providing an equitable share to linguistic diversity of our country and fair chance of representation to all the federating units in the high court of the common capital of the federation ie IHC.”
“Notice none of these summaries addresses the issue of oath or seniority of the judges to be transferred to IHC,” the counsel emphasised.
But Justice Mazhar rem­inded that we don’t know about summaries regarding opinions of the chief justices of the respective high courts, adding may be CJP had consulted with the respective chief justices through phone calls.
“How CJP could give his consent unless he asked first from chief justices of the respective high courts,” Justice Mazhar observed.
But the counsel emphasised that even in that process the issue of seniority and oath of the transferred judges were side stepped and not touched upon.
“I must reiterate that there must have been some consultation between the CJP and chief justices of the high courts may be on phone giving the fact that CJP had given ample reasons in his concurrence,” observed Justice Mazhar.
The counsel contended that it was after and not before the concurrence, the summary to the Prime Minister said that no fresh oath was needed under Article 200 of the Constitution rather it was for the first time that these issues were addressed.
Justice Mazhar reminded that the summary was referring to Article 200 and it was a matter of interpretation.
The counsel contended that in the process of transfer of judges under Article 200, the judiciary has to be insulated from the executive and ought to have been approved by the Cabinet since the transfer was an act of the executive.

And thereby hangs a tale.
It is, of course, abundantly clear that whoever carried out the massacre at Pahalgam or whoever backed the hideous killing of men by identifying them by their religion, helped the BJP’s divisive agenda under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch.
This was just as true of the killing of 40 troops in Pulwama in 2019. It too was turned into a communal incident.
A division of Indians along Hindu-Muslim lines inevitably helps negate the predominant social reality of caste, not only among Hindus but also for minorities, including Muslims. The killing of 27 men in Pahalgam, predominantly Hindu, by suspected Muslim gunmen, premeditated or not, was quickly turned into a Hindu-Muslim slugfest.

Pahalgam incident seen as helping ‘BJP’s divisive agenda’; quickly turned into ‘Hindu-Muslim slugfest’

“They didn’t ask one’s caste. They asked about their religion.” Pamphlets were put out on TV post haste within moments of the slaughter. The opposition said it was the BJP at work.
This was the currency that works sure footedly for political mileage. In Gujarat, too, almost moments after the burning of the train coach in Godhra in 2002, the Indian government blamed Pakistan before quickly turning its finger at well-to-do Muslims who had recently won the municipal elections in Godhra.
 
 

The “Mian Musharraf” slur continued to describe Gujarat Muslims to extract the last drop of political elixir. But poll-bound Bihar doesn’t respond quite so well to Hindu-Muslim mischief given its more entrenched, centuries-old social reality around caste.
Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav were part of the JP Movement, but belonged to different castes. (Nitish Kumar is the current chief minister of Bihar while Lalu Yadav is a predecessor).
The BJP too needs to move along the caste ruts while seeking to keep the religious pot boiling. When it overlooks the caste angle, its poll arithmetic is likelier challenged. That’s how a Dalit politician from the opposition could defeat the BJP candidate in Ayodhya in the general election last year.
Change of tact
When the full cabinet met under Mr Modi’s watch on Wednesday, the discussion was expected to be entirely on the India-Pakistan tensions. But the headlines were unexpectedly different, suggesting a more politically savvy preparation for Bihar than the Hindu-Muslim cliché.
No timeline was given and polls are due in the politically crucial state in October. The promise was made but the timeline was not provided about when the promise would be honoured. That’s what the newspapers focused on.
“With an eye on the Bihar elections, the Union government on Wednesday announced that a caste census will be conducted along with the decadal census,” The Wire reported.
Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw made the announcement at a cabinet briefing. “However, he did not provide any timeline for when the decadal census or the corresponding caste census will be conducted,” the report said.
The last population census was conducted in 2011 and the 2021 census, which was delayed by the pandemic, is yet to be conducted.
“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) has decided that caste enumeration should be included in the forthcoming census. This demonstrates that our government is committed to the values and interests of society and country.
“Like in the past, when our government had introduced 10pc reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society without causing any stress in any section,” said Vaishnaw.
A nationwide caste census has been a long-standing demand of the opposition parties and was a central issue during the Lok Sabha elections last year. Vaishnaw, while making the announcement on Wednesday, accused the INDIA alliance of using the caste census as a “political tool” and said that Congress governments have “always opposed caste census”.
The cynicism hasn’t abated on the communal front, though. Reports are coming of assaults on and beating up of Muslims in BJP-ruled states.
In Kashmir, where the police are controlled by New Delhi, the people helped arrest the slide. But, as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq noted on Wednesday, Kashmiris are being assaulted elsewhere.
“The physical and verbal assault on Kashmiri shawl vendors in Mussoorie (a hill station in Uttarakhand state), who had to flee when police refused to guarantee their safety, is very disturbing,” he said in a statement. “After large-scale detentions, demolition of homes, and crackdowns inside Kashmir, ordinary citizens, students, and small traders outside of J&K are being attacked and forced to return.”
Mirwaiz slammed the communal upsurge and the killings in Pahalgam in the same breath.
“Being themselves at the receiving end of all forms of violence and subsequent suffering for decades, Kashmiris’ condemnation, empathy, and grief for the victims of the Pahalgam bloodbath is straight from the heart, yet they are being vilified and targeted. I appeal to the people of India not to fall prey to hatred and media propaganda creating mistrust of Kashmiris, and reciprocate in ensuring their safety, as they have always done in times of crisis towards all visitors and tourists.”
Pahalgam has set a political agenda, however, in which caste calculations have surged to the fore. The delicate manoeuvre requires a balance between keeping the India-Pakistan border hot and not losing the state polls.

• Bushra Bibi’s appeal to be taken up by division bench next week
ISLAMABAD: In a major blow to Imran Khan’s hopes for a legal reprieve, the Islamabad High Court has signalled that his appeal against a 14-year sentence in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case won’t be heard this year — effectively keeping the former prime minister in legal limbo throughout 2025.
The report by the IHC registrar office was submitted to a division bench in response to an application, seeking the early hearing of an appeal against the conviction of the PTI founder and his spouse, Bushra Bibi.
As per the report, a criminal appeal filed in January 2025 by Mr Khan, sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, faces indefinite delays, with the court confirming that the case would not be heard during the current calendar year.
 
 

The report cited the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) recommendations, according to which the court had approved a ‘fixation policy’ in February 2023 to expedite pending cases, particularly the appeals filed by convicts. Key measures included designating special benches to resolve cases pending for over five years within two months. However, despite these directives, fresh cases like the 2025 appeal remain trapped in procedural limbo.
As per the report, 279 convict appeals are pending before the court, including 63 about the death sentence and 73 against life imprisonment. In 88 cases, the sentences are more than seven years and while in 55 cases, they are up to seven years.
The subject appeal, filed in January 2025, relates to a convict sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, said the report. Despite its recent filing, the case remains at the “motion stage”, requiring the preparation of paper books (mandatory legal documents) before admission.
“After [the appeal’s] admission, paper books are required to be prepared. So far, its fixation for regular hearing… is not in sight during the calendar year 2025,” the report stated, underscoring the procedural bottleneck. The report explicitly stated that due to existing priorities under the NJPMC’s policy—which focuses on older cases—the appeal of Mr Khan has “no sight of fixation for a regular hearing in 2025”.
Bushra’s appeal next week
During the hearing on the application for early hearing of this matter, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif scheduled Bushra Bibi’s plea for suspension of her seven-year sentence for hearing next week.
Barrister Salman Safdar, representing the petitioners, raised concerns over the court office’s handling of urgent applications. “For the third time, the PTI founder is in jail in this case, and our applications for suspension of sentence remain pending,” he told the bench.
He alleged that the registrar’s office was not processing the relevant applications and was instead prioritising other appeals unjustifiably.
Mr Safdar also emphasised that Bushra Bibi had no direct involvement in the case and requested immediate relief for her. He further urged the bench to fix the case for next Tuesday, citing travel arrangements from Lahore. In response, Acting Chief Justice Dogar remarked, “Let me tell you the day, I will see.”
Commenting on the development, advocate Faisal Hussain said that the delay has exposed the strategy of the PTI’s legal team. He said that the legal team should convince the court that this was not a routine case, and being its peculiar nature, the case should be heard on priority basis.

• India closes airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23; flights to GB cancelled for a few hours
• US Secy of State urges PM Shehbaz to help probe Pahalgam attack; tells New Delhi to work with Pakistan for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at calming tensions in the Subcontinent, fears of a possible military confrontation between India and Pakistan continued to persist on Wednesday.
Following a statement by Information Minister Atta Tarar in the early hours of Wednesday, where he warned of a possible incursion by India within the next 24-36 hours, a number of incidents of Indian aggression heightened tensions.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Pakistani security forces delivered a robust response to India’s unprovoked ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC), destroying an Indian checkpost after late-night aggression on April 29-30.
According to security officials, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked small arms fire in the Kiani and Mandal sectors, which was met with a prompt response.
Sources told APP that the retaliatory strikes destroyed several bunkers, including the Chakputra post in India-held Kashmir.
Reuters also reported that a conversation was held between top army officers from India and Pakistan — without naming them.
 
 

Separately, state media also reported that a “timely and swift response” by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had forced four Indian Rafale jets to retreat.
Quoting security sources, state-run PTV and Radio Pakistan said that the previous night, four Indian Rafales were detected patrolling over the territory of held-Kashmir. A timely and prompt action by the PAF forced them to retreat.
They said that Indian jets became flustered and retreated owing to the PAF’s prompt response.
Airspace concerns
With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
A Notam (Notice to Airmen) issued by New Delhi said the closure would be from April 30 to May 23, 2025.
While PIA flights to the Gilgit and Skardu airports were cancelled on Wednesday, two Airblue flights between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, sources said.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”.
However, the airspace closure ended after a few hours and flight schedules were restored.
One source told Dawn that the airspace closure was carried out due to certain exercises that were being carried out, but it was not clear if this was directly linked to the heightened tensions with India, or due to inclement weather, as rain and wind storms are predicted to sweep across the country’s northern parts from today.
Residents and visitors obviously faced difficulties, as alternative land routes are often less reliable and more time-consuming.
Diplomatic efforts
Meanwhile, the United States has urged both Pakistan and India to take steps to de-escalate tensions in the region.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed the message in separate calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “The secretary spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam. Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”
“The Secretary urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.
A separate readout of Rubio’s conversation with India’s foreign minister said: “[Secretary of State Marco Rubio] encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Rubio.
During the call, the prime minister condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and termed India’s escalatory and provocative behavior as deeply disappointing and worrisome, adding that these would only distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism.
He categorically rejected Indian attempts to link Pakistan to the incident and pointed to his call for a transparent, credible, and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
He urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar contacted leaders from European Union countries, apprising them that Pakistan was open to an transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack.
Mr Dar spoke with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi, briefing them on recent regional developments, including Indian propaganda and illegal unilateral measures against Pakistan, and placing Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of international law.
He also met with US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, who called on the foreign minister in Islamabad. Both leaders exchanged views on recent regional developments, a statement said.
In the meeting, Mr Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Ms Baker conveyed the US desire for de-escalation, adding that Washin­gton would stay engaged with both countries on the evolving situation.

Industry representatives warned that these measures are draining national revenue and stifling economic growth, urging lawmakers to support business-friendly policies in the next budget for the country’s economic development.
The committee, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, initiated consultations with the chambers of commerce and industry to make proposals for incorporation in the Budget 2025-26. 
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jaw­ed Bilwani spoke at length about the special tax regime for the ex-Fata region. He stated that tea imports had an abnormal surge of about five times compared to their population of four million people, causing a revenue loss of Rs30 billion annually because of this special facility.

Demand removal of special tax facility for erstwhile Fata region

He also highlighted the issue of low duties and taxes on the raw materials of the plastic industry, particularly polyethylene for manufacturers. He reiterated that manufacturers import more raw materials due to these low taxes and then sell them at higher prices.
The KCCI chief demanded the restoration of the zero-rated regime on the supply of raw materials to registered exporters under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). He also sought restoration of the final tax regime for exporters. 
Mr Bilwani also asked to provide regionally competitive energy to the export sector. In the next budget, the government should revive the incentives in the shape of duty drawbacks to the export sector. He pointed out that an estimated 40pc of motorcycle and 60pc of automobile parts were smuggled in due to high duties on regular imports. He suggested to rationalise these duties to encourage legitimate imports.
Moreover, he echoed his concerns about stuck-up sales tax refunds despite the FBR’s claims of releasing payments within 72 hours. He deplored that non-payment of refu­nds and advance taxes increased the cost of doing business manifold.
Senator Mandviwalla stated that the FBR had admitted the 72-hour refund policy of sales tax before the committee. The committee decided to take up the matter in the upcoming budget meetings.
The Lahore and Gujranwala Cha­m­bers of Commerce and Industry raised advance tax on exports. They apprised that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) charged one per cent tax plus an additional 1pc on remittances. They proposed the rationalisation of this tax.
Furthermore, the Sialkot Cham­ber of Commerce and Industry highlighted the expulsion of tribunals for matters in which sales tax exceeds Rs2 million and income tax Rs1m, expressing concern over the lack of proper appellate forums for small taxpayers.
The committee assured them of taking up the matter in the upcoming budget. Additionally, the Sialkot chamber emphasised the need to cater to the growing number of young entrepreneurs, with around 600 to 700 new registrations recor­ded each year, highlighting the importance of supportive policies for this emerging business segment.
Additionally, the Rawalpindi Cha­­mber of Commerce and Indus­try proposed lowering general sales to 15pc in the upcoming budget to help revive the dyeing industry. RCCI President Usman Shaukat also proposed providing tax incentives to export-based industries upon completion of export targets and providing necessary financial facilities to small and medium enterprises.
Funds for women entrepreneurs
The Islamabad Women’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IWCCI) urged the government to allocate dedicated funds for women entrepreneurs in the upcoming budget, emphasising the need to create a more supportive environment for women-led businesses. 
The chamber also called for reducing the existing Rs50m revenue threshold for corporate women, arguing that the current limit poses a barrier to entry for many capable women entrepreneurs seeking to formalise and expand their businesses.
The Paper and Stationery Asso­ci­ation called for the withdrawal of ta­­­­xes on stationery items. They sta­ted that the federal government had promised in the previous year to eliminate the existing taxes on stationery items in the following bud­get cycle. The association urged the government to honour its commitm­ent, stressing that these taxes shou­­ld be withdrawn immediately to ensure the affordability and accessibility of essential educational materials for students nationwide.

The FBR collected Rs9.299 trillion in July-April FY25 against the budgetary target of Rs10.130tr. However, the collection is 27 per cent higher than the year-ago figure Rs7.350tr.
On a monthly basis, the FBR collected Rs846bn in April against the target of Rs963bn, indicating a shortfall of Rs117bn. However, according to provisional data released on Wednesday, the collection is 30pc higher than Rs651bn collected a year ago.
A tax official said that despite low inflation and an economic slowdown, revenue collection saw a notable increase of 30pc in April thanks to enhanced enforcement efforts, particularly within the sugar sector and a few other sectors.

FBR raises Rs9.29tr in July-April

The IMF has revised the FBR revenue collection target for FY25, decreasing it to Rs12.333tr from Rs12.913tr, marking a reduction of Rs580bn. The IMF expressed readiness to adjust the target further downward. However, the prime minister insists that the FBR intensify its efforts to meet the target.
The shortfall is primarily attributed to reduced import tax collection, sluggish manufacturing growth and unexpectedly low inflation, which has dropped to the lowest single digits in decades.
The FBR paid Rs427bn in refunds to taxpayers in 10MFY25, up 1.18pc from Rs422bn in the same period last year. However, Rs43bn was refunded in April, almost the same amount as last year.
In July-April, income tax collection totalled Rs4.479tr, exceeding the target of Rs4.152tr by Rs327bn. The income tax collection grew 28pc compared to last year’s Rs3.505tr.
The sales tax collection fell short of the target by Rs774bn in 10MFY25, totalling Rs3.174tr against the target of Rs3.948tr. The sales tax collection rose 27pc compared to last year’s Rs2.498tr.
The customs collection also fell short of the projected target by Rs228bn to Rs1.043tr in 10MFY25 against the target of Rs1.271tr. The customs collection recorded a growth of 17pc when compared with last year’s Rs894bn. 
The Federal Excise Duty collection fell short of the target by Rs156bn to Rs603bn in 10MFY25. The excise duty recorded a growth of 33pc over last year’s Rs453bn.

For example, Lucky Motor Corporation drastically lowered the price of Kia Sportage L HEV, L FWD and L Alpha to Rs10.999 million, Rs9.999m and Rs8.499m from Rs1.2850m, Rs11.825m and Rs9.499m, a drop of Rs1.851m, Rs1.82m and Rs1m, respectively.
The company’s circular says that the new prices, which are temporarily adjusted, are effective from May 1.
On the contrary, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL), which raised the prices of various models by up to Rs120,000 in February, has come out with fresh price shocks for multiple models.
For example, the company revised the prices of Suzuki Swift GL MT model to Rs4.416m from Rs4.336m, up by Rs80,000 effective from April 26.
The price of Suzuki Cultus VXR, VXL and AGS models has been jacked up to Rs4.230m, Rs4.316m and Rs4.618m from Rs3.858m, Rs4.244m and Rs4.546m, up by Rs372,000, Rs72,000 and Rs72,000, respectively.
Temporary shutdown: Meanwhile, Bolan Casting Ltd, a leading tractor parts maker, temporarily halted production activities from April 28 to May 9, citing a drastic drop in orders.

Ukraine’s prime minister said First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko was flying to the United States to sign the deal, which is central to Kyiv’s efforts to mend ties with Donald Trump and the White House as the US president tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Two sources said the signing could happen later on Wednesday. But one source said the US was pushing Ukraine to sign two additional documents as well as the main minerals deal and that Kyiv felt they were not ready yet. “Who knows maybe today they will take (those) two docs and finish them too,” the source said.
A draft of the main minerals agreement showed Ukraine had secured the removal of any requirement for it to pay back the US for past military assistance, something Ukraine had staunchly opposed. Ukrainian officials hope that signing the deal promoted by Trump will help firm up softening American support for Kyiv in the more than three-year-old war.

Agreement will give Washington access to new natural resources 

The draft agreement gives the US preferential access to new Ukrainian natural resources deals but does not automatically hand Washington a share of Ukraine’s mineral wealth or any of its gas infrastructure, the draft showed. “Indeed, it is a strategic agreement... it is a truly equal, good international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine,” Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said.
Joint fund
The draft sets out the creation of a joint US-Ukrainian fund for reconstruction which will receive 50 per cent of profits and royalties accruing to the Ukrainian state from new natural resources permits in Ukraine. The draft does not spell out how the joint fund’s revenues will be spent, who benefits or who controls decisions about the spending. 
Shmyhal said in televised comments that once the main agreement was signed, the two sides would agree two further technical and supplementary documents outlining issues such as how the funds are accumulated.
He said Ukraine would retain control of all its resources in the deal, while the fund will invest in the development of Ukraine for a period of 10 years. 
“Ukraine will only make a contribution from new licenses, from new royalties on mineral resources. This will be our contribution, 50pc of which will be given to this fund,” he said.
The US could use its future military assistance to Ukraine as its contribution to the fund, Shmyhal said, with no previous military aid to the country reflected in the deal. The two sides signed a memorandum, published on April 18, as an initial step towards clinching an accord on developing mineral resources in Ukraine.
In the memorandum, they said they aimed to complete talks by April 26 and to sign the deal as soon as possible. Trump and officials in his administration threatened this month to walk away from efforts to broker a peace deal unless there were clear signs of progress soon.

Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organisation and the US president’s son, attended the signing ceremony with Qatari Diar and a second real estate developement partner, Dar Global.
The 18-hole Trump International Golf Course and Trump Villas are to be constructed as part of a major government-backed development scheme unveiled last year, the Simaisma Project, which will also include a theme park and a marina.
“We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global,” Eric Trump said in a statement.
“Trump International Golf Club Simaisma and our luxury villa community will reflect our highest standards of quality,” he added.
Abdullah bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Attiya, Qatar’s municipality minister and chairman of Qatari Diar, said:  “We are delighted to partner with Dar Global to bring the prestigious Trump brand to Simaisma.”  
“Through this collaboration, we look forward to further strengthening Qatar’s position as a preferred destination for investment, tourism and luxury living, both regionally and internationally,” he added.
The Trump Organisation has already partnered with Saudi developer Dar Global on a high-rise apartment complex in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, a luxury building in Dubai and a hotel complex in Oman.

US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued the order after immigrant rights advocates argued the administration had violated a court order he issued by flying four Venezuelans held at the US naval base in Cuba to El Salvador on a flight conducted by the US Department of Defence.
Murphy in late March had issued a temporary restraining order, which he later extended into an injunction, restricting the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to rapidly deport migrants to countries other than their own without allowing them to first raise concerns about their safety or potential torture.
Republican President Donald Trump’s administration argued it did not violate the judge’s order as it only applied to the Homeland Security Department, which oversees US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not the Defence Department.
The US Department of Justice called three of the four migrants members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and said the Department of Defence removed them to El Salvador without the knowledge or direction of the Homeland Security Department.

Speaking outside a courthouse in Vermont, Mahdawi addressed US President Donald Trump and his government, which has moved to revoke foreign students’ visas over their involvement in pro-Palestinian protests.
“I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said, and then joined the assembled crowd in chanting “no fear.” “If there is no fear. What is it replaced with? Love, love is our way.” Mahdawi, 34, was arrested on April 14 as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen, according to court filings.
A Palestinian born in the occupied West Bank, Mahdawi has been a legal US permanent resident since 2015, was set to graduate next month and planned to attend a Columbia master’s programme this fall, court filings said.

Mahdawi was arrested due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University

He is the co-founder of a Palestinian student group at Columbia alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the movement who Trump has also been trying to expel since his March arrest. “What did they do to me? They arrested me. What’s the reason? Because I raised my voice and I said no to war, yes to peace,” Mahdawi said on Wednesday.
A judge had previously ordered Mahdawi not to be removed from Vermont, after immigration authorities quickly transferred other students detained under the Trump administration’s crackdown to other jurisdictions.
Federal agents had attempted to fly Mahdawi to Louisiana on the day he was arrested, but they were late for the flight, according to court documents.
‘McCarthyism’
Khalil on the other hand was transferred to Louisiana shortly after his March 8 arrest, and an immigration judge there ruled earlier this month that he could be deported. His legal challenge remains ongoing. Mahdawi, in challenging his removal, has accused the Trump administration of violating his constitutional rights to free speech and due process, arguments Judge Geoffrey Crawford in Vermont found convincing. “Mahdawi has presented sufficient evidence that his speech was protected under the First Amendment,” Crawford said in his ruling.
Crawford ordered Mahdawi’s release on bail while his broader challenge proceeds, requiring that he remain in Vermont and only travel to New York for “educational purposes or to meet with his lawyers or as otherwise ordered by the court.” 
Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have accused participants in campus protests across the country last year of supporting the Palestinian armed group Hamas, whose Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the conflict in Gaza.
Israel launched a punishing offensive in response, reducing most of the enclave to rubble and killing more than 52,000 people there, most of them civilians, according to data the UN considers reliable. Rubio has argued that a rarely used federal law grants him the authority to summarily revoke visas and deport migrants who pose threats to US “foreign policy.” Judge Crawford expressed skepticism that Rubio’s application of the law to campus protesters would not violate free speech protections.
“Immigration detention cannot be motivated by a punitive purpose. Nor can it be motivated by the desire to deter others from speaking,” he said.
Crawford likened the political climate induced by Trump’s crackdown to the anti-communist furor in the early 20th century and 1950s period of McCarthyism.

The US president had vowed to end the war in his first 24 hours back in the White House but, as Trump celebrates 100 days in office, Rubio has suggested the administration could soon turn attention to other issues. 
“We are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday, in what she said was a message from Rubio. 
“If there is not progress, we will step back as mediators in this process.” 
She said it would ultimately be up to Trump to decide whether to move ahead on diplomacy. 
The president suggested on Tuesday that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin still wants to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine.
Asked in an interview with ABC television if Putin wants peace, Trump said: “I think he does.” 
Putin recently proposed a three-day ceasefire around Moscow’s commemorations next week for the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. But he has rebuffed a Ukrainian-backed US call for a 30-day ceasefire. 
The United States wants “not a three-day moment so you can celebrate something else — a complete, durable ceasefire and an end to the conflict,” Tammy Bruce said. 
Means of pressure 
It remains unclear if Rubio is actually ready to turn the page or is seeking to pressure the two countries. The United States already put together a framework proposal which Ukrainians feel bows to Russian demands. 
Trump has suggested an official recognition of Russia’s takeover in 2014 of Crimea, an annexation rejected by nearly all the world, in addition to land swaps.  “We all want this war to end in a fair way — with no rewards for Putin, especially no land,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told an event in Poland by videoconference on Tuesday. 
Russia has also not moved on the proposal with many experts believing Moscow now sees an upper hand — on the battlefield and diplomatically, with Trump eager to reconcile. 
Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, sought to blame Zelensky and said that Russia would keep speaking with the United States. 
Zelensky “is bent on escalating the conflict. He’s recklessly rejecting the United States’ balanced peace proposals,” Nebenzia told a UN Security Council meeting. 
US diplomat John Kelley told the session that both sides would benefit from working off the US framework and condemned Russian strikes into Ukraine.
“Right now, Russia has a great opportunity to achieve a durable peace,” Kelley said.

Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue agency reported that hundreds of civilians were at risk from the worst brushfires in years, with Katz ordering troops to deploy to support firefighters. MDA said it had provided treatment to around 23 people, 13 of whom were taken to hospital, the majority suffering from smoke inhalation and burns. Among them were two pregnant women and two children less than a year old, it added. It said the alert level had been raised to the highest tier.
“We are facing a national emergency, and all available forces must be mobilised to save lives and bring the fires under control,” Katz said in a statement from his ministry. 
Police closed the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and evacuated residents along the route as brushfires broke out again in an area ravaged by blazes a week ago. Communities home to thousands of people have been cleared out. 
“Our aircraft can’t do anything right now due to the weather conditions... Our goal is to save lives,” fire chief Eyal Caspi said at a televised press conference. “We are apparently facing the largest fire in Israel in a decade.” The police said on X that they had deployed in force around Route 1 and the Jerusalem Hills, asking the public to  “avoid travelling to the area”.
An agency journalist at the scene earlier on Wednesday said the blaze was sweeping through wooded areas near the main road between Latrun and Bet Shemesh, and that helicopters were working to extinguish the flames.
Bet Shemesh resident Shimon Bitton, 42, said his daughters had been evacuated from school.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.  Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and Modi granting “operational freedom” to his military.
The US has urged restraint and said it was planning talks with both sides to ease the crisis.
 


A statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office later today said the premier received a telephone call from the US Secretary of State
Marco Rubio in the evening during which Shehbaz “urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.
“Terming India’s escalatory and provocative behaviour as deeply disappointing and worrisome, the prime minister said that India’s provocations would only serve to distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism, particularly from militant groups, including ISKP (Islamic State Khorasan Province), TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) operating from Afghan soil,” it added.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz “categorically rejected” India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, highlighting his call for a transparent, credible and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
It said the prime minister shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Secretary Rubio.
“While condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the PM underscored Pakistan’s leading role in the war on terror and its sacrifice of over 90,000 lives and over $152 billion in economic losses,” the statement read.
“It is most regrettable that India chose to weaponise water, which is a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan,” the premier was quoted as saying, while also stressing that the Indus Waters Treaty had no provision for either side to unilaterally renege from its commitments.
The prime minister added that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute was the “only way to ensure lasting peace in South Asia”.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted to America’s top diplomat that Pakistan and the US had worked together closely over the past seven decades and there was much that both sides could cooperate on, including counter-terrorism and enhanced economic cooperation, particularly in the minerals sector.
“The prime minister also stressed that his government had undertaken major economic reforms over the past year, and consequently, Pakistan was now on the road to economic recovery,” the statement read.
“Secretary of State Rubio thanked the prime minister for the detailed conversation and emphasised the need for both sides to continue working together for peace and stability in South Asia,” it concluded.
The US State Department said in a statement that Rubio also “urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack”.
Rubio also spoke to Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, according to State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam, and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,” she was quoted as saying in a press release. “He also encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar for talks in which they exchanged views on recent regional developments.
Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Baker conveyed the United States’ desire for de-escalation, saying that the country would stay engaged with both Pakistan and India on the evolving situation.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi.
Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including “India’s inflammatory propaganda, illegal unilateral actions, and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a clear violation of international law”, the FO said.
The Omani FM underscored the importance of de-escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy to address issues.
FM Dar appreciated Oman’s efforts for Iran and US talks and conveyed best wishes for their success.
Separately, the Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concern regarding the escalating tension between Pakistan and India and the continued exchange of fire in the border areas.
“The kingdom calls on both countries to reduce tension, avoid escalation, resolve differences through diplomatic means, respect the principles of good neighbourliness and work to achieve stability and peace for the benefit of their peoples and the peoples of the region,” the statement said.
Indian Rafales patrolling above held Kashmir retreat after PAF scrambles jets
Earlier today, Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media reported.
PTV News and Radio Pakistan, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting “patrolling overnight” in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.
“PAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,” Radio Pakistan added.
“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” PTV News reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were “fully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India”.
India also shut its airspace to Pakistani airlines today. The ban on Pakistani aircraft will be from April 30 to May 23, according to a Notice to Airmen issued by the Indian government.
The developments come after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.
In a televised statement issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.
The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
FM Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Today’s incident also comes after the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, official sources said.
The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.
 
 

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the night of April 25.
Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) faced a major fall in intraday trade today.
Pakistan responds to unprovoked Indian firing on LoC
Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV reported that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC in AJK.

“According to security sources, on the night of April 29 and 30, India violated the ceasefire on the LoC. India opened unprovoked fire in the Kayani and Mandal sectors of the LoC,” PTV reported.
India used small arms in the unprovoked firing incident, the state broadcaster added.
“Security sources have confirmed that the Pakistan Army has responded forcefully and given a befitting reply to the Indian Army. The enemy has been silenced with an effective response,” the report said.
The state broadcaster cited reports of the destruction of several Indian bunkers due to the effective response of the Pakistan Army, adding, “Security sources have said that India’s Chakpatra post has been destroyed”.

“Earlier, India had also evacuated the border areas of occupied Kashmir while a crackdown against Muslims is underway,” PTV said, adding that the Pakistan Army was always ready to defend the integrity of the country.
PIA flights from Gilgit, Skardu cancelled
Amid heightened tensions, all Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights operating from the Skardu and Gilgit airports to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad — and vice versa — were cancelled today, according to PIA officials.
However, two Airblue flights destined between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, the sources added.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”. When the passengers reached the airports, they were told that the flights had been cancelled due to security concerns.
 
 

Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 also confirmed the cancellations of a total of 10 PIA flights and departures of the two Airblue flights.
Iqra Khan, a flight inquiry officer at Islamabad International Airport (ISB), also told Dawn.com that PIA cancelled its flights today from the federal capital to Gilgit and vice versa, citing “airspace security” as a reason.
Yesterday, amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities had refuted rumours of a possible closure of airports.
According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled earlier in the week.
The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
Ex-PM Imran says peace is ‘priority’, calls for unity
Amid the ongoing situation, the opposition PTI has proposed a multi-party conference with incarcerated former premier Imran Khan in attendance.
A statement posted on Imran’s X account, which is handled by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”
Recalling the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.
“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi sarkar is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.
 
 

He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a “nuclear flashpoint”.
“I have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,” Imran stressed.
“Needless to say, to win the war against an external enemy, the nation must first be united. It is high time to put a halt to all actions that are further polarising the nation,” he said, adding that the “state’s excessive focus on political victimisation at this critical time is deepening internal divisions”.
“Ironically, Narendra Modi’s aggression has united the people of Pakistan in one voice against Indian hostility,” the ex-premier noted.
India okays ‘operational freedom’ to army amid calls for restraint
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
India’s cabinet committee on security (CCS) — consisting of Modi and his interior, defence, home and finance ministers — is scheduled to meet later today, a government source told Reuters.
This would be the second such meeting of the CCS since the attack on April 22. In its first meeting, the committee had decided to take a series of measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. In the past few days, Dar has also spoken to the foreign ministers of China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary to brief them about Pakistan’s concerns.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday offering “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.
In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the PAF undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.

The sharp increase in imports was a reflection of businesses and consumers stockpiling foreign goods to get ahead of Trump’s sweeping trade levies, which went into effect earlier this month.
All three major Wall Street indices fell on the economic news, with the Nasdaq sliding more than 2 per cent before paring some losses, while oil prices extended their losses.
At a cabinet meeting in Washington, Trump insisted the growth downturn was the legacy of former president Joe Biden’s policies.
“That’s Biden, that’s not Trump,” he said.
Striking a more positive tone, he highlighted the “whopping” 22pc rise in gross domestic investment during the first quarter.
Annual economic growth stayed above 2pc in every year of Biden’s presidency, reaching 2.8pc in 2024.
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the world’s largest economy decreased at an annual rate of 0.3pc in the first quarter, after growing 2.4pc in the final months of 2024, according to Wednesday’s first estimate from the US Commerce Department.
 


This was sharply below the market consensus estimate of 0.4pc growth, according to Briefing.com, and marked the first quarterly contraction since 2022.
The Commerce Department said in a statement that the contraction was in large part down to an “upturn in imports,” aided by a decline in consumer and government spending.
‘A blaring warning’
In a statement, the White House called GDP a “backward-looking indicator.”
“It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “But the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering.”
The GDP figures were published on the 101st day since Trump returned to the White House, along with fresh data showing a slowdown in the US Federal Reserve’s favoured inflation gauge last month.
Trump’s introduction of sweeping tariffs against most countries sparked a selloff in financial markets, sending volatility to levels not seen since the Covid pandemic.
“This decline in GDP is a blaring warning to everyone that Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ failed MAGA experiment is killing our economy,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
‘Greater risk of recession’
Following the dramatic market movements in early April, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause to the higher tariffs for dozens of countries to allow for trade talks, while maintaining a baseline 10pc rate for most countries.
But the administration has also added to the tariffs on China, with the level of duties introduced since January now totalling 145pc — with some sector-specific measures pushing levies even higher.
Beijing has responded with its own steep, targeted measures against US goods.
At the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said China was getting “hammered” by the tariffs, and said he still hoped to make a deal with Beijing, whom he referred to as “the leading candidate for the chief ripper-offer” of America.
“Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” Trump said, arguing that the United States did not need many of the things China produced.
“And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,” he said.
Economists at Wells Fargo wrote in an investor note that the US economy is at a greater risk of recession now than a month ago, “but this 0.3pc contraction in Q1 GDP is not the start of one.”
“It reflects instead the sudden change in trade policy that culminated in the biggest drag from net exports in data going back more than a half-century.”</p><small>2025-04-30 20:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30235341b020514.jpg?r=004531' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907596/rising-militancy-democratic-backsliding-headline-hrcps-human-rights-report' target='_blank'><strong>Rising militancy, democratic backsliding headline HRCP’s human rights report</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Wednesday released its annual State of Human Rights in Pakistan report, which highlighted the country’s deteriorating security situation and democratic backsliding.
Amnesty International, in a statement last year, observed that human rights abuses remained “rampant” in Pakistan. Reports of extra-judicial killings, harassment of human rights defenders, mass arrests, military trials of civilians and violation of freedom of the press were some of the concerns listed by the rights group.
HRCP’s report was launched at an event held at a hotel in Islamabad, where the Commission’s Chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt, Co-chairperson Munizae Jahangir, General Secretary Haris Khalil and members Nasreen Azhar and Hina Jilani addressed the ceremony. The event was attended by journalists, human rights defenders, and transgender rights activists.
Butt highlighted the pressing human rights concerns in the country and called for “national reconciliation to steer Pakistan back on the right track under a democratic framework”.
“The country’s progress depends on upholding human rights, maintaining the rule of law, and improving the overall law and order situation,” he emphasised.
The report identified escalating violence, enforced disappearances, restrictions on freedoms and a breakdown in law and order among key issues Pakistan faced last year.
Butt highlighted the multifaceted crisis, stating, “Human rights have declined alarmingly, leading to widespread mental distress among the population due to inflation, joblessness, and blatant violations of the law.” He pointed out the poor state of law and order, with 1,166 terrorist attacks in 2024, resulting in 2,546 fatalities — a 66 per cent increase in fatalities compared to 2023.
“The state has failed” in its duty to protect its citizens, Butt asserted, citing the “Kurram battlefield” where 250 people were killed and a November incident that claimed 52 lives. Retaliatory violence further exacerbated the situation, leading to the deaths of 80 people, including 24 victims of mob lynchings, according to the report.
The report also shed light on the prevalence of alleged extrajudicial killings, with 108 police encounters reported. Sindh alone accounted for 3,856 encounters, resulting in the deaths of 341 suspects. The HRCP expressed grave concern over this alarming trend.
Another critical issue highlighted was the persistent problem of enforced disappearances. The report detailed instances of individuals being “kidnapped in the nights,” with families denied access and legal provisions to lawyers.
The HRCP emphasised the “profound mental anguish” inflicted upon the families of missing persons, describing it as an “unfortunate situation” with lasting consequences. The report unequivocally stated that “force disappearance perpetrators violate the constitution and international laws,” including the sanctity of private spaces.
The failure to produce arrested individuals in court within 24 hours, often followed by the discovery of their bodies, was strongly condemned by the Commission. The report acknowledged the treatment of growing movements in Balochistan and Sindh, such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).
Political leaders in Gilgit-Baltistan have also faced similar restrictions, with eight reportedly on the Exit Control List.
The HRCP report also raised serious concerns about the shrinking space for freedom of speech and expression. Restrictions on internet connectivity, including the social media platform X, were noted.
The report noted that journalists became increasingly vulnerable, with 162 incidents of attacks and 6 journalists killed by unknown individuals in 2024. The HRCP reminded the state of its constitutional obligation to ensure freedom of expression and freedom of faith.
The “misuse of religious material for blackmail and subsequent arrests by the Federal Investigation Agency,” often stemming from WhatsApp activity, was highlighted as a worrying trend.
Additionally, the 35 incidents targeting the Ahmadiyya community and the desecration of their graves, were documented. Five individuals from the Ahmadiyya community were killed, the report stated citing the Jamaat-i-Ahmadiyya press section.
The report further condemned the rise in mob lynchings based on allegations, citing incidents in Swat, Sargodha, Umerkot and Quetta, where only the intervention of law enforcement prevented further fatalities.
 
 

In 2024 alone, Pakistan witnessed 405 ‘honour’ killings, with 24 allegedly involving police personnel. The increasing prevalence of cybercrimes, with 321 cases reported, mostly in Punjab, also drew the HRCP’s concern.
In conclusion, the HRCP report paints a stark picture of a deteriorating human rights situation in Pakistan, urging the state to take immediate and concrete steps to address these critical issues. The Commission expressed deep concern and called for accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations.</p><small>2025-04-30 19:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/302344301cb38e6.jpg?r=234435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907595/govt-slashes-petrol-high-speed-diesel-prices-by-rs2' target='_blank'><strong>Govt slashes petrol, high-speed diesel prices by Rs2</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Wednesday slashed the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs2 per litre for the next fortnight.
The new prices are Rs252.63 for petrol and Rs256.64 for HSD, according to a press release from the Finance Division.
It did not mention any changes in the prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil.
The decision comes after the government last time burnt the midnight oil to block about a Rs10 per litre reduction in major petroleum products — petrol and diesel — by amending the Petroleum Products (Petroleum Levy) Ordinance 1961.
Government officials had aid the government was already charging the maximum permissible petroleum levy on petrol, HS) and high-octane blending component (HOBC) at Rs70 per litre, which is why a new law was required to keep the prices unchanged at the existing level.
This was done through an amendment to the petroleum levy law and an increase in the levy to Rs80 per litre. The government had decided not to let the petroleum prices decline further, which could trigger increased demand, encourage carbon emissions and cost higher foreign exchange.
In the global market, petrol and HSD prices had dropped by about $6 and $5 per barrel, respectively. The prime minister announced that funds raised through the increase in levy would be spent on road construction in Sindh and Balochistan, apparently to ensure political support from coalition partners.</p><small>2025-04-30 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30191552300918c.png?r=212448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907576/pakistan-wont-initiate-but-will-respond-strongly-to-any-indian-escalation-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan won’t initiate but will respond strongly to any Indian escalation: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Amid rising tensions with India, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Wednesday that Pakistan will not initiate any escalation but warned of a strong response if provoked.
His statement came during a joint press conference in Islamabad with Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan, where they addressed recent border confrontations with India along the Line of Control (LoC) and accused New Delhi of supporting terrorism inside Pakistan.

What was said:

FM Dar says entire region facing serious threat to peace
Says Pakistan will respond very strong to any escalatory move
Says durable solution for India in focusing on internal problems
Raises questions about Pahalgam incident
FO spokesperson highlights irregularities in Pahalgam FIR registration
DG ISPR pokes holes in Indian narrative
Says India uses illegally held Pakistani prisoners in fake encounters
Says army monitoring the situation very carefully in all terrains
Says Pakistanis will defend territorial integrity and sovereignty at all costs
Says law enforcement agencies fully capable of taking on all threats simultaneously


Ties between Pakistan and India have hit a new low after the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 men, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults on civilians there since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, or The Resistance Front, initially claimed responsibility but later denied involvement.  New Delhi, without evidence, implied Pakistani backing, a claim Islamabad has strongly rejected. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has urged a neutral probe into the incident.
FM Dar said the entire region was facing a serious threat to peace and stability owing to the “politically motivated and highly provocative environment being created by India” in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
“The world leaders have been requesting the exercise of restraint in recent days. I have made it very clear, on behalf of the government and the nation, that Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move. However, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” he said.
“Let me start by reiterating that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. No cause or objective can justify taking the lives of innocent people. This is the national and Islamic policy: killing of a human being is tantamount to killing entire humanity as per the [Holy] Quran and saving a life is tantamount to saving entire humanity.”
The deputy prime minister said the targeting of innocent civilians was sorely condemnable and deplorable, adding that Pakistan had been raising its policy in this regard wherever it was happening in the world.
“We are concerned over the loss of life during the Pahalgam attack. We also extend our condolences. Being a victim of terrorism itself, no one can feel the pain of those impacted by this scourge like Pakistan,” Dar said.
On the other hand, he said: “India glorifies and even celebrates its assassination campaign and sponsoring of terrorism in Pakistan and other countries. No other country has sacrificed so much or suffered as much as Pakistan due to terrorism.”
 


Recounting the loss of over 80,000 lives and economic losses of over $150 billion, Dar said that in total, the overall loss incurred by Pakistan amounted to $500bn. Pakistan, he went on to say, had been working closely with the international community to address the common threat.
He said the sacrifices made by Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies and civilians had helped to address the threat of terrorism and contributed towards regional and international peace and stability.
“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism that has been planned, orchestrated and sponsored by India,” FM Dar said, adding that in such a backdrop, it was “preposterous to even suggest any kind of association of Pakistan with this [Pahalgam] incident”.
Dar pointed out that the furore and media hype created over “each and every incident in India seems to be deliberate and choreographed”, adding that it was “unfortunate that India continues to weaponise unsubstantiated accusations and allegations as part of its disinformation strategy for narrow political ends”.
 
 

He alleged it was not the first time that India had resorted to this practice.
“They have done it before and resorted again to the same to what they did in the Pulwama incident,” the deputy prime minister said, adding that it had become a “very familiar template aimed at diverting attention from India’s inability to suppress the inalienable right of Kashmiris to self-determination, its security failures in [occupied Kashmir] as well as its decades-long state terrorism and oppression”.
Dar asserted that India deliberately raised tensions with Pakistan to distract the international community’s attention from the “horrors” of what was happening in occupied India.
“A durable solution for India lies in focusing on its internal problems instead of pointing fingers at other countries. India has been deploying allegations of terrorism to achieve its strategic objectives for a long time,” Dar said, adding that India had a history of using the excuse of terrorism to introduce “draconian laws” to suppress Kashmiris in the occupied territory and to defy UN Security Council resolutions on the issue.
“India needs to explain why such incidents usually coincide with high-profile visits … The root cause of instability and conflict in South Asia is the unresolved and long-festering Jammu and Kashmir dispute. India’s illegal occupation … in stark violation of UNSC resolutions and grave violations of human rights, must remain a matter of grave concern for the international community.
“At the same time, all such incidents are used to whip up domestic political sentiment for narrow political gains. We remain extremely concerned at the very vitriolic, highly inflammatory and blatantly Islamophobic narrative being directed against Kashmiris and Indian Muslims.

He said the Indian media and political leaders were directing a similar discourse against Pakistan, which he criticised as a “highly irresponsible ploy for narrow objective gains” that was pushing the entire region towards “extreme instability”.
“India made allegations against Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack without an iota of evidence and with such dramatic speed. Pakistan has nothing to do with it and we have said so right from the beginning, and I repeat: Pakistan has nothing to do with the Pahalgam incident, period.
“We demand an independent and transparent probe by neutral investigators, as announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Any TORs (terms of reference) in this regard should be credible and mutually agreed upon.
“Pakistan has neither any connection … nor is the potential beneficiary. At a time when the economy is stabilising and we are making significant progress against terrorism, we need to question why this situation is being created by India all of a sudden and what is the motivation behind it.”

Dar also mentioned that the recent actions and announcements by India after a meeting of its cabinet security committee were “illegal and highly irresponsible”.
“Holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty is unilateral and illegal. There are no such provisions in the treaty, it cannot be amended or terminated without consensus and in case of disagreements or issues, there are forums provided in the treaty which should be invoked,” he added.
The deputy prime minister added that the aforementioned actions demonstrated India’s “blatant disregard” for the sanctity of international treaties and set a dangerous precedent.
“It strikes at a fundamental ill of regional cooperation with profound implications for regional and global stability,” the foreign minister explained.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy, millions of people are dependent on the waters being regulated by this treaty. We gave up three rivers in this treaty and I can hardly find a water distribution treaty in the world whereby, a part of dealing with the distribution of water, the rivers could have also been given up.”
Dar said the National Security Committee had made it “very clear” that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan, as per the IWT and the usurpation of the rights of the lower riparian, would be considered an “act of war”.
“It is equal to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy. Other diplomatic measures by India are indiscriminate and unnecessary. India’s actions and inflammatory rhetoric over the last few days are highly irresponsible. Being a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan believes in restraint and remains committed to regional peace and stability.
“However, in case of any act of aggression, Pakistan remains determined to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in exercise of its inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter.”
Questions about Pahalgam incident
FM Dar said he wanted to raise some questions about the Pahalgam incident that needed to be considered.
“One, is it not time for the international community to hold India accountable for its transnational assassinations in different countries, including Pakistan? Two, is it not important to distinguish between the international community’s sympathies with the victims of the incident and the unwitting endorsement of Indian belligerence?
Three, is it not that Indian propaganda is aimed at fabricating a case for military adventure? Four, don’t you think that India’s blatant disregard for international law and whimsical approach towards its obligations would lead to a highly unstable and unpredictable regional order?
“Five, isn’t it high time for the international community to step in and condemn India and prevent it from targeting people on the basis of Islamophobia and religious hatred?
Six, can we deny that the dangerous Indian brinkmanship and efforts aimed at escalation can potentially lead to disastrous consequences in a nuclearised region and beyond?“
The foreign minister said Pakistan was cognisant of the developing situation. “We are very alert, the armed forces are alert, and the NSC resolve is very much there. We are vigilant, our armed forces are vigilant and the nation will thwart any misadventure, responding in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing,” he added.
Dar pointed out that it took no time for Pakistan to issue the statement expressing its condolences. “I was with the prime minister in Ankara on an official 36-hour visit. After we landed, the news came,  and the moment the meetings ended in the evening, for which we had gone, I was in touch with the FO and the foreign secretary, and the team and I finalised in consultation with the stakeholders, Pakistan’s statement on this incident,” the foreign minister said.
“So don’t tell me that Pakistan has not condemned. There are different forums of condemnation. Pakistan has condemned at the international forum where it is responsible, one of the 15 members of the UNSC. Pakistan’s highest security forum, which is the NSC, has condemned it.
“We have condemned terrorism in all its manifestations and forms. The prime minister has given a very clear condemnation statement when he offered an independent inquiry … by independent actors.
“So this is rhetoric which the other side has been playing that we did not condemn, that is all wrong.”
Irregularities with Pahalgam FIR
Following Dar’s remarks, FO spokesperson Khan highlighted irregularities in the registration of the first information report for the incident and criticised the speed with which Indian accounts began blaming Pakistan without offering any evidence.
“The timing raises serious questions about how information was processed so quickly,” he said.
Meanwhile, DG ISPR Lt Gen Chaudhry noted that the attack site was located far from the nearest town of Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, emphasising that Pakistan was presenting facts rather than engaging in baseless allegations.
“If the allegation is that the Pakistan-based so-called terrorists did this incident, then you need to be cognizant of where it lies, how deep within [occupied Kashmir]. If you see the terrain, you will see it is quite hilly, it is not the sort of terrain that is friendly and not the sort of terrain where all-weather fair roads exist. It’s mostly [four-wheelers] that travel,” he said.

Showing visuals of the area’s geography, he said the distance from the incident site to the nearest police station was 30 minutes and questioned how an FIR could be registered in 10 minutes.
The military spokesperson poked holes in the Indian narrative, saying that the other side mentioned reports of indiscriminate firing, while also putting forward a stance on the act of terrorism carried out based on religion.
Link between Indian propaganda and terrorism
Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Indian social media account spreading propaganda against Islam and Pakistan had previously been linked to terrorist attacks in the country, including the November 4, 2023, assault in Mianwali and the October 6, 2024, attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi.
“There you see the collusion, how the choreography is carried out: first projecting and predicting where we will strike, then the attack happens, followed by its glorification on social media,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “If you observe the pattern, their electronic media jumps in within minutes. The same sequence was visible in Pahalgam.”
He said a similar pattern of hinting at a major incident, followed by a terrorist attack, was also observed in the Jaffar Express train bombing.
The military spokesperson said the questions raised by FM Dar were those being asked by common Kashmiris and Indians themselves.
“Is it the first time it is happening? No, there is a litany of using terror incidents for political ends. This is important — these terror incidents have a political objective. We saw last time, in Pulwama, how the terror incident in February was used for … change of status of Kashmir.
“We are seeing now that a terror incident that happened in Pahalgam is being used for the purpose of IWT, distracting [from] Pakistan’s continuously and hard-fought won war on terrorism and successful efforts in reviving the economy.”
He said another important fact that needed to be considered in the situation the region was facing today was the phenomenon of fake encounters using illegally held Pakistani prisoners in India.
“We have reports, the information that hundreds of Pakistanis held in jails in different locations by India are used in fake encounters projected as terrorists and infiltrators.”
Turning to India’s “state-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan, Chaudhry said the spokesperson of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) had appeared on multiple Indian news channels after the Jaffar Express attack, where he was openly glorified.

DG Chaudhry said Indian media was the first to show footage of the attack that was shot by the BLA.
He said the issue of Indian-sponsored assassinations and terrorism was transnational, affecting Canada, the US and Australia as well.
“Once we say that we have gotten nothing to do with Pahalgam and once we say that the only way out is an independent, credible transparent investigation, we have strong reasons, empirical evidence, and facts on the basis of which we are saying this.”
The military spokesperson further said: “We have credible intelligence that Indians post-Pahalgam have tasked all their proxies to undertake terrorist acts everywhere in Pakistan. Whether these proxies are operating in Balochistan or other parts of Pakistan.”
DG Chaudhry said the country had seen 3,700 terror incidents since January 24 with 77,816 operations, 1,666 terrorists killed and 3,896 casualties.
“This is terrorism that is being abetted and sponsored by India. It’s for the whole world to see, they feel it, its effects. We must be cognizant that Pakistan is the last bulwark standing against this scourge of terrorism.”
DG Chaudhry lashed out at India, saying that for the sake of its “short-term myopic objectives, it is facilitating this terrorism, it is abetting this perverted creeping ideology. Why? For short-term political objectives”.
Regarding the subsequent rhetoric against Islam and action against Muslims in India, the DG ISPR said: “I talked earlier that there is a planned and choreographed campaign of Islamist terrorism, but the acts speak differently.
“This is what some sane people are saying, the tourists who came in taxis belonging to Muslims, they stayed in hotels owned by Muslims, they ate food cooked by Muslims … and after the attack, they were covered and protected by Muslims. The first person to die was Muslim.”
He questioned why an effort was being made to label the whole community of Indian Muslims as terrorists. “Is this part of some agenda? is it part of that hate that is being systematically put into society?”
Chaudhry said that those questioning the Indian narrative were being clamped down upon.
“What the Indians are trying to do is … internalisation of external problems and externalisation of internal problems. Kashmir is an external problem and they are externalising it.
“Terrorism and extremism are an internal problem of India. Instead of handling it, and addressing it, they are externalising it. This cycle is manifesting itself in this Pahalgam incident.”
Pakistan response to escalatory moves
Questioned on Pakistan’s response and the options available to it, the DG ISPR said: “We are monitoring the situation very carefully in all terrains and accordingly, our responses and countermeasures in all domains are ready and as you must have seen in the NSC declaration, the statement of the government that came last night as well, that there will be decisive and assured actions.”
He said he would not elaborate on the details but “rest assured that the people of Pakistan, with its full resolve will defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan at all costs.”
Dar added: “Pakistan will exercise restraint for the purpose of regional peace, but and that is very clear, that if provoked, any action from the other side will be responded to in a befitting manner and in a stronger way.”
He further said: “The nation is united, the resolve of the leadership is in front of you in the NSC press release … I must compliment all political parties represented in the federation, all federating units, in the Senate … there is a unanimous resolution … the message is loud and clear.
“In terms of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no compromise and we are one united [nation] with a clear resolve that if provocation takes place then don’t blame us.”
The DG ISPR said Pakistani authorities would take up the case of India’s state-sponsored terrorism with all forums, including the international community.
Questioned about a fight on two fronts, the DG ISPR said law enforcement agencies were “fully capable” of taking on all threats simultaneously and effectively with full force.

“Terrorists are being hunted down. We are vigilant and watching everywhere,” he said with appropriate countermeasures in place for “fitting and decisive responses”.
Questioned about any need for mediation in the matter, FM Dar said: “There is a need for investigation, not mediation. Our friends have offered it and they must be trying. The need of the hour is, because both countries being nuclear, any escalatory move can go to a direction which would be unsustainable not only for the two countries but the entire region so it is my responsibility, of friends and regional actors to make sure India doesn’t make this mistake [of an attack].
“On behalf of armed forces, they’re alert, they’re ready and in a position to give a befitting response and we will choose the time and mode of our liking.”
Meanwhile, the DG ISPR confirmed that Pakistan and India’s military discussed ceasefire violations. He said the two sides held a routine weekly call in which Pakistan “raised the ceasefire violation issue” on Tuesday along the LoC.
Reuters earlier reported that despite the heightened tensions, India and Pakistan’s top military generals held their normal weekly phone call on Tuesday, according to two Indian military sources and a Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter.
“The Indian side objected strongly to unprovoked firing happening from Pakistan,” one Indian source said.
A Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the talks had happened, but gave no details.
The DG ISPR said this routine weekly contact was normally not made public. “We don’t know for what reason the Indians thought it necessary to make it public,” he said.
AJK president calls for international mediation
Meanwhile, AJK President Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called for international mediation and said that his administration was preparing a humanitarian response in case of any further escalation.
“There is a lot of activity going on and anything could happen, so we have to prepare for it. These few days are very important,” he told Reuters in an interview, calling for rapid international diplomacy to de-escalate the situation.
“We expect some mediation at this time from some friendly countries and we hope that that mediation must take place, otherwise, India would do anything this time,” he said. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates could be in a position to mediate, he added.
He also said he hoped major players such as the United States and Britain might also get involved.
He said activity along the LoC was “hot” and that Pakistan had shot down two Indian drones in the last few days.
“There had been regular firing by Pakistani and Indian soldiers day and night, though so far there had been no casualties,” he said, adding that Pakistan had also detected Indian Rafale fighter jets flying near the LoC, though they had not crossed.
He said he had not received intelligence on when and where India was expected to strike, but his administration was working with groups such as the Red Crescent Society to prepare extra medical and food supplies in case of any conflict.
“Red Crescent are working on it and we are working on displaced people in affected areas,” he said.
He added that the international community also needed to pay more attention to Kashmir’s long-term future.
“I think this is the right time for the international community as a whole and the UN to play some mediating role in Kashmir,” he said. “It’s been a very long time and the people of Kashmir have suffered a lot.”</p><small>2025-04-30 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30222010706aea4.jpg?r=222919' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907591/despite-wars-end-afghanistan-remains-deep-in-crisis-un-relief-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Despite war’s end, Afghanistan remains deep in crisis: UN relief chief</strong></a><br><p>Climate change, women’s rights, displacement, poverty: Afghanistan remains a priority as it faces overlapping crises, the UN’s relief chief Tom Fletcher told AFP on Wednesday, deploring “brutal” aid budget cuts.
“We’ve identified 17 crises across the world where our engagement is most urgent, most vital. Afghanistan is high on that list,” said the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs in an interview with AFP during a visit to northern Afghanistan’s Kunduz province.
Fletcher’s visit comes after US President Donald Trump’s decision to slash foreign aid sent shock waves across the globe.
 
 

Washington had been the top donor to Afghanistan, having spent $3.71 billion in humanitarian and development aid since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
“We’re in a period when we’re having to massively prioritise, take brutal choices … literally life and death choices, about where to operate and which lives to save,” Fletcher said.
“You can look at Sudan for the scale of the crisis, you can look at Gaza for the intensity, the ferocity of the killing there,” he added. “Afghanistan is a different kind of challenge, but it’s a huge challenge nonetheless.”
Climate change is hitting the country “particularly hard” and it “will drive the needs even more than conflict will in the period ahead”, he said. “You’ve got that combined with the existing levels of poverty and these decades of instability and conflict.”
‘Dialogue’ on women’s rights
The situation of women’s rights in the country adds to the layers of a “building up of crisis upon crisis”, Fletcher added.
The Taliban authorities have imposed restrictions on women that the UN has denounced as “gender apartheid”. Women and girls have been banned from education beyond primary school as well as many sectors of work and public spaces.
“I think this particular dynamic around women and girls is something that can surely cut through to even the most hard-hearted and cynical, transactional politician right now,” Fletcher said.
After meetings with Taliban officials this week in Kabul and the Taliban heartland of southern Kandahar, Fletcher noted the need for “dialogue in order to try and change the mindset” on women’s rights.

“It’s encouraging to me that people were willing to have the conversation and not have it in a purely defensive way,” he said.
Afghan women are particularly affected by humanitarian aid cuts, especially in the healthcare sector, which has been heavily dependent on foreign support.
In Afghanistan, maternal mortality rates of 620 per 100,000 births and infant mortality rates of 55 children under five per 1,000 births are among the highest in the world, according to Unicef.
“I challenge anyone who celebrates aid cuts to sit with a woman who has lost her child because she had to cycle for three hours while in labour to get the care that she needed,” said Fletcher, after having met Afghan women at a mobile health centre.
‘Humanitarian reset’
When Amina, a 28-year-old housewife, fell ill, she walked for an hour and a half to reach the centre in the rural countryside.
“There are no clinics, no doctors who come here, nothing nearby. We don’t even have electricity,” she told AFP.
The small facility, supported by the local non-governmental organisation JACK and UN agencies, is under strain.
Already overwhelmed, it now has to accommodate patients from US-funded clinics that had to close, as well as Afghans who have been expelled from Pakistan since early April.

“The reality with the cuts was that we didn’t see the impact straight away,” Fletcher said. “It’s now that we’re really coming to understand how brutal these cuts are going to be.”
Under these conditions, he said, “we’re in the process now of a massive humanitarian reset”.
“We’ve got to rediscover that sense of coexistence and care for the most vulnerable people on the planet. I don’t think that’s gone away just because of a few election results,” he said. “I don’t think you can put tariffs on humanitarian action,” he added, referring to the trade war recently launched by Trump.</p><small>2025-04-30 17:35</small></div><hr>
