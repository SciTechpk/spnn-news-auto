ISLAMABAD: In a landmark ruling with far-reaching constitutional and fiscal implications, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Tuesday, while accepting parliament’s competence to legislate for the imposition of taxes, upheld the vires of the super tax, ruling that certain provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) 2001 will apply from the dates on which they were levied at the prescribed rates.
Various businesspersons, banks and companies had challenged the imposition of the super tax before the high courts, arguing that its retrospective application amounted to double taxation.
Later, appeals were filed in the Supreme Court against judgements of the Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad High Courts concerning the levy of super tax through Sections 4-B and 4-C, inserted into the ITO 2001 through the Finance Acts of 2015 and 2022, respectively.
After 71 hearings before the Supreme Court, the cases were transferred to the FCC following the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Headed by Chief Justice of the FCC Aminuddin Khan, a three-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah announced the much-anticipated short order in the afternoon, following a brief morning hearing, at which the court had reserved its verdict.
The detailed judgement will be issued later.
According to a senior counsel representing Revenue Secretary Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, the FCC decided more than 2,200 long-pending tax cases relating to Sections 4-B and 4-C of the ITO, thereby safeguarding an estimated Rs310 billion in public revenue.
The tax was initially imposed in 2015 through a money bill, with the stated purpose of rehabilitating areas affected by Operation Zarb-i-Azb against terrorism. It was introduced as a one-time measure to fund the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the military operation.
An additional five per cent super tax was levied on annual profits exceeding Rs300 million. In 2022, however, the super tax was extended to individuals earning more than Rs150m annually, with a maximum rate of 10 per cent.
Introduced by the PML-N government in 2015, the super tax applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning above Rs500m. It imposes a tax rate of four per cent on the income of banking companies and three per cent on other sectors, aimed at funding the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
In its ruling, the FCC held Sections 4(b) and 4(c) to be intra vires of the Constitution, reaffirmed Parliament’s exclusive authority to determine taxation under these provisions, and clarified that the courts’ role was limited to interpretation. The court declared that the high courts’ judgements striking down or reading down Section 4(c) were constitutionally invalid as they had exceeded their jurisdiction and therefore stood set aside.
The FCC held that courts could not re-determine tax slabs, rates, thresholds or fiscal policy, and that the high courts had committed judicial overreach in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. All appeals filed by the Secretary, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Commissioner Inland Revenue were declared maintainable.
The court ruled that the super taxes were valid, with specific exclusions for benevolent funds. It also allowed oil and gas exploration companies to approach the relevant tax commissioner individually for exemptions, to be assessed on a case-by-case basis under the 1948 concessions regime.
Petroleum sector gets relief
A senior counsel, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the petroleum sector was the only one granted relief on the basis of petroleum concessions signed by the President with exploration companies. He recalled that it had been argued before the FCC that imposing taxes beyond what was agreed under these concessions could lead to international arbitration, potentially resulting in heavy damages, as seen in past cases such as Reko Diq and rental power projects.
During the hearing, it was contended that the government could not breach the agreed tax ceiling without violating petroleum concession agreements. The counsel added that the association of petroleum companies had also served a notice on the federation, warning of the possibility of invoking international arbitration. He said it appeared that this argument had proved persuasive.
Commenting on the implications of the judgement, senior counsel Isaac Ali Qazi told Dawn that to offset the impact of the super tax, industry might adopt two strategies: companies close to the super tax threshold might freeze sales and production to avoid the levy, or they might pass on the tax burden by factoring it into profit margins, which could fuel inflation.

Real GDP to expand 3.5 per cent in FY26, before strengthening to 4.4pc in FY27, it said while commenting on SBP’s monetary policy decision that kept benchmark interest rate unchanged at 10.5pc on Monday.

 

This is generally in line with SBP that projected real GDP growth in the range of 3.75-4.75pc in 2025-26, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated momentum in commodity-producing sectors and spillovers to services. This momentum is expected to extend into FY27, aided by earlier monetary easing and ongoing macroeconomic stability.
These projections are relatively higher than 3.2pc growth rate projected by the International Monetary Fund last week, down from 3.6pc of its previous estimate.
On the external front, the SBP projected the current account deficit to remain within 0-1pc of GDP in FY26. With continued remittance inflows and planned official financing, foreign exchange reserves are projected to surpass $18bn by end-June 2026 and rise further in FY27, approaching the benchmark of three months of import cover, the central bank had observed.
S&P Global Market Intelligence (not S&P Global Ratings) projected a current account deficit of 0.5pc and 1.3pc of GDP, respectively, in calendar years 2026 and 2027 with a disclaimer. “Risks weigh on the downside, owing to elevated global tariff uncertainty, volatile commodity prices, and geopolitical fragmentation,” S&P noted.
On inflation, the SBP expected stabilisation within the 5-7pc target range over the next two years, after temporarily exceeding the upper bound for a few months during calendar year 2026.
The S&P, on the other hand, projected inflation to come at 5.1pc in 2026 before slightly inching upwards to 5.6pc in 2027, again with a caveat. “Risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, linked to volatility in global commodities and domestic wheat prices, possible adjustments in administered energy tariffs, and a stronger-than-assumed pickup in domestic demand,” it concluded.

“During July-November FY26, Rs144.9 billion was spent under Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) against Rs156.7bn last year,” the Ministry of Finance said in its economic update and outlook for January.
This is despite the fact that the government has committed to increasing unconditional cash transfers, the Kafaalat benefit from Rs13,500 to Rs14,500 to adjust for inflation, and to entail a structural benchmark for end-January 2026 under the IMF programme. The coverage for this programme has also to be expanded by 200,000 to 10.2m families by end of FY26.
The ministry said the economy was well-positioned to sustain its growth momentum in FY26, supported by the encouraging performance of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and other high-frequency indicators. The MoF claimed that this reflected the impact of prudent policies, ongoing structural reforms, and easing of monetary conditions due to subsiding inflationary pressures. “Inflation is expected to remain within the range of 5-6pc in January,” it said.
On the external front, the current account would remain a deficit, the ministry said, hoping that robust remittance inflows and steady performance in IT and services exports would likely “cushion external pressures”.
The improved fiscal management is also expected to continue supporting the macroeconomic stability, it added.
It said the economy completed the first half of the current fiscal year with continued macroeconomic stability, as reflected in contained inflation, rebounding LSM growth, and strengthened foreign exchange reserves, with a stable exchange rate. The sustained growth momentum has been complemented by fiscal discipline, resulting in fiscal and primary surpluses. LSM has gained momentum, signalling improved growth prospects for the remaining period of the fiscal year.
Remittances remained robust, supporting the external account. In parallel, the Pakistan Stock Market has maintained a strong rally, ranking among the world’s top-performing markets and reflecting improved investor sentiment.
Building on these gains, the government has launched economic governance reforms to embed stability in institutions and enable sustainable, private-sector-led growth.

Addressing a press con­­f­e­r­ence, senior leader MQM-P Dr Far­ooq Sattar, along with Haider Abbas Rizvi at the party’s Baha­durabad headquarters, said that Sindh’s current system of governance was “opp­ressive and feudal” and had pushed the province to the brink of collapse.
He said Karachi, des­pite being the country’s econo­mic hub, continued to be deprived of its constitutional and admin­istr­ative rights. He demanded the formation of a judicial com­mission to investigate the recent Gul Plaza blaze and assess broader gov­ern­ance issues in the province.

 

“I urge the federal government and the relevant state institutions to intervene in Sindh’s affairs, act as an arbitrator in Kar­achi’s matters, and constitute a high-level judicial commission to review adm­inistrative failures and the worsening law and order situation in the province,” he said.
Dr Sattar expressed gra­ve concern over the withdrawal of security for MQM-P leaders. He said police headquarters had informed the party that security cover had been removed, creating serious risks.
“After media reports, there were claims that some security arrangements would be restored, but the ground reality remains alarming,” he said, warning that if the Sindh government failed to provide security, the ruling ally would demand protection from the Islamabad police.
He praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, stating that their efforts had restored the dignity of Pakistan’s green passport and improved the country’s standing at the international level.
“Their hard work and sacrifices should not be undermined by the incompetence of the Sindh government,” he said.
Criticising the PPP leadership, Dr Sattar urged PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to demonstrate sincerity towards Karachi by ensuring the implementation of Article 140-A of the Constitution, which mandates the devolution of powers to local governments. He said the 18th Constitutional Amendment was meant for all provinces, not for the continuation of “one-family rule”.
Dr Sattar warned that continued neglect of Karachi’s issues could further aggravate the situation in the city.
“We were mocked when we raised Sindh’s concerns earlier, but today the consequences are visible,” he said, adding that it was time for serious and practical decisions rather than political slogans.
The press conference was also attended by MQM-P leaders Shabbir Qaimkhani, Arshad Vohra, as well as members of the National Assembly and Sindh Assembly.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan denied the MQM-P claims about the withdrawal of security for the party leaders and called it “baseless”.
In a statement, he said that no decision has been taken to withdraw security for the MQM-P leaders.
“Both senior leaders of the party, Mustafa Kamal and Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, are currently in Islamabad,” he said. “There’s no directive from the government regarding the removal of security from any political figure.”

GILGIT / RAWALPINDI: A fresh spell of snowfall brought life to a standstill across parts of Gilgit-Baltistan amid freezing temperatures, power outages and road closures.
Snowfall continued on Monday and Tuesday, blocking the Karakoram Highway (KKH), the Ghizer-Shandur Road, Baltistan Road and several link roads.
Temperatures in upper areas dropped below minus 15 degrees Celsius. Police said that up to six inches of snow was recorded in parts of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang, Hunza, Nagar and Ghizer, disrupting routine life and making travel hazardous.
Residents said the latest snowfall compounded existing hardships. Shafqat Ali, a resident of Astore, told Dawn that road links in upper parts of the district had been cut off. He said roads to Shounter, Dasskharam, Tirshing, Rattu, Gultari, Minimarg, Bobin and other areas were blocked.
In Hunza, Nagar, Shigar and Ghanche, heavy snowfall left roads slippery and risky, cutting off several localities. The situation was particularly difficult for earthquake-affected residents in Chipurson and flood-affected communities in Ghizer, many of whom are living in tents or temporary shelters.
Ali Ahmed, a resident of Chipurson, said more than 200 affected families had been struggling since the recent earthquake and the snowfall had worsened their conditions. Road closures also hampered relief activities.
In Diamer, snowfall since Monday night paralysed life in upper areas, including Tangir, Daril, Thak Babusar and Goharabad. Police said several communication links were blocked, raising fears of food shortages, while residents also faced electricity outages.
Travel between Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country remained suspended on parts of the KKH on Tuesday as snow and rain made sections of the road slippery. In a public advisory, authorities warned of rockfall risks in the KKH’s Gilgit-Kohistan section and urged travellers to avoid unnecessary travel.
Officials in Ghizer said land connectivity to several areas was cut off. Roads in upper parts of Yasin, Phander and Ishkoman were closed, while residents continued to suffer due to prolonged power outages and road blockages.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Yar Muhammad directed the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, district administrations and the Communications and Works Department to clear snow from highways and take timely measures to prevent damage during the ongoing snowfall and rains.
He also urged residents of remote areas to avoid unnecessary travel due to accident risks and directed relevant departments to utilise all available resources to ease public hardship.
Snow blankets Murree
Snow also blanketed Murree and adjoining hills, with the district administration reopening the GT Road to traffic after temporary restrictions.
A Met official said nine inches of snow was recorded at the Murree observatory, with one to two inches in upper hills, while the temperature dropped to minus 3 degrees.
The official said the weather was expected to clear by Wednesday morning, but temperatures could fall further in Murree and the twin cities in the coming days. A westerly wave was affecting upper parts of the country and was likely to persist in northern areas until Wednesday, she added.
“The snowfall stopped in the afternoon and district administration opened the traffic for all kind of traffic.
Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that traffic restrictions were lifted in the afternoon after snowfall subsided. He said vehicular movement on the GT Road had earlier been restricted to locals and visitors with advance hotel bookings, while Murree Expressway remained open.
He said main roads had been cleared, though some link roads were still snow-covered and work was under way to clear them. The deputy commissioner said officials had been deployed on roads, hospitals were functioning normally with sufficient medicine stocks, and there was no electricity breakdown in the hill station.
Divisional Commissioner Amir Khattak also visited Murree to review arrangements, saying that major connecting roads were open and unnecessary closures would not be allowed.
He directed that machinery be kept fully operational during snowfall and roads cleared at the earliest. Tourists were advised to follow official instructions, avoid unnecessary travel and contact facilitation centres and helplines in case of emergencies.
Heavy snowfall in Quetta
The Quetta valley and surrounding areas received heavy snowfall on Tuesday, while Ziarat and several towns across northern and central Balochistan were also blanketed in white, disrupting routine life and affecting traffic on key highways and inter-provincial routes.
The snowfall began around midnight in Quetta and continued until noon with brief breaks. Residents welcomed the spell, saying it had broken a prolonged dry period in the provincial capital and adjoining areas.
Officials said Hanna Urak valley, about 20 kilometres from Quetta, also received snowfall, drawing large numbers of families from the city.
District administration officials said Ziarat received heavy snowfall overnight, which continued into Tuesday noon and led to the closure of the Quetta-Ziarat Road, suspending traffic.
Snowfall was also reported in Zhob, Muslim Bagh, Qila Abdullah, Chaman and the Khojak Pass, Kan Mehtarzai, Khanozai, Toba Kakari, Toba Achakzai, Qila Saifullah, Harnai, Duki, Sanjavi, Mastung, Kalat, Surab, Noshki, Dalbandin and Taftan, among other areas.
Reports said the Quetta-Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan highway was affected, with snow and ice hampering movement between Balochistan and other provinces.

ISLAMABAD: Days after the appointment of leader of the opposition in both the Senate and the National Assembly, the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), is seriously considering rejoining the standing committees of parliament, a move that remains contingent on the consent of its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.
A majority of PTI leaders are said to be keen to regain the chairmanship of standing committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), in order to “resist” what they describe as controversial decisions and policies of the government.
As the final decision to rejoin the committees rests with Mr Khan, political analysts believe he is likely to decide on the matter after the PTI’s countrywide protest scheduled for Feb 8.
PTI previously held the chairmanship of more than a dozen standing committees in the National Assembly and five in the Senate, besides participating in several others. However, on the directives of its founder, the party withdrew from all standing committees in both houses of parliament in August last year.
It has been learnt that a majority of PTI legislators now believe the party should not have exited the standing committees, as doing so allowed the government to function without effective parliamentary scrutiny. They believe Mr Khan’s decision ceded crucial ground to the ruling coalition.
Talking to Dawn, a senior PTI leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many key party decisions were pending and linked to a meeting between the jailed PTI founder, party legislators and his sisters. “The government should arrange a meeting between Imran Khan and party legislators so that he can be convinced that we must rejoin the standing committees,” he said.
He added that relinquishing the chairmanship of the PAC was not a sagacious decision, as the party had used the forum effectively to expose alleged wrongdoing by the government.
The PTI leader said that, besides the PAC, the party should not have vacated three other important committees — finance, law and justice, and human rights.
He recalled that when PTI workers and members of the Punjab Assembly were recently maltreated by the police, the matter was taken up by a privilege committee. “On the other hand, PTI parliamentarians are often humiliated and manhandled by the police, but they cannot take such matters to the privilege committees of the Senate and the National Assembly,” he said.
All decisions linked to jail meeting
PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar, while talking to Dawn, agreed that all pending party decisions were linked to a meeting between Imran Khan and party leaders in jail.
The newly-appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Achakzai, shortly after his maiden speech in the house, declined to comment on the possibility of PTI’s return to the standing committees.
However, PTI acting chairman Barrister Gohar Ali said the decision regarding rejoining the standing committees would be taken by the party’s parliamentary committee.
According to observers, Mr Khan’s decision to exit the standing committees mirrored his move in 2022, when he opted to quit parliament following the no-confidence vote instead of positioning PTI as a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power.
They believe the decision to withdraw from the committees did not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three or four PTI lawmakers from a committee did not affect the quorum, which requires the presence of one-fourth of the total members. Moreover, the departure made little practical difference, as members from the treasury benches replaced PTI representatives. In effect, PTI remained the sole loser in the entire episode.
Courage to disagree
Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said PTI leaders were effectively helpless, even if they favoured a return to the committees, as the authority to decide rested solely with Mr Khan.
He noted that most PTI leaders lacked the courage to even disagree with Mr Khan’s position as they wished to remain in his good books.
Mr Mehboob was of the opinion that Mr Khan would first assess the outcome of PTI’s Feb 8 countrywide protest and then decide on the issue of standing committees.
He said democracy required PTI to return to the committees and play an effective role. However, he added, Mr Khan remained the final authority. “A lack of opposition representation in these important committees negatively impacts the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” he said.
Calling the situation ironic, the Pildat chief said PTI’s decision to leave all standing committees, including the PAC, echoed its earlier move to quit the National Assembly and relinquish governments in provinces.
Meanwhile, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat said NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had advised PTI on several occasions to return to the committees and that any such move by the party would be welcomed by the secretariat.

The IGA between the two sides was proposed by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik here during his meeting with the new Australian High Commissioner (AHC) to Pakistan, Timothy Kane.
It builds on a July 2025 Australian proposal made through former AHC Neil Hawkins for collaboration between Australian universities, mining firms, and Pakistani institutions to provide specialised training programmes in modern mining techniques and services and enhance local expertise and support Pakistan’s mining sector development.
An official statement said the new AHC Kane and the petroleum minister discussed avenues for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors. The minister welcomed the strong interest of Australian companies in Pakistan’s mining sector and highlighted the country’s immense untapped mineral potential, particularly in the Tethyan Belt.
“He proposed the possibility of an IGA between Pakistan and Australia to promote structured and long-term cooperation in the mining sector,” the statement said.

Discuss possibility of long-term cooperation agreement to tap country’s vast mineral potential

Australia had been operating in Pakistan’s mineral and natural resources sector, almost in all resource-rich regions, including Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, mostly in research and exploration and identified critical reserves in copper, gold, coal, zinc and other precious resources, including oil and gas.
Australian BHP Billiton’s joint venture with the Geological Survey of Pakistan had led to the discovery of the multi-billion dollar Reko Diq copper-gold deposits, now being developed for commercial production by Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada. BHP had left Pakistan under its global restructuring almost two decades ago.
Mr Malik briefed the new envoy about the government’s efforts to develop and formalise the gemstones sector to unleash its true potential for value addition, exports, and employment generation.
The AHC reiterated that Australian companies were already actively involved in the Reko Diq project, and additional Australian firms had shown keen interest in joining the project. He said the Australian companies would be encouraged to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF), expressing hope for a strong Australian presence at the event.
The diplomat highlighted the growing global importance of copper and gold for the energy transition, adding that Pakistan’s mining sector had attracted significant international attention. He also expressed “optimism for collaboration in the gemstones sector through knowledge exchange, training, and technical assistance”, the statement said.
The two sides also discussed the recent visit of the petroleum minister to Australia for the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) and the fruitful discussions with leading and junior Australian mining companies on investment and cooperation opportunities in Pakistan’s minerals sector. The two sides agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors for mutual benefit.
The presence of mineral deposits in the Reko Diq area was identified by the Geological Survey of Pakistan in the early 1990s in collaboration with BHP Billiton of Australia. Later in 2000, Tethyan Corporation (TCC) of Australia took over the project from BHP and invested $30 million by raising funds through an international listing and drilled over 75,000 meters to prove the reserves.
The TCC was subsequently taken over by two of the world’s largest copper and gold mining firms — Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada for A$158 million ($130m) at the time. The agreement between Pakistan and the two mining firms signed in the Musharraf era ran into trouble, leading to international arbitration followed by an out-of-court settlement for penalties and project revival. In the process, the Reko Diq project production, due in 2010, was delayed by at least 15 years.
It was announced at the time of discovery by GSP and BHP that the Reko Diq mining area had proven estimated reserves of two billion tonnes of copper and 20 million ounces of gold, valued at $65bn at the time.
The recent feasibility studies completed by Barrick have also established that the project would have a 45 million tonnes of throughput per annum (Mpta) for the first five years and then 90 Mpta for the following 32 years of the second phase. Based on existing reserves, the Reko Diq project is expected to yield production of 13.1m tonnes of copper and 17.9m ounces of gold over the life of the mine (100pc basis), according to state-run Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), one of the shareholders.
The feasibility study has also confirmed a lucrative 25pc rate of return on investment on one of the biggest copper-gold projects. Under the updated feasibility study, Phase 1 is planned to process 45m tonnes of mill-feed annually (Mtpa) from 2028. Previously, it was estimated to be close to 40m tonnes. By 2034, Phase 2 is planned to double the processing capacity to 90Mtpa.

In the written order seen by Dawn, Justice Ahmad Nadeem Arshad observed that the veracity of the allegations cannot be determined without recording evidence and that repeated public statements while the matter was sub judice could amount to a “parallel media trial, which is neither permissible nor desirable in the interest of justice and fair adjudication”.
The judge subsequently dismissed the plea filed by Shafi challenging the gag order issued by the trial court on Jan 24, 2019.
Zafar had claimed that the allegations levelled against him by Shafi were false and had damaged his reputation. Along with the defamation suit, he had sought an interim injunction to prevent the defendant female singer from issuing further statements on the matter.
The trial court had accepted Zafar’s application and passed an order which stated: “The defendant shall not make any statement which is relevant to the controversy of defamation of plaintiff in this case till the decision of this suit.”
The written order by the LHC said that during the arguments, Meesha’s counsel had argued that an injunction could not be granted in a defamation suit. He further said that injunctions in defamation cases should only be granted in exceptional circumstances.
Meanwhile, Zafar’s counsel had opposed Shafi’s petition, pointing out the irreparable harm to his client’s reputation through public statements made by the petitioner, it noted.
In his judgment, Justice Arshad held that there was no “absolute bar” in the law on granting injunctions in defamation cases and that interim protection may be justified in exceptional circumstances to prevent irreparable harm to reputation.
He noted that reputation, once damaged, could not be restored through monetary compensation and that the balance of convenience favoured maintaining the injunction.
The judge said that for a public figure whose career and livelihood depended upon public perception and trust, the continuous circulation of unproven allegations would cause harm that could not be quantified in terms of money.
“The allegations levelled against him (respondent), if found to be untrue, are of such a nature that they directly strike at his dignity, honour and professional credibility,” the judge added.
He said the material available on record prima facie showed that the suit raised “serious triable issues requiring evidence, therefore, the respondent cannot be left remedyless, during the pendency of the proceedings”.
On the contrary, the judge noted, the petitioner (Shafi) would not suffer any irreparable prejudice by being restrained from making statements pertaining to the controversy till the matter was decided on merit.
He said the restraint imposed was temporary in nature and subject to the final outcome of the suit. The judge ruled that the trial court had exercised its discretion properly by imposing a limited restriction rather than a blanket prohibition.
The judge also held that the order did not violate freedom of expression, stating that such freedom was subject to reasonable restrictions and must be balanced with the right to dignity.
Justice Arshad observed that following the principles of Bonnard v. Perryman (1981), an interim injunction restraining the petitioner from making any statement regarding the subject matter of the alleged defamation until the disposal of the suit was justified.
Dismissing Shafi’s petition, the judge also directed the trial court to decide the main defamation suit expeditiously, preferably within 30 days, as the case was currently at the stage of final arguments.
In his suit, Zafar said Shafi had posted on Twitter (now X) on April 19, 2018 and levelled baseless allegations of sexual harassment against him, which resulted in tarnishing his image in public.
He said the female singer failed to delete the post and issue an apology within 14 days of a legal notice served on her. He had asked the court to issue a decree against Shafi directing her to pay Rs1 billion as damages to him.</p><small>2026-01-27 19:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/272328391460888.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969373/president-zardari-uae-counterpart-discuss-way-to-further-deepen-ties' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari, UAE counterpart discuss way to further deepen ties</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari met his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday, with both leaders discussing ways to further deepen ties between the two countries.
According to the President’s Secretariat, President Zardari, who is currently undertaking a four-day official visit to the Gulf country, met his UAE counterpart while being accompanied by a high-level delegation.
“The leaders discussed ways to further deepen the longstanding and brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE,” the statement said.







“They reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral cooperation and explored new opportunities in trade, investment, energy, infrastructure, technology, and people-to-people exchanges, highlighting the significant potential for expanding economic and strategic partnership,” the statement said.
President Zardari highlighted the significance of the UAE president’s recent visit to Pakistan and expressed “appreciation for the UAE’s continued support for strengthening bilateral ties”.
“Both sides also exchanged views on a range of regional and international developments and reaffirmed their commitment to promoting peace, stability, and sustainable development,” the statement said.
“President Zardari’s visit underscores the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Pakistan and the UAE,” it stated.
Earlier in the day, the president had met with UAE Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi, according to a separate statement by the President’s Secretariat. He also paid tribute to the leadership of the UAE president.
“The meeting underscored the importance of promoting dialogue, inclusivity, and peaceful coexistence,” the handout said.
It said the president paid tribute to the visionary leadership of the Emirati president and “lauded the UAE’s national vision of tolerance and human fraternity, noting that it has positioned the country as a leading global example of harmony among diverse communities”.
“He appreciated the UAE’s success in fostering unity and mutual respect among over 200 nationalities as a compelling model of social cohesion,” it added.







President Zardari noted that “these values strongly resonate with Pakistan’s own commitment to interfaith harmony, social inclusion, and respect for cultural and religious diversity, as enshrined in its Constitution and societal traditions”.
First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE were also present on the occasion, according to the statement.
Meanwhile, AD Ports Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi also paid a courtesy call to President Zardari.
A separate handout said the president appreciated the group’s “long-term investment and growing role in Pakistan’s maritime and logistics sector, describing it as a key pillar of Pakistan–UAE economic cooperation”.







“He highlighted the group’s ongoing investments at Karachi Port as instrumental in enhancing port capacity, efficiency, and regional competitiveness,” it added.
The statement said that both sides agreed that “the expansion and modernisation of port infrastructure would strengthen trade flows and support Pakistan’s broader economic development and the country’s seaborne trade”.
“President Zardari also welcomed the establishment of AD Ports Group’s representative office in Islamabad and appreciated the group’s collaboration on digital and customs facilitation initiatives aimed at improving trade efficiency,” it added.
According to the Foreign Office, during the four-day official visit, the president will hold high-level meetings with the UAE’s leadership to review the “full spectrum of bilateral ties, especially in the domains of trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties”.







It said that Zardari’s trip, which follows the brief visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan last month, “reflects the deep brotherly ties between the two nations and reaffirms commitment to transforming the strong friendship between Pakistan and the UAE into a mutually rewarding partnership”.</p><small>2026-01-27 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/27173019c74aa8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969364/pti-says-imran-suffering-from-ailment-that-could-permanently-damage-his-eyesight-if-not-treated-promptly' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says Imran suffering from ailment that could permanently damage his eyesight if not treated promptly</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Tuesday again raised concerns about the health of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, saying it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly.
In a statement released on the social media platform X, the party demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and associates. It also demanded that he be allowed medical treatment at a hospital of his own choice.







The statement said the party had learnt through credible media reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”.
“According to medical experts who reportedly checked him in jail, this is an extremely sensitive and serious medical condition which, if not treated promptly and properly, carries a high risk of permanent damage to his eyesight,” the party said.
“Despite this, the jail administration is stubbornly insisting that the treatment be carried out inside the jail, while the attending specialist doctor has clearly stated that such treatment is not possible in jail and that it requires an operation theatre and specialized medical facilities,” the party said, adding that this “reckless attitude” put Imran’s vision and his overall health in grave danger.
It said that Imran was last granted access to his personal physician in October 2024, who had not been allowed to examine him since then, despite order issued by the Islamabad High Court.
“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights. Moreover, a petition regarding Imran Khan’s regular medical check-ups has been pending since August 2025, which is being deliberately ignored. The government’s conduct clearly demonstrates that, in its obsession with political vendetta, it is willing to gamble with the life and health of a prisoner,” the party said.
It demanded that Imran be immediately allowed an unrestricted meeting with his family and close associates so that the “public may be reassured about his condition”.
“We also demand that he be allowed without delay to Shaukat Khanum Hospital or to any other reputable hospital of his own choice, where he can receive proper treatment under the supervision of qualified specialists with full medical facilities. We strongly appeal to the judiciary to treat this as a matter of health and human life, not politics, and to ensure that no negligence or delay is allowed in his medical care,” it said.
The statement said that if there was permanent damage to Imran’s eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be responsible as they were “obstructing his treatment despite clear medical advice and court orders”.
Shaukat Khanum Hospital, which was established by Imran, also issued a statement, saying it was “gravely concerned” about the ex-premier’s health.
“While we have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians currently looking after him, we nevertheless request that a team of physicians from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be given immediate access to Khan sahib and be allowed to participate in his care so as to reassure all those who are concerned for his welfare,” the statement said.







Imran’s sisters question reports about his ailment
For their part, Imran’s sisters raised doubts about the reports of his ailment. The three, among other PTI supporters and workers, had gathered near Adiala jail — where Imran is incarcerated — on Tuesday. Speaking at the spot, one of Imran’s sisters, Noreen Khanum, was asked to comment on the restriction on meetings with Imran.
In response, Noreen said, “We come here to [protest] against the cruelty being meted out to Imran.”
She also addressed the reports of Imran having an eye ailment, saying: “If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment.”
Without naming anyone, she alleged that “they [float rumours] as a tester, they lie to worry and disappoint the people and this is why I don’t believe this.”
She asserted that Imran was healthy and fit, further warning that “if they are planning to do something, then damaging Imran’s eyes will mean that even their eye will not be spared”.
Imran’s other sister, Aleema Khanum, said no one from the jail administration was sharing any details about him with his family and lawyers.
“So who has leaked this news? Which institution has leaked this? Because can you believe that this can be leaked without the involvement of any agency?” she said, adding, “We have just one demand: release Imran Khan.”







She also said that Imran had been imprisoned for the past two-and-a-half years because he was adamant that he “will not secure his release through a deal”.
The ex-premier’s third sister, Uzma Khanum, said that she had last met her brother on December 2, 2025 for just 20 minutes. “During that conversation, he said nothing about his eyesight,” she said.
However, Uzma continued, in a meeting held two months earlier, Imran had told her that he had an infection in his right eye, but only eye drops were given to him.
Presently, “we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him”, she said.
Aleema spoke to the media again at night, saying that the last time Imran met someone was two months ago when his lawyer, Salman Safdar, was allowed to meet him for eight minutes.
Later, the PTI claimed in a post on X that Aleema was stopped by police when she was returning from the Adiala jail.







The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also alleged in a statement that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” when they were returning from the Adiala jail.
The statement said that Imran’s sisters were not just barred from meeting him, but also “wrongfully confined” while they were returning.
“This act is another clear example of the brutal and illegitimate use of state power, the objective behind which is to scare citizens and intensify political revenge,” the statement said.
The TTAP demanded that Imran and his family be allowed to meet, the fundamental right of peaceful assembly and free movement be respected, and legal action be taken against those responsible for the wrongful confinement of Imran’s sisters.
PTI MNAs file fresh plea for meeting Imran
Separately, PTI MNA arrives at the IHC to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, along with MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan, Shehryar Afridi, Salman Akram Raja, Aamir Dogar, Ali Asghar Khan and Shahzada Gustasp, among others, appeared at the IHC court premises and completed the biometric verification to submit their application.
Speaking to the media outside the IHC, Gohar said that Tuesdays were the designated day for meetings with Imran. He said that the party leadership had approached the IHC chief justice multiple times but had not been granted a meeting.







He added that a letter signed by PTI MNAs was being submitted to the IHC chief justice, requesting that meetings with the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi be scheduled in accordance with the law and court orders.
The PTI chairman also expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi stressing that meeting a prisoner was a fundamental legal right and should not be politicised.
Gohar reiterated that PTI’s mandate had been “robbed” and reiterated the opposition’s nationwide protest call for February 8, including a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike, calling on shopkeepers and transporters to participate.
PTI Secretary General Raja said that the youth’s right to vote had been snatched. He called for a peaceful protest and expressed concern over reports that Imran was suffering from an eye problem. He added that the party would raise these concerns with the IHC chief justice.







Separately, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka extended interim bail to Imran in five additional cases related to May 9 and to Bushra Bibi in a fake receipts case related to the Toshakhana.
The PTI founder could not be presented before the court, either physically or via video link, due to which arguments could not be concluded. The court ordered that he be presented at the next hearing and extended interim bail until February 6.</p><small>2026-01-27 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2716260304e71d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969360/no-question-of-military-operation-in-tirah-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No question of military operation in Tirah: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah, insisting that migration was a routine practice in the valley.
Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan.
The press conference came two days after the federal and provincial governments traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of planned military action against terrorists.
The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles.
At the outset of the press conference, the defence minister said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said.
The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, who were to migrate.
“The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government.
On Sunday, the information ministry had also referred to the same notification by the KP Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement department for the release of funds, reportedly Rs4 billion, for the anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of the population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh). These funds were seemingly required for relief-related arrangements for those leaving Tirah.
The ministry also asserted that the armed forces or the federal government had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah.
During the press conference, Asif said that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have not carried out an operation in years in favour of IBOs,” he said.
The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.”
Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice.
He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. The minister claimed that there was a “complete absence of civilian law enforcement agencies” in Tirah. “There is no police station there,” he added.
Asif further stated that hemp was being harvested in Tirah over 12,000 acres. Hemp harvested over each acre gave a profit of around Rs3-3.5 million, he said, adding that “this is a major factor” in this matter.
He said that hemp had several uses, including in medicines, construction material and bricks.
“Hemp is harvested there and dividends earned from it either go to the people associated with politics or the TTP. We have initiated measures to stop this, so that [Tirah’s] people benefit from this harvest, and schools and hospitals are constructed there,” Asif added.
He went on to allege that the interests of the provincial government aligned with those of the TTP in Tirah, “as they are together exploiting this source (hemp)”.
The minister recalled that the jirga in Tirah had held meetings on December 11, 21 and 31 last year on the matter.
“It has been meeting the civilian government. You don’t see the military anywhere in this [matter]. And this jirga was constituted many years ago […] And all 24 members of the jirga are onboard. All the things that I have listed that are required there [Tirah], it is their (jirga) demand. Now, in the presence of the jirga and this notification, where do you see the military’s [involvement] in this?” Asif said.
He alleged that the KP government wanted to deflect the blame for its “failures” to the military or an operation that did not even exist.
Then, ostensibly referring to the movement of people in Tirah, he maintained that this “tradition has been in place for decades” due to the climate and topography of the area. It was even mentioned in a gazette from the British era, he added. “This transition takes place every year.”
“This is nothing unusual, but the PTI government has tried to make it [appear] unusual,” he said. Moreover, the KP government had claimed spending Rs2-4bn on setting up camps for the evacuated residents, he said, alleging that those camps did not protect from the cold.
He again asserted that the military presence or an operation in Tirah was an “assumption”. “No operation has been carried out there for years,” he maintained.
He added that if the KP government wanted to work for the betterment of the people of Tirah, the federal government would provide it with the wherewithal needed for that purpose.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Tarar said it was stated in the official gazetteer in the 1880s that the Afridi and Akakhel tribes of Khyber descended and migrated to other areas in winters and returned to Tirah in summers. “This is an established fact,” he insisted.
For his part, PM’s aide Wali said it needed to be uncovered how much money from the Rs4bn package approved by the provincial government had reached the people who had been “forced to relocate”.
“Because the PTI has been in power [in KP] for 13 years. They create such programmes and use these funds for campaigns such as street movements,” he alleged.
Wali further highlighted that the KP government’s notification said that the movement of people from Tirah would be “voluntary”.
“This proves my points that a project was created to mint money,” he argued, adding that the armed forces had nothing to do with the movement of people in Tirah.
The PM’s aide said that to his understanding, the people of Tirah would be used to ensure the success of the opposition’s protest on February 8.
Following that, a journalist sought confirmation of the number of people who had left Tirah, saying that international media had reported that 65 per cent had vacated their houses.
To that, Asif said, “People escape the snowfall in the area and relocate. And more or less 65pc of the people migrate […] There is historical evidence of this. And this will continue to happen in the future as well”.
He said that this matter had been “politicised”, asserting that an impression had been created as if “forced relocation” had been taking place in Tirah.
“And it is being linked to us. Even if forced [relocation] is taking place, it is between the provincial government and the population. We or the military have nothing to do with it.
“The military has been carrying out IBOs there and will continue to do so. As I said, there are around 500 TTP members there […] The military conducts IBOs and weeds them out,” he said.
When asked about KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s claim that he had not been involved in talks with tribal elders from Tirah, Asif said: “This is his and his government’s problem. The talks were held with his government, and if he was not in the loop, that is not my problem or the problem of the federal government.”
He also alleged that some TTP militants had been paying extortion money to some individuals in the KP government.
In response to another question, he clarified that no operation was being carried out in Tirah.
The minister was also asked whether the option of reversing the decision to merge erstwhile tribal areas with KP was being considered in a potential “next amendment”. Asif said no such proposal was being considered.
Asked who formed the jirga that held talks regarding the evacuation of people from Tirah, Asif insisted that it was the provincial government.
A journalist also pointed out to the government representatives that migration from Tirah had been taking place in late October or early November. “What migration is this that a man, along with his five children, goes towards his death?” he questioned.
At that, Information Minister Tarar reasoned that it was due to the shift in weather patterns due to climate change. “Previously, there was no snowfall at the end of January. It used to start in November,” he said.
‘Injustice is being done’
Separately, KP CM Afridi also issued a video statement on the situation in Tirah, condemning a planned “military operation” in the valley and warning that “decisions taken behind closed doors have once again pushed the region toward instability, displacement and distrust”.
The KP CM’s statement in Pashto was a repeat of his earlier rebuke of the Centre on the matter, in which he said that “people are being forcibly displaced due to a military operation, the decision for which was taken behind closed doors”.
In his latest video statement, he said that “harsh conditions have once again been imposed on Tirah Valley”.







The CM further recalled that after PTI founder Imran Khan was removed from power in 2022, “warnings were issued in Khyber, Hazara, Malakand, Dera Ismail Khan and Waziristan about terrorism and instability again being imposed on the Pashtun belt”.
“Peace jirgas and public mobilisation campaigns were organised to alert the people that their future was being traded without their consent,” he added.
He criticised the then-Pakistan Democratic Movement government for dismissing those warnings as “propaganda”, claiming that people came out in large numbers and rejected the “decisions taken behind closed doors”.
Afridi said that presently, there was peace in the districts where the decisions were rejected, while terrorism had reared its head in areas where the warnings were ignored.
“Decisions taken behind closed doors not just toppled a democratic government but also triggered the return of terrorism and economic collapse, forcing investors and young people to search for opportunities abroad,” he lamented.
Referring specifically to Tirah, he said he had raised his voice against “imposing decisions” that were taken without the public consent and questioned the logic of launching another operation when “22 major and more than 14,000 IBOs had failed to eliminate terrorism”.
The KP CM recalled that a jirga held at the KP Assembly had finalised a 15-point agenda. He said the jirga also unanimously agreed that a military operation was not a solution and that sustainable peace could only be achieved through dialogue and consensus.
Despite that, he said, another “operation was being imposed”. The CM also claimed that the 24-member committee that was said to have held talks on a military operation in Tirah was headed by the corps commander and frontier corps inspector general.
“Elders of the Afridi [tribe] were told to vacate their houses on the pretext of militants operating from residential areas. Despite people’s objections, they were forced to leave their homes during the harsh winter and amid snowfall.
“And the world is now witnessing elderly people, women, and children being displaced in freezing conditions while the operation, too, cannot be carried out due to snowfall,” he said.
In light of this, he raised questioned the purpose and wisdom behind the decision to conduct a military operation. The CM said that the operation was being launched to malign him and destablise his government.
“But, the people continue to show me respect and support.”
He also condemned the information ministry’s statement on the situation in Tirah, according to which the valley’s residents were leaving their homes voluntarily.
The CM termed the statement “dangerous and an attempt to create conflict between the province and federal government and institutions”. It was also an attempt to “erode public trust in the leadership and state institutions”, he said.
Afridi reiterated his announcement of holding a grand jirga of all tribes residing in Khyber on the coming Sunday at 2pm at Jamrud Football Stadium. He said displaced people will be asked at the meeting whether they had left their homes voluntarily or were forced to do so.
“Then, the world will see that injustice is being done,” the CM remarked.
He said that the people of KP were “not subjects to be experimented upon and their blood is not cheap”. Their dignity must be respected, he stressed.
Afridi said his government had released Rs4bn for the displaced families, adding that previous military operations had resulted in the destruction of houses while promises of compensation to those affected also remained unfulfilled.
The KP government was resolute that it would not abandon its people “in the face of decisions taken in secrecy”, he emphasised, reaffirming that he stood with the Pashtun people and would defend their rights till his last breath.</p><small>2026-01-27 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/272037560c512fe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969374/atomic-scientists-set-doomsday-clock-closer-to-midnight-than-ever' target='_blank'><strong>Atomic scientists set ‘Doomsday Clock’ closer to midnight than ever</strong></a><br><p>Atomic scientists set their “Doomsday Clock” on Tuesday closer than ever to midnight, citing aggressive behaviour by nuclear powers Russia, China and the United States, fraying nuclear arms control, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and artificial intelligence (AI) worries among factors driving risks for global disaster.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the theoretical point of annihilation. That is four seconds closer than it was set last year.
The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world.
The scientists voiced concern about threats of unregulated integration of AI into military systems and its potential misuse in aiding the creation of biological threats, as well as its role in spreading disinformation globally. They also noted continuing challenges posed by climate change.
“Of course, the Doomsday Clock is about global risks, and what we have seen is a global failure in leadership,” nuclear policy expert Alexandra Bell, the Bulletin’s president and CEO, told Reuters.
“No matter the government, a shift towards neo-imperialism and an Orwellian approach to governance will only serve to push the clock toward midnight.”
It was the third time in the past four years that the scientists moved the clock closer to midnight.
“In terms of nuclear risks, nothing in 2025 trended in the right direction,” Bell said.
“Longstanding diplomatic frameworks are under duress or collapsing, the threat of explosive nuclear testing has returned, proliferation concerns are growing, and there were three military operations taking place under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the associated escalatory threat. The risk of nuclear use is unsustainably and unacceptably high.”
Bell pointed to Russia’s continued war in Ukraine, the US and Israeli bombing of Iran and border clashes between India and Pakistan.
Bell also cited continuing tensions in Asia, including on the Korean Peninsula and China’s threats toward Taiwan, as well as rising tensions in the Western Hemisphere since US President Donald Trump returned to office 12 months ago.
The last remaining nuclear arms pact between the United States and Russia, the New START treaty, expires on February 5.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the two countries agree to observe for another year the limits set under the pact, which caps each side’s number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550.
Trump has not formally responded.
Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin’s offer.
Trump in October ordered the US military to restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of more than three decades. No nuclear power, other than North Korea, most recently in 2017, has conducted explosive nuclear testing in more than a quarter-century.
No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the US State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability.
‘Aggressive and nationalistic’
Trump has upended the world order. He sent US forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, threatened other Latin American countries, vowed to restore US dominance in the Western Hemisphere, talked about annexing Greenland and imperilled transatlantic security cooperation.
Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there is no end in sight. Among the weapons Russia has used is the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile.
Russia released a video in December of what it said was the deployment of the Oreshnik in Belarus, a move meant to boost the Russian ability to strike targets across Europe.
“Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have become increasingly aggressive and nationalistic,” Bell said.
Their “winner-takes-all great power competition” undermines the international cooperation needed to reduce risks of nuclear war, climate change, misuse of biotechnology, potential AI-related hazards and other apocalyptic dangers, Bell said.
Bell also cited Trump’s domestic actions against science, academia, the civil service and news organisations.
Maria Ressa, a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her journalistic efforts exposing abuses of power in the Philippines, including how social media platforms were used to spread disinformation, participated in the announcement.
“We are living through an information Armageddon — the crisis beneath all crises - driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division,” Ressa said in a statement.

She issued these directives at a provincial cabinet meeting in Lahore — which was broadcast live on television — three days after a fire at a hotel in the provincial capital’s Gulberg area claimed three lives.
Seven people sustained burn injuries in the incident, while 275 staff members and guests were safely evacuated from the hotel.
Following the incident, Maryam also directed the DCs — who attended the cabinet meeting — to ensure that all under-construction buildings had fire safety systems installed before work was completed.
“Make sure that all the safety equipment is functional as well,” she emphasised.
The chief minister further instructed that the prices of fire hydrants should be “locked” for the next 90 days, as the prices might surge due to the increasing demand.
Moreover, she instructed that all the commercial plazas should have “first aid [facilities], oxygen cylinders, automatic water sprinkling systems and ventilated emergency staircases, preferably outside the building”.
Maryam added that “no boilers and hazardous or smoke-emitting material” should be allowed in the basements of buildings.
“Seal every substandard boiler immediately because when it explodes, it causes widespread destruction and claims lives,” she said, adding that no life should be lost in a fire incident because one death affected an entire family.
The Punjab CM also noted that those working in markets where chemicals, plastic and garments were sold “take safety very lightly” when dealing with sensitive or hazardous materials.
“Encroachments, over-stuffing and tight spaces also cause blockage and suffocation during an emergency,” she further stated, adding that when panic spreads in such situations, people get “trapped” because of unplanned structures.
“We must ensure that all encroachments are removed, and all entry and exit points must be cleared,” she stressed.
Commending her team for their rescue efforts during the fire at the hotel in Gulberg, she said, “Our government becomes one unit at the time of any emergency”.
Maryam also highlighted that the response time of Rescue 1122 team in the incident was just five minutes, which prevented a possible tragedy.
She also expressed grief over the recent fire in Karachi’s Gul Plaza, saying that her government stands with the aggrieved and is ready to extend any help if needed.</p><small>2026-01-27 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2716595821d679c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969363/trump-says-iran-wants-talks-as-us-aircraft-carrier-deploys' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Iran wants talks as US aircraft carrier deploys</strong></a><br><p>A US naval strike force led by an aircraft carrier was in Middle Eastern waters on Tuesday as Iran vowed to hit back against any strike and President Donald Trump said he believed the Islamic republic still wanted talks.
Washington has not ruled out new military intervention against Tehran over its crackdown on protests, which saw over 3,000 killed within days, according to Iranian media.
A strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln has now arrived in Middle Eastern waters, US Central Command said, without revealing its precise location.
Since Iran earlier this month launched the crackdown on protests accompanied by a blanket internet blackout, Trump has given mixed signals on intervention.
“We have a big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela,” Trump told the Axios news site, weeks after US military action resulted in the capture of the Latin American nation’s president Nicolas Maduro.

 

But he added: “They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk.”
Axios said Trump declined to discuss the options presented to him by his national security team, or which one he prefers.
Analysts say options include strikes on military facilities or targeted hits against the leadership under Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a full-scale bid to bring down the system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah.
‘Weakest point’
The New York Times, meanwhile, reported that Trump has received multiple US intelligence reports “indicating that the Iranian government’s position is weakening” and signalling its hold on power “is at its weakest point” since the shah’s fall.
US Senator Lindsey Graham told the paper he had spoken with Trump in recent days about Iran and that “the goal is to end the regime”.
“They may stop killing them today, but if they’re in charge next month, they’ll kill them then,” he added.
Iranian officials have over the last days appeared wary of pouring oil on the fire.
Tehran has in the past said a channel of communication is open between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US envoy Steve Witkoff, despite the lack of diplomatic relations between the two foes.
But the Hamshahri conservative newspaper on Tuesday quoted Revolutionary Guards spokesman Mohammad Ali Naini as saying that “if their aircraft carrier made a mistake and entered Iranian territorial waters, it would be targeted”.

 

The conservative Javan newspaper said Iran was “ready for a major response” and would seize the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for energy supplies.
Meanwhile, an anti-US billboard has appeared in Tehran that appears to show an American aircraft carrier being destroyed.
‘Mass arrests, intimidation’
Rights groups have described the crackdown as the deadliest ever against protests in Iran and warn compiling tolls has been complicated by an almost three-week internet blackout that they say is aimed at masking the extent of the repression.
A statement by Iran’s foundation for veterans and martyrs, cited by state television, has said 3,117 people were killed during protests which first erupted in late December.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has claimed that thousands of people have been arrested.
“Security agencies continue to pursue an approach centred on mass arrests, intimidation, and control of the narrative,” HRANA said.
Activists have accused authorities of raiding hospitals to find injured protesters and then arresting them. The health ministry has said all people should present themselves at hospital without worry and not treat themselves at home.</p><small>2026-01-27 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/27144010ff49410.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969358/sindh-cabinet-approves-compensation-package-for-families-of-gul-plaza-victims' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh cabinet approves compensation package for families of Gul Plaza victims</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Cabinet on Tuesday approved the relief and rehabilitation package — announced last week — for the families of the victims of the Gul Plaza inferno in Karachi, which includes Rs10 million as financial compensation.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had earlier announced the compensation on January 19.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
After nine days of scouring through the rubble to locate remains of the dead and missing, the search operation concluded on Sunday.
According to a press release issued by the Chief Minister’s House today, during the meeting, the cabinet expressed grief over the loss of lives in the Gul Plaza tragedy and approved Rs10m for the families of the deceased, along with the Rs10m “interest-free loans” for shopkeepers affected by the devastating blaze.







The chief minister held that “there can be no compromise on human life. Relief, justice, and prevention must go hand in hand”.
“In addition, Rs500,000 per shopkeeper will be provided as immediate subsistence support to cover household and utility expenses,” the statement added.
During the cabinet meeting, the Sindh CM also directed that “alternative commercial spaces be provided within two months to enable shopkeepers to resume their businesses”.
The provincial cabinet also approved the constitution of a high-level subcommittee to examine the fact-finding report and take “all legal remedial actions”.
The cabinet subcommittee — chaired by CM Murad and including ministers Sharjeel Inam Memon, Nasir Hussain Shah, Saeed Ghani, and Ziaul Hassan Lanjar — would present its report in the next cabinet meeting, a notification said.
“No negligence will be overlooked. Those found responsible will be held accountable,” the CM was quoted as saying.
On January 19, CM Murad had announced that an inquiry committee headed by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi was being set up to probe the Gul Plaza fire.
He asserted that the inquiry’s aim was not to point blame but to acknowledge and correct one’s mistakes.
Separately, the provincial cabinet also approved Rs19.116 billion for the “ immediate execution” of six major road infrastructure projects in the metropolis, the press statement said.
“These include the Star Gate flyover, Malir Halt underpass, Sohrab Goth flyover, and the reconstruction of important arteries linking M-9 to Malir and Main Korangi Road to Khayaban-i-Saadi,” it added.
“These projects are essential for easing congestion, improving road safety, and supporting Karachi’s economic activity,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.
4 more victims identified
Meanwhile, four more deceased individuals from the Gul Plaza blaze were identified, Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said.
Hence, the number of those identified now stands at 27, out of the 73 deaths confirmed as of yet.
In a post on X, Dr Syed said 73 remains had been “medicolegally  processed”, out of whom 20 had been identified through DNA matching.

The MQM-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the PPP have been engaged in a war of words since the Gul Plaza inferno, trading blame over improper governance during the tenure of their respective party mayors.
Speaking to Geo News earlier today, MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal replied in the affirmative when asked whether he was among the MQM leaders whose security protocol had reportedly been withdrawn by the Sindh government.
The MQM-P leader, who also serves as the federal health minister, insisted that the action was “in response” to his party’s criticism of the Sindh government and to “scare them”.
Instead, Kamal argued, the provincial government’s alleged action supported the MQM-P’s stance that Karachi be “taken in the Centre’s control”.



“Karachi should not be in control of an incompetent provincial government like Sindh’s,” he said, adding the Sindh government could not “suppress our voices” by taking these measures.
He went on to say that the provision of security did not matter to them.
However, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar rejected the MQM-P’s claims, with the latter stating that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked.
The MQM-Haqiqi (MQM-H) had also said the Sindh government has withdrawn security from party chairman Afaq Ahmed.
In a statement, MQM-H Vice Chairman Shaukat Farooqi condemned the alleged move, saying it indicated that the PPP was afraid of Ahmed.
‘Sindh govt stepping back from responsibility’
Addressing a press conference in Karachi after the Sindh government’s denial, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said, “You withdrew security. Even if some individuals’ security was restored, then also restore whatever little security you had given as a formality to our MNAs and MPAs.”
Stressing that it was the Sindh government’s responsibility to provide security, Sattar said, “If you would not provide, then we will ask the Islamabad police and the prime minister to send their police.
“And then gradually make this a federal territory,” he added, reiterating his party’s demand.



The MQM-P leader contended that by revoking the security of “all” its MNAs and MPAs, including party convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, the Sindh government was distancing itself from its duties.
He stressed that it was the Sindh Police that had alerted them about a threat to their lives, and the same provincial government was stepping back from the responsibility to guarantee their security.
“Then this means someone will have to take responsibility. Should we then ask Islamabad Police to provide us security?” Sattar said.
‘Those entitled have security’
In a statement, the Sindh home minister clarified that security has not been withdrawn from any MQM leaders.
He stated that Kamal, the federal health minister, and Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui were currently in Islamabad, adding that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked.
Lanjar added that security arrangements for political leaders, including those from the MQM, will continue unchanged.
Speaking to reporters later in the day, the Sindh senior minister also dismissed the MQM-P’s claims.
“The home minister has categorically told the media that no security has been withdrawn from MQM,” Memon asserted, saying that the party was engaged in “propaganda” and a “campaign”.
The minister clarified that even Sindh Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi still has the security allotted to him.
“Whoever is entitled to it, they all have security,” Memon said, adding that those not entitled, needed to submit a request to the government along with their reasons.







“Federal ministers in Islamabad roam around with a single police official. Here, they have been allotted 10 police personnel each. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has 10 police officers; Mustafa Kamal may have more than that.”
He also noted that MQM-P leaders who were federal ministers — namely Kamal and Siddiqui — were in Islamabad as per his reports. “So, did you have to take the security along with you?” he asked rhetorically.
Earlier in the day, Sindh government spokesperson MPA Sadia Javed told Geo News that she was unaware of any such move to withdraw security, adding that it might have been done due to “shortage of police”.
Replying to a question on the disruption of proceedings in the Sindh Assembly, which witnessed a protest on Monday and slogans on Tuesday as well, Memon said protesting was the right of everyone in a democracy.
“Opposition can protest, if they want,” he told reporters.



Memon raised multiple questions, asking why the MQM-P did not protest after the May 12, 2007 mayhem, the Bolton market blaze and the Baldia factory tragedy.
The Sindh senior minister stated: We are not saying them [MQM-P] not to [protest] .. it. We are democratic people. Everything that comes under democracy is allowed.
“However, if they opt for undemocratic practices, the government will not sit idle,” he added, calling for the protests to be “peaceful”.
“We will support them. However, if they opt for old tactics of … [forcefully] closing shops, … shooting in the city, this time our mood is different,” he said, adding that the government would prioritise the public’s safety if the MQM-P attempted to stage a strike or engage in arson or vandalism.
“When this incident (Gul Plaza fire) occurred, everyone was teary-eyed … but the attitude of certain parties … the bodies were not even recovered and calls were made to roll back the 18th Amendment and hand over Karachi to the Centre,” Memon said.
In the wake of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has claimed at least 73 lives, the MQM-P demanded that Karachi be made a “federal territory” by making it the country’s “financial capital”.

 

It also assailed the 18th Amendment, which devolved certain ministries to the provinces from the Centre, and claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage” of it.
In response, the PPP has assailed the MQM-P for “politicising” the Gul Plaza fire. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah detailed the shopping centre’s history, noting former mayors had approved leases to regularise building violations.</p><small>2026-01-27 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/27163518d1efe31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969361/pm-shehbaz-stresses-expanded-cooperation-between-pakistan-myanmar' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz stresses expanded cooperation between Pakistan, Myanmar</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday emphasised the need to expand cooperation between Pakistan and Myanmar.
He made the remarks as Myanmar’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Than Swe, who is currently undertaking a four-day official visit to Islamabad, called on him in Islamabad, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“Welcoming the visiting dignitary and reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening its longstanding relations with Myanmar, the prime minister underscored the importance of expanding cooperation in trade and economic engagement, education, culture, capacity-building, and people-to-people exchanges,” the statement said.
He also appreciated Myanmar’s cooperation in combating trafficking and its support for Pakistan’s engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
Meanwhile, the Burmese foreign minister thanked PM Shehbaz for the warm welcome accorded to him and his delegation.
“He conveyed the greetings and good wishes from Myanmar’s leadership and expressed Myanmar’s desire to expand its ties with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest,” the statement said.
He also expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s support during an earthquake that rocked Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand last March.







On Monday, the two countries had agreed to renew and strengthen bilateral relations through expanded trade, people-to-people engagement and academic exchanges, signaling a diplomatic reset after years of limited engagement.
The understanding emerged from delegation-level talks between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Than Swe, followed by a joint press conference in Islamabad.
Dar said the discussions were “productive and comprehensive”, and underscored the need for sustained, structured and result oriented initiatives, particularly in capacity building.
He said the visit by Myanmar’s foreign minister reflected the importance both sides attach to revitalising relations and called for resolving all contentious issues through dialogue and diplomacy.
Relations between Pakistan and Myanmar have experienced a period of silence in recent years, largely influenced by the Rohingya crisis. Pakistan has condemned Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority at international forums, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations, while providing humanitarian assistance and hosting refugees.
Despite those strains, recent engagement suggests a pragmatic turn in ties.
On Monday, Dar also emphasised the importance of deepening academic linkages and youth engagement, saying Pakistan valued its “cordial and friendly” relations with Myanmar and remained keen to expand cooperation across mutually beneficial fields.</p><small>2026-01-27 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/271218373793106.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969347/kse-100-slips-to-18820285-points' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 slips to 188,202.85 points</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark stock exchange, KSE-100, remained under pressure, closing in the red at 188,202.85 points, a 0.2 per cent fall from the previous close of 188,587.66 points.
The index touched an intraday high of 189,521.32 points in early trading before briefly slipping to 187,538.23. Trading activity remained moderate, with volumes at 341.60 million shares at a market value of Rs40.22 billion.
At the midday mark, the index had stood at 188,001.04 points, down 586.62 points.
There was heightened volatility on account of yesterday’s State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announcement to maintain the key policy rate of 10.5pc.
Industry leaders and traders alike were surprised by this announcement, resulting in the subdued performance of the exchange so far today.
Arif Habib Limited noted that they had anticipated that the SBP was likely to deliver a 75 basis points cut during the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), potentially taking the policy rate to 9.75pc, signalling a long-awaited return to single-digit territory.
Echoing a similar sentiment, business leader, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh, stated that the business community had categorically demanded a substantive reduction of 350 basis points to bring the policy rate down to 7pc to kickstart the economy immediately, as the industry is currently battling an existential crisis due to exorbitant energy tariffs and high borrowing costs.
Commercial banks remained relatively immune from the dip, with all listed banks aside from the Askari Bank, MCB Bank Ltd, Samba Bank, and United Bank trading in the green.</p><small>2026-01-27 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/27141626e79c288.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969356/japans-beloved-last-pandas-leave-for-china-as-ties-fray' target='_blank'><strong>Japan’s beloved last pandas leave for China as ties fray</strong></a><br><p>Hundreds gathered to say farewell to two popular pandas departing Tokyo for China on Tuesday, leaving Japan without any of the beloved bears for the first time in 50 years as ties between the Asian neighbours fray.
Panda twins Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were transported by truck out of Ueno Zoological Gardens, their birthplace, disappointing many Japanese fans who have grown attached to the furry four-year-olds.
“I’ve been coming to watch them since they were born,” Nene Hashino, a woman in her 40s wearing a panda-themed jacket and clutching a bear stuffed toy, told AFP.
“It feels like my own children are going somewhere far away. It’s sad.”
The pandas’ abrupt return was announced last month during a diplomatic spat that began when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hinted that Tokyo could intervene militarily in the event of an attack on Taiwan.
Her comment provoked the ire of Beijing, which regards the island as its own territory.

 

The distinctive black-and-white animals, loaned out as part of China’s “panda diplomacy” programme, have symbolised friendship between Beijing and Tokyo since they normalised ties in 1972.
Their repatriation comes a month before their loan period expires in February, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which operates Ueno Zoo.
“According to the relevant agreement between China and Japan, the giant pandas who were living in Japan, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, today began their return trip to China,” said Guo Jiakun, China’s foreign ministry spokesman.
“As always, we welcome the Japanese public to come see giant pandas in China.”



Japan has reportedly been seeking the loan of a new pair of pandas.
However, a weekend poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed that 70 per cent of those surveyed do not think the government should negotiate with China on the lease of new pandas, while 26pc would like them to.
On Sunday, Ueno Zoo invited some 4,400 lucky winners of an online lottery to see the pandas for the last time.
‘Part of my heart’
Well-wishers wearing panda-themed clothes, hats and badges waited for hours on the streets lining the zoo two days later to say their final goodbyes.
They called out to the animals as the windowless truck left the gates.
“It’s so sad,” said Daisaku Hirota, a 37-year-old shop worker who said he tried to visit the pandas as often as he could on his days off.
“I lost one part of my heart,” he said.
Lei Lei and Xiao Xiao were delivered in 2021 by their mother Shin Shin, who arrived in 2011 and was returned to China in 2024 because of declining health.

 

Since late last year, China has discouraged its nationals from travelling to Japan, citing deteriorating public security and criminal acts against Chinese nationals in the country.
Beijing is reportedly also choking off exports to Japan of rare-earth products crucial for making everything from electric cars to missiles.
However, China routinely removes pandas from foreign countries and the latest move may not be politically motivated, said Masaki Ienaga, a professor at Tokyo Woman’s Christian University and an expert in East Asian international relations.
“If you talk about [Chinese] politics, the timing of sending pandas is what counts,” and pandas could return to Japan if bilateral ties warm, Ienaga said.
Other countries use animals as tools of diplomacy, including Thailand with its elephants and Australia with its koalas, he added.
“But pandas are special,” Ienaga said.
“They have strong customer-drawing power, and … they can earn money.”</p><small>2026-01-27 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/27142429df1901f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969357/govt-assures-quick-fix-for-overseas-pakistanis-occupied-property-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Govt assures quick fix for overseas Pakistanis’ occupied property in capital</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday assured a quick fix for overseas Pakistanis’ illegally occupied properties in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), declaring that their assets were fully protected.
“For overseas Pakistanis: If you report any qabza/illegal occupation, the DC Islamabad is bound to decide within seven days. Your property rights will be protected; no one will be allowed to take what is lawfully yours,” Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi posted on X.
“Your investments in ICT are welcome and valued. We will provide a secure, investor-friendly environment and ensure swift, transparent action to safeguard your assets 100 per cent”, he said.







The minister’s post evoked an overwhelming response. Many welcomed the assurance, noting that land grabbers’ mafia had scared off many overseas investors. However, others raised questions about whether it would be implemented in letter and spirit.
“That’s the type of tone, action and attitude we need against (the) Qabza mafia,” a comment posted in response said.
“This should be implemented nationwide across Pakistan as citizen portals and courts often take years to resolve even straightforward matters,” another response to the post said.

 

Meanwhile, some sought to know the fate of expatriates’ investments in housing societies that were still not approved by the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
An individual whose father passed away back in 2002 chose to use the platform for an appeal seeking the intervention of the authorities to ensure that he gets his lawful share of inherited property.
A software developer by profession, the man wrote: “My paternal grandfather and uncles have denied me my legitimate rights. My mother has grown old and weak, and I am left without support. I cannot fight influential individuals alone.”
While commenting on a post, an overseas Pakistani wondered how the deputy commissioner would react if the illegal occupant were an influential individual.
Many linked the issue with politics, and criticised the role played by deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners as electoral staff in the 2024 general polls.
Earlier in September 2025, the Prime Minister’s Office constituted a joint inquiry committee to thoroughly probe the alleged land grabbing by the ‘land mafia’ in the federal capital and to fix responsibility on those involved in the illegal practice.</p><small>2026-01-27 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2712470349ee29c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969348/mother-of-all-deals-india-eu-finalise-landmark-trade-deal-pm-modi-says' target='_blank'><strong>‘Mother of all deals’: India, EU finalise landmark trade deal, PM Modi says</strong></a><br><p>India and the European Union have finalised a long-pending landmark trade deal, both sides said on Tuesday, as they seek to hedge against fickle ties with the United States.
The deal is expected to double EU exports to India by 2032 by eliminating or reducing tariffs in 96.6 per cent of traded goods by value, and will lead to savings of 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) in duties for European companies, the EU said.
The EU will cut tariffs on 99.5pc goods traded over seven years, with tariffs to be cut to zero on Indian marine goods, leather and textile products, chemicals, rubber, base metals and gems and jewellery, India’s trade ministry said in a statement.
“Yesterday, a big agreement was signed between the European Union and India,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said earlier.
“People around the world are calling this the mother of all deals. This agreement will bring major opportunities for the 1.4bn people of India and the millions of people in Europe,” he said.
The accord would open up India’s vast and highly guarded market, with New Delhi slashing tariffs on cars to 10pc over five years from as high as 110pc, according to an EU statement, benefiting European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
India is also slashing tariffs on alcoholic beverages like wines to 75pc immediately from 150pc, which would be lowered to 20pc gradually. Tariffs on spirits will be lowered to 40pc, the EU said.
The deal will also cut tariffs on a slew of EU goods coming to India including machinery, electrical equipment, chemicals and iron and steel, the EU said.
“Europe and India are making history today,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on social media. “This is only the beginning.”







Trade between India and the EU stood at $136.5bn in the fiscal year through March 2025.
The formal signing of the India-EU deal would take place after legal vetting expected to last five to six months, an Indian government official aware of the matter has said.
“We expect the deal to be implemented within a year,” the official added.
Flurry of trade deals
The agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.
During the same period, New Delhi finalised pacts with Britain, New Zealand and Oman.
The spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against trade with the United States as President Donald Trump’s bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European nations test longstanding alliances among Western nations.
An India-US trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communications between the two governments.
Talks between India and the EU were relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, and gathered momentum after Trump put tariffs on several trading partners, including a 50pc tariff on goods from India.
For India, the tariff cuts with the EU will lead to more exports in labour intensive sectors that will help partly offset the impact of US tariffs, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official.
He said the deal will also give an immediate price advantage for EU products in India because of some relief from its high tariffs, for instance up to 110pc on cars.</p><small>2026-01-27 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/271227420112040.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969349/strengthening-city-government-only-solution-to-karachis-issues-ji-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Strengthening ‘city government’ only solution to Karachi’s issues: JI chief</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Tuesday stressed the formation of a “city government” as the only solution to Karachi’s administrative and governance issues.
The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need to empower local governments (LGs) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) even demanding that Karachi be made a “federal territory”.
“The solution to Karachi’s issues is not provincial or federal control. According to the Constitution, the solution is Karachi city government,” the JI chief said while addressing a press conference in the metropolis.
Rehman made the case for better local governance by citing Istanbul as an example: “Istanbul’s local governance has its master plan, fire brigade, construction, transportation, water, sewage, education and employment under its jurisdiction.”
“This is real governance, not KDA (Karachi Development Authority) or SBCA (Sindh Building Control Authority),” he said, adding that “development cannot result from this”.



“This is why a city government is the only solution here — a government that is empowered and represented by an elected official,” he said, alleging that the mayorship was “stolen from JI”.
In June 2023, Murtaza Wahab was elected as the first PPP mayor of Karachi, after much controversy, recriminations and protests.
During his presser, the JI chief also announced a march on February 1, titled “Jeenay dou Karachi ko” (let Karachi live) — on Sharea Faisal, expressing optimism that “it will give young people hope”.
“At the march, we will outline our plans,” he said, stressing that “we must free the city from mafia and feudal lords”.
He said that the “JI stood with young people of the country — Generation Z”.
The JI chief reiterated that the “people’s mandate should be respected, and the city governance plan should be implemented”.
He also demanded that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah step down and take accountability for his government’s “incompetence”.
Growing calls for local government
Last week, the National Assembly echoed with calls for strengthening LGs as lawmakers stressed the need for reforms in the wake of the Gul Plaza fire.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Only 23 of the deceased have been identified so far.
While the first information report (FIR) of the incident has said the blaze was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”, no identified individuals have been nominated so far. The Karachi police on Monday formed a special team make “all-out efforts” to arrest suspects.
In the NA, MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units” and for powers to be “handed over” to the mayor, town chairman, and union council chairman.
Besides members of the MQM-P, PML-N’s Khawaja Asif has also favoured strengthening LGs for better city administration.
Speaking on the floor of the NA last week, Asif called for providing people “representation in their own neighbourhoods”. Days later, he also lamented that LGs continued to be neglected by political parties, ultimately weakening civilian rule.</p><small>2026-01-27 08:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2711120129d329d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969344/westerly-wave-to-persist-until-tomorrow-says-nwfc-northern-areas-experience-below-freezing-temperatures' target='_blank'><strong>Westerly wave to persist until tomorrow, says NWFC; northern areas experience below-freezing temperatures</strong></a><br><p>The country remained in the grip of a cold wave as a westerly system affected the upper parts, with temperatures dipping below freezing in many northern areas.
The National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC) in its daily forecast said that “a westerly wave is affecting the upper parts of the country and likely to persist in northern parts till tomorrow”.
According to NWFC, the upper parts of the country, including Malam Jabba, Parachinar, and Gupis, saw temperatures dip to -7°C, Bagrote at -6°C, followed closely by Kalam and Rawalakot at -5°C, while the temperature in Muree and Skardu remained -3°C, followed by -1°C in Quetta.
The weather centre warned that snowfall may cause “road closure/ slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli on January 27”.
It also predicted the possibility of landslides and avalanches in hilly areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
It advised tourists to exercise caution and avoid unnecessary travel.
As for rain, the weather centre predicted that intermittent rain, wind, and thunderstorms were expected today in upper KP, AJK and GB.
“Heavy rain with moderate to heavy snowfall is also likely at isolated places,” it added.
As for the lower KP, northeastern Punjab and northern Balochistan, the NWFC predicted “cloudy weather accompanied [by] more isolated rain-wind/thunderstorm.”
“Cold and dry weather is likely in other parts of the country,” it further said, adding that the weather will persist till tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the National Highways and Motorways Police (NHMP), in a series of posts on X, detailed that the motorway police were “engaged in ensuring smooth flow of traffic” amid heavy snowfall in the upper parts of the country.
On the E-35 Hazara Expressway, NHMP said that “it was maintaining the smooth flow of traffic and ensuring timely assistance to the public”.
Visuals shared by the motorway police showed officials clearing snow from the road.







In a separate update, the NHMP shared visuals of heavy machinery removing snow from the Murree Expressway.







The NWFC, in its yesterday’s forecast, had warned of traffic disruption due to heavy snowfall, causing road closures and slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galiyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob.
‘Critical’ situation in Galiyat
Separately, conditions in Abbottabad district’s Galiyat area remained “critical” as heavy snowfall continued on Tuesday, the state-run APP reported.
Nathiagali, Ayubia, and Changla Gali received over three feet of snow in the last 16 hours, the report added. Snow clearance operations were underway, and the situation was being closely monitored, APP quoted officials as saying.
The intensity of the snowfall remained high, with an estimated rate of up to 0.8 cm per hour, APP reported.
Third spell of snow in South Waziristan
A third spell of snowfall, accompanied by intermittent rain, swept across the mountainous districts of South Waziristan Upper and South Waziristan Lower on late Monday night.
The weather intensified the cold and restricted mobility in high-altitude areas.
The weather system, described as the third major snowfall of the season, has caused a noticeable drop in temperatures, raising concerns over road blockages.
At the same time, the weather has brought relief to farmers after an extended dry period.
Local sources said snowfall continued intermittently in the upper reaches, while lower and plain areas received steady rainfall.
Residents reported icy roads, reduced visibility, and increased difficulty in daily travel.
Authorities warned that prolonged snowfall could once again cut off access to remote villages if road clearance operations are delayed.
Areas affected by the snowfall include Angoor Adda, Shakai, Khamrang, Raghzai, Zam Cheena, Margha Cheena, Kaniguram, Badar, Makeen, Ladha, and surrounding mountainous regions.
Two days prior, heavy snowfall in these localities blocked at least 12 road sections, severely disrupting transportation and delaying the supply of food and other essential items.
From an agricultural standpoint, the latest spell has been widely welcomed.
Farmers and landowners across South Waziristan said the winter rain and snowfall would have a positive impact on crops, particularly wheat, which is currently at a critical growth stage.
They explained that precipitation and melting snow naturally enhance soil moisture and fertility, creating favourable conditions for improved yields in the coming months.
A farmer from Wana said rain and snow function as natural irrigation systems. “They keep the soil moist, help seeds germinate properly, and increase the effectiveness of fertilisers,” he said. “This ultimately results in higher yields and improves farmers’ incomes.”
Officials from the agriculture and irrigation departments also described the latest weather spell as encouraging, particularly given the steady decline in groundwater levels observed over recent years.
They said prolonged dry conditions, below-average rainfall, and excessive use of tube wells had significantly depleted underground water reserves across South Waziristan.
According to officials, the gradual melting of snow will replenish streams, springs, and underground aquifers, helping stabilise water levels throughout the region.
Despite the benefits, the adverse effects of snowfall remain a concern in remote and elevated areas. The sharp decline in temperature has intensified cold conditions, while icy surfaces and fog have partially disrupted traffic in several localities. Residents reported difficulties commuting during early morning and evening hours, particularly on steep and narrow roads.
District administration has advised residents, especially those living in snowfall-prone areas, to remain cautious and avoid unnecessary travel during severe weather.
Citizens have also been urged to take preventive measures against extreme cold, particularly for children and the elderly.
Officials said instructions have been issued to ensure timely road clearance operations and preparedness to respond swiftly to any emergency arising from further snowfall or adverse weather conditions.</p><small>2026-01-27 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/271151043f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969346/pakistan-ghana-hold-first-formal-bilateral-talks-reaffirm-commitment-to-strengthen-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Ghana hold first formal bilateral talks; reaffirm commitment to strengthen ties</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Ghana held their first formal bilateral talks and signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
A press release by the FO, initially released on Monday, said that the two countries convened their first Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) on Monday, “marking an important milestone in the development of bilateral relations between the two countries”.
“The Pakistani delegation was led by Ambassador Hamid Asghar Khan, additional foreign secretary, while the Ghanaian side was headed by Ambassador Khadija Iddrisu, chief director (of the) ministry of foreign affairs,” it said.
During the talks, it added, two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed: an MoU on BPCs and an MoU between Islamabad’s Foreign Service Academy and the Ghana Foreign Service Institute.







“Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and agreed to enhance cooperation across a broad range of areas, including political, economic, defence, tourism, cultural, health, education, information technology, and other mutually beneficial sectors,” the statement said.
According to the FO, the two sides also agreed to hold the next round of the BPC in Islamabad next year.
“Pakistan and Ghana have friendly, cooperative ties, spanning many decades. The institutional dialogue process will further strengthen their bilateral relations through more meaningful and project-specific cooperation,” it said.
While relations between the two countries are still budding, Pakistan has been endeavouring to establish closer diplomatic ties with African nations.
On Saturday, Pakistan and Somalia signed an agreement abolishing visa requirements for diplomatic passport holders of both countries.
Last year, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution declaring May 25 as Pakistan-Africa Frien­d­­ship Day, a motion moved by Deputy Prime Minister and Fore­ign Minister Ishaq Dar.</p><small>2026-01-27 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2709503237c200a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969339/extreme-cold-grips-millions-as-us-digs-out-of-deadly-snowstorm' target='_blank'><strong>Extreme cold grips millions as US digs out of deadly snowstorm</strong></a><br><p>Perilously cold temperatures threatened millions of Americans on Monday in the wake of a sprawling winter storm that left at least 23 people dead as it knocked out power and paralysed transportation.
A frigid, life-threatening Arctic air mass could delay recovery as municipalities from New Mexico to Maine tried to dig out following the storm, which dropped a vicious cocktail of heavy snow and wind, along with freezing rain and sleet.







Forecasters warned that much of the northern half of the country will see temperatures that are “continuously below freezing through February 1,” and “record low temperatures tonight across the South are particularly dangerous in the wake of the weekend winter storm with many still without power,” the National Weather Service said in an X post.
While skies began clearing in parts the country, relentless snowfall in the northeast meant parts of Connecticut saw over 22 inches of snow, with more than 16 inches recorded in Boston, Massachusetts.
The storm was linked to at least 23 deaths, according to a compilation of state government and local media reports, with causes including hypothermia as well as accidents related to traffic, sledding, ATVs and snowplows.
One man was found in the snow, unresponsive, with a shovel in his hand.
In New York City, eight more people were found dead amid plummeting temperatures, and an investigation to determine the causes was underway. It was not known if all of these fatalities were storm-related.







Electricity began blinking back on across the south, but as of Monday evening, well over 550,000 customers remained without it, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.com.
Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana — southern states unaccustomed to intense winter weather — were especially impacted.
Approximately 190 million people in the United States were under some form of extreme cold alert, the National Weather Service (NWS) told AFP.
The Great Lakes region’s residents woke up to extreme temperatures that could cause frostbite on exposed skin within minutes. In parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the NWS reported early Monday morning temperatures as low as -23F (-30.6C), with windchills exacerbating the bite.
Over the weekend, nearly half of the states in the contiguous US received at least a foot of snow (30.5 cm), and in many cases, far more.
The NWS said New Mexico’s Bonito Lake accumulated the highest US total over the weekend with 31 inches (78.7 cm).
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell told journalists that trees were continuing to fall under the weight of encrusted ice across the Tennessee capital city — sometimes knocking out power that had already been restored.







Nashville and other municipalities across the country were establishing emergency warming shelters.
NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli told AFP this storm recovery was particularly arduous because so many states were impacted — meaning northern states with more winter supplies were unable to share their resources with less-prepared southern regions.
“A lot of those locations don’t have the means or the resources to clean up after these events,” she said.
“We’re particularly concerned about the folks in those areas that are without power right now.”
Polar vortex
At least 20 states and the capital Washington, were under states of emergency in order to deploy emergency personnel and resources.
The snowfall and biting icy pellets that pummeled cities left impassable roads along with canceled buses, trains and flights – thousands of departures and arrivals were scrapped over the weekend.
The storm system was the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air pouring across North America.
Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled and natural variability plays a role.
Dave Radell, a NWS meteorologist based in New York, told AFP that the character of this storm’s snow was “very dry” and “fluffy,” meaning the wind could lash it around with ease, impeding roadway-clearing efforts and visibility.
“That makes it even more challenging,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-27 05:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/270921343cba1e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969338/2-killed-10-injured-in-accident-on-islamabad-peshawar-motorway' target='_blank'><strong>2 killed, 10 injured in accident on Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway</strong></a><br><p>A multi-vehicle collision on the Islamabad- Peshawar Motorway (M-1) on Tuesday killed two people and injured 10 others, including three women, according to Swabi Rescue 1122 officials.
Swabi Rescue 1122 spokesperson Luqman, while speaking to Dawn, said that a trailer initially met with an accident on the motorway and blocked the road. As a result, multiple vehicles collided with each other.
One vehicle occupant was killed on the spot, while the other was pronounced dead by medical staff at a hospital. The vehicles involved in the pile-up were travelling to Peshawar from Islamabad.
Traffic on the M-1 was disrupted following the incident. Motorway police said its teams were at the incident site soon after the mishap and started initial rescue operations.
Rescue personnel shifted the injured to Bacha Khan Teaching Hospital and an emergency was declared at the medical facility.
The hospital’s spokesperson, Rahan Yousafzai, confirmed they received two bodies and 10 injured from the incident. He added that five of the injured are in critical condition.
“The hospital director put all emergency staff on high alert and the required facilities were provided to the injured,” added Rahan.
Traffic was later restored on the vital artery after the vehicle wrecks were removed by emergency personnel.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
Earlier this month, at least 24 people were killed and over 20 were injured in two separate accidents, as a truck fell into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district and a coach overturned near Balochistan’s Ormara tehsil.</p><small>2026-01-27 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2707440483625dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969289/uks-ex-chancellor-sparks-controversy-by-opposing-entry-of-his-own-parents' target='_blank'><strong>UK’s ex-chancellor sparks controversy by ‘opposing entry of his own parents’</strong></a><br><p>


LONDON: In a revealing interview with The Sunday Times, former UK Chancellor Sajid Javid reflected on his life journey from a childhood marked by poverty, domestic violence and racism to a career as a multimillionaire, cabinet minister, and home secretary. He also discussed his family’s complex past and integration in Britain and modern immigration policy.
Among the most striking revelations, British Pakistani Javid admitted that under the existing immigration rules, he “wouldn’t allow either his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry today”.
“The biggest block to good community cohesion is English. We should have set a requirement that if you want to settle in the UK, you should be able to speak fluent English. We should have done that ages ago,” he said.
Javid’s parents arrived from Pakistan in the early 1960s. His father, arriving with just £1, worked as a bus driver, mill worker and shop owner, while his mother who was uneducated and initially unable to speak English, struggled to adapt. The Colour of Home, Javid’s new memoir, details a childhood shaped by hardship and family tension.

In revealing Sunday Times interview, Sajid Javid says he ‘wouldn’t allow his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry’ into UK under current rules

The memoir describes his father’s violence. Javid recounts being beaten with a leather slipper, a wooden spoon and on one occasion a hammer that required a CT scan. He writes about enduring racist attacks from skinheads and school bullies, as well as the emotional toll of growing up in cramped and impoverished living conditions.
“Crouching in a ball and covering his face while his father beat him,” Javid recalls, highlights the intensity of these early struggles.
Family tensions extended to marriage expectations. His mother initially objected to his white Christian wife Laura refusing to meet her for two years, and had even tried to arrange a marriage with his cousin. His mother also “didn’t want two black workmen her husband employed to come for dinner” though she later learnt English and “came to deeply regret her racism towards the black workmen”.
Later in life, his father apologised to Javid for his past violence.
Despite these hardships, the family’s story is one of resilience. Javid fulfilled his childhood goal of buying his parents a house in Bristol, writing that one of his proudest moments was achieving “enough to give myself and my family a better life”.
He told the interviewer that a “Reform voter… might think this is exactly the kind of family that we want in the UK because they went on a journey and look where they’ve ended”.
In politics, Javid was known for his positions on immigration. He supported a post-Brexit points-based system but argued that the UK “lets in too many immigrants” and stressed that language skills are essential for community cohesion.
