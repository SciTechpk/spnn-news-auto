“As agreed by both China and the United States … Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead a delegation to Malaysia from October 24 to 27 and hold economic and trade talks with the United States,” Beijing’s commerce ministry said in a statement.
Beijing this month announced sweeping controls on the critical rare earths industry, prompting US President Donald Trump to threaten 100 per cent tariffs on imports from China in retaliation.
 
 

The two countries also began applying arrival fees against each other’s ships, sparked by a US “Section 301” investigation that found Beijing’s dominance in the industry was unreasonable.
Trump later threatened to cancel his expected meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit starting October 31.
But the US president has made it clear he hopes to seal a “good” deal with China and end the trade war.
Thursday’s announcement comes after He, who has taken a lead role in managing the thorny row with Washington, agreed to fresh in-person talks in a call with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over the weekend.
The talks will cover “important issues in the economic and trade relationship between China and the United States”, the commerce ministry said in the statement.
The trade talks overlap with a visit by Trump to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur for an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting from October 26 to 28.</p><small>2025-10-23 08:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23124617286c396.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950768/polands-deputy-prime-minister-arrives-in-islamabad-on-2-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Poland’s deputy prime minister arrives in Islamabad on 2-day visit</strong></a><br><p>Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski landed in Islamabad on Thursday on a two-day official visit.
“Deputy prime minister/foreign minister of Poland, His Excellency Radosław Sikorski, arrived in Islamabad today for a two-day official visit,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a post on social media platform X.
The FO added that Sikorski was received by the additional secretary for Europe, the Polish ambassador and other senior officials.
 






Later, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received Sikorski at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“The two leaders held a tête-à-tête meeting and exchanged views on matters of mutual interest,” the FO said.
 






A day earlier, the FO had stated that the Polish minister would be paying an official visit to Islamabad at Dar’s invitation.
“This will be minister Sikorski’s second official visit to Pakistan; his previous visit took place in 2011,” the statement said. During the visit, Dar and Sikorski will hold a one-on-one meeting as well as delegation-level talks.
“The two sides are expected to discuss the full spectrum of bilateral relations,” the FO said, adding that the talks would be followed by a joint press stakeout.
The FO said that Sikorski’s visit marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan-Poland relations” and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Warsaw “for the mutual benefit of both countries”.
 






In July, Pakistan and Poland had agreed to enhance collaboration via high-level visits, parliamentary interactions and dialogue, during the 9th round of Bilateral Political Consultations between the two countries held in Warsaw.
At these consultations, regional and global issues of mutual interest were also discussed, including developments in South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. It was mutually agreed that the next round of consultations would be held in Islamabad in 2026.</p><small>2025-10-23 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231329544f734d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950771/centres-decision-on-fate-of-extremist-party-expected-to-come-shortly-says-punjab-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Centre’s decision on ‘fate of extremist party’ expected to come shortly, says Punjab minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari said on Thursday that a decision on the “fate of an extremist party” — an apparent reference to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan — was expected to come shortly from the federal government.
“The Punjab government had prepared its case on this and forwarded it,” she added.
She made this statement during a press conference in Lahore, days after the Punjab government forwarded a summary to the Centre to ban the religio-political party and amid reports of a federal cabinet meeting scheduled for later today.
At the press conference, the provincial minister detailed recent measures taken by the Punjab government pertaining to law and order and security following a TLP protest earlier this month.
These also include steps taken regarding weapons possession and licences, on which Bokhari said the provincial government had “suspended the licences of 28 weapons’ dealers and the shops of some other fake dealers who lacked licences have been sealed”.
“There is a zero-tolerance policy on buying and selling of weapons, and as I said earlier, no licence for weapons will now be issued in Punjab,” she added.
The minister further stated that currently, over one million people in the province had weapons’ licences. “A province where such a large number [of people] have licences for weapons, you can figure out how big a challenge it is to maintain peace.”
Moreover, 47,918 security companies in the province had weapons’ licences and the number of licences issued to various institution exceeded 42,000, she added.
Bokhari then went on to share some details of weapons and ammunition, which she said had been found in custody of “people belonging to the TLP”.
With pictures displayed on a screen in the background, she said TLP protesters had snatched weapons, ammunition and other articles from police during their protests in previous years.
“This is their modus operandi. They surround police, snatch vehicles, weapons and tear gas guns from them and use them later.
“In the 2021[protest], they robbed 3,498 tear gas shells, 23 tear gas guns, 326 anti-riot kits, two 12-bore pistols and 11 submachine guns,” she said. Pointing to one of the pictures on the screen, she added that they matched the bullets that were shot at police during the TLP’s recent protest.
According to Bokhari, TLP activist damaged eight police vehicles and snatched a submachine gun, two 12-bore pistols, 945 bullets during their recent protest. Moreover, the minister said the protesters had snatched 197 helmets, 22 kits, 130 “safety sheets”, one tear gas guns and 984 tear gas shells, of all which wear part of anti-riot gear.
They even damaged Safe City cameras, Bokhari added.
She further said that a special prosecution cell was working on cases pertaining to the TLP, in which 559 suspects had been sent on physical remand. Among them, 161 were sent to jail and 190 were on judicial remand, she added.
Moving on actions taken regarding social media posts, she said a total of “75 links” had been blocked for sharing hateful and inciting material and 107 people had been apprehended.
Bokhari further said citizens could give tip-offs to police about “the extremist party” and “illegal citizens, be it Afghans or anyone else”, by calling 15 police helpline. Their calls would be transferred to a special cell and the informants’ name would be kept secret, she assured.
She stressed that “dala culture”, too, would not be tolerated.
“Giving a call for strike and forcing shops, business and transport to shut down is totally unacceptable. Cases will be registered under terrorism laws [against those involved],” she further warned.
Bokhari also emphasised that there was a province-wide ban on posters, pamphlets, branding or any other kind of publicity of “extremist mobs”.
About Afghan refugees, she said combing operations had been initiated to identify those lacking the necessary documents, who would then be shifted to centres established at the district level. They would then be sent back to their country in a respectful manner.
This would also apply to others residing in Punjab “illegally”, she said, adding that “information was being collected about illegal citizens doing business in Punjab so that they could also be repatriated”.
In this connection, the minister warned that renting or leasing out properties to “illegal citizens” or letting them stay at one’s residence was a crime and action would taken over it. “The Punjab government has taken a decision on this and it is being implemented.”
She also said the Punjab government had requested the Centre to regularise weapons’ factories.</p><small>2025-10-23 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2313164239e50f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950657/timeless-wheels-hit-karachis-roads-as-classic-car-rally-begins' target='_blank'><strong>Timeless wheels hit Karachi’s roads as classic car rally begins</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The pride and joy of classic car collectors was put to the test once again on Wednesday as the 18th Annual Cross Country Vintage and Classic Car Rally, under the aegis of the Vintage and Classic Rally Drivers Association of Pakistan (VCRDAP), kicked off from Karachi on Wednesday.
After making stopovers in Sukkur, Multan, Lahore, Nurpur Noon and Islamabad, the rally will eventually culminate in Peshawar on Oct 29. This year, too, the classic cars participating in the rally include some dating back to 1960. The oldest car this time is a 1960 Chevrolet Impala along with a 1963 Chevrolet Impala, a 1972 Toyota Corona, a 1977 Mercedes 240D, a 1980 Mercedes 500SL and a 1986 Mercedes 300SEL, to name a few.

“This first-ever classic car rally of Pakistan started from Karachi on Nov 5, 2010 and has since been regularly held every year. The VCRDAP is a cluster of all the classic car rally drivers of Pakistan, who have taken part in different classic car rallies held in Pakistan since 2010. The aim of holding this unique national motoring event is a big step forward in projecting a soft image of Pakistan to the outer world, year after year,” said VCRDAP’s founder and President Imad Samad.
Lucky to be on an autumn break from her school, his and Fozia’s 14-year-old daughter, Maryam Samad, is also coming along. The youngest participant of this rally in 2011 at the age of only six months, Maryam this year will take turns riding with her father sometimes and with her mother at other times.

Cars from as far back as 1960 take part in rally that ends in Peshawar on Oct 29

A unique feature of this year’s rally is a women’s team of Fozia Imad and Sabina Mansoor. Fozia, a rally participant as a driver for a third time (she has otherwise been accompanying her husband for 14 to 15 years), is driving a black 1977 Mercedes 240D and Sabina is driving a red 1952 MG TD. Sabina’s husband Capt Mansoor ul Islam, meanwhile, compliments her by driving a green 1952 MG TD. Fozia’s husband Imad is in a red 1960 Chevrolet Impala, which belongs to his friend Rais Matloob Ahmed. “It is the oldest sedan in this year’s rally,” said Imad.

All the cars in the rally are well-maintained and in great shape. “We have kept them in proper running condition so that they can undertake this long cross country journey,” said VCRDAP’s Vice President Shoaib Qureshy, who also founded the Antique Cars Museum. “This rally is a statement of the passion and the spirit of veteran rally drivers,” he added. Shoaib is himself driving a 1980 Mercedes 500 SL.
He also briefed that the rally will feature a Grand Classic Car Show at the Pink Polo Festival in the Lahore Polo Club Grounds on Oct 26, which will be hosted by the Patron of VCRDAP Adnan Hayat Noon, an avid classic car enthusiast, rally driver and collector. “Another 30 cars will join this rally from Lahore onwards. Among them are a 1976 Cadillac Eldorado, a 1968 MGB GT, a 1959 Austin Healey 3,000, a 1961 Jaguar Mark 10, a 1972 Mercedes 300SEL, a 1965 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow, a Rolls Royce Silver Spur, a 1977 VW Campervan, a 1965 Ford Mustang, 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia and several others,” informed Shoaib.
“After Lahore, en-route to Islamabad, the rally will make a stopover at the beautiful and historic estates of Nurpur Noon, where Adnan Hayat Noon and his family are hosting the rally participants. In Islamabad, they will be hosted by the CEO of Murree Brewery Isphanyar Bhandara, who is himself a well-known Mercedes Benz collector,” VCRDAP’s vice president added.

“The rally will conclude in Peshawar, where the VCRDAP Peshawar members have organised an elaborate closing ceremony to mark the completion of this iconic cross-country journey,” VCRDAP’s General Secretary Ahmed Agha concluded.
The drivers and their families have all taken care to pack warm clothes with them as they know that after Sindh they would be facing cold weather.

The 36-year-old off-spinner finished with 6-50, taking his 1,000th first-class wicket in the process, on a deteriorating Rawalpindi stadium pitch.
South Africa reached the 68-run target for the loss of captain Aiden Markram (42) and Tristan Stubbs (nought), both to spinner Noman Ali, who finished with 2-40.
Ryan Rickelton, who scored 25 not out, hit Sajid Khan for a six to seal an emphatic win minutes before the lunch break for the World Test Championship holders.
 






In another battle of spinners, Pakistan managed 333 in their first innings before the South African tail wagged to help them pile up 404 for a crucial 71-run lead.
Spinners took 34 of the 40 wickets to fall in the first Test in Lahore, which Pakistan won by 93 runs.
Thursday’s morning session saw Pakistan’s batters fold, adding just 44 runs after resuming the fourth day on 94-4.
Harmer torpedoed Pakistan’s hopes of saving the Test when he trapped Babar Azam leg-before with the fifth ball of the day after the batsman had reached his 30th Test half-century.
 






Pakistan’s hopes had rested on Azam ending his century drought, having not scored a ton since December 2022.
His lean spell goes on.
Nine runs later Harmer had Mohammad Rizwan caught by close-in fielder Tony de Zorzi for 18.
In his next over the spinner dismissed Noman for nought, caught behind for Harmer’s 1,000 wicket in his 235th first-class match.
Harmer is the fourth South African to take 1,000 or more first-class wickets, behind Mike Procter (1,417), Allan Donald (1,216) and Charlie Llewellyn (1013).
Harmer’s previous best figures of 4-51 came in the first Test in Lahore.
Unlike South Africa, Pakistan’s tail did not last long as they lost their last five wickets for just 33 runs in their second innings, just their latest batting slumps in the series.
Shaheen Shah Afridi was run out without scoring while Keshav Maharaj dismissed Salman Agha for 28 and Sajid Khan for 13 to swiftly wrap up the innings.
Maharaj finished with 2-34 to follow up his 7-102 in the first innings.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23115844c66bbfe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950765/fo-condemns-israels-attempt-to-extend-so-called-sovereignty-over-occupied-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>FO condemns Israel’s attempt to extend ‘so-called sovereignty’ over occupied West Bank</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Thursday condemned Tel Aviv’s attempt to “extend its so-called ‘sovereignty’” over parts of the Occupied West Bank a day after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied West Bank won preliminary approval from the Knesset.
Israeli lawmakers voted on Wednesday to advance two bills on annexing the occupied West Bank, barely a week after US President Donald Trump pushed through a deal aimed at ending Israel’s two-year military offensive in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement released today, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s attempt to extend its so-called ‘sovereignty’ over parts of the occupied West Bank, including illegal Israeli settlements, through a draft law introduced in the legislature of the occupying power.”
 






The FO said that these actions constituted a “flagrant violation” of international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
“Such provocative and unlawful measures undermine ongoing efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region,” the FO said.
It called on the international community to take “urgent and decisive action” to halt these illegal steps and to hold the Israeli occupying forces accountable for their continued violations of international law.
“Pakistan reiterates its commitment to working with regional and international partners to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, and to ensure peace, justice, and dignity for the Palestinians,” the FO said.
The FO also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
The vote in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday was the first of four needed to pass the law and it coincided with the visit of US Vice President JD Vance to Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party did not support the legislation, which was put forth by lawmakers outside his ruling coalition and passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers. A second bill by an opposition party proposing the annexation of the Maale Adumim settlement passed by 31-9.
Members of Netanyahu’s coalition have been calling for years for Israel to formally annex parts of the occupied West Bank, territory to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties.
Israel argues the territories it captured in 1967 are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied.
The UN’s highest court in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
The Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in some areas of the occupied West Bank.
US says Israel annexation moves in West Bank ‘threatening’ peace deal
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened the Gaza peace deal.
“I think the president’s made clear that’s not something we can be supportive of right now,” Rubio said of annexation as he boarded his plane for a visit to Israel.
Annexation moves are “threatening for the peace deal,” he told reporters.
 






“They’re a democracy, they’re going to have their votes, and people are going to take these positions,” he said.
“But at this time, it’s something that we … think might be counterproductive,” he said.
Asked about increased violence by extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Rubio said: “We’re concerned about anything that threatens to destabilise what we’ve worked on.”
But Rubio voiced optimism overall for preserving the peace deal.
“Every day there’ll be threats to it, but I actually think we’re ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign,” Rubio said.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23105005cae0647.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950762/dar-says-regional-connectivity-not-optional-essential-for-growth-and-shared-progress' target='_blank'><strong>Dar says regional connectivity not optional, essential for growth and shared progress</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Thursday that regional connectivity was not optional, terming it essential for growth and shared progress.
“Connectivity is not optional. It is essential for stability, growth and shared progress. Regional cooperation directly impacts the lives of millions of our people,” he said while addressing the Regional Transport Ministers’ Conference in Islamabad.
Transport Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Iran, Belarus, Turkmenistan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, among others, are participating in the two-day conference. Delegates from the Asian Development Bank, Economic Cooperation Organisation, International Road Transport Union, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific are also attending.
In his remarks, Dar said that many countries in the region were already investing in forward-looking connectivity projects. “Central Asia is emerging as a true trans Eurasian land bridge,” he said.
He noted that oil and gas pipelines laid down across deserts and mountains linked markets, while expanding road and rail networks demonstrated a collective commitment.
“These projects are not just infrastructure, they create shared opportunities. We can and must achieve more by aligning our efforts and working together. The whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.”
He further said that Pakistan’s strategic location connecting South Asia with Central Asia, the Middle East and China made it a “natural hub for regional connectivity”.
“Our vision is to build seamless linkages through road, rail, air, maritime, energy and digital corridors — turning geography into an opportunity,” he said.
“No project better symbolises Pakistan’s vision of win-win cooperation through connectivity than the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),” he said, adding that the project was now widely recognised as a “catalyst for energy infrastructure development, transport connectivity and enhanced trade across the whole of South and Central Asia”.
“It embodies our commitment to building partnerships that deliver tangible benefits, not just for Pakistan and China but for the entire region.”
Dar also called Pakistan’s high-speed motorways and national highways the “backbone of regional and domestic connectivity”, linking key border crossings to the Karachi and Gwadar ports.
“Integrated border and maritime systems enable faster transit, reduce costs and strengthen Pakistan’s role as a vital trade and transit corridor,” he said.
Speaking on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Framework Agreement, he said it was a landmark initiative that had opened new trade avenues. Similarly, he said the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad road and rail corridors offered a cost-effective land bridge across Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Asia.
“These corridors hold immense promise for regional trade and beyond,” he said.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s partnership in the Central Asia–South Asia (CASA-1000) electricity transmission and trade project transmitting surplus electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He also stressed the country’s commitment to investing in energy projects such as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP-500) electricity transmission project for strengthening energy security, supporting economic growth and “linking our markets and resources for our shared progress”.
He added that Pakistan was also expanding and modernising its ports and logistics infrastructure and enhancing air connectivity to promote tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges.
“Physical and digital connectivity must advance together,” the foreign minister stressed.
“Pakistan is prioritising digital trade platforms and e-port integration to create seamless, paperless and efficient trade flows, boosting efficiency, transparency and competitiveness, and ensuring that our connectivity vision is future-ready.”
He acknowledged the “valuable support” of Pakistan’s development partners, multilateral banks, UN agencies and regional organisations for their “technical expertise, financing and competitive building efforts” that were “instrumental” in moving the projects forward.
He called these initiatives “building blocks for regional integration, instruments for economic transformation and enablers of peace and stability”.
“They represent a future where goods, energy, data and people move without any hindrances across borders,” he said. “Where our economies complement [each other] and where connectivity drives inclusive growth.”
Dar said that the roundtable today would provide an opportunity to identify shared priorities and agree on practical steps for collaboration.
“Pakistan stands ready to coordinate transport plans, enhance cross-border facilitation, mobilise joint investments and strengthen regional value chains,” he said. “Every country has a vital role in the shared journey towards connectivity and prosperity.”
He invited all partners to deepen engagement, align strategies and forge durable partnerships, saying, “Together we can transform these corridors into engines of growth.
“Connectivity is about building trust, opportunity and shared destiny,” he added.
Dar ended by extending a “very warm welcome” to all the participants of the conference and wishing them productive and meaningful discussions with a “successful and fruitful outcome”.
“I thank you for your presence, your partnership and your commitment to advancing our shared vision of connectivity and cooperation,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2309281821bfb4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950755/babar-azam-makes-t20-return-as-pakistan-name-squad-for-south-africa-matches-tri-series' target='_blank'><strong>Babar Azam makes T20 return as Pakistan name squad for South Africa matches, tri-series</strong></a><br><p>Former captain Babar Azam has made a return to Pakistan’s T20I squad as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday announced squads for the upcoming white-ball series.

According to sources, the PCB has also sent a formal notice for termination of the franchise’s contract “after completing all necessary legal procedures”. The move marks a significant escalation in the simmering tensions between the board and the Multan franchise.
Sources revealed that the action followed repeated public statements by franchise owner Ali Tareen, who allegedly criticised the PCB and PSL management.
In April, Ali shared a podcast clip on X questioning the PCB’s pre-season build-up, writing:
“How is PSL 10 bigger and better? Same games, same teams – what’s new? Fed up with hollow words. PCB had time to plan innovations, but we’re repeating last year. Our biggest brand deserves more. Explain the vision!”
A few days later, he sought to clarify his stance amid backlash from other franchise owners, posting:
“I love PSL – it’s a MADE-IN-PAKISTAN success story we all benefit from. My words were about pushing for real growth, not negativity. Salman Naseer & PCB team are giving their all. Let’s unite as owners to back them and elevate the league. No more stagnation!”
However, tensions persisted. In July, Ali renewed his criticism in response to a PCB post-season debrief video celebrating PSL 10’s “success”. He wrote: “Applause? You must be kidding. TV ratings down, attendance plummeting, digital engagement slowing – yet we’re celebrating? PCB, wake up. PSL deserves better planning, not self-congratulation. Time to fix these issues before it’s too late.”
A PCB source said the repeated statements “damaged the league’s reputation and violated the terms of the agreement”.
The board’s notice reportedly outlines specific clauses of the franchise agreement that were breached. PCB officials maintained that the board remains committed to upholding the integrity and professional standards of the PSL.
Al Multan Sultans spokesperson told Dawn on Thursday that “the PCB has sent a legal notice which is not a notice of termination”.
The development comes amid growing concerns over franchise-board relations within the PSL framework, with several stakeholders calling for greater transparency and consistency in the PCB’s dealings with team owners.</p><small>2025-10-23 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23105535354318c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950761/trump-slaps-tremendous-sanctions-on-russian-oil-for-ukraine-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump slaps ‘tremendous’ sanctions on Russian oil for Ukraine war</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies on Wednesday, complaining that his talks with Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine war “don’t go anywhere”.
The European Union also unveiled a fresh wave of sanctions to pressure Russia to end its relentless, three-and-a-half-year invasion of its neighbor, which is allied with both Washington and Brussels.
Trump has held off pulling the trigger on sanctions against Russia for months, but his patience snapped after plans for a fresh summit with Putin in Budapest collapsed.
“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump said in response to a question from an AFP journalist in the Oval Office.
But Trump added that he hoped the “tremendous sanctions” against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil would be short-lived. “We hope that the war will be settled,” he said alongside Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday evening that the US still wants to meet with the Russians, despite the sanctions.
“We’re always going to be interested in engaging if there’s an opportunity to achieve peace,” Rubio told reporters.
Separately, the EU agreed to impose new measures aimed at crimping Moscow’s oil and gas revenues over the war, a spokesperson for the bloc’s current Danish presidency said.
That package — the 19th from the EU since the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion — sought to keep the pressure on Russia in light of Trump’s faltering peace push and an escalation of Russia’s offensive.
 
 

Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States welcomed the sanctions.
“This decision fully aligns with Ukraine’s consistent position that peace can only be achieved through strength and by exerting maximum pressure on the aggressor using all available international instruments,” Ambassador Olga Stefanishyna said in a statement.
The sanctions came hours after Russia’s latest overnight barrage on Ukraine killed seven people — including two children — and ripped into a kindergarten.
Not ‘honest and forthright’
The US sanctions represent a major stepping up of its actions against Russia and reflect Trump’s growing frustration at being unable to persuade Putin to end the conflict despite what he calls his personal chemistry with the Kremlin chief.
The sanctions involve a freezing of all Rosneft and Lukoil assets in the United States, while barring all US companies from doing any business with the two Russian oil titans.
“Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.
Bessent later told the Fox Business programme Kudlow that it was “one of the largest sanctions that we have done against the Russian Federation.
“President Putin has not come to the table in an honest and forthright manner, as we’d hoped,” Bessent said, adding that Trump was “disappointed at where we are in these talks”.
Trump this week halted plans to hold talks with Putin in Budapest, saying he did not want a “wasted” meeting.
The Kremlin on Wednesday appeared to leave the door open for a summit, saying ahead of the sanctions announcement that preparations were still ongoing.
“No one wants to waste time, neither President Trump nor President Putin,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
EU oil and gas sanctions
As part of the new EU measures, the 27-nation bloc brought forward a ban on the import of liquefied natural gas from Russia by a year to the start of 2027.
It also blacklisted over 100 more tankers from Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ageing oil vessels and imposed controls on the travel of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.
The package is scheduled to be formally adopted on Thursday, just before Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky joins EU leaders at a summit in Brussels.
Zelensky signed a letter of intent with Sweden earlier on Wednesday to acquire 150 Gripen fighter jets.
During the latest Russian strikes, AFP journalists in Kyiv heard the buzzing of Russian drones and explosions throughout the night, and saw a pillar of smoke rising above the capital.
“My hands are still shaking,” Kyiv resident Mariana Gorchenko told AFP. “I jumped up, glad that my little one wasn’t in the room where the windows were blown out.”
The strikes also damaged a kindergarten in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv.</p><small>2025-10-23 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231008587ed73ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950759/age-love-and-perseverance-asif-afridis-story' target='_blank'><strong>Age, love and perseverance: Asif Afridi’s story</strong></a><br><p>People say “age is just a number” when they want to feel young again. But in truth, age tells a story — of perseverance, growth, and dreams pursued against time itself.
In Asif Afridi’s case, age represents the power to dream and the perseverance to achieve. It reflects the richness of skill and the mental fortitude of a 38-year-old Test debutant. Above all, it represents love — and how it drives him.
Love has driven Asif all his life. His love for cricket took him from team to team, city to city, in pursuit of a permanent place in either. It kept him going through the toil and hardship of Pakistan’s domestic circuit for no less than 16 years.
Now, as he finally made his Test debut for Pakistan in the second match against South Africa, love again inspired him.
Asif is father to four boys and a little girl — and unapologetically, he loves the girl the most. She is battling cerebral palsy in a hospital while Asif plays the Test, having already taken six wickets on debut.
But he wants to win it for his girl.
“I am worried for her but at the same time happy about my performance here,” he said on Wednesday.
“My wife is extending support and giving me hope during this time. I’m praying we win this match so that I can dedicate it to my daughter. I love her more than my boys.”
Just as Asif can bowl on a nagging line and length for hours — a skill he showcased in Rawalpindi — his love for his daughter is equally steadfast, something well known among his colleagues in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata cricket fraternity.
“What’s most special about him? It’s how he loves and takes care of his daughter,” Abdul Rehman, a renowned coach from Peshawar, told Dawn.com.
Describing Asif further, Rehman called him a “calm and cool” person — a temperament that has shaped his game.
“He’s humble, hardworking, and a master of his craft,” Rehman said. “His understanding of the game, the conditions, and the batter he’s bowling to has always been immaculate.”
That understanding was on full display during South Africa’s first innings in Rawalpindi, as Asif kept landing the ball right on target. He hardly missed the stumps and began reaping rewards late on the second day — trapping Tony de Zorzi lbw before producing a peach of a delivery to dismiss Dewald Brevis.
On the third day, he added four more wickets, even as South Africa fought back through Senuran Muthusamy and Kagiso Rabada, inching closer to a series-levelling win.
“All I wished coming into the Test match was to live up to my reputation in domestic cricket — someone who bowls a nagging line and length, whether I take wickets or not,” Asif told reporters.

“I wanted people to recognise me as a quality bowler. Thank God I did more than I wished for.”

Asif’s journey to this point hasn’t been straightforward. His domestic career suffered a major setback in 2023 when he was banned for a year for an anti-corruption offence — later determined to be an honest mistake. Yet he didn’t let it derail his focus, taking 27 wickets in the 2024 season.
Earlier this year, he led Fata to promotion to the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy — Pakistan’s premier first-class competition — claiming 33 wickets in just five matches in the Hanif Mohammad Trophy, a Grade II event.
For Asif, those performances came from a simple desire — to bow out of the game with his head held high.
“…if we hadn’t returned to first-class cricket that year, it would have been very difficult later,” he said.
“So I worked hard and bowled long spells. I always hoped, God willing, that whenever I play, wherever I play, I’ll perform in such a way that people say my career ended on a strong note.”
Little did Asif know that before hanging up his boots, he would wear the Pakistan Test cap. And when that moment finally arrived, it brought sheer happiness.
“When the captain informed me on the eve of the match that I’d be making my debut, believe me, I couldn’t sleep all night,” he said. “I was very happy — and so was my family.”
When Pakistan’s mainstays, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, walk to the crease this morning with a slender lead of 23, they will also be playing for Asif and his daughter.
And if Pakistan go on to win, it won’t just be a victory for the team — it will be a triumph of love, patience, and a father’s promise to his little girl.</p><small>2025-10-23 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2309262907cc920.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950628/6-killed-as-vehicle-ambushed-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed as vehicle ambushed in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>NORTH WAZIRISTAN: Six people were killed when unknown gunmen ambushed a vehicle in Mirali tehsil of North Waziristan tribal district here on Wednesday.
The incident took place near Api village where a car, carrying six inmates, was attacked by unknown assailants. As a result, all the inmates died on the spot. Sources said that after the tragic incident, the attackers poured petrol on the vehicle and set it on fire, which badly burnt the bodies.
District police officer Waqar Ahmed confirmed the incident, saying that the suspects managed to escape after the attack, while the bodies were shifted to Mirali Hospital for identification.
Identity of the deceased has not been ascertained as yet, he said.
Sources said motive behind the attack could not be known. However, they added that the deceased were reportedly members of a local peace committee. 
The police and security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest the attackers.

This rapid assessment serves as the foundation for the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment 2025, following the precedent set by the comprehensive PDNA 2022 that guided Pakistan’s Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction Framework (4RF). Can the current assessment provide the vision, direction, and granular data needed to ensure that PDNA 2025 translates lessons learned into effective climate adaptation and disaster resilience measures?
The 2025 floods provide a crucial, if tragic, opportunity to assess whether the climate-focused recommendations from 2022 influenced reconstruction and preparedness, or whether they merely exposed gaps between Pakistan’s development partners’ engagement ambitions and the government’s implementation realities. Three questions follow the Preliminary Assessment: What methodology was employed to capture the scientific complexity of floods across diverse ecosystems? How does the assessment build upon existing national and international climate commitments? What lessons were learned from the 2022 floods, and does the 2025 assessment show their application?
 
 

Methodology: The preliminary assessment lacks any scientific methodology. Rather than systematic data collection, it consists of an ad hoc compilation of datasets received from various departments in response to federal agency requests. The resulting data is neither complete nor verifiable. Critical gaps include the absence of district-level severity rankings and gender-disaggregated data. The assessment thus presents a fragmented, province-level, top-down picture lacking the methodological coherence needed for recovery planning.
Climate integration: Beyond some fleeting, rhetorical references noting that Pakistan ranks among the most vulnerable countries while contributing less than one per cent of emissions, the assessment is silent on climate readiness preparations. There are no references to climate adaptation or mitigation, Paris Agreement commitments, or national climate policies including the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) or NDCs. It even fails to mention the climate change ministry; neither has it referred to the findings and recommendations of the 2022 PDNA or 4RF. Does this mean that those who compiled the current report did not use the prior, climate-focused assessment as a benchmark for measuring progress?

Does the 2025 assessment show the application of lessons learned from the 2022 floods?

PDNA 2022 lessons: PDNA 2022 and the accompanying 4RF reframed our vulnerability, positioning recovery not as mere reconstruction, but as an existential imperative to embed climate resilience into national development planning through nature-based adaptation rather than traditional engineering. The diagnosis was robust; the prescription was not as it didn’t specify the institutional mechanisms and operational frameworks needed, leaving implementation priorities to the government.
 
 

Proposed policy reforms: The 2022 PDNA’s policy recommendations centred on three priorities. Institutionally, it advocated embedding risk assessments into the Planning Commission’s project approval processes and strengthening district-level disaster management capacity. Strategically, it called for aligning recovery with Pakistan’s climate commitments, while operationalising existing disaster management and flood protection plans. Operationally, it emphasised enforcing climate-resilient building codes in flood-prone areas, establishing comprehensive disaster risk financing strategies including sovereign insurance, and creating shock-responsive social protection systems.
Proposed programmatic interventions: These prioritised housing reconstruction with subsidies for climate-resilient core units. Infrastructure was to be rebuilt to multi-hazard standards emphasising nature-based solutions. Social assistance included cash-for-work schemes. Finally, the farm sector required weather-based agricultural insurance systems.
A critical gap spanned both policy and programmatic recommendations. The 2022 PDNA outlined what should be done but provided limited guidance on how. While this preserved sovereignty in priority-setting, it also created implementation vacuums that became evident in the 2025 floods.
Conclusion: The 2025 floods provide clear preliminary evidence of significant implementation gaps in the 2022 climate mandate. The persistent re-destruction of infrastructure (for example, the M-5 motorway section) and the loss of over 8,400 houses, confirms ‘build back better’ principles were not operationalised. Local capacity remains weak, with District Disaster Management Authorities still under-resourced. Pakistan has again requested support from the World Bank, ADB, EU, and UNDP for a post-disaster needs assessment. With this process ongoing, systematic evaluation of climate considerations in 2025 recovery planning remains pending.
PDNA 2022 exhibited strong conceptual understanding of climate vulnerability — acknowledging attribution science, invoking ‘build back better’ principles, and recommending nature-based solutions and climate-resilient reconstruction aligned with international best practices. Yet three weaknesses undermined implementation. First, the PDNA stresses principles over operational specificity, recommending climate resilience without detailing enforcement mechanisms, institutional mandates, or compliance frameworks. Second, it failed to systematically link recommendations to our existing climate policy architecture — the climate change policy, NAP, and NDC — forgoing opportunities to leverage these frameworks for implementation and financing. Third, it proposed no institutional reforms or policy actions necessary to embed climate screening into routine development planning, particularly the Planning Commission’s project approval processes.
By 2025, these weaknesses produced predictable failures. Environmental and climate risk screening remained absent from major infrastructure. Resilient construction standards went unenforced. District capacity-building never materialised. Adaptive social protection systems were never established. The gap between 2022’s climate ambitions and 2025’s reality exposes fundamental implementation barriers in Pakistan’s disaster response system.
The 2022-2025 experience proves that merely acknowledging climate drivers differs fundamentally from implementing effective policy. Assessments alone can’t drive transformation; they require strong institutional enforcement mechanisms, reform champions, and political will that prioritise long-term resilience over quick, short-term reconstruction. The 2025 floods resulted not from insufficient knowledge, but from unreformed political and institutional systems. Without operational frameworks to translate analysis into action, communities will remain vulnerable to predictable, recurring climate impacts.

Since the last week of September, police have registered five such cases but are reportedly reluctant to register another one that occurred recently, sources told Dawn.
A victim of such an incident visited the Khanna police station twice to register her case, but the police gave her a cold shoulder and made ‘lame excuses’.
Talking to Dawn, Mohammad Umer Saeed, son of the alleged victim, said his mother along with his sister, was waiting for a passenger vehicle on the Islamabad Expressway on Sunday when a car carrying three women stopped and called for passengers going to Gujar Khan. His mother and sister boarded the vehicle.
After some time, the passengers inside the vehicle snatched a purse from the victim.
When she raised an alarm, the suspects pushed her and her daughter out of the moving vehicle near Khanna and escaped. The purse contained a mobile phone and Rs2,000 in cash, he said.
Following the incident, the victim and her daughter went to the Khanna Police Station, but the “police ignored them, pretending to be busy”.
They waited for the duty officer to listen to their complaint, but no one paid attention, the citizen said. After some time, the duty officer left the police station without hearing her case, forcing her to return to her hometown, Gujar Khan.
The next day (Monday), she returned to the police station with her son and submitted a written complaint to the duty officer. The officer took her to the station clerk (moharrar), who told her that the duty officer on duty the previous day was on leave and that the matter was his responsibility. The clerk accepted her complaint but did not provide any receipt, complaint number, or e-tag and asked her to return later.
Since then, no one from the police station has contacted the family to inquire about the incident or inform them about any legal action.
Sources in the police said that since September 26, the capital police have registered five such cases. One case each was registered at the Secretariat and Tarnol police stations, where culprits looted Rs140,000 and Rs100,000 respectively.
In October, similar cases were reported at the Industrial Area, Secretariat and Khanna police stations, in which culprits looted Rs40,000, Rs80,000 and Rs300,000 respectively. The sources said that the gangs involved in these crimes operate with two distinct modus operandi. One group uses private cars to offer rides to people, while the other pretends to operate passenger vehicles.
The latter group also includes female accomplices who participate in the crimes and help lure victims. The gangs usually target people waiting at bus stops and pick them up under the pretext of taking them to their destinations before snatching their cash and valuables.

These measures stabilised the economy by choking all growth, the same tried and tested formula Pakistan has been using since 1988.
But the problem has always been the same: how to restart growth after stabilisation in a way that does not lead to a resurgence of the same deficits all over again. That has been the bane of Pakistan’s economy for too many decades now, booms followed by busts.
In the past, they always managed to get some sort of a bonanza from abroad to finance their growth. These inflows included borrowed money via the Foreign Currency Deposit Scheme in the 1990s, or the post 9/11 bonanza enjoyed by Musharraf, or the generous inflows from China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the middle of the 2010s, or the post Covid inflows and debt restructuring coupled with the temporary halt of the IMF programme in the period 2020 to 2022.
The few times we had adjustment without ensuing growth saw the country come to unendurable stagnation. Two examples would be the aftermath of the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement implementation (though 9/11 came along and changed everything) and the post Great Financial Crisis period following 2008.
 
 

The path from stagnation to growth was marked, in each case, with the same set of indicators moving in the same direction every time. First came the nascent signs of growth in the Large Scale Manufacturing Index. This was followed by rising import payments. Eventually, the import growth swamped exports, and the current account, which had been stabilised with much pain and sacrifice, returned to deficit. Then the deficits began to grow and the foreign currency reserves, which had peaked, began their downward slide. From there, things became unstoppable, because growth (of this sort) once begun, is very difficult to stop for any government.

The problem is how to restart growth after stabilisation in a way that does not lead to a resurgence of the same deficits all over again.

The government tries to shore up reserves with borrowed money, and once that effort runs its course, the reserves begin to fall. Once the fall gathers momentum the need to adjust the exchange rate rises and the government resists. Eventually, they are reduced to selling reserve dollars in the market in order to shore up the exchange rate, thereby accelerating the decline. Once reserves fall below certain thresholds it becomes necessary to adjust the exchange rate, and because they do it in one go, and at the last minute, the adjustment is traumatic and large.
Thus begins the eternal return to the IMF. Every government succeeds in putting this moment off long enough till they are no longer in power. And they all make the same argument: ‘while we were in power, the economy grew. It’s when the other guys came that everything started to go wrong.’
This is worth remembering and bearing in mind when looking at Pakistan today, because the same story is repeating itself all over again. Having hit ‘peak stability’ earlier this year, the government has been stuck in a low growth, low inflation equilibrium ever since. They cannot move forward towards growth. They cannot stay standing in this place for long either.
Estimates of the number of new entrants to Pakistan’s labour force range as high as two million every year. If the economy is not creating 2m new jobs every year, then unemployment rises. Some of these new entrants find income-generating opportunities through creating new businesses of their own in our time, but these businesses are almost always in the services sector, and don’t create enough value to be the bedrock of job creation on the scale that is required for a country the size of Pakistan.
As unemployment rises so does the number of people living below the poverty line. And those urban middle class folks who saw their incomes devastated during the period of the inflationary spiral find life turning into endless drudgery as their household incomes remain insufficient to meet even middle class life requirements.
This cumulative build-up of misery across society is channelled upward via any institution that taps the voice of the people at scale, such as political parties, mass and social media. The government of the day finds itself struggling to message out its accomplishments, which appear to the people like superficial vanities. Thus is born the desperation to pump growth, the first requirement for which is dollars.
This was the story every time since at least 1998. Musharraf entered claiming he inherited a bankrupt economy and had to make difficult decisions to stabilise it. But he left a bankrupt economy in 2008, while claiming the economy grew while he was in power and crashed only when the others entered office instead. The PPP government claimed it inherited a bankrupt economy, as did Nawaz Sharif in 2013 and Imran Khan in 2018. Each left a bankrupt economy too, but they claimed things were going well while they were in power (except for the PPP which could not even mount that claim since it never got the chance to pump growth as there never was much of a bailout for them beyond the IMF).
Now one more time the story is repeating itself, though we are in the early stages of the curve. The stabilisation part is done. The growth is yet to come. But even the small, incipient growth that the economy has registered in the past few months has caused import payments to rise and put pressure on the foreign exchange markets. The government is more unpopular than any in recent memory. And they are hungering for some sort of breakout. Whether or not it comes, it is worth remembering this tale always has the same ending.

PM Shehbaz visited Egypt last week to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. Among his many engagements with world leaders, the premier had also met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
 






Fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan noted that posts from multiple users on social media platform X, particularly PTI supporters, since October 13, had shared a low quality and blurry image of the meeting with the Armenian premier , claiming it showed PM Shehbaz and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the Middle East Summit in Egypt. This was despite Netanyahu not even attending the event.
Gulzar had also shared the image with the same claim in a now-deleted post with the following caption: “Article 6! Treason! Pakistan does not recognise Israel let alone a genocidal murderer like Netanyahu.”
 


“I have deleted my tweet on Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting with Netanyahu as the picture is not 100 per cent clear,” said Gulzar in a followup post.
The PTI MNA had further alleged: “What is 200pc clear and proof is available with ‘concerned’ people, a meeting was arranged between Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu. I will be demanding logs from Foreign Office of these secret meetings between Shehbaz Sharif and Netanyahu in summer 2025 to discuss Abraham Accords. Good luck on obtaining those. Meeting was arranged beforehand by friends of Israel. Full delegation from both sides present.”
 






Gulzar had subsequently reposted a copy of a first information report (FIR) lodged against her on Sunday at the NCCIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre on the complaint of Technical Assistant Aneesur Rehman under Sections 11 (hate speech), 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person) and 26A (punishment for false and fake information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR referred to the matter of the X posts alleging the PM Shehbaz-Netanyahu meeting, as well as others.
In a statement issued today, the NCCIA said that as per the investigation, the PTI MNA had shared several fake and misleading tweets and videos.
“The content included hateful and inflammatory statements against state institutions. The accused’s tweets attempted to incite racial and linguistic hatred.
“Shandana Gulzar spread fake images and false information regarding the prime minister of Pakistan. The false report alleged a meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The fake news spread fear, anxiety, and distrust among the public towards state institutions,” the NCCIA said.
“Investigations confirmed that the accused deliberately advanced an anti-state narrative through fake news.”
It added that the investigation is ongoing to identify other “individuals and accomplices behind the anti-state campaign”.</p><small>2025-10-23 03:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/230756050770673.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950700/punjab-runs-night-convoys-on-m-5-motorway-after-katcha-kidnappings' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab runs night convoys on M-5 motorway after Katcha kidnappings</strong></a><br><p> 

MOTORISTS wait for the convoy to get underway, near the Azampur Service Area on the M-5 motorway.—Dawn

• Two armoured vehicles lead each convoy through high-risk stretch
• 72 dacoits with over Rs60m head money surrender in Sindh
• Over 200 weapons laid down, including G3 rifles, RPG launchers and 12.7mm anti-aircraft guns
RAHIM YAR KHAN / SUKKUR: Police in Rahim Yar Khan have started running escorted night convoys on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) during the current week to protect motorists from Katcha dacoit gangs.
Traffic on the M-5 fell sharply after floods eroded a portion of the motorway near Jalalpur Pirwala in September, forcing many drivers to use the National Highway (N-5) instead. However, the traffic flow on M-5 rose again when one lane of the damaged stretch was restored and the motorway reopened via a diversion.
From 7pm to 6am, Rahim Yar Khan police are now halting all vehicles at the Azampur service area between Jamaldin Wali and Bhong and dispatching convoys every half an hour, led by two armoured police pickups. South-to-north traffic from the Sukkur side is escorted from the Guddu interchange to Azampur.
Police adopted the measure after the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped 10 people from multiple vehicles on the M-5 near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5. It was the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing the Sukkur-Multan Motorway within Punjab’s limits.
 
 

“It used to feel like the safest way to travel,” motorist Muhammad Shahid, who drove from Rahim Yar Khan to Rohri, told Dawn. “Now there’s uncertainty,” he lamented, adding that he waited about half an hour at Azampur and then crawled along with the convoy to Guddu interchange.
He added that once the limits of Sindh start, there were no convoys from Guddu to Sukkur, though Sindh police and another law enforcement agency were patrolling.
Another frequent traveller between Sukkur and Lahore said he felt uneasy on parts of the M-5, particularly between Iqbalabad and Rohri interchanges. He described Jahanpur Jungle near Qutub Din Shah service area as “the most frightening stretch where I felt extreme fear”.
RYK police spokesperson Zeeshan Rand­h­awa told Dawn the force was concerned about the safety of lives and property and had deployed bulletproof vehicles and trained personnel “equipped with modern weapons” to move traffic in convoys through high-risk areas.
Insisting that operations against robbers were ongoing, he said, “Once the area is safe, traffic will run as usual rather than in convoys.”
Ghotki SSP Anwar Khaitran told Dawn that Sindh Police had briefly used convoys in January and February last year, but now relied on temporary pickets and heavy patrolling.
“Eight Sindh Police vehicles and eight Rangers vehicles are always on the M-5, in addition to National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) units,” he said.
He added that the NHMP had written to the Punjab IG recommending convoys, but Sindh had addressed the risk through “extensive patrolling”.
SSP Khaitran stressed that government had to adopt a long-term strategy to find a permanent solution and eliminate the Katcha criminals. For this purpose, Katcha areas would be converted into Pacca areas by developing riverine areas and denying cover to criminals, he said.
Dacoits surrender

Separately, more than 70 wanted bandits surrendered under the Sindh government’s ‘Surrender Policy 2025’ at the Shikarpur SSP office on Wednesday, laying down over 200 weapons.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon, senior Rangers officers and local PPP leaders attended the ceremony.
Mr Lanjar praised the police, Rangers and cooperating tribal elders and paid tribute to the martyred officers.
Addressing the surrendering men, the minister said, “You’ve taken a commendable step. Serve your sentences and return as law-abiding citizens.”
He urged remaining gangs to accept the policy, saying it would unlock support for families in Katcha areas — from Benazir Income Support stipends to roads, schools, healthcare, veterinary services and land for homeless farmers.
Warning those still at large, he said: “Surrender, or you will be eliminated inside your hideouts.”
IGP Memon said law and order in Sindh was gradually improving. Kidnapping for ransom, a decades-long scourge, had “almost ended”, he claimed, citing a sustained crackdown since the so-called “Honey Trap Operation” began in 2012.
He said 171 dacoits had been killed and 421 captured injured during police operations.
Rangers’ Sector Commander highlighted joint operations in Katcha and pledged continued support.
DIG Larkana Nasir Aftab said the term “Katcha” had become synonymous with kidnapping and extortion, but coordinated action by police, Rangers and intelligence agencies had shifted the balance.
He said 282 suspects had applied to surrender; more than 70 approvals were issued, along with the deposit of 209 weapons at Wednesday’s ceremony.
Surrendered weapons included 62 G-3 rifles, 97 SMGs, 48 double-barrel shotguns, two RPG-7 launchers, an anti-tank RR-75 and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun. Authorities said the combined head money on the surrendered men exceeded Rs60 million.
According to police, several operations had been conducted, including in Garhi Tegho (where 107 hostages were rescued over five months), Kot Shaho, Jagan, Kalhoro (Madeji) and Bagarji (Sukkur).
In Operation Bachal Bhayo, notorious dacoit Shero Mahar was killed.

• Security man loses life in landmine blast
QUETTA: At least 11 militants were killed in separate operations in Chagai and Sibi districts over the past 24 hours, whereas two police constables were martyred in Noshki, and a security official lost his life to a landmine in Kachhi, officials said on Wednesday.
Officials said security forces launched an intelligence-based operation in the mountainous area of Dalbandin in Chagai after reports of militants hiding there. Troops cordoned off the location and came under heavy fire. A fierce gun battle ensued and lasted about an hour, leaving six suspects dead.
“The Fitna al-Hindustan terrorists were hiding in the area and were detected through aerial reconnaissance,” officials said, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the hideout. They said the operation had reduced threats to security forces and civilians in the vicinity.
 
 

In a separate action, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an operation in Sibi after a tip-off about the presence of members of a banned outfit.
CTD personnel surrounded a compound where the suspects were holed up. The militants opened fire and a firefight lasting more than an hour ensued, leaving five suspects dead, CTD sources said.
Arms, ammunition, maps and documents allegedly detailing attack plans were recovered from the site. Officials said the slain men were linked to past attacks on security forces, police and Levies personnel. All five bodies were shifted to a hospital.
Two cops martyred
Meanwhile in Noshki, two police constables were gunned down by unidentified attackers on Wednesday.
Police said Abdul Razzaq and Obaid Ullah were travelling to police lines when assailants on motorbikes opened fire near the Gharibabad western bypass.
“Both constables sustained multiple bullet wounds and [were martyred] on the spot,” said Noshki SHO Zahoor Baloch.
Police moved the bodies to the district hospital and started an investigation. No group had claimed responsibility by late Wednesday.
In another incident in Kachhi district’s Sanni Shoran area, a security man lost his life when a landmine planted beside a road exploded as a patrol vehicle passed. Police said the blast also badly damaged the vehicle.

• Azma asks PPP to rein in its Punjab leader, take notice of remarks
ISLAMABAD: Amid uncertainty over the status of the country’s main wheat-buying body, the PPP has sought clarity from the federal government on the wheat procurement mechanism after the minimum support price was recently set at Rs3,500 per 40kg.
In May this year, the federal food minister informed the National Assembly that the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) was being abolished because the market had been deregulated and the government was not buying the staple anymore.
It may be noted that in line with the IMF demand, the government had deregulated the wheat market much to the chagrin of farmers, but a decision recently overturned through the national wheat policy.
 
 

Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked the PML-N government in Punjab as to who would procure wheat and under what mechanism, following the “abolition” of Passco.
Addressing a press conference, the PPP leader said that in the absence of Passco, farmers were at the mercy of middlemen who had been buying at a price much lower than the recently announced price of Rs3,500.
Mr Murtaza also spoke about the differences with the coalition partner, PML-N, and urged the need for dialogue to resolve disagreements.
“We are allies, you (PMLN) should sit with us and talk so that these differences do not surface again,” he said. He referred to recent reports about the withdrawal of security from Lahore’s Bilawal House, which was denied by the provincial government. “If someone reported that security was removed from Bilawal House in Lahore, they (PMLN) denied it in the media and did not contact us,” he rued.
About the flood relief plan that stirred differences between the two parties, Mr Murtaza clarified that the PPP had given the government an “immediate relief plan” on the flood issue and suggested that the data of the Benazir Income Support Program be used for the purpose, but there was an uproar by the PML-N government over this suggestion.
 
 

He claimed the Punjab CM was provided inaccurate statistics regarding the floods and subsequent losses. “Farmers needed urgent money; for this, we asked you (PMLN) to use the BISP data and provide immediate assistance to the growers so that they could meet their needs,” he added.
Mr Murtaza said the PPP did not want to derail the system, adding that at least the spokespersons of the Punjab government should reconsider their choice of words.
The PPP leader also complained that research centres were not providing seeds to the farmers. “What will a poor farmer do with the limited compensation amount of Rs5,000 per acre when a bag of DAP fertiliser is available for Rs15,000,” he added.
Local govt law
He also reiterated reservations against the local government law. He said the PPP expressed reservations on the legislation as the law was “questionable”. However, the PPP will participate in the polls, he added. “We have serious reservations about the legislation, as non-party-based elections are the beginning of pre-poll rigging,” he said, adding that the PPP would soon present its strategy regarding the local bodies act. “Even if our concerns are not addressed, we will not leave the field open. The PPP will actively participate in the upcoming local government elections,” he said.
It may be noted that the Election Commission of Pakistan on Oct 21 asked the Punjab government to formulate the delimitation rules within four months in light of the new law, as it withdrew an earlier order under which polls could have been held by the end of this year.
‘Take notice’
The PML-N, however, took exception to the press conference by Mr Murtaza, particularly the criticism of the agri policies and the local government act. Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari asked the PPP to take notice of Hassan Murtaza’s remarks; otherwise, the PML-N would be compelled to respond to him.
“Whether Murtaza is conspiring against his own leadership… If anyone owes an apology, it should be to Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto, who could not even keep such defeated elements under control,” she quipped. Ms Bokhari said the PPP never missed a chance to malign the PML-N leadership.
After months of broadsides, the acrimony between the PPP and the PML-N came to an apparent end following meetings between the top leaders, including PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The PM even agreed to use BISP for flood relief, while the PPP central executive committee decided to give its ally one month’s time to make good on the ‘unfulfilled’ promises.

IN PAKISTAN, one-tola (24kt) price has plunged by Rs19,538 in the last six days.—Reuters/file

KARACHI: Gold prices in the local market continued their downward trend on Wednesday, following a sharp decline in international rates.
The prices of 10 grams and one tola of gold dropped by Rs6,463 and Rs7,538, respectively, settling at Rs374,967 and Rs437,362.
According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), global gold prices fell by $85 per ounce to $4,150 on Wednesday. Since last Friday, international prices have declined by $208 per ounce, resulting in a cumulative decrease of Rs19,538 in the domestic one-tola rate.
Despite the decline, demand has remained subdued. All Pakistan Jewellery Manufacturers Association Chairman Mohammad Arshad stated that despite the ongoing wedding season, customers have not returned in significant numbers.
He noted that demand had already begun to taper off when the price of gold crossed Rs400,000 per tola.
“Many people still cannot afford gold despite the recent drop,” he said, adding that it is difficult for consumers to purchase even a single tola jewellery set, which still costs around Rs450,000.
According to Reuters, gold prices fell on Wednesday to a near two-week low, following their sharpest single-day drop in five years in the previous session, as investors booked profits ahead of key US inflation data due this week.
 
 

Gold prices have notched multiple record highs and gained 54pc this year, bolstered by geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, expectations of US rate cuts and strong inflows into ETFs. Prices fell 5.3pc on Tuesday, after notching a record high of $4,381.21 per ounce in the preceding session.
Friday’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, delayed due to the ongoing US government shutdown, is expected to show that core inflation held at 3.1pc in September.
Arshad said that persistently high bullion prices and weak jewellery demand have impacted manufacturing units, with around 60pc of them struggling to sustain operations. Others have scaled down their workforce due to reduced orders.
He also pointed out that investors, who had earlier purchased gold bars and coins, are now holding off on further buying, adopting a wait-and-see approach. He declined to predict future price movements, stating that much would depend on global factors, including political developments.

Subsequently, the PTI has responded that the offer can be considered if the government demonstrates its “seriousness” on the issue.
In an appearance on Asma Shirazi’s talk-show on Hum News, Federal Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry suggested that Mr Khan could be shifted to Banigala, where PTI leaders and his family members can meet him on a daily basis.
 






Later, talking to Dawn, Mr Chaudhry said that there were 8,000 prisoners in Adiala jail and they were also suffering beca­use of the PTI founder and his political activities.
“We are ready to shift him if they submit an appl­i­cation. There [at Bani­gala] PTI leaders can meet him and play Ludo and other games day and night,” the minister added.
He said that Mr Khan cannot be released, but he can be shifted to his Banigala residence by declaring it a sub-jail.
“The PTI should submit a written application to shift Imran Khan from Ad­i­­ala to Banigala. And we will do that [shift him].”
‘Will consider offer’
When approached for a reaction, PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser told Dawn that although he was unaware of such an offer, but it can be considered if the government showed its seriousness.
“I have a gut feeling that the government will backtrack on it. However, if it is serious, we can discuss the offer within the party, our legal team and also with Imran Khan. If Khan sahib gives the nod, we will defiantly submit the [written] application,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser said that the PTI founder was in jail for over two years and legally he has become entitled for bail.
“If the government is serious, it should remove pressure from the judiciary and let the bail be accepted.”
He said that as a gesture of goodwill, the government should allow PTI leaders and family members to meet Mr Khan in jail so that developments could proceed.
It is worth mentioning that in January 2024, the PTI founder’s spouse Bushra Bibi had surrendered herself before the accountability court after being sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana case. Later, she was shifted to her husband’s Banigala residence, which was declared a sub-jail.
However, Ms Bushra alleged that she was being poisoned there.
Later, she approached the Islamabad High Court, which in May last year ordered her transfer from the Banigala residence back to Adiala Jail.

• Official says Pak-EPA lacks financial, technical resources to do its job
• Senate panel urges Centre to strengthen initiatives for climate-vulnerable Gilgit-Baltistan
• Calls for sharing of early-warning data for disaster prevention in northern areas
ISLAMABAD / GILGIT: Critical inadequacies in Pakistan’s environmental oversight were highlighted on Wednesday, after a parliamentary committee heard that emission standards remain frozen at Euro-II levels, a benchmark long-abandoned by most nations.
Following the revelation, the National Assembly’s Standing Comm­ittee on Climate Change and Environ­mental Coordination voiced serious concerns and directed the Ministry of Climate Change to present a mechanism for air-quality monitoring, along with a comprehensive action plan.
During the sitting, the committee received a joint briefing from the ministry and the Islamabad Capital Terri­tory administration and was informed that country’s vehicle emission limits remain at Euro-II, far below modern Euro-V and Euro-VI standards.
The panel also noted that the current National Environmental Quality Standards only correspond to Euro-II levels, which have long lost relevance given deteriorating air quality and international shifts toward Euro-V and Euro-VI benchmarks.
“There is no mechanism in place to check emissions or enforce compliance,” said MNA Munaza Hassan, who chairs the committee, characterising the situation as a fundamental failure of oversight.
The scale of the challenge became clearer when Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon told the committee that the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) — the body responsible for monitoring air quality — lacks both the financial resources and technical capacity to fulfil its mandate.
He said the agency had borrowed testing units from Punjab’s EPA, while the Capital Development Authority funded the purchase of five additional units.
Directing the climate ministry to prepare a comprehensive, time-bound air-quality improvement plan within four weeks, the committee called for increased funding and emphasised that the climate agenda must figure prominently in Pakistan’s foreign engagements.
Experts invited to the meeting said targeted management actions could reduce air pollution by up to 30 per cent.
They proposed pragmatic interventions such as staggered school and office timings, improved road infrastructure and catalytic converters for older vehicles and motorbikes.
Further recommendations included incentivising retrofitting, mandating emission testing during vehicle transfers and transitioning to Euro-V-compliant fuels.
“We should at least try to make Islamabad a model city,” Ms Hassan concluded.
More climate action in vulnerable GB
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and SAFRON decided to recommend that the federal government enhance efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the region.
The committee, chaired by Senator Asad Qasim, met in Skardu on Tuesday to discuss climate impacts, forest protection and the status of disaster-preparedness projects. “Gilgit-Baltistan is among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts,” Qasim told Dawn.
“This year, GB experienced unprecedented climate change-induced disasters. Glaciers melting, cloudbursts and glacial-lake outburst floods badly affected GB.”
Qasim said the committee’s goal is to prevent future catastrophes and address challenges faced by the local population.
“We don’t like to see these disasters again in future; we will work for mitigation of the climate change disasters,” he said. “We are listening to the challenges faced by local people from climate change impacts. We have come here to see for ourselves.”
Officials briefed the committee on forest protection efforts and were directed to share a working plan for forests.
They also called for incentives to create awareness and motivation for forest conservation within local communities.
Officials said a comprehensive legal framework is in place to protect forests and that 1.1 million cubic feet of illegal timber has been seized and a plan for its legal utilisation is being prepared.
They noted that residents often depend on wood for fuel because of a lack of electricity, but projects for clean energy generation are being completed on the prime minister’s special instructions.
The meeting was attended by Senators Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, Nasir Mahmood and Ataulhaq, GB Additional Chief Secretary Waheed Shah, Director General GB Disaster Management Authority Zakir Hussain, Commissioner Baltistan Division Kamal Khan and Deputy Commissioner Skardu Hamza Murad.
Early warning systems
A separate sitting of the Senate panel on the UNDP-funded GLOF-II and Early Warning System was also convened in Skardu to review disaster management and early-warning systems in GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
Project Head Muteeb Ali told members that of 292 early-warning stations established in GB and KP, 218 are fully functional; 77 face communication issues and civil work is underway at 23 others.
The committee directed full coordination among the Gilgit-Baltistan Disa­ster Management Auth­ority, district administrations, the Meteorological Department and the UNDP to make the system more effective.
Members also stressed that all relevant agencies should be given access to early-warning data and the dashboard to enable a timely, coordinated response during any emergency.

According to a report compiled by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), second sitting had the highest number of MNAs (200 or 61pc of the current membership) present during the session. 
The third sitting had the lowest number of MNAs in attendance (159 or 49pc). As many as 216 (66pc ) MNAs skipped at least one sitting during the session.
As Many as 50 (23pc of 216) MNAs submitted applications for leave of absence during the session. As many as 166 (77 pc of 216) MNAs skipped the House proceedings without any formal leave application in advance.
Among the cabinet members, four federal ministers and one state minister attended all the sittings. The PM did not attend any sitting, while the office of the Leader of the Opposition remained vacant during the session.
Attendance patterns by sitting
As in previous sessions, female members generally had higher attendance than their male counterparts. The second sitting saw the highest attendance, with 200 members (61pc of the current membership) present.
This session was a Private Members’ Day, during which the minister for housing and works moved motion 288 to suspend the agenda to discuss the country’s flood situation under motion 259, which had been previously introduced by the minister for parliamentary affairs in the first sitting. The lowest attendance occurred during the third (last) sitting, with only 159 members (49pc ) present. An analysis of attendance records and leave applications announced during the proceedings shows that 216 members (66pc of the current strength) missed at least one sitting during the session. However, only 50 members (23pc of those absent) submitted applications seeking leave from the House for their absence.

“PM Shehbaz discussed the current overall political landscape with KP lawmakers and leaders, as well as reviewed progress on ongoing development projects in the province,” said the statement.
“The meeting focused on federal efforts to boost socio-economic development in KP and enhance coordination between the Centre and provincial stakeholders,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier stressed the “need for sustained political engagement to ensure stability and growth in the province,” the report said.
During the meeting, PM Shehbaz “emphasised that KP remains a key priority in the national agenda”.
The prime minister also “directed relevant authorities to expedite key infrastructure and welfare projects”.
The PTI-led KP government’s relationship with the federal government has grown increasingly tense in recent weeks, particularly on the matter of counter-terrorism efforts.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to displacements.
On October 20, the newly elected KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
He also criticised the Centre for not providing KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism or “other Constitutional rights.”</p><small>2025-10-22 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22212621569d1e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950590/climate-change-population-growth-hindering-pakistan-from-becoming-3tr-economy-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>Climate change, population growth hindering Pakistan from becoming $3tr economy: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that unchecked population growth and climate change are hindering Pakistan from becoming a $3 trillion economy.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost 45pc of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
At the same time, Pakistan has been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025.
“I have been clear right from the beginning that we have two existential issues because if we don’t tackle them correctly … there are two reasons that could derail us from becoming a $3tr economy and those are climate change and population growth,” said the finance minister in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’.
Aurangzeb said the former was no longer merely “an academic discussion” but something “we are living day in and day out”, pointing to the onset of the smog season in Lahore and the recent flood which devastated large tracts of Pakistan.
The finance czar said the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events were increasing, adding that he had participated in three forums during the last week that discussed the matter of climate change.
 
 

“There is no way to put a value on the precious human lives we have lost,” he said of the deaths in the recent floods and climate disasters overall, adding that the growth goal for this year was targeted at 4.2pc but “there is no doubt now that at least 0.4-0.5pc will be shaved off.”
He stated that 80pc of the damage caused by the recent floods was sustained in Punjab, predominantly impacting the agriculture sector, especially rice and cotton-producing regions.
Regarding the government measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, the finance minister said Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik was tasked by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to devise a plan for the next 300 days.
MNCs exiting Pakistan
 
 

Questioned about the recent high-profile departures of multinational companies from the country, Aurangzeb said there were multiple aspects to the issue.
“These global companies make decisions on their participation regarding which clients to stay with, which products to stay with and in which countries to remain.”
Mentioning his own past example, he pointed to the exit of the Royal Bank of Scotland from Pakistan, adding that the entity had decided at the time to exit all global money markets.
He further said that while some companies were indeed exiting, some entered the market during the past three to four years, pointing to Aramco and others.
There have been a flurry of announcements over the last few years by various multinational corporations either exiting Pakistan or significantly scaling down their operations here. Some of the prominent ones include Procter & Gamble, Shell, Caltex and Eli Lily, among others.
There has also been a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity, where more than half of products tracked by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics through the Large Scale Manufacturing index have exhibited a median drop in production of 10pc annually, over the last two years.
Stability but no growth due to no reforms: Miftah Ismail
Meanwhile, speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, former finance minister Miftah Ismail said that while stability was indeed achieved, key reforms were needed for growth but they were not carried out and instead the government had not reduced its expenses but raised taxes, thus dampening demand.
He also pointed to the lack of reduction in the share of the provinces in the National Finance Commission award as a reason for lack of growth.
The former finance minister also criticised government sprawl at the federal and provincial levels, saying: “If the government steps back just a little, the private sector will handle it.”
Ismail said there was a lack of incentive for foreign companies to enter the country with his high taxation and utility costs for gas and electricity. He added that the entire energy infrastructure of the country needed a rehaul to move away to more cheaper methods such as solar and wind.</p><small>2025-10-22 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22221726d6dd2ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950595/pakistan-will-not-travel-to-india-for-junior-hockey-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not travel to India for Junior Hockey World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Hockey Federation on Wednesday finalised its decision to not send its team to India for next month’s Junior World Cup, slated to held from Nov 28 to Dec 10.
The decision came after a high-profile meeting in Islamabad where the security issues and India’s hostile approach towards Pakistan in the sports sector, particularly the conduct of its cricket team during the recent Asia Cup, came under discussion.
“The PHF will convey its decision to Hockey India soon,” a PHF official told Dawn.com. “The PHF and the government don’t want to compromise on security of players, therefore we decided not to send our team.”
International Cricket Council, the sports global body, has arranged for neutral venues for both Pakistan and India during tournaments held in either country. Hockey’s governing body, the FIH, however, hasn’t made any such hybrid arrangement.

A press release issued today said the decision was taken during PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja’s visit to Karachi. During his visit, he met party leaders, including PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, PTI Parliamentary Leader Shabbir Qureshi and Jamal Siddiqui.
Raja held detailed discussions on the prevailing political situation, strategy for party founder Imran Khan’s release and organisational matters.
Addressing the media after the meetings, Raja announced that a “massive public rally will be held in Karachi” in November, followed by similar gatherings in Hyderabad and other major cities as part of a nationwide public engagement campaign.
The senior PTI leader added that the party was united and mobilised for Imran’s release.
 
 

He informed those present that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated as opposition leader in the National Assembly and Raja Nasir Abbas in the Senate, while Sohail Afridi had been appointed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, terming the recent moves as symbolising “a wave of political renewal within PTI”.
“We stand firm for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law,” Barrister Raja said. “Truth and justice will prevail. All cases fabricated against Imran Khan are proving false in the courts. However, delaying tactics are being used to hinder justice, but these baseless cases will soon be over.”
Reiterating Imran’s message to the nation, Raja said: “Patron in Chief Imran Khan has urged the people to keep faith in Allah Almighty; victory always belongs to truth. He has directed the party to reach out to the public through rallies across the country to raise awareness against oppression and injustice.”
Expressing grave concern over the situation in Sindh, Raja said that the PPP had “in the last 17 years … turned Sindh into ruins”.
He noted that from Karachi to the interior of the province, cities were in a state of decay, adding that lawlessness and insecurity had made life miserable for citizens.
Raja said he had personally visited several cities of Sindh and found a “scene of desolation and hopelessness everywhere“.
“Rampant corruption by the PPP has plundered Sindh’s public resources,” he asserted. “But the people of Sindh are now awake. Wherever we went, we witnessed overwhelming support for Imran Khan. The people of Sindh want change; they want a leader like Imran Khan: honest, brave, and dedicated to the nation.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
The party said last week that Imran has offered to resolve the recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan and other issues if he is released on parole.
The party had also aired concerns earlier this month about Imran being transferred from Adiala Jail to some unknown location to prevent his access to his family and legal team.</p><small>2025-10-22 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22165639411776e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950570/saudi-arabia-bans-employers-from-charging-domestic-workers-for-recruitment-work-permit' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia bans employers from charging domestic workers for recruitment, work permit</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia has banned employers from charging any fees to their domestic workers, including for recruitment and work permits, setting maximum penalties of a fine worth 20,000 riyals (SR) and a three-year ban on hiring, according to Saudi Gazette.
The Saudi outlet reported on Monday that employers were banned from “charging any fees from their domestic workers”, including those “related to recruitment, change of professions, transfer of services, residency permit (iqama) and work permits”.
 






Saudi Gazette said the provisions were included in the “Guide to the Rights and Obligations of Domestic Workers”, issued by the Saudi human resources ministry. It added that the new regulations “include a package of rights that guarantee the domestic worker a decent life and a stable work environment”.
According to a guide available on the Saudi human resources ministry’s website, professions/jobs permitted by law in the domestic worker sector include “domestic worker, private driver, educator, home nurse, home cook, home planning, home travel, home life, home manager, home guard, home farmer, home coffee-maker, personal assistant, and physical therapy specialist”.
The guidelines also allow the addition of any other profession that may be within household tasks.
The guide defines a domestic worker as any person “who performs domestic work or the like directly or indirectly for the domestic employer and any member of the staff under his supervision who performs domestic work or someone who takes his place”.
 
 

To deter violations, the regulations set a “financial fine that may reach up to SR20,000, in addition to the possibility of being banned from recruiting for a period of up to three years”.
The ban may be extended to become permanent in some cases, with the penalty doubled in case of repeated violation, the report added.
Meanwhile, the regulations also mandate domestic workers to ensure proper conduct, including taking care of the employer’s property, maintaining household secrets, respecting Islam and keeping societal values and morals in mind.
A domestic worker who violates the regulations will face a fine of up to SR2,000, or a permanent ban on working in Saudi Arabia, or both.
“Fines shall be multiplied by the number of violations proven against the domestic worker. The violating domestic worker shall bear the costs of his return to his home country,” the guide stated.
According to the Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, over 2.05 million Pakistani workers, including those in the domestic sector, were registered for employment in Saudi Arabia from 2020 to September this year.
Rights of domestic workers
The new regulations also stipulate that “domestic workers shall be disbursed with their wages according to the unified contract signed with the employer,” Saudi Gazette reported.
Saudi Arabia has recorded minor violations of its strict labour regulations for decades, allowing an influx of cheap labour used both by companies and as domestic workers.
Yemen, Egypt, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines all have large numbers of citizens working in the country and all rely heavily on their remittances.
According to Saudi Gazette, the new guidelines stress workers’ right to a weekly rest day agreed upon in the contract.
The provisions also include “daily rest hours of no less than eight continuous hours, in addition to a full month’s leave after completing two years of continuous work if the worker wishes to renew the work contract”.
Domestic workers also have the right to obtain a “travel ticket to his/her country every two years at the employer’s expense, an end-of-service gratuity equivalent to one month’s salary upon completing four consecutive years, and sick leave of up to 30 days per year when needed, based on an approved medical report”.
They also have the right to keep all their identification documents, such as their passport and iqama, with the employer not allowed to confiscate them.
Under the guidelines, as per Saudi Gazette, the employer is obligated to enable the worker to communicate with his family in a normal manner, issue and renew residency and legal licences at his own expense, and pay the monthly wage regularly as per the contract.
 
 

In 2008, the Human Rights Watch called on Saudi Arabia to improve labour law protections and end its “sponsorship” system to prevent domestic workers from being treated like slaves.
Under the “sponsorship” system, also known as the “kafala” system, foreigners in Saudi Arabia obtain a visa through their employer, who usually retains their passports, binding them to the recruiter.
In 2021, the kingdom amended the kafala system by allowing some migrant workers to leave the country without their employer’s permission.</p><small>2025-10-22 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2216591463b58f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950575/fo-condemns-israels-renewed-attacks-on-gaza-calls-on-intl-community-to-intervene' target='_blank'><strong>FO condemns Israel’s renewed attacks on Gaza, calls on int’l community to intervene</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday condemned Israel’s renewed hostilities in Gaza, following a US-backed ceasefire agreement, calling on the international community to take “urgent and effective” measures against the violation.
Israeli forces have killed at least 87 Palestinians, among them civilians, since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and two Israeli soldiers were killed by Palestinian freedom fighters in southern Gaza over the weekend, Reuters reported. On Sunday, more than 100 air strikes were reported in Rafah and Khan Younis in the south, Jabalia in the north, and other parts of central Gaza.
While Israel accuses Hamas of initiating the hostilities with an attack on its forces in Rafah, the group has denied any knowledge or connection to the incident.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, resulting in the loss of numerous civilian lives,” said a statement released by the Foreign Office (FO) today.
 






It noted that Israeli actions “run contrary to the spirit of the peace agreement signed in Sharm El-Sheikh in the presence of leadership from the Muslim and Arab world, [the] US, Europe, and the UN.”
The FO, in its statement, urged the international community to “take urgent and effective measures to end these violations and to ensure full implementation of the ceasefire and protection of Palestinian civilians.
“Reaffirming its unwavering support for the Palestinian people, Pakistan calls for an immediate end to Israeli hostilities and reiterates its principled position for the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
Pakistan was among the eight countries that worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
Most Americans support US recognition of Palestinian state, poll shows
Most Americans — including 80 per cent of Democrats and 41pc of Republicans — think the US should recognise Palestinian statehood, a sign that Trump’s opposition to doing so is out of step with public opinion, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
The six-day poll, which closed on Monday, found 59pc of respondents backed US recognition of a Palestinian state, while 33pc were opposed and the rest were unsure or did not answer the question.
About half of Trump’s Republicans — 53pc — opposed doing so, while 41pc of Republicans said they would support the US recognising a Palestinian state.
A growing number of countries — including US allies Britain, Canada, France and Australia — have formally recognised Palestinian statehood in recent weeks, drawing condemnation from Israel, whose founding in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and decades of conflict.
Israeli bombardments have leveled vast swaths of Palestinian neighbourhoods in Gaza following an October 2023 surprise attack by Hamas on Israel.
Some 60pc of poll respondents said Israel’s response in Gaza was excessive, compared to 32pc who disagreed.
Trump, who returned to the White House in January, has largely backed Israel in its offensive and this month brokered a ceasefire, raising hopes that a lasting peace could be in reach.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll gave signs that the US public was ready to give Trump credit should his plan work. Some 51pc of poll respondents agreed with a statement that Trump “deserves significant credit” if peace efforts are successful, compared with 42pc who disagreed.
 
 

While only one in 20 Democrats approve of Trump’s overall performance as president, one in four said he should get significant credit if the peace holds.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and gathered responses from 4,385 people nationwide. It had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</p><small>2025-10-22 12:53</small></div><hr>
