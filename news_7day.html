First introduced in the United States this year, the feature is now expanding globally, with Pakistan among the latest countries to gain access.
The tool, powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5, enables people to ask longer and more complex questions that previously required multiple searches. Available in English, AI Mode can be accessed via the Google app on Android and iOS, as well as on mobile and desktop web.
In a statement, Google said that early testers have shown that queries are already two to three times longer than traditional searches, highlighting the tool’s usefulness for exploratory tasks such as comparing products, planning trips, or tackling “how-to” questions.
“It dives deep to answer multiple questions at once, with helpful links for further exploration,” the company said.
Google explained that Pakistani users can use ‘AI Mode’ for different use cases, including “Planning a trip” by writing a prompt about a trip to any place at a particular time and seeking suggestions from the AI mode for a five-day itinerary that balances sightseeing, adventure and local food experiences, with a follow-up prompt: “Can you recommend some local food spots or traditional dishes in that particular area?”
At the same time, the other prompts could be related to the education of children, such as the example of a child in grade 9 struggling with math. “Can you suggest free online resources in Pakistan to help with algebra and geometry?” and the follow-up prompt like “Can you recommend interactive apps or YouTube channels for grade 9 math practice?”
 
 

Behind the scenes, AI Mode uses a “query fan-out” technique, breaking down a user’s question into subtopics and running multiple searches simultaneously.
This approach allows Google to surface highly relevant content from across the web, combining it with information from the Knowledge Graph and real-time shopping data for billions of products.
The feature is also multimodal, allowing users to interact through text, voice or images. For example, a photo of unfamiliar spices at a local market could be uploaded with the question: “What are these spices and how can I use them in Pakistani cooking?” Follow-up questions can then be asked in a conversational style, creating a seamless browsing experience.
Google said AI Mode is designed to deliver deeper, smarter and more comprehensive results, but acknowledged that, as with any early-stage AI system, responses may not always be accurate.

The study, titled “Unveiling exploitation and abuse in the brick kilns of Punjab”, was conducted in collaboration with the Pakistan Partnership Initiative.
The investigation highlighted systemic exploitation, gender-based violence, debt bondage, and widespread denial of basic labour rights to brick kiln workers.
The report was based on extensive field research in Faisalabad and Kasur — two of Punjab’s brick kiln hubs.  Surveys of 200 workers and in-depth interviews with 30 victims led to documented case studies. The study engaged trade unions, kiln owners, and officials from the Punjab Labour Department to provide a multi-stakeholder perspective.
Speaking at the launch event, NCHR Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said: “Today’s report follows months of fieldwork, interviews, and surveys identifying violence, exploitation, and abuse in Punjab’s brick kilns. It documents laws ignored, promises broken, and dignity denied.”
She said the NCHR had long been demanding reform in this most inhumane of sectors. “For all of us, ending bonded labour is not charity. It is not a favour. It is justice and human dignity. It is the fulfilment of our Constitution’s promise.”
Justice Jawad Hassan of the Lahore High Court, the chief guest, said the evolution of bonded labour from colonial bondage to constitutional protection showed progress, but the brick kiln horrors reminded of unfinished work.
“It is incumbent not just on the judiciary but also on the legislative and executive branches to work towards correcting these horrors and let this report ignite collective action for a Pakistan where no worker is bonded, and dignity prevails,” Justice Jawad Hassan said.
He called for legislative reforms, judicial and institutional strengthening and collaborative action to end this extreme form of exploitation.
Violation of Constitution
Abdul Khalique Shiekh, the Secretary, Ministry of Human Rights, said: “Bonded labour is a violation of our Constitution, our laws, and our commitments under international human rights treaties.”  He said the government had taken important steps to ensure that brick kiln workers live a life of dignity, citing amendments to labour laws, initiatives like the Elimination of Bonded Labour in brick kilns project  and efforts to regulate advances. “But we know more is needed.”
 
 

Abdul Khalique Shiekh said such studies were essential to show where gaps remained between law and enforcement, between policy and practice. “They remind us that passing laws is only the first step. Implementation is the true test of justice.”
Ashraf Wadhawa Mall, the PPI CEO, said the study had exposed the extreme conditions faced by brick kiln workers. He said so far 2,339 families from brick kilns across the country had been rescued and rehabilitated.
The study documents extreme abuses ranging from verbal and physical harassment to cases of abduction and even murder. Women workers remained especially vulnerable, subjected to rampant sexual harassment, coercion, and forced marriages. Workers continued to labour in unsafe, unhygienic, and exploitative conditions under extreme weather, often receiving wages well below the legal minimum and having no access to social security.
The study showed that 97 per cent workers entered kilns because of urgent loans, 90pc had no written contracts, leaving them invisible to labour protection efforts and over 70pc of families lived in a single cramped room. It said 92pc workers reported verbal abuse, many described beatings, torture and even abductions.

The decision was taken on Tuesday at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti and attended by provincial Finance Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan, Principal Secretary Babar Khan and banking sector expe­rts. It reviewed an initial feasibility report for the project and declared it viable.
The chief minister dire­cted the officials concer­ned to prepare a comprehensive and operational plan within one week. “The Bank of Balochistan will be a revolutionary step aimed at providing high-quality and accessible banking services to the business community, traders, industrialists, investors and common people,” Mr Bugti said.
He added that the initiative would not only boost economic activity but also generate employment opp­o­r­t­unities for the youth. “The Bank of Balochistan will prove to be a milestone in stabilising the provincial economy and will accelerate development projects by utilising local resources,” he said.
 
 

Mr Bugti assured the public that they would soon receive good news regarding the project, saying the bank would initially meet provincial needs but could also play a role at the national level in future.
Banking experts, who joined the meeting via video link, stressed the importance of the decision, saying the establishment of a provincial bank would make financial resources available for development projects.
The idea of setting up the Bank of Balochistan was first announced in the provincial budget for fiscal year 2007-08 by then finance minister Syed Ehsan Shah during the coalition government of Nawab Aslam Khan Raisani. In the 2017-18 budget, then finance minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi allocated Rs10 billion for the project, but it did not materialise for unspecified reasons.

Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) Chief Exec­utive Officer Babir Sahib Din told Dawn that all residential and commercial property owners in Lahore’s upscale localities, including Gulberg, Johar Town, Muslim Town, New Mus­lim Town, Shadman, Faisal Town, Garden Town, Upper Mall Scheme, and the localities facing the Canal Road, Mall Road, and Jail Road will receive their bills next month.
Private housing schemes are exempt, however, because they have their own disposal system. “This was in the works for long and finally the government decided to impose a clea­n­liness fee in a bid to ensure excellent cleanliness in all area­s, starting from the posh ones in the first phase,” he revealed.
Penalty
The proposal to introduce a cleanliness fee regime had been approved by the Punjab cabinet in a meeting held a few months ago after the launch of the Suthra Punjab Progra­mme. However, its implementation across the province may take up to two months.

Defaulters to face hefty fines, even FIRs for littering

An LWMC spokesperson said that those people who failed to pay their bills will have their waste disposal service cancelled after two months. Besides, they could face hefty fines and FIRs if they were found dumping their waste illegally, he said.
Fee categories
Under this regime, Rs300 per month fee has been fixed for a five-marla house, Rs500 for up to 10-marla, Rs1,000 fee for the houses measuring one kanal and above.
Likewise, Rs500 to Rs3,000 cleanliness fee has been fixed for business premises according to nature and volume of the business. Rs200 fee has been suggested for houses in rural areas.
Mr Din said people in the posh localities of other districts, including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Sahiwal, Faisalabad, and Sargo­dha, would also receive cleanliness bills for August in the coming days.
He said these neighbourhoods would be declared ‘zero-waste’ areas, so the government would impose fines in case anyone was found littering. “
Our enforcement inspectors and their staff will start making rounds of these localities very soon. And if they found anyone littering, a fine would immediately be imposed on such people,” he warned, requesting the people to refrain from such acts.
He said the core objective behind the introduction of the cleanliness regime was not only to make the waste management system sustainable but also to create a sense of ownership among the public at large.

• Jailed founder refuses to accept Salman Akram Raja’s resignation; throws his weight behind Achakzai as potential replacement for NA opposition leader
ISLAMABAD: Changing its mind once again, the PTI has decided to boycott the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assemblies, in line with the opinion of its incarcerated leader, Imran Khan.
The decision was taken by the party’s political committee, which met to consider Mr Khan’s input following a meeting with his legal team at Adiala Jail on Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, Mr Khan’s message was relayed to the media by his sister, Aleema Khan, who also met Mr Khan in prison.
She was flanked by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — whose resignation was reportedly turned down by the incarcerated former PM.
Denying reports of a bitter exchange with Mr Raja, she said the lawyer was “like family” to them. She said her brother had asked the party’s political committee to hold another meeting on the by-election issue based on his instructions, and report back to him.
Later on Tuesday night, PTI MNA Amir Dogar confirmed that the political committee had endorsed Imran Khan’s opinion on not contesting by-elections, adding that party lawmakers would also start quitting parliamentary bodies soon.
Imran’s view
Talking about nominations to appoint new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, Salman Akram Raja said that for them, Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were still the opposition leaders, adding that they were still contesting their cases and would fulfil all legal requirements.
 
 

“If there is a need after that, then the name that Imran has repeated today for the NA opposition leader is that of Mehmood Khan Achakzai,” he said.
Mr Raja explained that Imran gave his “clear directions” about participating in the by-polls after listening to all those allowed to meet him today, including his sisters.
A day earlier, the party’s political committee had voted 12-9 to take part in the by-elections. Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram had even tweeted that candidates would be given Sunni Ittehad Council tickets to avoid the chances of their being declared ‘independents’.
According to insiders, Sheikh Waqqas Akram, Salman Akram Raja, SIC leader Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Arif Alvi, Sajjad Burki, ex-GB CM Khalid Khursheed and some others were against the decision to take part in by-polls, while those in favour included Aliya Hamza, Sanaullah Mastikhel, Aamir Dogar, Farhat Abbas and others.
Talking to Dawn, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser confirmed that in Imran Khan’s opinion, the party should not go into by elections, and that its lawmakers should leave all parliamentary standing committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
“Parliament has already been made a rubber stamp, as the voice of the opposition members has been suppressed by not telecasting their remarks on the floor of the house. Secondly, after the passage of the 26th constitutional amendment, courts have come under immense pressure,” he added.
Mr Qaiser said that the jailed PTI founder had given his opinion, and asked the party’s political committee to review its decision.
“Imran Khan was of the view that the government will not let the PTI candidate to win by-elections… [and] if [we] take part in the elections, it will legitimise the government’s illegal action of de-seating PTI legislators,” he said. He, however, said the PTI will continue its street protests and continue to approach the courts to seek justice.
When contacted, Mustafa Nawaz Khaokhar – who is part of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance alongside the PTI – said there seemed to be two opinions in the party regarding by-elections, one suggesting that it should not legitimise the de-seating of its lawmakers, while the other was opposed to ceding political space.
He agreed that this was causing a visible rift in the PTI’s ranks, which had created disappointment in the party workers.
Commenting on the situation, political analyst Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said it was quite unfortunate that the decision taken by the party’s political committee to contest by-elections was reversed by jailed founder Imran Khan.
The PTI is more of a ‘one-man show’ than any other political party, he noted.
He also noted with irony that the party had decided, once again, to leave all parliamentary committees, especially the PAC. “This is the same act it committed when it left the National Assembly and ceded all provinces, where it was ruling, one by one,” he added.

• Chenab, Ravi hit ‘exceptionally high flood’; Sutlej in ‘very high flood’
• Authorities on red alert; urgent evacuations ordered across the province
• NDMA chief warns nearly half of country’s glaciers melting at accelerated pace
• PM says Pakistan can’t tackle climate crisis alone
LAHORE / ISLAMABAD: The Punjab government has called in the army in six districts to assist civil authorities in rescue and relief operations as the province is facing an unprecedented flood emergency due to a combination of heavy rains and India’s decision to release waters from two dams.
Both Pakistan and India have been ravaged by intense monsoon rains and flooding in recent weeks. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said late on Tuesday that India had opened all the gates of its Thein Dam on the Ravi River.
The announcement came a day after Pakistan received a second warning from India that it intended to release water from the rapidly filling Madhopur Dam, Reuters reported. Both dams are located on the Ravi River, which flows from Indian Punjab into Pakistan.
At the same time, heavy rains in the upper catchment areas of the Chenab River have swollen downstream flows, placing thousands of citizens at risk. The Sutlej River is also reaching alarming levels and recording catastrophic discharges.
As of 2am on Wednesday, the Chenab at Head Marala and the Ravi at Head Jassar were declared to be in an “exceptionally high flood” condition, with outflows exceeding 900,000 and 200,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs), respectively.
Authorities have warned that Head Khanki and Head Qadirabad on the Chenab may also reach exceptionally high flood levels within the next 24 hours due to persistent heavy rainfall in the river’s upper catchments.
Head Khanki on the Chenab and Head Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River were both placed in the “very high flood” category, recording outflows of 426,578 and 245,236 cusecs, respectively.
Officials fear the Ravi River may inflict the most widespread damage, as unlike the Chenab, which is a flowing river, the Ravi is now largely dry for most of the year, particularly the section that flows into Pakistan. The sudden release of water from India has triggered emergency evacuations across several districts, including Lahore and Kasur.
In Kasur, 72 villages and 45,000 residents have been affected. Tens of thousands more have been impacted across the Sutlej basin, including Pakpattan, Vehari, Bahawalnagar and Bahawalpur.
Authorities said that 14,000 citizens and 17,000 livestock have been relocated to safety, with 67 relief camps, 38 medical camps, and 46 veterinary centres established.
The PDMA said it had also mobilised 130 boats, 115 outboard motors, 500 rescue workers, 1,300 life jackets and 1,600 tents.
Rescue 1122 said it had evacuated 28,055 people from Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar and Vehari.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia ordered urgent evacuations from riverbeds and nullahs, particularly Deg Nullah.
Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed also warned of landslides in Murree and Galiyat.
Authorities cautioned that further inflows from India could compound the crisis, testing the disaster response capacity as both the Ravi and Sutlej rivers continue to surge.
Army called in
According to a spokesperson for the Punjab Home Department, the army has been requisitioned in Lahore, Faisalabad, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal and Okara districts to support district administrations in protecting lives and property. The decision was taken after local administrations formally requested immediate deployment of troops.
“The army has been called in to aid civil authorities and ensure the safety of citizens,” the spokesperson said, adding that district administrations, Rescue 1122, Civil Defence and police were already working on the front line in the affected areas.
The Home Department confirmed that a formal request had been sent to the federal interior ministry for the deployment of troops. The number of personnel to be deployed in each district will be finalised in consultation with the local administrations.
More intense monsoon
Meanwhile, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that next year’s monsoon is expected to be 22 per cent more intense, with the potential to cause widespread destruction.
He warned that nearly 45pc of Pakistan’s 7,500 glaciers are melting at an accelerated pace and projected that 65pc of the country’s glaciers could vanish within the next 52 years.
Pakistan has more glaciers than any country outside the polar regions, with over 13,000 identified, primarily in the Karakoram, Hindu Kush and Himalaya ranges of Gilgit-Baltistan. The country’s glaciers are of immense importance as they feed the Indus River system, which serves as the lifeline for the nation’s agriculture, drinking water and energy generation.
“This year’s devastating floods were largely caused by glacial melting,” Lt Gen Malik said, cautioning that unchecked melting could deplete Pakistan’s water reserves and expose the country to severe drought and famine-like conditions.
He noted that the current monsoon, expected to last until Sept 10, has already claimed around 800 lives nationwide.
Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan pointedly asked, “If Rescue 1122 and district administrations are operating on the ground, then what exactly is NDMA’s role?”
The NDMA chairman explained that while Pakistan’s current disaster management relied mostly on ground sensing, the authority had recommended that the government adopt remote sensing technology using climate satellites for more accurate forecasting. “We can now provide early warnings up to six months in advance to provincial authorities,” he said.
 
 

According to NDMA estimates, Pakistan suffers $4 billion in annual flood-related losses. April this year was recorded as the hottest month in the country’s history.
Pakistan hardest-hit
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has warned that Pakistan cannot face the climate crisis alone, urging the international community to provide both technical and financial support to help the country cope with ravaging floods and extreme weather.
“The devastating floods of 2022 and the loss of over 700 lives due to extreme weather events this year alone are stark reminders that Pakistan cannot face this crisis alone,” the prime minister said while addressing the launch of the New Electronic Vehicles Policy 2025-30 on Tuesday.
He stressed that Pakistan remains among the hardest-hit nations despite contributing little to global emissions.

The Trump administration said late last month that it would abolish a tax exemption on small packages entering the US from August 29.
The move has sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in France, Britain, Germany, Italy, India, Australia and Japan, that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.
The United Nations’ Universal Postal Union (UPU) said it had already been advised by 25 member countries that their postal operators “have suspended their outbound postal services to the US, citing uncertainties specifically related to transit services”.
It said the suspensions would remain in place until there was more clarity on how US authorities planned to implement the announced measures.
The UPU did not provide a list of postal services it had heard from.
‘Considerable operational changes’
The organisation, which was established in 1874 and counts 192 member states, warned that the new US measures would “entail considerable operational changes for postal operators around the world”.
From Friday, the UPU said the measures would require postal carriers delivering packages to the US “to collect customs duties from senders in advance”, on behalf of the US Customs and Border Protection agency.
India’s communications ministry said at the weekend that Trump’s executive order issued last month required transport carriers or other “qualified parties” approved by US authorities to collect and remit the tariff duties.
But “several critical processes relating to the designation of ‘qualified parties’ and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined,” it said in a statement.
Under the new US measures, individual customers will still be able to send documents and items worth up to $100 as presents to the country without being taxed.
But anything above that value is expected to be hit with the same tariff rates applied to other imports from the sending country.
That means 15 per cent for countries in the European Union and 50pc for India.
And Germany’s postal service DHL warned last week that even exempted items would be subject to extra checks to prevent the service from being used for commercial goods.
‘Sustainable solutions’
The UPU stressed that it was “taking all possible measures to prepare its member countries for the impacts [the new measures] may have on their postal flows”.
UPU chief Masahiko Metoki had sent a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday to convey member countries’ concern regarding the operational disruptions, it said.
Pointing to the short implementation timeline and voicing particular concern over the impact on the delivery of e-commerce items, the union said it was “working with the relevant US authorities to ensure that information on the operational requirements of the measures is communicated effectively to other member countries”.
In parallel, it said it was working with “relevant postal stakeholders” to help find sustainable solutions, including one initiative aimed at developing a system to facilitate duty collection and remittance across its network.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26203658b5b209b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937384/pakistan-iran-army-chiefs-affirm-readiness-to-eradicating-terrorism-for-secure-borders' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran army chiefs affirm readiness to eradicating terrorism for secure borders</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and his Iranian counterpart, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, affirmed their readiness on Tuesday to eradicate terrorism for securing the borders of both countries.
Pakistan and Iran, earlier this month, agreed that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combatting terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained ties.
A statement issued by the Iranian embassy said Field Marshal Munir and Gen Mousavi, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, held a telephonic conversation today.
“The two sides are ready to eradicate terrorism to secure common borderlines,” it read.
 






A statement carried by Iranian state news agency IRNA said Gen Mousavi mentioned that Iran was prepared to eradicate terrorism and secure its borders with Pakistan, pointing to growing cross-border movements of terrorist groups and calling for joint efforts to eliminate terrorism.
It added that Field Mashal Munir echoed the call for securing common borders, saying the two sides must “jointly turn the Pakistan-Iran border into a border of friendship, brotherhood, and economic development”.
“Field Marshal Munir expressed his gratitude for Mousavi’s sympathy for the Pakistani nation and expressed his condolences for the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan Province.”
Gen Mosavi also expressed his sympathy with the flood-affected victims in Pakistan, saying that “Iran would proudly provide any assistance within its power to dear brothers in Pakistan”.
He further expressed his satisfaction over bilateral ties, saying both countries were interacting and cooperating at various levels, particularly commending Pakistan’s stance and support for Iran during the 12-day war with Israel.
In his visit earlier this month,  Iranian Presi­dent Masoud Pezeshkian had said that development of economic and trade ties would be achieved through peace, stability and tranquillity.
“Given the threats from terrorist groups in border areas, both sides emphasised the need to increase cooperation to ensure border security and safeguard the peace and well-being of citizens in border cities,” the Iranian president had added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had acknowledged that security was paramount for progress in bilateral relations. “There will be zero tolerance for all forms of terrorism. If anyone falls victim to terrorism in Iran, it is the same as someone being affected by terrorism in Pakistan,” he had said.
“For peace and development in our region, and along our hundreds of kilometres-long shared border, we must cooperate against terrorism and take effective steps to eliminate the scourge of terrorism once and for all,” the PM had added.
While the two leaders voiced their commitment to deepening cooperation, specific operational details were reportedly discussed in President Pezeshkian’s meeting with Field Marshal Munir.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26202643291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937383/main-suspect-in-raiwind-murder-video-case-arrested-handed-over-to-ccd-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Main suspect in Raiwind murder video case arrested, handed over to CCD: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>The main suspect in the torture of two brothers by some street vendors in Raiwind has been arrested and handed over to the Crime Control Department (CCD), the lawyer of their father said on Tuesday.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in the Raiwind area a few days back. They were lying in a pool of blood, and the suspected attackers, holding clubs in their hands, were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father on August 22 at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
It said the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit. “Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.
He said he managed to free his sons after reaching the scene, accompanied by other people, adding that the suspects fled while uttering threats. The complainant urged action against the suspects.
The lawyer for the father, lawyer Ahmed Ali Awan, told Dawn.com today: “The main suspect has been handed over to CCD. He was arrested by the police today.”
He added that the second suspect was still in police custody and raids were underway to arrest the other suspects.
In June, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen after a video of the incident went viral on social media, prompting authorities to take notice of it.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26162512ba39807.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937371/9-ttp-terrorists-killed-so-far-in-joint-operation-in-kps-upper-dir-police' target='_blank'><strong>9 TTP terrorists killed so far in joint operation in KP’s Upper Dir: police</strong></a><br><p>Nine terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group have been killed in a joint operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Dir district, the police said on Tuesday.
A statement issued by Upper Dir District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Bilal said the police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted a targeted operation against the TTP in the district.
“Nine terrorists were killed in the operation that has been going on for three days, and the bodies of five were recovered,” he said, adding that 10 police personnel were injured in firing by terrorists and two locals were also killed.
The statement said the operation was carried out in adjoining areas within the limits of the Dir City Police Station based on credible information indicating the presence of elements of banned terrorist organisations.
“Dir Police is always ready to eliminate terrorism and protect the lives and property of the people, and is determined to make every kind of sacrifice. This operation will continue until the complete elimination of Fitna-al-Khawarij,” the DPO said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the police and the CTD for the operations, adding that he and the entire nation were proud of them.
 






Five security personnel and three civilians, including a two-year-old child, embraced martyrdom while several policemen sustained injuries as clashes between security forces and militants continued over the weekend and a day ago in various parts of KP. At least seven terrorists were also killed, officials and sources had said.
In Upper Dir and Lower Dir districts, officials and sources had said five suspected militants were killed and seven policemen injured late on Sunday night during fierce clashes between the security forces and the TTP. They said the exchange of fire in the Dobando area of Upper Dir continued for several hours. Two civilians from Hatnar Dara, caught in the crossfire, lost their lives.
A senior CTD official had told Dawn.com that the bodies of all five terrorists were in police custody. They might have links across the border in Afghanistan, he had said.
In Lower Dir’s Lajbook Dara area, heavy firing broke out between police and militants. Though no casualties were reported from this clash, tension gripped the area as the attackers torched police vehicles, including two pick-up trucks and a car, locals had said. Sharing the footage on social media, the outlawed TTP claimed they had “seized the vehicles and destroyed them”.
In July last year, the government designated the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past years, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.

An earlier version of this story erroneously mentioned Upper Dir as Lower Dir. The error has been rectified and is regretted.</p><small>2025-08-26 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2621544469f37e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937387/steep-us-tariffs-set-to-hit-indian-exports-from-wednesday' target='_blank'><strong>Steep US tariffs set to hit Indian exports from Wednesday</strong></a><br><p>Indian exporters are bracing for a sharp decline in orders from the United States after trade talks collapsed and Washington confirmed that steep new tariffs on the South Asian nation’s goods would take effect from Wednesday, escalating tension between the strategic partners.
An additional 25 per cent duty announced by President Donald Trump, confirmed in a notice by the Homeland Security Department, takes total tariffs to as much as 50pc, among Washington’s highest, in retaliation for New Delhi’s increased buying of Russian oil.
“The government has no hope for any immediate relief or delay in US tariffs,” said a commerce ministry official, who sought anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to the media.
 
 

Exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to alternative markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East, the official added.
However, the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the latest notice.
The new duties will apply from 12:01am EDT on Wednesday (9:31am IST), it showed. Exceptions are shipments in transit, humanitarian aid and items under reciprocal trade programmes.
The Indian rupee fell to a three-week closing low of 87.68 against the dollar, despite recovering some ground after suspected central bank intervention to support it.
The benchmark equity indexes closed down 1pc each, for their worst sessions in three months.
Wednesday’s tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks, during which Indian officials had signalled optimism that tariffs could be capped at 15pc.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgment and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose two-way trade is worth more than $190 billion.
 

The chart shows India’s monthly imports and export to US

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have accused India of indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine by boosting Russian oil purchases.
This month, Bessent said India was profiteering from its sharply increased imports, making up 42pc of total oil purchases, versus less than 1pc before the war, in a shift Washington has called unacceptable.
India has issued no directive yet on oil purchases from Russia. Companies will continue to buy oil on the basis of economics, three refining sources said.
Exporters seek aid
Exporter groups estimate hikes could affect nearly 55pc of India’s merchandise exports worth $87bn to the US, while benefiting competitors such as Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.
 

The table shows the sectors that get affected mainly from US tariffs on India and the total potential impact on trade numbers

“The US customers have already stopped new orders,” said Pankaj Chadha, president of the Engineering Exports Promotion Council. “With these additional tariffs, the exports could come down by 20-30pc from September onward.”
The government has promised financial aid such as greater subsidies on bank loans and support for diversification in the event of financial losses, Chadha added.
“However, exporters see limited scope for diversifying to other markets or selling in the domestic market.”
The commerce ministry official said the government had identified nearly 50 countries to which India could boost exports, particularly items such as textiles, food processed items, leather goods and marine products.
India’s diamond industry exports have already hit a two-decade low on weak Chinese demand, and the higher tariffs now threaten to cut it off from its largest market, taking nearly a third of $28.5bn annual shipments of gems and jewellery.

Broader economic impact
Private sector analysts warn that a sustained 50pc tariff could weigh on India’s economy and corporate profits, prompting the steepest earnings downgrades in Asia, even if proposed domestic tax cuts partly cushion the blow.
Last week, Capital Economics said full US tariffs would chip 0.8 percentage points from India’s economic growth both this year and the next.
Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar also said trade talks continued and Washington’s concern over Russian oil purchases was not equally applied to other major buyers such as China and the European Union.
The US could be a major energy supplier to India, an official of its New Delhi embassy said on Tuesday.
The US is committed to collaborating with India on exports of high-quality products and services to help achieve energy security and economic growth, the official added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to compromise the interests of Indian farmers, even if it entails a heavy price. Modi is also moving to burnish ties with China, planning his first visit there in seven years at the end of the month.</p><small>2025-08-26 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261159341c8649c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937333/engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-detained-under-mpo-also-booked-under-blasphemy-charges' target='_blank'><strong>Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza detained under MPO, also booked under blasphemy charges</strong></a><br><p>Jhelum police said on Tuesday that they have detained cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza for 30 days under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance for alleged controversial remarks and later booked him under blasphemy charges.
Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel.
Earlier today, Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meesam Abbas and District Police Officer (DPO) Ahmed Mohiyuddin confirmed Mirza’s arrest under MPO to Dawn.com.
Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
A religious group had yesterday filed an application, seen by Dawn.com, requesting legal action against Mirza for alleged controversial remarks made during an interview that “went viral on social media”.
Separately, a first information report (FIR) was registered at the Jhelum city police station on August 26 under Section 295 C (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (2016).
Mirza “has severely hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims by making blasphemous remarks”, the FIR read. The complainant said that legal action must be taken against Mirza under Section 295C of the blasphemy laws.
Mirza was also among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram last year to prevent any potential sectarian violence.
The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him.
The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-08-26 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261744017ee724a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937376/aleema-rejects-reports-of-tense-exchange-with-ptis-salman-akram-raja' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema rejects reports of tense exchange with PTI’s Salman Akram Raja</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, on Tuesday rejected rumours of a tense exchange with PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja that allegedly led to his decision to resign.
There seems to be a tug of war within the PTI over whether to participate in the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assembly seats — vacated after the recent disqualifications of a number of key lawmakers. Insiders had told Dawn the party’s political committee — in its meeting on Monday — had a change of heart after a majority of members voted against the decision to boycott by-polls. This contravenes the opinion reportedly expressed by Imran, transmitted by Aleema on a couple of occasions, to steer clear of by-elections so that the party isn’t seen as legitimising the process.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram had shared the party’s decision on social media and triggered a wave of criticism from across the globe. When approached, Akram confirmed that he, Raja and a few others were against the decision, but they had to go with the majority. In a dramatic turn of events, however, Raja announced his intention to step down from the post of secretary general. Although he did not specify what prompted him to take this decision, the timing of his X post indicated that the “incident” he referred to was — in all probability — the political committee’s decision to contest by-polls.
Questioned about reports of a tense exchange with him being the cause of his decision, Aleema said while talking to the media outside Adiala Jail today: “I had no bitter exchange of words with him. He is our lawyer and like a family [member] with all of us, but I think it is more so [a matter] of his own [decision] and that of the political committee. It is an issue [of participation] in the by-election and you should ask him (Raja).”
 


Pushed on the reports of a disagreement in the party over whether to contest the by-elections or not, Imran’s other sister, Uzma Khanum, interjected and said: “The party will tell what conflict it was. As per our last family meeting, Khan sahib very firmly, repeatedly and clearly said not to contest the elections but to boycott them because there will be no benefit, it will harm the party and the [movement] for actual freedom and the illegitimate disqualifications would be legitimised.”
Addressing the media later, Aleema said Imran had directed PTI lawmakers to resign from parliamentary committees and to inform him about the political committee’s decision regarding the by-elections tomorrow morning after holding a meeting later today on the issue based on his instructions.
Meanwhile, Raja said while talking to the media that Imran had not accepted his decision to resign.
He added that the political committee would have a meeting again today to discuss the issue of participating in the by-elections based on Imran’s “clear instructions”.
Raja further said that the PTI had a clear stance that Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were still the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, adding that they were still contesting their cases and would fulfil all legal requirements.
“If there is a need after that, then the name that Imran has repeated today for the NA opposition leader is that of Mehmood Khan Achakzai.”
 


Raja explained that Imran gave his “clear directions” about participating in the by-polls after listening to all those allowed to meet him today, including his sisters.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar said he had not read Raja’s statement on resigning as secretary general, nor had he received any resignation in writing.
“Imran will decide whether he decides to continue or not. It is unfortunate. I’ve always said that something always comes up from inside the party and people make it an issue. Imran said that no party leader would mention their resignation in public.”
 


The PTI has already obtained stay orders against the de-seating of key opposition leaders. It has also, albeit reluctantly, nominated replacements while the party pursues legal options.
But faced with threats on multiple fronts — including the possible loss of maj­o­rity in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly due to future disqualifications, a push to reclaim political space in Punjab, and a showdown between two opposing camps within the party — it seems as if the PTI may throw its hat in the ring, despite all misgivings about the by-elections. According to sources privy to proceedings, Monday’s meeting of the political committee had voted 12-9 in favour of fielding candidates for the upcoming by-elections.
Additionally, Akram had announced that all candidates would be issued tickets under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council, which appears to be an insurance policy of sorts, to offset chances of them being declared ‘independent candidates’, since the dispute around PTI’s intra-party elections and the matter of its electoral symbol are still in limbo.</p><small>2025-08-26 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26165117bcfea13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937353/many-areas-in-gbs-ghizer-cut-off-for-5th-day-as-gilgit-shandur-road-remains-blocked' target='_blank'><strong>Many areas in GB’s Ghizer cut off for 5th day as Gilgit-Shandur road remains blocked</strong></a><br><p>Several areas in Gilgit Baltistan’s (GB) Ghizer district have been cut off for five days, as preparations are underway to clear the Gilgit-Shandur road, authorities said on Tuesday.
Since late July, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country, especially in its northern regions like GB, by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to locals, majority of the areas in the Ghizer district, including Gupis, Phander, and Yasin tehsils, remained stranded for five days as five kilometres of the region’s main road were submerged by an artificial lake formed at Raushan  village in Ghizer.
Local resident Meraj Ali Shah told Dawn.com that 300 houses had been dama­ged by the glacial flood, with houses submerged due to artificial lake in Hakis, Thangi, and Raushan villages as they remained without basic necessities.
He added that hundreds of people had been displaced when a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) swept everything in Tildas village.
“They are living without electricity, drinking water, proper accommodation, medical facilities, [and] other basic needs,” he said.
Locals also complained of a lack of support from the government, adding that they had been dependent on relief items by welfare organisations.
Two patients in a critical condition were taken from Gupis to Gilgit on Monday through a helicopter belonging to the Aga Khan Development Network, as per the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat.
According to the locals, people affected in previous floods in Ghizer’s Khalti, Daen, Chatorkhand, Yasin, and other areas did not have access to roads, clean drinking water, and other necessities.
Since three weeks, the Karakoram Highway at Hassanabad Hunza could not be opened as it was blocked after a Glof from Shishper glacier submerged a portion of the thoroughfare, posing severe difficulties to Hassanabad’s residents. The Glof also damaged dozens of homes, farmland, and the area’s government and private infrastructure.
Residents in the Hisper valley of Nagar district have been disconnected for a month as the only accessible road was blocked owing to river erosion and landslides. Gilgil’s Haramosh and Bagrot valleys have also remained disconnected.

Locals said the water supply systems to areas populated by thousands of people, including Gilgit’s Danyor, Sultanabad, and Mohammadabad have remained suspended, adding that they had to purchase water tankers daily, which the poor could not afford.
“For the last month, people in the populated areas have faced a severe water shortage,” said a local resident Shahzad Hussain.
Furthermore, according to the locals, the crops and trees have dried up due to the unavailability of irrigation water supply systems.
A local, Muhammad Alam, told Dawn.com that flood-affected people in Mashabrum sub-division of Ghanche district in Baltistan are currently living in difficult circumstances. “Above sixty households in Ghanche district, including Haldi and Balayagan villages displaced in flood have taken shelter in tents under the open sky and are waiting for the government’s assistance.”
Unfortunately, locals said, no concrete steps have been taken by the government so far for their rehabilitation and redressal of their problems, due to which the victims have been plunged into severe difficulties and deprivation. Without basic facilities, they say they are forced to spend their days and nights in destitution and helplessness.

Furthermore, those traumatised by high intensity floods also complain of mental health issues, demanding mental rehabilitation.
According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the GB government, the affected people in the recent floods, especially children, women and the elderly, are suffering from mental and psychological problems.
In view of these challenges, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Arif Tahseen, the additional secretary of the GB department of social welfare. Senior officials of various government and private institutions participated to formulate a coordinated strategy for the mental and psychological rehabilitation of the victims.
In the meeting, it was agreed to work together to restore mental health among the people of the affected areas in collaboration with the GB Health Department, Aga Khan Health Service and Rupani Foundation.
On this occasion, Additional Secretary Tahseen said the recent floods have not only caused physical and economic devastation but have also left deep emotional and psychological impacts on individuals and families, especially children, women and the elderly in affected areas.
“To address these impacts, it is imperative that a joint and coordinated strategy involving all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors be launched immediately to include this important aspect in the overall disaster response process,” he said.
The meeting discussed the improvement of mental health facilities, provision of psychologists, community outreach programs and the launch of awareness campaigns, and suggested practical measures.
All the institutions expressed their determination to jointly fulfill this important national responsibility and agreed that a comprehensive and long-term plan would ensure the complete rehabilitation of the victims.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain said in a statement that due to the recent rains and flood situation, the National Highway Authority machinery has been mobilised to clear the Gilgit-Shandur road in the Raushan area. He added that formal approval has also been obtained for the construction of an alternative route in a short period of time and work on it is progressing rapidly.
“Under the project, a bypass will be constructed and the road will be connected to the main highway through a bridge,” he said, adding that this will ease movement and reduce difficulties faced by people.
“The government is utilising all available resources for the restoration of flood-affected areas, and for this purpose, work is being done in close coordination with the relevant institutions,” Hussain said. “We stand with the affected people and are trying to resolve their problems immediately.”

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to arrive in GB on Wednesday to review the disastrous situation.
A statement by the GB government said a high-level meeting was held to review arrangements for the PM’s expected visit. The meeting, chaired by GB Chief Secretary Abrara Ahmed Mirza, was briefed on the damage caused by the flood situation and the steps taken for the rehabilitation of the affected areas. The meeting’s participants also discussed the current status of the early warning system.
It was decided that all the relevant institutions will complete their preparations before the PM’s visit. Mirza directed the rehabilitation work in the affected areas to be accelerated, adding that all institutions should coordinate in this regard.</p><small>2025-08-26 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26180145718daca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937378/new-zealand-fast-bowler-will-orourke-out-for-three-months-as-injuries-mount' target='_blank'><strong>New Zealand fast bowler Will O’Rourke out for three months as injuries mount</strong></a><br><p>Fast bowler Will O’Rourke will be out for at least three months with a stress fracture in his lower back, New Zealand Cricket said onb Tuesday, adding to a mounting injury list.
The 24-year-old was injured while bowling in the first Test against Zimbabwe this month and returned home, where scans revealed the extent of the damage.
“We’re really feeling for Will at the moment and wishing him speedy recovery,” New Zealand head coach Rob Walter said.
 






O’Rourke will miss the home white-ball series against Australia in early
October, England later that month and the West Indies in November.
All-rounder Glenn Phillips was also ruled out of the Australia series as he recovers from the groin injury that saw him miss the Zimbabwe tour.
And opening batsman Finn Allen will be out for a minimum of three months after having surgery on his right foot.
“It’s disappointing to lose the services of Glenn and Finn, who have played important batting roles in our T20 set-up in recent times,” said Walter.
White-ball captain Mitchell Santner returned home from England’s The
Hundred tournament at the weekend after feeling groin pain.
Walter said the spinning all-rounder will now have abdominal surgery with an expected recovery time of a month, but would be given every chance to prove his fitness before the three T20s against Australia.
“Mitch is a world-class player and a crucial part of our T20 side from a skills and leadership point of view,” said Walter.
“With that in mind we expect to name him in our squad. From there we can assess how his rest and rehabilitation progresses following surgery, before making a call on the eve of the series.”

Vantara is a marquee project of the Reliance Foundation and the Ambani family. Located in western Gujarat state and led by the billionaire’s son, Anant Ambani, it has rescued and treated thousands of animals, and built the largest elephant hospital.
It was also one of the venues for Anant’s pre-wedding celebrations last year, with the global celebrities who attended advised to don “jungle fever” outfits when visiting Vantara.
The Supreme Court late on Monday ordered an inquiry as it ruled on public interest litigations that referred to complaints by non-profit and wildlife groups alleging mistreatment of animals at Vantara and questioning how the animals ended up at the rescue centre. They also alleged the Central Zoo Authority, the regulatory agency, failed in its duties.
In a written order, the court said although there was no evidence to support the allegations, an independent investigation was needed because the petitions alleged authorities were unwilling to discharge their duties.
“We consider it appropriate in the ends of justice to call for an independent factual appraisal,” the court said in its order.
In a statement, a Vantara spokesperson told Reuters it remains committed to transparency and legal compliance. Vantara added it would cooperate fully with the investigation panel, and its “mission and focus continues to be the rescue, rehabilitation and care of animals”.
The Central Zoo Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The panel will be led by a former Supreme Court judge and will submit a report on the acquisition of animals, particularly elephants, look at complaints regarding the creation of a vanity or private collection of wildlife, as well as check for compliance with India’s Wild Life Protection Act.
The panel needs to submit a report to the court by September 12.
Located in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Vantara is home to more than 150,000 animals across more than 2,000 species. It also has a 998-acre elephant welfare trust, which it says is the world’s largest care facility for rescued elephants.
This month, local communities in neighbouring Maharashtra state staged protests against the relocation of a 36-year-old elephant that was unwell to Vantara, arguing the animal had been part of their spiritual life, including processions, for decades.
Reliance has acknowledged the “deep religious and cultural significance” of the elephant, but says it was following a court’s directive with the relocation.
In March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured Vantara and said it “provides a safe haven for animals while promoting ecological sustainability and wildlife welfare”.
Anant is also an executive director of oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries, and is involved in its technology and telecoms business, Jio Platforms.
In media tours last year, Anant showed the large kitchens at the facility for elephants, where dishes such as juice and sweets were prepared for the animals, and popcorn was served as a “treat”.</p><small>2025-08-26 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26164832309c770.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937373/fact-check-viral-video-showing-imran-khan-with-a-beard-is-doctored' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video showing Imran Khan with a beard is doctored</strong></a><br><p>Posts from PTI supporters on multiple social media platforms since Sunday were sharing a video showing PTI founder Imran Khan with a beard. However, the video is doctored.
Imran has remained incarcerated for over two years since August 2023 due to ongoing legal proceedings, despite several acquittals and suspended sentences. In January 2025, he was handed a 14-year prison sentence in a corruption case linked to the Al-Qadir University Project Trust.
On Aug 23 this year, a TikTok user — who appeared to be a PTI supporter based on his past posts — shared a video showing Imran with a beard.
The user did not provide any details about when or where the video was recorded.
The video amassed over 21.3 million views and more than 2.3m likes.
The same video was also shared by other PTI supporters on TikTok, here and here, where it gained 4.1m and 2.2m views, respectively.
Other users also circulated the clip on various other platforms, which can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here.
In addition, an image of Imran with a beard was also widely shared online, with examples available here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in Imran.
A reverse image search led to an X post shared by PTI’s official account on May 23, 2023.
 






The caption of the post read: “PTI Chairman Imran Khan earlier today in ATC (anti-terrorism court), Islamabad”.
In the image, Imran appears clean-shaven, wearing a white shalwar kameez with a dark blue waistcoat, identical to his attire in the viral video. The policemen visible in the image — one bearded and one clean-shaven — also match those seen in the viral video.
 


A keyword search for news reports around that date led to a Geo News report from the same day, titled “NAB grills Imran Khan in £190m settlement case”.
According to the report, Imran was granted bail in eight cases, while his wife Bushra Bibi secured bail in the £190m settlement case. Later that day, NAB questioned him regarding the Al-Qadir Trust and the settlement with a property tycoon, seeking records of donations and trust deeds. Imran had denied wrongdoing, maintaining that the funds remained with the Supreme Court and no personal benefit was taken.
The same image from PTI’s official post also appeared in the news report, further confirming its authenticity.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows Imran Khan with a beard is false. The video clip is doctored.

The foreign ministers discussed the “grave situation in Palestine”, Dar said on X.
The trio stressed the “urgent need for humanitarian access, a ceasefire, and lasting peace, while underscoring the importance of unity within the Muslim Ummah in these challenging times”.
 






At the OIC session yesterday, Dar slammed Israel’s “annexationist and rogue mindset” and condemned Tel Aviv’s plan to take control of Gaza City as threatening regional peace.
He also presented seven “urgent and essential steps” for the international community and Muslim nations to halt Israel’s war on Gaza — already termed a genocide by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch — and secure enduring peace in Palestine.
 
 

Pakistan also fully endorsed and joined the statement issued by 31 Arab-Islamic countries and the secretaries general of the OIC, the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments about ‘Greater Israel’.
Algeria’s Ambassador to the UN Amar Bendjama has called for sanctions on Israel in response to its Gaza City plan.
Pakistan has brotherly ties with Egypt and Algeria, bonded in shared religion and culture.
In April, Islamabad and Cairo agreed to enhance bilateral collaboration in the health sector, with a specific focus on eliminating Hepatitis C. It was also reported earlier this year that Egypt’s renowned Al-Azhar University had plans to set up its campus in Pakistan.
Meeting with Turkiye’s foreign minister
The deputy PM also met with Turkiye’s FM Hakan Fidan today, expressing his “deep appreciation” to Turkiye for its leadership role in the capacity of chairing the OIC ministerial session.
“We affirmed firm solidarity with Palestine, noting the worsening humanitarian crisis and famine, and the urgent need for humanitarian aid and relief,” Dar noted.
The two ministers also “reaffirmed the brotherly Pakistan-Türkiye relations, and looked forward to further strengthening our multifaceted cooperation”.
 






Dar had also met with the top diplomats of several other friendly countries yesterday on the sidelines of the OIC meeting. They included Saudi Arabia’s FM Faisal Bin Farhan, Iran’s FM Abbas Araghchi, Malaysia’s Mohamad Haji Hasan, and Bangladeshi Adviser for Foreign Affairs Md Touhid Hossain.</p><small>2025-08-26 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26131946a897ad7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937347/powerful-optics-chinas-xi-to-welcome-putin-modi-in-grand-show-of-solidarity' target='_blank'><strong>‘Powerful optics’: China’s Xi to welcome Putin, Modi in grand show of solidarity</strong></a><br><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping will gather more than 20 world leaders at a regional security forum in China next week in a powerful show of Global South solidarity in the age of Donald Trump while also helping sanctions-hit Russia pull off another diplomatic coup.
Aside from Russian President Vladimir Putin, leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, to be held in the northern port city of Tianjin from August 31 to September 1.
The summit will feature Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years as the two neighbours work on further defusing tensions roiled by deadly border clashes in 2020.
Modi last shared the same stage with Xi and Putin at last year’s Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, even as Western leaders turned their backs on the Russian leader amid the war in Ukraine.
Russian embassy officials in New Delhi last week said Moscow hopes trilateral talks with China and India will take place soon.
“Xi will want to use the summit as an opportunity to showcase what a post-American-led international order begins to look like and that all White House efforts since January to counter China, Iran, Russia, and now India have not had the intended effect,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, a research agency.
“Just look at how much Brics has rattled [US President] Donald Trump, which is precisely what these groups are designed to do.”
This year’s summit will be the largest since the SCO was founded in 2001, a Chinese foreign ministry official said last week, calling the bloc an “important force in building a new type of international relations”.
The security-focused bloc, which began as a group of six Eurasian nations, has expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer countries in recent years. Its remit has also enlarged from security and counter-terrorism to economic and military cooperation.
‘Fuzzy’ implementation
Analysts say expansion is high on the agenda for many countries attending, but agree the bloc has not delivered substantial cooperation outcomes over the years and that China values the optics of Global South solidarity against the United States at a time of erratic policymaking and geopolitical flux.
“What is the precise vision that the SCO represents, and its practical implementation are rather fuzzy. It is a platform that has increasing convening power, which helps in narrative projection,” said Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Research Programme at the Takshashila Institution thinktank in Bangalore.
“But the SCO’s effectiveness in addressing substantial security issues remains very limited.”
Frictions remain between core members India and Pakistan.
The June SCO defence ministers’ meeting was unable to adopt a joint statement after India raised objections, saying it omitted reference to the deadly April 22 attack on Hindu tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which led to the worst fighting in decades between India and Pakistan.
 
 

New Delhi also refused to join the SCO’s condemnation of Israeli attacks on Iran, a member state, earlier in June.
But the recent détente between India and China after five years of heightened border frictions, as well as renewed tariff pressure on New Delhi from the Trump administration, are driving expectations for a positive meeting between Xi and Modi on the sidelines of the summit.
“It’s likely [New Delhi] will swallow their pride and put this year’s SCO problems behind them in a bid to maintain momentum in the détente with China, which is a key Modi priority right now,” said Olander.
Analysts expect both sides to announce further incremental border measures such as troop withdrawals, the easing of trade and visa restrictions, cooperation in new fields including climate, and broader government and people-to-people engagement.
Despite the lack of substantive policy announcements expected at the summit, experts warn that the bloc’s appeal to Global South countries should not be underestimated.
“This summit is about optics, really powerful optics,” added Olander.
Modi is expected to depart from China after the summit, while Putin will stay on for a World War Two military parade in Beijing later in the week for an unusually long spell outside of Russia.</p><small>2025-08-26 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261357141cec107.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937350/indian-lenders-told-to-step-up-checks-on-funds-flowing-indirectly-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indian lenders told to step up checks on funds flowing indirectly from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the country’s lenders to increase scrutiny over funds flowing indirectly from Pakistan, according to a letter seen by Reuters that cited a “high risk” of such money being used to buy arms.
Direct flows of funds from Pakistan to India are largely prohibited, with every transaction requiring the central bank’s approval.
The directive, dated August 6, follows investigations by Indian agencies after the two neighbouring countries engaged in a fierce military conflict in May, triggered by India blaming Pakistan, without evidence, for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir.
The RBI named Pakistan a “high risk” jurisdiction from an arms financing perspective and cited Indian investigations into arms financing, but did not go into detail about their findings.
According to a government source with direct knowledge of the matter, Indian investigative authorities found that some Pakistani nationals had sent funds to India via other countries.
India’s banking channels are at a “high risk of being used for arms funding by Pakistan”, alleged the source, who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.
The central bank has general guidelines in place for banks to prevent money laundering and the financing of arms and terrorism, but a directive drawing attention to Pakistan is rare.
The Reserve Bank of India did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.
Zafar Masud, president of the Pakistan Banks Association, said in a statement that Pakistan’s “anti-money laundering laws and combating the financing of terrorism is very strict and robust.”
The RBI letter to banks and non-bank lenders also separately cited instances where Pakistan has been accused of violating global sanctions and rules.
It noted that a June 2025 report by the global anti-money laundering watchdog Financial Action Task Force had accused a Pakistan state-owned entity, the National Development Complex, of “evading sanctions by importing items for missile development without declaring them.”
Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The letter also listed North Korea as a “high risk” jurisdiction, citing sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on the country in the past.</p><small>2025-08-26 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26135224193ba04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937349/pakistan-buys-initial-30000-tonnes-sugar-in-tender-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan buys initial 30,000 tonnes sugar in tender, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has purchased an initial 30,000 tonnes of white sugar in an international tender seeking around 200,000 tonnes, European traders said on Tuesday.
On July 8, the government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
The validity of other price offers submitted in the tender, which closed last week, has been extended until tomorrow, so more purchases are seen as possible, traders said.
The initial 30,000-tonne purchase was believed to have been made from Al Khaleej Sugar for medium-grade sugar at an estimated $582.50 a ton, cost and freight (c&f) included, they said.
 
 

Reports reflect assessments from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later. The tender sought sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.
The TCP is believed to have purchased about 55,000 tonnes of white sugar in a previous international tender seeking up to 100,000 tonnes. The recent purchase will bring the total amount of sugar bought to 85,000 tonnes.
The government has vowed strict monitoring of sugar stocks and also placed some unidentified mill owners on the Exit Control List in a bid to stabilise rates.
A cartelisation case involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p><small>2025-08-26 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26123139ed8adad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937335/fia-arrests-2-traffickers-in-gwadar-for-sending-pakistanis-to-iran-via-illegal-routes' target='_blank'><strong>FIA arrests 2 traffickers in Gwadar for sending Pakistanis to Iran via illegal routes</strong></a><br><p>Two human traffickers were arrested in Balochistan’s Gwadar for attempting to send citizens to Iran via illegal sea routes, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said in a statement on Tuesday.
Human smuggling from Pakistan to Iran has been a persistent issue, with many migrants attempting to cross through perilous land and sea routes in search of better economic opportunities or to reach onward destinations in the Middle East and Europe, according to a report by the National Initiative against Organised Crime.  Gwadar and other parts of Balochistan are frequently used as key transit points, where traffickers exploit vulnerable citizens by charging hefty sums for the dangerous journeys.
Per the FIA’s statement, “major operations” were carried out by the agency’s Composite Circle Gwadar, through which the suspects were arrested from different areas of the district.
“The arrested suspects are involved in sending citizens from Pakistan to Iran through illegal sea routes,” it said. “The suspect extorted Rs10,000 each from the victims.”
The suspects were arrested after being identified by the victims, the statement further said, adding that an investigation into the matter had been initiated.
Last week, FIA Balochistan arrested five traffickers in Taftan and Loralai for allegedly facilitating illegal travel abroad using fake documents and charging millions of rupees from the victims.
The group was sending people to Iran and Turkiye through illegal routes and fake documents, according to the FIA spokesperson.
“Three of the suspects were listed as most wanted by Pakistani embassies in Iran and Turkiye,” the spokesperson said, adding that they had already sent large numbers of people abroad illegally.</p><small>2025-08-26 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261035411672222.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937304/punjab-govt-opposition-spar-over-cm-maryams-japan-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt, opposition spar over CM Maryam’s Japan tour</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government and opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have been wrangling over “exorbitant spendings, chartered jet and private persons in the delegation” of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s Japan’s five-day tour.
Ms Nawaz concluded her Japan visit on Monday and reached Thailand. Questions are also being raised on social media regarding CM Maryam’s ‘official visit’ to Japan, in which ‘private individuals’, including her family members, as also a part.
It is being argued that even if such participants claim to bear their own expenses, the practice undermines the sanctity of official delegations and blurs the line between state affairs and personal interests.
Questions are also being raised on social media platforms over the inclusion of private persons as part of her visit, causing a huge sum of money to the exchequer.

Entourage comes under scrutiny; PTI’s Waqas claims bank borrowing spent on excursion; Azma says PTI will consume in its own frustration

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, who is also part of the CM delegation to Japan, rejected a list of the ‘participants’ of the CM’s visit circulating on social media, calling it “a pack of lies“.
 






She said Pakistan and Japan were entering a new era of diplomatic cooperation, but certain anti-national elements were trying to malign this relationship with disinformation and propaganda.
“For the first time, a woman CM made a ‘historic’ visit to Japan and the malicious campaign against this milestone is nothing short of a shameful act of hostility against the country’s progress. The individuals (the Sharif family members and its friends) mentioned in the
social media list were not part of the ‘official government delegation’. Only officially nominated delegates had their expenses covered by the government, while all others covered their own costs privately,” she said.
Ms Bokhari said those pained by Pakistan’s cooperation with Japan in urban development, technology, and youth skills enhancement must accept that the nation is moving forward. “The opposition PTI has nothing to offer except falsehood and propaganda. Just like in the past, it will continue to consume in its own frustration,” she added.
 






On the other hand, the PTI strongly criticised Maryam Nawaz for her foreign trip to Japan, demanding full disclosure of public funds ‘squandered’ on the tour.
“What did Punjab really gain from Maryam Nawaz’s Japan visit? Questions persist over public spending, use of a chartered jet, and the actual outcomes beyond photo optics and promises,” it asked.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram termed Maryam’s trip a “wasteful” excursion at the expense of the poor nation’s hard-earned money, undertaken when the country was navigating its ‘worst-ever’ economic crisis.
 






He pointed out that as per the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Punjab government borrowed a staggering Rs405 billion in just first 38 days of the current fiscal year 2025-26 (July 1 to August 8), which were not utilised for any public welfare rather wasted on foreign trips, lavish advertisements, and political image-building.
“The people of Pakistan demand a full and transparent disclosure of how much has been spent on these useless advertisements and foreign excursions. The ‘fake’ CM Punjab must clarify whether her Japan trip, along with dozens of cronies, family members and sycophants, was paid from her personal pocket or from the funds of the Punjab and federal governments,” he said.
Analyst Imtiaz Gul said on X: “Massive advertisement campaign on @MaryamNSharif Japan visit: Isn’t it an affront to the poor of Punjab? Has she conquered Japan? Do donors ask about the rationale of the precious funds being spent on personal projection?”
 






Earlier, a local TV channel, citing official documents, had claimed that the Punjab government allocated Rs160 million for the CM ’s Japan trip which included expenses for luxury hotel stays in Japan and Bangkok, luxury cars for transport and diplomatic gifts.
Political observers are of the view that foreign visits by elected leaders should strictly focus on advancing provincial and national interests through professional representation, rather than projecting political families. They warn that such practices not only set a poor precedent but also raise concerns of nepotism, misuse of protocol, and dilution of credibility in the eyes of international counterparts.
