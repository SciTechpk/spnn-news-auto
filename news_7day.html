According to a Dawn.com correspondent, the reporters voiced their concerns about not being given a technical briefing yesterday by the Federal Board of Revenue (FRB) on the Finance Bill 2025, which details the legislation for the proposed measures under the budget.
Subsequently, they walked out of the conference room in protest.
However, flanked by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, Aurangzeb soon continued with his press conference in the presence of some journalists.
 


He reiterated the significance of the tariff reforms under the National Tariff Policy. “People ask us that the revenue will decline but if we have to take this country forward towards an export-led discussion […] I want to go into the details of the steps we have taken.”
The minister noted that additional customs duties were removed in four “lines”, while they were reduced in 2,700 tariff lines, which were “directly linked with those raw materials on the basis of which exporters will benefit”. He stressed these steps were just for the upcoming year and more measures will be taken eventually.
Echoing his remarks from yesterday, Aurangzeb stressed that the government tried to give relief “as much as possible” while considering the fiscal space. He also pointed out the 0.5pc reduction in super tax for the corporate sector.
Detailing the measures proposed for property buyers and sellers, he said: “Selling side still gets capital gains but the buying side should get some relief.”
The minister also termed the mortgage financing “as important as the fiscal side of things and what we have to do on the taxation side”.
Speaking on the agricultural sector, Aurangzeb said an additional tax on fertilisers and pesticides was a “benchmark” but it was negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that it was a “critical input into agriculture” and should not be imposed.
“Again, this is a step in the right direction”, the minister asserted.
Aurangzeb acknowledged that additional taxes and measures were also talked about last year. “We had to impose those as when we were speaking to international institutions, they were not agreeing with our stance that there can be enforcement in this country,” he said.
 
 

Expressing the aim to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.9pc by the next year, the minister said additional taxes were around Rs312m of the total 2.2tr target. “We have two ways — either we ensure enforcement or we introduce additional measures of up to Rs 400 to 500bn. This is why we will go to the parliament to help us out with the enabling amendments and legislation.”
The minister added: “We have laws, legislation and taxes but we were not able to enforce it, so in this fiscal year, we have worked on enforcement, which has exceeded Rs400 billion.”
Responding to a query, Aurangzeb underscored the need to reduce the role of the middleman in the agricultural sector and increase the financing for small farmers. “It is very critical […] that we have a policy in the devolved subjects.”
He noted that the relevant measures were underway, hence the growth target was decided considering that.
On salaries and pensions, the finance czar stressed the need for a benchmark.
“If we are saying the inflation is declining, similarly, the salary or pension has to benchmarked with inflation. This is not just the rule in Pakistan but across the world.”
Acknowledging that past concerns about the government expenditures not reducing were the “right pushback”, the minister highlighted that the figure had gone up by just 1.9pc in the outgoing fiscal year.
“We have reduced subsidies and debt-servicing costs, and increased some expenditures because this country needed those. But this is our response to those people who are paying taxes in this country that ‘why are you not bringing the government expenditures under control’,” Aurangzeb asserted.
He pointed out that whatever the government was giving was doing so “by taking loans as we start with a deficit”, adding that if the expenditures were not reduced, then the loans would keep surging.
‘NA, Senate heads’ salaries hiked after 9 years’
Asked about a recent increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker, the minister claimed that the last time their salaries were “adjusted” was in 2016. He emphasised that the hike was “all of a sudden” as it had not been done for the past nine years.
Responding to a question on how the federal government could delink population from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Auranzgeb asserted, “Everything will be done in consultation with provinces.”
He added, “Nothing will be done [without them], including the national fiscal pact which we signed with the provinces.”
Aurangzeb noted that the government had taken two “very concrete measures” in a bid to bring the cash-based economy of Rs9.4tr or more towards documentation.
The minister also acknowledged a lack of implementation in suggested measures: “Over the past 10 years, I’ve been looking at the state of economy, first in the private sector and now in this job. I have never seen anything going up go downwards.
“I could be wrong; maybe it might have happened in some year,” he added.
“It starts with acknowledgement, the undue burden that we had, as the prime minister has said before as well,” Aurangzeb said.
The budget
Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb yesterday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors, in an effort to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.
At the same time, however, the government announced it was imposing a ‘carbon levy’ of Rs2.5 per litre on petrol, diesel and furnace oil in the upcoming fiscal year, to be doubled the following year.
It also introduced a 5 per cent tax on large pensions, an 18pc tax on imported solar panels, and an increase in the debt servicing surcharge on electricity to finance not only interest payments, but also principal debt. Additionally, it announced the gradual elimination of tax exemptions for the tribal areas beginning this year.

The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 2,285.13, or 1.87 per cent, to stand at 124,309.57 from the last close of 122,024.44 at 11:49am.
While there had been uncer­tainties surrounding the taxation measures ahead of the budget announcement, the PSX remained bullish yesterday and gained nearly 400 points to cross the 122,000 point-mark, just before the budget was presented in the National Assembly.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com that the budget announcement was “well-received by investors, primarily due to the absence of any new taxes or levies on the stock market, alleviating initial concerns”.
He noted: “Overall, the budget is viewed as neutral to positive for the listed sectors, with tax collection and fiscal deficit/primary surplus targets seen as non-events, as we believe they remain within the authority’s ability to meet for FY26.”
Despite a record tax shortfall of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the outgoing fiscal year, the government has set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr.
 
 

Expanding upon the factors related to the stock market, Ashraf said the increase in tax rate for profit on debt and “proportionate imposition of tax on mutual funds contingent to dividends received from debt and equities at rate of 25pc and 15pc mutual funds, respectively, is expected to provide further traction for the equity market”.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb yesterday announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings.
However, some businessmen have labelled the proposed plan a “camouflage budget” due to its unrealistic targets and the lack of meaningful relief for both the business community and the general public.
 
 

Pakistan Business Council Chief Executive Ehsan Malik, while noting “small mercies”, termed the real estate sector the “real winner” from the budget.
Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Secretary General M. Abdul Aleem expressed disappointment over the government’s limited progress in addressing inequitable corporate tax rates.

Sindh government has reaffirmed its commitment towards addressing Karachi’s urban mobility and transport issues. With a population of 20 million, the metropolis faces rampant infrastructure issues ranging from transport, water and sanitation.
The decision was made in a meeting chaired by Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon and attended by Secretary Transport Asad Zamin, Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) Managing Director Kamal Dayo and TransKarachi CEO Fuad Ghaffar Soomro among other officials.
During the meeting, a comprehensive review of various projects under the provincial transport and mass transit department, including People’s Bus Service, EV scooters, and other issues were discussed. The meeting also discussed establishing charging stations for EV vehicles at various locations in the province.
The minister was given a detailed briefing on the transport department’s projects for the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25, and held comprehensive discussions on the proposed projects for the upcoming year.
Memon was briefed about the launch of bus services by various investors under the public-private partnership mode.
The meeting was informed that work on the Jam Sadiq Bridge, an important part of the Yellow Line BRT, is complete and could be inaugurated in the coming months. It was decided to further accelerate work on completion of the Red Line BRT.
Memon said the provincial government is committed to establishing an environmentally sustainable and modern public transport system. “The Sindh government is constantly striving for eco-friendly and affordable travel facilities for the people,” he said.
The minister said that a new batch of buses are expected to arrive in Karachi soon, while double-decker buses are also being introduced.
“We have launched successful projects like EV buses, People’s Bus Service in Karachi, and are working to lay this network in every corner of Karachi,” he added.  “We want every citizen across Sindh, including Karachi, to avail modern travel facilities.”
The minister said the projects launched by the Sindh government are aimed at regulating the city’s traffic and developing the transport system on modern lines.
During a recent visit to the headquarters of the Chinese automobile company Chery Holdings Group (CHG) in Wuhu, China, Memon has announced that a charging station for EVs will be established every 50 kilometres across all districts of the province.
During the meeting, the company expressed its willingness to install EV charging infrastructure across Sindh. Memon said that the establishment of EV charging stations at regular intervals would benefit owners of electric motorcycles, cars and trucks.
He mentioned that the innovation is coming to the transportation system of Sindh and their vision is to promote environmentally friendly EV vehicles.
He added that the initiative would also create employment opportunities at the local level. In addition, an assembly plant for EV mini-trucks is being set up in Karachi, he said.</p><small>2025-06-11 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11074204c9f0c45.jpg?r=074215' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916442/budget-2025-26-austerity-budget-offers-crumbs-for-relief' target='_blank'><strong>Budget 2025-26: Austerity budget offers ‘crumbs’ for relief</strong></a><br><p>• Next year’s revenue target set at Rs14.13tr

ISLAMABAD: Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors, in an effort to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.
At the same time, however, the government announced it was imposing a ‘carbon levy’ of Rs2.5 per litre on petrol, diesel and furnace oil in the upcoming fiscal year, to be doubled the following year.
It also introduced a 5 per cent tax on large pensions, an 18pc tax on imported solar panels, and an increase in the debt servicing surcharge on electricity to finance not only interest payments, but also principal debt. Additionally, it announced the gradual elimination of tax exemptions for the tribal areas beginning this year.
Ambitious targets
Despite a record tax shortfall of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the current fiscal year, the finance minister set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr. This would include approximately Rs840 billion in additional revenue measures, on top of a Rs1.39tr automatic tax increase supported by projected inflation of 7.5pc and economic growth of 4.2pc and expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr (equivalent to 2pc of GDP), driven primarily by reduced debt servicing costs, and also at the expense of development and public welfare initiatives.
 


Not only the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), but the provincial governments, too, were unable to meet their commitment of maintaining a Rs1.22tr surplus for the current year. Still, they provided vital support to the federal government with a surplus of Rs1.01tr.
This contribution enabled the federal government to outperform its fiscal target and record a budget deficit of just 5.6pc of GDP (Rs6.44tr) — the lowest in a decade since FY2015-16 — compared to a higher projected deficit of 5.9pc (Rs7.28tr). This notable fiscal tightening was achieved through punishing additional taxation measures amounting to Rs2.2tr (1.8pc of GDP) alongside a reduction in expenditure as interest rates declined from a historic peak of 22pc.
Accordingly, the FY2025–26 budget sets an ambitious target to reduce the budget deficit to 3.9pc of GDP (Rs5.04tr), contingent upon a cash surplus of Rs1.46tr from the provinces. As a result, the primary budget surplus is projected to rise to 2.4pc of GDP, or Rs3.17tr, for the next year — up from this year’s 2.2pc of GDP (Rs2.5tr).
Relief for select groups
The government found sufficient fiscal space to offer some relief to the salaried class, who have been burdened by high tax rates, declining real incomes, and severe inflation over the past two years.
The finance minister proposed a reduction in income tax by half, to 2.5pc, on annual income between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. It is pertinent to mention that there was a discrepancy in the income tax rate for the lowest taxable bracket announced by the finance minister and the tax rate mentioned in the finance bill, which was even lower at 1pc.
 
 

Clarity is awaited on this matter. Similarly, the annual tax on a salary of Rs1.2m was proposed to be reduced to Rs6,000, down from the current Rs30,000. Mr Aurangzeb added that the income tax rate for those earning up to Rs2.2m per annum would be cut to 11pc, down from the current 15pc. Similarly, the tax rate has been reduced to 23pc from 25pc for salaried income between Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m. In addition, the finance minister acknowledged that oppressive tax rates were driving highly skilled professionals to migrate, contributing to a “brain drain”. As a corrective measure, he announced a 1pc reduction in the surcharge on annual incomes exceeding Rs10m.
Apart from this, a 10pc increase in salaries and 7pc rise in pensions was announced for government employees. The salaries of armed forces personnel would also be increased by 25pc, including a special relief allowance in recognition of their recent heroic performance in response to Indian aggression, the finance minister said.
At the same time, the government introduced a generous tax relief and incentives for the construction sector, including access to cheaper mortgage financing, in a bid to revive large-scale manufacturing, which has been contracting for the past three years due to unprecedented increases in energy and borrowing costs. To this end, the finance minister announced a reduction in the withholding tax on the purchase of real estate from 4pc to 2.5pc. The next two current withholding tax rates of 3.5pc and 3pc will also be reduced to 2pc and 1.5pc respectively.
Additionally, a 7pc federal excise duty imposed last year on the transfer of commercial properties, plots and houses has also been proposed to be abolished.
As a new initiative, the budget includes a tax credit on mortgages for homes of up to 10 marla (250 square yards) and flats of up to 2,000 square feet. This is in addition to a new scheme aimed at promoting mortgage financing. The finance minister also announced a reduction in stamp duty on property purchases in Islamabad Capital Territory, from 4pc to 1pc, and expressed hope that provincial governments would follow suit by reducing heavy taxation on immovable property.
The government also succeeded in persuading the IMF to exempt fertilisers and insecticides from taxation for the current year, in an effort to position agriculture as the engine of economic growth.
Tightening the net
On the other hand, the finance minister announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings. However, he clarified that this would not apply to small savers or investments in national saving schemes.
Similarly, digital marketplaces and online businesses are to be brought into the tax net through courier companies, it was announced. The minister also announced a 5pc income tax on pensions exceeding Rs10m per annum for pensioners under the age of 70. In a move to promote a cashless economy, non-filers will now be subject to a 1pc advance tax on cash withdrawals, up from the existing 0.6pc. Taxpaying businesses will be discouraged from making cash sales exceeding Rs200,000. Additional measures have also been introduced to encourage online transactions and digital payments.
 
 

Strict steps will be taken against non-filers. Only taxpayers who submit their wealth statements will be allowed to undertake large financial transactions, such as the purchase of vehicles, immovable properties, securities, mutual funds, or the opening of certain bank accounts.
Tightening the noose around unregistered traders, the finance minister proposed the freezing of bank accounts, restrictions on property transfers, and the sealing of business premises in cases of serious violations of sales tax laws, with the involvement of trade bodies. In the same vein, he also announced a notional 0.5pc reduction in the super tax for corporate firms with annual incomes between Rs200m and Rs500m.
Improved tax collection
The finance minister noted a rise in the tax-to-GDP ratio, which has historically been one of the weakest aspects of Pakistan’s economy, from 8.8pc in June 2024 to 10.3pc in the first nine months of the current year. This figure is projected to reach 10.4pc by June 30, 2025. Including non-tax revenue, the federal tax-to-GDP ratio has improved to 11.6pc, representing an increase of 1.2 percentage points, up from 0.8 percentage points last year.
The consolidated tax-to-GDP ratio, the finance minister added, has reached 12.3pc, including a 0.7pc contribution from the provinces. “The 1.6pc of GDP increase in FBR revenue is not only the highest in Pakistan’s history, but is also rarely seen anywhere else in the world in recent times,” the minister boasted.
Balancing the budget
The government has set the non-tax revenue target for the next year at Rs5.15tr, slightly higher than the current year’s Rs4.9tr. This brings the total gross federal revenue (FBR plus non-tax) to Rs19.28tr, up from the current year’s original budget target of Rs17.8tr, which was later revised down to Rs16.8tr. After transferring Rs8.2tr to the provinces, the net federal revenue is estimated to be Rs11.07tr for the next year, compared to Rs9.8tr this year. This leaves a projected federal deficit of Rs6.5tr, a reduction from the current year’s budgeted Rs8.5tr, which was later revised to Rs7.44tr.
 
 

Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc to Rs1.19tr for the next year, down from Rs1.38tr in the current year. This is primarily due to a 13pc (Rs154bn) cut in power sector subsidies. The tariff differential subsidy for ex-Wapda distribution companies has been reduced by 9.7pc (Rs27bn) to Rs249bn, from Rs276bn this year. Meanwhile, the tariff subsidy for K-Electric has been cut by 28pc (Rs49bn), to Rs125bn from Rs174bn. An even larger reduction has been applied to the tariff subsidy for Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which has been reduced to Rs74bn from Rs108bn, reflecting a cut of 31.5pc.
The major non-tax revenue item is expected to be the petroleum levy on POL products, projected at Rs1.47tr, which is a 26pc increase from the current year’s Rs1.16tr. An even larger contribution is anticipated from State Bank of Pakistan profits, estimated at Rs2.4tr for the next year, though this marks a slight decline from Rs2.6tr this year.
The debt servicing cost for next year has been estimated at Rs8.2tr, representing an 8pc decline from actual repayments of Rs8.95tr, and 16pc lower than the original budget estimate of Rs9.78tr. Pension expenditure is expected to rise by around 4pc, reaching Rs1.06tr, up from Rs1.01tr this year. Military pensions are projected to grow by 12pc to Rs742bn, compared to a 10pc increase in civil pensions, which are expected to reach Rs243bn.
As a result, total current expenditure has been set at Rs16.29tr for the next year, slightly below this year’s figure of Rs16.39tr.
Published in Dawn, June 11th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-11 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11111621e2fc667.png?r=111645' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916429/pti-rejects-imf-dictated-budgetary-proposals' target='_blank'><strong>PTI rejects ‘IMF-dictated’ budgetary proposals</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Teh­reek-i-Insaf (PTI) has rejected the budgetary proposals, alleging that the proposed budget for the upcoming financial year has been prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The party arrived at this conclusion after discussing the budgetary proposals for financial year 2025-26 at a meeting of the parliamentary party, which was attended by PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, leader of the opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and leader of opposition in Senate Shibli Faraz among others.
Calling the PML-N government “illegitimate”, the participants were of the opinion it had no authority to present the budget. They said the PTI would never accept the budget prop­o­sals as the IMF had allegedly prep­a­red them. They alleged that relaxati­ons were proposed for the elite, while the less privileged were crushed.
The PTI leaders also criticised the ‘biased role’ of the NA speaker. The party decided that if the national broadcaster/PTV failed to air speeches by lawmakers from the opposition benches, the party would hold protests during budget debate.
While talking to Dawn, PTI leader from Rawalpindi Shehryar Riaz said the budget 2025-26 demonstrated a narrow, IMF-driven fiscal tightening, heavily prioritising defence at the expense of social welfare and reforms.
“Without bold tax reform, debt relief or growth-centred investments, it risks perpetuating poverty and instability,” he said.
No benefit for salaried class
Later, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja told a presser there was hardly any benefit for the salaried class.
“They are told to invest money in the stock market. People are being encouraged to invest in stock market that fluctuates. The class, which cannot protest, is continuously being burdened,” he said.
Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz said budget made for the elite broke all records of burdening the less privileged.
The senator suggested that the figures from Imran Khan’s tenure and current government’s tenure should be compared. Economic conditions of the masses had become so weak that many people could not even afford to sacrifice animal during Eidul Azha, he noted.
Interest on loans
Shibli Faraz said the debt was continuously increasing and most of the tax revenue was being used in paying the interest on loans.
He said that government employees protested due to which all roads leading to Parliament House were closed and it had become difficult for lawmakers to reach there for the budget session.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that instead of a minute increase in salaries, the government should have apologised to the masses.
Published in Dawn, June 11th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-11 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11105606898da38.jpg?r=105621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916482/us-china-reach-deal-to-ease-export-curbs-keep-tariff-truce-alive' target='_blank'><strong>US, China reach deal to ease export curbs, keep tariff truce alive</strong></a><br><p>United States and Chinese officials said on Tuesday they had agreed on a framework to put their trade truce back on track and remove Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earths while offering little sign of a durable resolution to longstanding trade differences.
At the end of two days of intense negotiations in London, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters the framework deal puts “meat on the bones” of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease bilateral retaliatory tariffs that had reached crushing triple-digit levels.
But the Geneva deal had faltered over China’s continued curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of its own preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.
Lutnick said the agreement reached in London would remove some of the recent US export restrictions, but did not provide details after the talks concluded around midnight London time (4am PKT).
“We have reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus and the call between the two presidents,” Lutnick said.
“The idea is we’re going to go back and speak to President Trump and make sure he approves it. They’re going to go back and speak to President Xi and make sure he approves it, and if that is approved, we will then implement the framework.”
In a separate briefing, China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang also said a trade framework had been reached in principle that would be taken back to US and Chinese leaders.
The dispute may keep the Geneva agreement from unravelling over duelling export controls, but does little to resolve deep differences over Trump’s unilateral tariffs and longstanding US complaints about China’s state-led, export-driven economic model.
The two sides left Geneva with fundamentally different views of the terms of that agreement and needed to be more specific on required actions, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center in Washington.
“They are back to square one but that’s much better than square zero,” Lipsky added.
The two sides have until August 10 to negotiate a more comprehensive agreement to ease trade tensions, or tariff rates will snap back from about 30per cent to 145pc on the US side and from 10pc to 125pc on the Chinese side.
Investors, who have been badly burned by trade turmoil before, offered a cautious response and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.57pc.
“The devil will be in the details, but the lack of reaction suggests this outcome was fully expected,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone in Melbourne.
“The details matter, especially around the degree of rare earths bound for the US, and the subsequent freedom for US-produced chips to head east, but for now as long as the headlines of talks between the two parties remain constructive, risk assets should remain supported.”
Resolving restrictions
Lutnick said China’s restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals and magnets to the US will be resolved as a “fundamental” part of the framework agreement.
“Also, there were a number of measures the United States of America put on when those rare earths were not coming,” Lutnick said.
“You should expect those to come off … in a balanced way.”
 
 

US President Donald Trump’s shifting tariff policies have roiled global markets, sparked congestion and confusion in major ports, and cost companies tens of billions of dollars in lost sales and higher costs.
The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast for 2025 by four-tenths of a percentage point to 2.3pc, saying higher tariffs and heightened uncertainty posed a “significant headwind” for nearly all economies.
A resolution to the trade war may require policy adjustments from all countries to treat financial imbalances or otherwise greatly risk mutual economic damage, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on a rare visit to Beijing on Wednesday.
Phone call helped
The second round of US-China talks was given a major boost by a rare phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, which Lutnick said provided directives that were merged with Geneva truce agreement.
Customs data published on Monday showed that China’s exports to the US plunged 34.5pc in May, the sharpest drop since the outbreak of the COVID pandemic.
While the impact on US inflation and its jobs market has so far been muted, tariffs have hammered US business and household confidence and the dollar remains under pressure.
 
 

Lutnick was joined by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the London talks. Bessent departed hours before their conclusion to return to Washington to testify before Congress on Wednesday.
China holds a near-monopoly on rare earth magnets, a crucial component in electric vehicle motors, and its decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets upended global supply chains.
In May, the US responded by halting shipments of semiconductor design software and chemicals and aviation equipment, revoking export licences that had been previously issued.
China, Mexico, the European Union, Japan, Canada and many airlines and aerospace companies worldwide urged the Trump administration not to impose new national security tariffs on imported commercial planes and parts, according to documents released Tuesday.
Just after the framework deal was announced, a US appeals court allowed Trump’s most sweeping tariffs to stay in effect while it reviews a lower court decision blocking them on grounds that they exceeded Trump’s legal authority by imposing them.
The decision keeps alive a key pressure point on China, Trump’s currently suspended 34pc “reciprocal” duties that had prompted swift tariff escalation.</p><small>2025-06-11 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/111037070e98243.jpg?r=103739' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916481/trump-willing-to-work-on-kashmir-issue-confirms-us-state-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Trump willing to work on Kashmir issue, confirms US State Dept</strong></a><br><p>US Department of State on Wednesday reiterated US President Donald Trump’s resolve to work on the Kashmir dispute, saying each step that he takes “is made to solve generational differences between countries”.
Donald Trump had offered to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after the two nations’ most intense military confrontation in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a White House press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard,” adding that the White House would have plenty to say about the matter.
She further said, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.
“It shouldn’t surprise anyone that he’d want to manage something like that,” said Bruce.
Detailing the recent visit of a Pakistani delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in response to a question, she said that the delegation met with state department officials in Washington, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker.
She elaborated that the two parties discussed issues related to the Pak-US bilateral relationship, including counterterrorism cooperation. Hooker reiterated US support for the ongoing ceasefire.
“We also know that Deputy Secretary Landau met with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States strong support of India in the fight against terrorism,” Bruce added.
 


Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence in the country.
Meanwhile, last week, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink of war.
“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-11 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/111023423d33f49.jpg?r=102549' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916444/road-to-stardom' target='_blank'><strong>Road to stardom</strong></a><br><p>FOR an icon of women’s cricket — in fact, women’s sports — in Pakistan, Sana Mir’s induction into the International Cricket Council’s Hall of Fame is a testament to her unwavering spirit and relentless drive to pursue excellence.
Sana is Pakistan’s first female cricketer to find a place in ICC’s esteemed Hall of Fame, being inducted alongside stalwarts of the men’s game including India’s M.S. Dhoni, Australia’s Matthew Hayden, New Zealand’s Daniel Vettori and South Africans Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith.
England’s Sarah Taylor was the only other woman cricketer to be inducted into the Hall of Fame on Monday. Sana has earned her place for not just her achievements on the pitch but also her role off it.
 
 

The 39-year-old burst onto the scene in 2005, at a time when pursuing cricket as a career in Pakistan was hardly a lucrative option for women. Besides, the social stigma attached to women playing the game publicly also pushed away aspiring players. But Sana soldiered on, overcoming the odds: when a back injury threatened her fast-bowling career, she turned herself into a spin-bowling all-rounder to devastating effect.
Sana became the first Pakistan bowler to claim 100 wickets in women’s One-day Internationals, and also attained the top spot in the ICC ODI bowling rankings in 2018 — another unprecedented feat.
As captain, she led Pakistan to glory at the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games, while mentoring numerous youngsters as team leader, setting an example for them to follow. Having led Pakistan at five T20 World Cups and two ODI World Cups, she stepped down from her role in 2017 but continued to contribute to the team as a player until her retirement in 2020.
 
 

Sana is a role model, advocating child protection and mental health. She is also critical of body-shaming in sports advertising. Her ascendancy to the Hall of Fame should inspire more Pakistani women to take up not only cricket but other sports too.

The Arctic region is on the frontline of global warming, heating up four times faster than the rest of the planet since 1979, according to a 2022 study in scientific journal Nature.
“The melting rate of the Greenland ice sheet by, from a preliminary analysis, a factor of 17… means the Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise is higher than it would have otherwise been without this heat wave,” one of the authors of the report, Friederike Otto, associate professor in climate science at the Imperial College London, told reporters.
“Without climate change this would have been impossible,” she said.
 
 

In Iceland, the temperature exceeded 26 degrees Celsius (79 Fahrenheit) on May 15, unprecedented for that time of year on the subarctic island.
“Temperatures over Iceland as observed this May are record-breaking, more than 13 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991-2020 average May daily maximum temperatures,” the WWA said.
In May, 94 per cent of Iceland’s weather stations registered record temperatures, according to the country’s meteorological institute. In eastern Greenland, the hottest day during the heatwave was about 3.9C warmer compared to the preindustrial climate, the WWA said.
“While a heatwave that is around 20C might not sound like an extreme event from the experience of most people around the world, it is a really big deal for this part of the world,” Otto said.
“It affects the whole world massively,” she said.
According to the WWA, the record highs observed in Iceland and Greenland this May could reoccur every 100 years.
For Greenland’s indigenous communities, the warmer temperatures and melting ice affect their ability to hunt on the ice, posing a threat to their livelihood and traditional way of life.
The changes also affect infrastructure in the two countries.
“In Greenland and Iceland, infrastructure is built for cold weather, meaning during a heatwave ice melt can lead to flooding and damage roads and infrastructure,” the WWA said.</p><small>2025-06-11 05:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/110949572ed49ea.png?r=095748' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916428/8pc-of-uplift-budget-for-climate-change' target='_blank'><strong>8pc of uplift budget for climate change</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a significant move to address growing challenges of climate change, the federal government on Tuesday allocated 6.9 per cent of the current budget and 8.2pc of the development budget for climate-related initiatives in the fiscal year 2025-26.
In addition, the finance minister announced during his budget speech that in order “to discourage use of fossil fuels” and create a funding source for climate adaptation and Green Energy Programmes, the government has proposed the imposition of a Rs2.5 carbon levy per litre of petrol, high-speed diesel and furnace oil, which will be  increased to Rs5 per litre from the next fiscal year.
 
 

Furthermore, a petroleum levy on furnace oil will be imposed as per the government announcement.
According to the Annual Budget Statement, the allocations reflect a strategic shift towards climate-resilient planning, with climate-responsive grants making up 0.2pc and nearly half of all subsidies geared towards climate-related objectives. These interventions aimed to equip the federal government with the tools to make more targeted and impactful decisions in response to climate risks.

Rs2.5 per litre carbon levy proposed on all fuels, will be enhanced to Rs5 next year

A key feature of this year’s budget process was the implementation of the Climate Budget Tagging (CBT) tool, which enabled the classification of climate-sensitive expenditures in line with the National Climate Change Policy. The government, through a consultative process involving multiple stakeholders, successfully tagged more than 5,000 cost centres across three primary categories, along with 40 sub-categories. This data had been integrated into the Sustainable Development Prog­ramme Achievement Program­me (SAP) system for streamlined accounting and reporting.
The budget statement noted that this tagging system would streng­then the government’s ability to monitor and track climate-related spending, with regular reports expected to improve transparency and guide future policy-making.
As per the detailed breakdown, Rs85.43 billion had been allocated for adaptation measures aimed at enhancing climate resilience, Rs603bn for mitigation efforts to reduce emissions and transition to cleaner technologies, and Rs28.33bn for supporting areas, including capacity building, institutional development, and research.
The enhanced climate allocations underscored Pakistan’s commitment to integrating environmental considerations into national development planning, ensuring that economic growth aligned with the country’s climate resilience and sustainability goals.
According to the statement, the federal government had adopted a climate budget as a governance system to mainstream climate considerations into policy decision making. Green budgeting will enable the government in prioritising climate by integrating it into budgeting process to ensure implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting across line ministries and departments.
Separately, Rs2.76bn has been allocated in the budget; from which a major chunk of Rs2.25bn will go to upscaling the Green Pakistan Programme. Besides, Rs325 million has been allocated for strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Climate Change.

Many suspect that the real estate sector is the “backdoor the authorities plan to use for providing some impetus to economic growth”. The tax relief announced for the wealthy real estate and construction lobby is believed to be meant to drive up the growth rate.
This year’s provisional GDP growth estimate of 2.7pc falls short of the original target of 3.2pc, though it remains in line with the projection of the IMF and other multilateral lenders.
 
 

Many, however, suspect that the government will not be able to meet its target without putting pressure on its external account, as imports are rising at a much faster pace than exports.
“By pushing growth, the government risks bringing significant pressures on its current account,” Pakistan Business Council Chief Executive Officer Ehsan Malik insists, expressing his dismay over lack of any meaningful measures in the budget to increase industrial productivity and exports.
The budget has proved to be a major disappointment for those who thought the economic stability achieved under the IMF programme would guide the government to implement deeper reforms for a structural shift in the economy and lay the foundation for sustainable growth in future.
If anything, according to economist Sajid Amin, the budget is all about fiscal stabilisation and revenue generation and lacks in long-term growth reform vision. “It’s a routine budget that hopes to prepare the ground for the success of the upcoming second review of the IMF programme,” he argues.
Economist Ali Hasnain agrees. The budget aims to strengthen the financial position of the government, through cuts in developing spending and subsidies, without any structural improvement, he maintains.
“Similarly, the external sector improvements owe to record increase in remittances (rather than increase in exports and foreign direct investment). At best, it is a cautious step in the right direction, even if they don’t have a plan.”
The absence of credible effort to implement reforms, especially to broaden the base of taxes, apart, the government sets off in motion the long-standing tariff reforms — again under the IMF loan conditions — to revoke protections to some industries over the next five years and seeks to restrict ability of tax non-filers to purchase securities above a threshold and cars above 850cc or opening bank accounts.
Moreover, it lays the ground for phased removal of sales tax exemptions for industries (steel, edible oil & ghee, etc) operating in Fata/Pata in three years to make the playing field even across the country.
These are indeed welcome measures, said the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) in its reaction to the budget. Yet the organisation representing more than 200 foreign investors operating in the country expressed its deep disappointment over the limited progress in addressing inequitable corporate tax rates.
“There is an urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of tax structures to enhance Pakistan’s competitiveness attracts foreign investment,” it said, regretting that the government has missed the opportunity to broaden the tax base in the next budget, which is devoid of any concrete strategy to document Pakistan’s substantial Rs9tr cash-based informal economy — a critical measure for meaningful revenue enhancement and economic formalisation.
The OICCI also noted the absence of meaningful reductions in government expenditure, which could have helped narrow the budget deficit. “Fiscal discipline remains critical to ensuring macroeconomic stability, and OICCI urges the government to prioritise expenditure rationalisation in its budgetary measures.”
Pakistan badly needs transformative policies to turn around the economy and out it on a sustainable path to growth. But that cannot be achieved by using the backdoors. Previous governments have tried that path and always led the country to a worse crisis than before.

This is apparent from the significant reduction in the consolidated national fiscal deficit target to 3.9pc of GDP from the original target of 5.9pc. The provinces, which have often been criticised for adding to federal fiscal woes because of their increased share under the NFC award, will contribute cash surplus of nearly Rs1.5tr, up 50pc from the Rs1tr they were required to contribute this year to hold down the national deficit.
Indeed, the government has partially met the income tax relief demand from the salaried classes, but the fiscal space for this is basically provided by savings of Rs1tr in debt payments due to reduced domestic interest rates over the last year. These savings have also allowed the authorities to give relief to powerful real estate lobbies demanding tax concessions.
That said, the budget is disappointing for those who thought the economic stability achieved over the last year and a half would encourage implementation of deeper structural reforms for sustainable economic growth.
There is not much in the budget to give hope for such a structural shift. But that does not mean the document is devoid of good points. For example, it sets into motion long-standing tariff reforms that hopefully will end protections to some rent-seeking industries over the next five years.
 
 

It also seeks to bring non-filers into the net by imposing restrictions, such as on the purchase of securities above a certain threshold, purchase of autos above 850cc, etc. Moreover, it lays the ground for phased removal of sales tax exemptions for industries operating in ex-Fata/Pata to make the playing field even across the country.
Though the finance minister spoke of the hardships of the compliant corporate sector, his budget speech fell short of addressing the issue of inequitable corporate tax rates, a major obstacle to investment and export growth. While the controversial super tax has been reduced marginally, steps to enhance competitiveness and attract foreign investment are absent.
It is primarily because of unfair tax policies and the burden they put on industry, which forms 18pc of the economy but contributes nearly 60pc to overall tax revenues, that large-scale manufacturing has been contracting.
With the government wanting to boost exports to $100bn in five years under its Uraan programme, the goal is likely to remain elusive without increasing industrial productivity and attracting FDI. Many remain sceptical about the government’s ability to achieve next year’s growth target of 4.2pc, due largely to its failure to change the dynamics of a moribund economy. Stability has returned. Will growth follow suit?

It said that the repatriation of Afghan Citizenship Card (ACC) holders alongside unregistered and illegal foreigners commenced from April 1.

It said that returnees to their respective countries were being treated with dignity, and arrangements for food and healthcare for returning foreigners were already in place.

The government also introduced pension reforms, in a bid to reduce the exp­e­nditure under this head, as it eliminated multiple allowances and limited the family pension period to 10 years in case of the death of the actual beneficiary.
Interestingly, the government did not announce the minimum wage — currently at Rs37,000 — in the federal budget. Previously, the federal government would set a minimum wage threshold and provinces would also follow suit. Moreover, the differently-abled employees would be eligible for a monthly conveyance allowance of Rs6,000 — an increase of Rs2,000.
 
 

Although the budget document showed that the government had proposed a 6 per cent increase in the salaries of government employees, the budget speech by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced a 10 per cent pay hike.

Proposal puts end to multiple allowances, reduces family pension period to 10 years

“Besides reducing tax on salaried class and despite financial constraints, the government has decided to take relief measures for the government employees. Such as a 10 per cent increase in the salaries of government employees (from grade 1 to 22), 7 per cent raise in pension of retired employees, conveyance allowance for differently-abled employees has been increased from Rs4,000 per month to Rs6,000 per month,” the finance minister said.
“Following the constitution regarding equal rights, disparity in salaries is being eliminated and thus there is a proposal of 30 per cent disparity reduction allowance for eligible employees,” the minister said, adding that the country was facing acute security threats and armed forces of the country have rendered remarkable services for the defence of the country’s borders.
“In recognition of their services, there is a proposal of a special relief allowance for armed forces officers, soldiers and JCOs. These expenses will be met under defence budget of the year 2025-26,” he added.
Pension reforms
Talking about pension reforms, the finance minister said the government had introduced some reforms in the sector to diminish the burden on the exchequer. In the last few pension schemes, some changes had been made through executive orders that caused an extra burden on the exchequer, he claimed.
Listing the reforms, he said, “Discouraging early retirement; linking of pension increase with the Consumer Price Index (CPI); after the death of the life partner, the family pension period will be limited to ten years; abolishing of more than one pension; choosing any one of the two — pension or salary in case of re-employment after retirement.”
Mr Aurangzeb noted that there was a proposal to impose 5 per cent tax on pensioners below 70, who were drawing over Rs10 million yearly pension. However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners, he added.
Before the budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presided over the federal cabinet meeting and said that during the last one-and-a-quarter year, the nation faced a hard situation and challenges, but steering the country out of the quagmire was no ordinary achievement.
“The common man and the salaried class gave sacrifices,” the prime minister said, adding that the salaried class was asking the question that they had contributed about Rs400 billion to the national exchequer in the form of taxes and how much the wealthy and opulent had given?

• Military budget jumps to 1.97pc of GDP, up from 1.7pc last year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Tuesday proposed an allocation of Rs2.55 trillion for the country’s armed forces in the fiscal year 2025-26, marking the highest annual increase in defence spending in over a decade, amid heightened tensions with India and last month’s military clashes between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The new allocation represents a 20.2 per cent rise over the previous year’s budget of Rs2.122tr, pushing defence spending to around 1.97pc of GDP — up from 1.7pc last year — as it inches back to 2pc after years of incremental decline. The increase also contrasts with the decline in national spending on health and education in terms of GDP, with figures for the first nine months of the outgoing fiscal year well below 1pc.
The defence spending hike also means a rise in its share of the total federal outlay to 14.51pc, the highest in recent years.
 
 

Presenting the budget in the National Assembly, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb said, “The security situation in the country is precarious and the armed forces have rendered commendable service in protecting the borders.”
The military allocation comes against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions, including clashes with India in May 2025 and a concurrent 9.5pc increase in India’s defence budget to 6.81tr Indian rupees. Internal security operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have also contributed to the rising expenditure on security, though internal security spending is met from a separate budget head.
The Rs2.55tr defence allocation — about $9.18 billion — includes key hikes in operational and infrastructure expenses. Operating costs, which cover fuel, rations, training and medical treatment, are set to rise 37.22pc to Rs704.4bn. Civil works, such as infrastructure development, will increase by 37.4pc to Rs336.5bn.
A 3.8pc increase has been proposed for employee-related expenses, covering salaries and allowances for servicemen, with Rs846.03bn earmarked for this purpose. The finance minister said that officers, junior commissioned officers and soldiers would receive a special relief allowance, funded from within the defence budget.
 
 

Spending on physical assets — covering arms and equipment procurement — is set to climb 20.9pc to Rs663.1bn. Large-scale military acquisitions and funding for the country’s nuclear and missile programs are believed to be channelled through classified allocations not reflected in the published defence budget.
The employee-related expe­n­ses, which account for 33.18pc, remain the largest chunk, though dropping from 39pc in FY25. Operating expenses now take 27.62pc, up from 25pc in the outgoing year.
Physical assets, meanwhile, claim 26pc, which is a slight increase from 25.8pc in 2024-25. Civil works would receive 13.2pc, rising from 11.5pc, underscoring a growing emphasis on military construction and facilities.
Compared to the outgoing year, the share for employee-related expenses has declined by 5.82 percentage points, while operating expenses and civil works have gained 2.62 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, pointing to a reallocation of resources to address heightened security needs amid regional tensions.
Service-wise allocations are as follows: Army, Rs1.17tr (45.9pc of the total); Pakistan Air Force, Rs520.75bn (20.4pc); Navy, Rs265.97bn (10.4pc); and Inter-Services Organisations, Rs498.11bn (19.5pc). All services received around a 15.45pc increase, with the Army’s slightly higher 15.84pc rise.
A closer examination of the defence allocation of Rs 2.55 trillion reveals an unallocated amount of Rs 95.17 billion, as the combined allocation for the Army, PAF, Navy, and Inter-Services Organisations totals Rs 2.45483 trillion. This discrepancy suggests the unallocated funds may be directed toward operational costs not directly tied to specific services.
In addition to the defence budget, Rs1.055tr has been set aside for military pensions — a 4.04pc increase over the previous year. While not part of the defence budget, military pensions constitute roughly 6pc of the total Rs17.573tr federal outlay.
The latest figures suggest a continuing shift away from the decade-long trend of modest annual increases of around 11pc, with the 2025-26 hike being the third consecutive rise from what had become a routine annual raise.
The increase looks to be driven by Pakistan’s evolving security needs, regional dynamics and a push to modernise and maintain readiness across all branches of the military.
Despite the increase, Pakistan’s defence spending remains considerably lower than that of India, whose military expenditure stands at nearly nine times higher in dollar terms.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s April 2025 report, South Asia’s military expenditure continues to rise due to geopolitical rivalries and modernisation initiatives across the region.

• Climate campaigner says she was ‘kidnapped’ in international waters
CAIRO: Israeli gunfire killed at least 17 Palestinians and wounded dozens as thousands of displaced people approached an aid distribution site of a US-backed humanitarian group in central Gaza on Tuesday, local health authorities said.
Medics said the casualties were rushed to two hospitals, the Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, and the Al-Quds in Gaza City, in the north.
The Israeli military said its forces had fired warning shots at “suspects who were advancing in the area of Wadi Gaza and posed a threat to the troops”.
It added that it was aware of reports that several were injured, but said numbers released by local health authorities did not align with the information it had collected.
Separately, local health authorities said an Israeli strike on a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza Strip killed eight people, taking Tuesday’s death toll to at least 25.
The Israeli military said it had intercepted one rocket fired from northern Gaza towards Israeli territories.
Last week the army warned Palestinians not to approach routes leading to sites of the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) between 6pm and 6am local time, describing these roads as closed military zones.
There was no immediate GHF comment on Tuesday’s incident.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May, overseeing a new model of aid distribution which the United Nations says is neither impartial nor neutral.
“Day after day, casualties & scores of injured are reported at distribution points manned by Israel & private security companies,” Philippe Lazzarini, the chief of the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), wrote on X.
“This humiliating system continues to force thousands of hungry & desperate people to walk for tens of miles excluding the most vulnerable & those living too far,” he said.
 






While the GHF has said there have been no incidents at its distribution sites, Palestinians seeking aid have described disorder, and access routes to the sites have been beset by chaos and deadly violence.
Thunberg deported
Meanwhile, Israel deported campaigner Greta Thunberg on a flight to Sweden via France on Tuesday, after detaining her along with other activists aboard a Gaza-bound aid boat.
Of the 12 people on board the Madleen carrying food and supplies for Gaza, five French activists were taken into custody after they refused to leave Israel voluntarily.
Israeli forces intercepted the boat, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, in international waters on Monday and towed it to the port of Ashdod.
They then transferred them to Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv, the foreign ministry said, from where Thunberg flew to France ahead of a scheduled flight to Sweden.
On arrival in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, 22-year-old Thunberg accused Israel of “kidnapping us in international waters and taking us against our will to Israel”.
“This is yet another intentional violation of rights that is added to the list of countless other violations that Israel is committing,” she said.
Thunberg, one of the world’s most prominent voices in the fight against climate change, has avoided air travel for years, and once sailed for a fortnight on a zero-emissions yacht to reach a UN summit in New York.
Five French activists who were also aboard the Madleen were set to face an Israeli judge, the French foreign minister said.
“Our consul was able to see the six French nationals arrested by the Israeli authorities last night,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X.
“One of them has agreed to leave voluntarily and should return today. The other five will be subject to forced deportation proceedings.

• There is a major gap between available jobs and skills of jobseekers
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan faces a significant unemployment challenge at 6.3 per cent, particularly impacting the youth aged 15-35, according to budget 2025-26.
Unemployment remains a complex issue and youth joblessness is particularly alarming, with 44.9pc of jobseekers aged 15–24, and female unemployment far exceeding male, the budget document says.
Pakistan, having a substantial domestic labour force of 71.8 million, holds the sixth largest workforce globally. Each year, approximately 2m young Pakistanis join the labour market, contributing to an expanding talent pool. There is a significant gap between the demand and supply of workers, especially, a serious mismatch between the jobs demanded and the supply of skills and trained manpower in the country. Pakistan’s labour market faces significant challenges, particularly concerning youth unemployment, gender disparities, and the need for skill development.
These trends are exacerbated by a mismatch between educational outcomes and labour market needs, especially in rural and underserved regions. It also reflects deep-rooted issues such as limited access to quality education, insufficient job creation, and gender inequality in economic participation.
Pakistan is a country of 241.5m population (Population Census 2023) with annual growth rate of 2.55pc echoes demographic expansion which may increase unemployment rate further. Pakistan’s population is characterised by a high proportion of youth, presenting both opportunities and challenges for its future. The latest labour force survey shows that the total youth population (15-29 years) is close to 62.58m (26pc) population. Additionally, 40pc of the population falls in the age group between 0-14 years, implying that the youth population will continue to rise. The Pakistan Demographic (2020) reports that by 2030 out of a total estimated population of 280m, 100m will be youth.
The budget document says that around 0.8m semi-skilled, skilled and highly skilled Pakistanis proceed abroad for employment annually.
The government has launched several initiatives to tackle these issues, including commitments to continued fiscal consolidation under the new IMF programme, planned privatisations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), reforms of power distribution companies, and an accelerated business regulatory reform agenda.

• Up to 80pc tax relief for salaried individuals earning Rs600,000-1.2m annually
• Minimal relief for top salary brackets earning above Rs4.1m
• 1pc surcharge reduction for income above Rs10m to curb brain drain
• Super tax cut by 0.5pc for companies earning Rs200m-500m
• Pensions above Rs10m to be taxed at 5pc
• Cash withdrawal tax for non-filers increased to 1pc from 0.6pc
ISLAMABAD: The government has announced sweeping tax reforms in the federal budget 2025-26, offering tax cuts of up to 80 per cent for low-income salaried individuals while limiting relief for higher earners to just 3pc. A new 5 per cent tax has also been proposed on high-value pensions exceeding Rs10 million annually.
The focus of the budget seems to balance sectoral rel­ief, expand tax scope, achieve equitable burden-sharing, and introducing strong enf­orcement measures. The government expects the digital taxation framework, carbon levies and tax enforcement on e-commerce and digital transactions to help Pakistan adapt to global financial regulation standards.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said tax relief measures total Rs60 billion for salaried individuals, Rs2.4bn for the corporate sector, and Rs60bn in exemptions for fertilisers and pesticides.
 
 

To achieve the proposed tax collection target of Rs14.131 trillion, the autonomous tax growth is projected at Rs1.34tr in FY26 based on the GDP growth target of 4.2pc and inflation rate of 7.5pc.
With the current year’s revenue collection of Rs11.5tr and autonomous growth of Rs1.345tr, revenue collection will reach Rs12.845tr in FY26 without any new tax or enforcement measures.
Tied to its commitments under the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF) programme, the government introduces additional revenue measures of Rs1.05tr, including new tax measures of Rs655bn and another Rs400bn through enforcement.
Enforcement measures
The Finance Bill also proposes Section 114C, which introduces a framework to restrict high-value economic transactions — such as purchase of vehicles, immovable property and securities — for individuals and entities, who have not filed income tax returns or cannot justify their financial capacity through formally declared resources.
By mandating that, only “eligible persons” with sufficient declared assets can engage in such transactions.
A new Section 175AA is proposed to be inserted into the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, empowering the FBR to share tax-related information of high-risk persons with scheduled banks.
This includes details such as turnover, income (including taxable income) for one or more tax years, identification data (including bank account numbers) declared in income tax returns, wealth statements, financial statements, or any other document submitted to the FBR, along with data-based algorithms as may be prescribed.
Salaried class
The salary exemption limit has remained unc­h­anged at Rs50,000 per month. However, the government has now proposed a reduction in tax rates for annual income up to Rs3,200,000 to provide rel­ief to people in lower- and middle-income brackets. Sim­ilarly, the surcharge rate has been proposed to be reduced to 9pc from 10pc for salaried individuals only.
Taxpayers earning between Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m annually will now face a 1pc tax rate, down from 5pc, offering up to 80pc tax reduction.
 
 

For annual incomes between Rs1.2m and Rs2.2m, the rate will drop to 11pc from 15pc (on the amount exceeding Rs1.2m), and the fixed sum reduced to Rs6,000 from Rs30,000. For a salary of Rs150,000 per month, this translates to a 48pc reduction in tax liability.
For annual salaries bet­ween Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m, the rate drops from 25pc to 23pc (on the income exceeding Rs2.2m) and the fixed sum to Rs116,000 from Rs180,000.
No percentage change was made for the remaining two slabs except reductions in the fixed sums.
Those earning between Rs3.2m and Rs4.1m per year will see their fixed tax reduced to Rs346,000 from Rs430,000, though the income exceeding Rs3.2m will still be taxed at 30pc.
For people earning more than Rs4.1m annually, the fixed sum has been reduced to Rs616,000 from Rs700,000, but the tax rate on income exceeding Rs4.1m will remain 35pc.
A 1pc surcharge reduction is proposed for individuals earning above Rs10m to discourage skilled professionals from emigrating. Meanwhile, pensioners drawing over Rs10m annually will now be taxed at 5pc.
Other key measures
The income tax and withholding tax exemption for the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions has been proposed to be extended to June 30, 2026.
Withholding tax on property purchases has been lowered across brackets — from 4pc to 2.5pc, 3.5pc to 2.5pc, and 3pc to 1.5pc — and Federal Excise Duty on commercial property transfers has been abolished (previously up to 7pc).
The interest income tax rate will rise from 15pc to 20pc, though national savings schemes are exempt.
Rent from commercial properties must be reported at a minimum of 4pc of fair market value unless proven otherwise to the commissioner.
Digital economy
A Digital Transactions Proceeds Levy will apply to all payments for goods or services delivered via digital platforms. Banks and courier services will act as withholding agents to capture the payment chain.
Withholding tax on cash withdrawals by non-filers rises from 0.6pc to 1pc. For specified services, withholding tax increases from 4pc to 6pc, excluding IT and IT-enabled services.
For non-specified services, a flat 15pc applies; for sportspersons, the rate increases from 10pc to 15pc. The tax rate on profit on debt has been increased from 15pc to 20pc. The dividend tax rate has been enhanced to 25pc and 15pc on dividend from mutual funds.
The government also proposes removing the Rs5m cap on profit from debt under the final tax regime for individuals and associations of persons  though companies will retain the adjustable tax.
Sales tax measures
The government also proposes an 18pc sales tax on the sales of imported solar panels.
Hybrid cars will also be subject to an 18pc sales tax, aligning them with petrol and diesel vehicles. A 10pc sales tax on goods will now be gradually imposed over the next five years in the sales tax-exempt provinces, i.e. ex-Fata region and Balochistan.
Under the proposed regime, payment intermediaries (banks, financial institutions, exchange companies, and payment gateways) will collect sales tax on digital payments, while couriers will handle tax collection for cash on delivery transactions. Additionally, the withholding tax rate is set to increase from 1pc to 2pc.
Sales tax has been extended to items like pet food, chocolates and cereal bars in retail packs. Rate on vermicelli and sheermaal has been increased from 10pc to 18pc. The 10pc tax on bun and rusk supply has been withdrawn.
The government has imposed 18pc sales tax on supplies, imports and import of plant and machinery by the industrial units located in the erstwhile Fata and Pata.

Still, stakeholders are complaining that it ignored many more demands that it had previously promised it would consider.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday acknowledged before parliament that the agriculture sector, responsible for 24 per cent of Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), had not performed well last year. He assured, however, that the government has extended it a helping hand not only to get it back on its feet, but to keep it up and running.
“Though [this is] a provincial subject, the prime minister has constituted a national committee for consultations with the provinces to [find ways to] improve it.”
Sectoral loans have risen from Rs1,785 billion in the first 10 months of the last fiscal year to Rs2,066 in the corresponding period of this year, the minister said. Keeping in view the rising demand, the federal government will be starting a ‘Clean Financing Facility’ to provide farmers up to Rs100,000 without collateral, with the money transferred directly to their e-wallets. The government has also planned a National Seed Development and Regulatory Authority that will help develop standardised seeds which can withstand climatic changes and improve yields.

Pesticides, fertilisers to remain exempt from sales tax, but reviving sectoral growth an uphill task

Though cotton, one of the most important crops, has suffered during the last few years, there was some improvement noticed during the outgoing fiscal year, the finance minister said. The government plans to capitalise on this improvement by allocating over Rs4 billion to 10 ongoing and five new schemes for agricultural improvement. Under the Green Pakistan Initiative, farmers will be helped in diversifying crops, meeting yield gaps, and gaining better access to markets. The government is also sending 1,000 agriculture graduates to China for training in modern agriculture; a batch of 300 students has already been sent under the programme, the finance minister said.
Farmers, however, are less impressed. Explaining their annoyance, Khalid Khokhar of the Pakistan Kissan Ittehad said the sector had registered a massive contraction in the outgoing year and its paltry growth (of 0.56pc) was attributable mainly to the livestock sector; otherwise, the final figure would have been deep in red territory.
Mr Khokhar wondered how the sector could grow by 4.5pc when the budgetary philosophy and allocations did not seem to support that target. “Seed improvement is a slogan, but where is the money to realise it?” he asked. “The government has pulled out of the market – refusing to fix procurement price and procure wheat, but where is the alternative arrangement? Are hoarders and stockists now the answer?” he added.
“Take it from me, next year will be worse if corrective measures, which are not visible in this budget, are not taken,” he concluded, adding that “not slapping GST on fertiliser and pesticides is a big relief, but it is not enough to help revive the sector.”
Separately, a Punjab government official regretted what he described as ‘federal insensitivity’, complaining that the budget had fulfilled only one of many promises. “The federation had also promised to cut duties on farm machinery, which is badly needed by the sector; reduce, as far as it could, fertiliser prices; and spearhead research and development initiatives. [Instead], it hid behind jargon and small concessions to escape responsibility, which can only be regretted. Avoiding GST on two inputs, however, is a welcome step,” he added.

The three-day visit will be the latest in a series of high-level exchanges between Islamabad and Washington amid a fragile regional security climate following last month’s military standoff between India and Pakistan.
Led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, the delegation includes senior Federal Board of Revenue officials and representatives of the energy and information technology sectors. They will hold meetings with counterparts at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, focusing on trade imbalances, tariff adjustments, and sectoral cooperation.
Diplomatic sources confirmed that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was scheduled to visit Washington by June 29. His visit would launch the first round of official discussions on the recent Indian military ‘misadventure’. Mr Dar is expected to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior officials to discuss regional security, post-conflict diplomacy, and broader strategic cooperation.

Commerce, IT, energy, FBR officials to be part of trade delegation due in US this week; PTI plans protests

PTI plans protests on 14th
While official dates for these visits are being withheld due to political sensitivities, the PTI, which has long opposed the current Pakistani establishment, has announced plans to stage large-scale demonstrations during the visit.
In a tweet posted over the weekend, PTI’s Secretary for Overseas Affairs, Sajjad Burki, called for a protest outside the Pakistan embassy in Washington on June 14, coinciding with the expected presence of senior Pakistani officials in the US capital. “Let the White House know that any deal with this government is not acceptable to the people of Pakistan,” Mr Burki posted, in a message that is also being distributed as pamphlets in Washington’s Pakistani-American neighbourhoods.
 






While the PTI announcement claims that Pakistan’s army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir would visit Washington around the same time, neither the US nor Pakistani officials have confirmed his visit. The ambiguity surrounding his travel plans reflects security concerns and diplomatic caution, especially given the protest plans.
In the wake of last month’s border hostilities, parliamentary delegations from both India and Pakistan visited Washington to present their respective positions. Islamabad has publicly thanked US President Donald Trump for helping arrange a ceasefire and has urged Washington to play a more active role in defusing regional tensions and reviving dialogue on the longstanding Kashmir dispute.

Moreover, the Finance Bill has proposed a tax on social media advertising in Pakistan by foreign e-commerce platforms.
The bill has proposed amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 to add the definitions of e-commerce platforms and “digitally delivered services”.
Under the proposed amendments, e-commerce would include the “sale or purchase of goods and services” through “websites, mobile applications or online marketplaces”.

In a consequential move, govt looks to tax foreign companies for selling goods, running ads in Pakistan

Meanwhile, digitally delivered services would include music, audio and video streaming services, cloud services, online software applications, telemedicine, e-learning, and online banking etc.
As per the proposal, local e-commerce companies will have to pay a tax on every purchase made from their platforms within Pakistan.
For digital payments, a tax rate of 1pc will be charged on payments not exceeding Rs10,000.
For payments between Rs10,000 and Rs20,000, the tax would be 2pc of the gross amount and 0.25pc for over Rs20,000.
If a customer pays for electronic items through cash-on-delivery payments, they will be charged 0.25pc of the gross amount as tax. For clothing items, the rate would be 2pc and 1pc for every other item.
The tax on digital payments will be charged by payment gateways when processing the transactions.
In case of cash on delivery, courier services will collect the amount, inclusive of tax, from customers. As per the law, courier services would include logistics companies, ride-hailing and food delivery platforms and delivery services provided by e-commerce platforms.
New rules for sellers
The bill has also proposed tightening the regulations for online vendors to bring them into the tax net.
“Every online marketplace or courier service … shall not allow any vendor to use its platform services to carry out e-commerce transactions unless such vendors have been registered under the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (VII of 1990) and this Ordinance.”
The provision essentially means that shopkeepers not registered under the Sales Tax Act will not be allowed to sell their goods on online stores.
Foreign vendors
The government has also introduced new taxes on goods purchased online from outside Pakistan.
The new measures, announced by Federal Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in his budget speech, included the promulgation of a new law titled the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025.
It aims to bring online marketplaces that sell to Pakistani customers but have little to no physical presence in the country.
Under section 3 of the proposed law, every foreign vendor with a “significant digital presence in Pakistan” will be charged a tax on goods sold online from outside Pakistan.
Typically, these vendors include online marketplaces such as AliExpress, Temu, and Amazon, among others.
Under the proposed law, customers would be charged 5pc of the amount paid to the vendor for the purchase of goods from a foreign marketplace.
The tax would be collected by banks, financial institutions, or payment gateways that facilitate transactions between customers and the online marketplace.
Customs have been empowered to ensure that goods purchased online from foreign marketplaces are not delivered to customers unless the courier companies provide evidence of tax payment.
Foreign marketplaces will not only have to pay taxes for goods sold to Pakistani customers, but they will also be charged for social media ads run in the country.
As per the proposed law, every foreign vendor who pays “social media platforms or any other online platform for online advertisement in Pakistan” will pay 5pc of the amount paid to social media platforms.
As per the law, payment intermediaries and social media platforms will file quarterly statements on tax deducted and deposited into the government exchequer.
Failure to submit these reports would result in penalties of Rs1 million every quarter.

Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s “Wall Street” — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.
Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.
According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.
I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.
The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.
Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.
CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.
The Sindh government had recently approved a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.
The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.
Fine were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.
Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.
These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p><small>2025-06-10 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/101555182fcd658.jpg?r=160225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916300/former-student-kills-10-people-in-austrian-high-school-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Former student kills 10 people in Austrian high school shooting</strong></a><br><p>A former student killed 10 people when he opened fire at a high school in southeastern Austria on Tuesday before taking his own life, authorities said, in an unprecedented case of deadly gun violence that stunned the Alpine country.
Heavily armed police, a helicopter and paramedics descended on the Dreierschuetzengasse high school in Graz after the 21-year-old lone shooter struck, police said.
Nine victims were immediately confirmed, but a woman died from her wounds in the hospital later, an official said.
Seven of the victims were female and three were male, authorities said without specifying their ages. A 17-year-old French student was among the victims, his father told AFP.
Twelve people suffered severe injuries, and police said support was being provided to witnesses and those affected.
The suspect acted alone and took his own life in the school toilet, police said, adding his motive remained unknown.
Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker declared three days of national mourning to remember the victims, saying the country had witnessed “an act of unimaginable violence”.
According to police, the alleged perpetrator was an Austrian from the Graz region, who used two legally owned weapons.
He was a former student at the high school, but had not finished his studies, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told reporters.
‘Unheard of’
Bouquets of flowers and candles were placed in front of the school, which has around 400 students aged between 14 and 18, as nearby businesses closed.
One resident, originally from the United States, whose children attend a nearby elementary school and kindergarten, told AFP she was “shocked” and it was “a lot to take in” .
“In my home country, it happens more often, as we know, but that it happens here is unheard of,” she said, declining to give her name.
“Graz is a safe city,” said Roman Klug, 55, who said he lived close to the school that he said was “known for its openness and diversity”.
‘Deeply shocked’
After arriving in Graz, Stocker described the shooting as “a national tragedy”, adding that it was “a dark day” for Austria.
Condolences poured in from across Europe.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that “France extends its deepest sympathy to the victims’ families, the Austrian people and Chancellor Stocker during this difficult time.”
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said “our thoughts are with our Austrian friends and neighbours” following the “horrific” shooting.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban offered his “deepest condolences”.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said “the news from Graz touches my heart” while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her sympathies to the families of the victims following the “tragic news”.
Attacks in public are rare in Austria, which is home to almost 9.2 million people and ranks among the 10 safest countries in the world, according to the Global Peace Index.
While still less common than in the United States, Europe in recent years has been shaken by attacks at schools and universities that were not connected to terrorism.
In France today, a teaching assistant was killed in a knife attack at a school in the eastern town of Nogent.
In January, an 18-year-old man fatally stabbed a high school student and a teacher at a school in northeastern Slovakia.
And in December, a 19-year-old man stabbed a seven-year-old student to death and injured several others at a primary school in Zagreb, Croatia.
In December 2023, an attack by a student at a university in central Prague left 14 people dead and 25 injured.
A few months earlier, a 13-year-old gunned down nine fellow classmates and a security guard at an elementary school in Belgrade.</p><small>2025-06-10 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10163840cefc7e9.jpg?r=165306' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916305/pupil-stabs-teaching-assistant-to-death-at-french-school' target='_blank'><strong>Pupil stabs teaching assistant to death at French school</strong></a><br><p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday condemned a “senseless wave of violence” after a teaching assistant stabbed by a 15-year-old pupil outside a school in the east of the country succumbed to her wounds.
The secondary school student was arrested after attacking the 31-year-old assistant with a knife during a bag search in Nogent in eastern France, officials said.
France has, in recent years, seen a series of attacks on teachers and pupils by other schoolchildren.
“While protecting our children, a teaching assistant lost her life, the victim of a senseless wave of violence,” Macron wrote on X, commenting on the latest in a spate of such incidents at French schools. “The nation is in mourning and the government is mobilised to reduce crime.”
 






Education Minister Elisabeth Borne was on her way to Nogent “to support the entire school community and the police”.
“I commend the composure and dedication of those who acted to subdue the attacker and protect the students and staff,” she said on X.
 






The pupil is 15 years old and did not have a criminal record.
The teaching assistant received several knife wounds just as classes were starting and the alleged attacker, who gendarmes overpowered, “appears to be a student at the school”, education officials said.
‘Have had enough’
In March, French police started random searches for knives and other weapons concealed in bags at and around schools.
The teaching assistant was “simply doing her job by welcoming students at the entrance to the school”, said Elisabeth Allain-Moreno, secretary general of the SE-UNSA teachers’ union, expressing “immense pain”.
Allain-Moreno said that the attack “shows that nothing can ever be completely secure and that it is prevention that needs to be focused on”.
Jean-Remi Girard, president of the National Union of Secondary Schools, added: “It’s impossible to be more vigilant 24 hours a day. We can’t say that every student is a danger or a threat, otherwise we’d never get out of bed in the morning.”
French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denounced what she called the “normalisation of extreme violence, encouraged by the apathy of the authorities”.
“Not a week goes by without a tragedy striking a school,” Le Pen said on X. “The French people have had enough and are waiting for a firm, uncompromising and determined political response to the scourge of juvenile violence.”
 






At the end of April, after a fatal attack at a school in Nantes, the education ministry reported that 958 random bag checks in schools had led to the seizure of 94 knives.
After that knife attack, which left one person dead and three injured, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called for “more intensive checks around and inside schools”.</p><small>2025-06-10 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10190611c222e5b.jpg?r=190613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312/iran-says-new-round-of-us-talks-planned-for-sunday' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says new round of US talks planned for Sunday</strong></a><br><p>The sixth round of Iran-US nuclear talks is planned for Sunday, Tehran said as the two sides appear locked in a standoff over uranium enrichment nearly two months into the high-stakes negotiations.
Iran has said it would present a counter-proposal to the latest draft from Washington, criticised by Tehran for failing to offer sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
“The next round of Iran-US indirect talks is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement on Tuesday.
There was no immediate comment from mediator Oman, which has hosted some of the previous rounds, while Washington has said the talks could be held as early as Thursday.
The longtime foes have held five rounds of negotiations since April, the highest level contact since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear accord during his first term.
Trump has said the next meeting was expected on Thursday, although a source familiar with preparations said it would more likely be on Friday or Saturday.
Iran’s top negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, will be attending the annual Oslo Forum in Norway on Thursday, his office said.
On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal for an agreement, which Araghchi has criticised for its “ambiguities”.
Tehran has said the offer failed to include issues raised in previous negotiations including the lifting of sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
On Monday, foreign ministry spokesperson Baqaei said Iran would present a “reasonable, logical and balanced” counter-proposal.
‘National interests’
Trump said that the next round of talks could make it clear if a nuclear deal is possible to avoid military action.
In a key sticking point, Tehran has defended its right to enrich uranium as “non-negotiable”, while Washington called any Iranian enrichment a “red line”.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States and its ally Israel, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
In an interview published on Tuesday, Iranian deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said there was no “deadlock” in the talks, and that the next round would be the first in which the parties discuss “any written material”.
“Any negotiations with an international dimension come with their own sensitivities and require a great deal of patience for them to reach a result,” he told the official IRNA news agency.
“What matters to us is that we can safeguard the national interests of the country through these talks, and that is how we proceed.” In a statement issued on Tuesday, a group of Iranian lawmakers accused the United States of turning the negotiations into a “strategic trap” in coordination with Israel.
They said Washington’s “aim is to impose demands through coercion, adopting positions that are insulting and entirely incompatible with the legitimate rights of the Iranian people.”
‘Less than satisfactory’
On Monday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog began a Board of Governors meeting in Vienna that will last until Friday to discuss Iran’s atomic activities and other issues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency meeting followed a report issued by it criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch foe Israel.
On Tuesday, Araghchi reiterated criticism of a plan by European powers and the United States to adopt a resolution at the IAEA meeting that would accuse Tehran of non-compliance with nuclear obligations.
“Any ill-considered and destructive decision in the Board of Governors against Iran will be met with an appropriate response,” Araghchi said during a phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.
Iran has said it would reduce cooperation with the IAEA if the resolution passed.
On Saturday, Tehran announced it had obtained a trove of Israeli intelligence in a covert operation, including files related to Israel’s undeclared nuclear facilities and defence plans.
 
 

It said the information would enable Iranian forces to launch counterattacks should Israel strike the Islamic republic.
Israel — an undeclared nuclear power — has repeatedly threatened that it could attack Iranian nuclear sites in warnings that have escalated since Tehran and Washington began talks.</p><small>2025-06-10 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10134820954a100.jpg?r=134939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916285/dont-let-them-silence-you-says-aseefa-on-sana-yousaf-murder' target='_blank'><strong>Don’t let them silence you, says Aseefa on Sana Yousaf murder</strong></a><br><p>First Lady and MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari has condemned the murder of teenage social media influencer Sana Yousaf in Islamabad, who was gunned down on the eve of her 17th birthday last week, saying that the incident should not silence girls and discourage from trying to achieve their dreams.
Sana Yousaf was shot dead at her residence in Sector G-13 in the presence of her mother and aunt by an unidentified man who fled the scene. Police arrested the suspect Omar Hayat within a few hours who police claimed murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances.
Inspector General Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said the suspect was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. A local court approved a 14-day judicial remand of the prime suspect to facilitate his identification parade.
Calling it a stark reminder of the violence women and girls face simply for asserting their rights, Aseefa extended her condolences to Sana’s family, the community in Chitral, and all those grieving this senseless loss.
“Sana was just a girl—with ambition, with dreams, with a life ahead of her,” Aseefa said in a statement. “She had every right to live freely and safely. What happened to her wasn’t just an act of violence — it was a punishment for saying no. And that should horrify every one of us.”
She highlighted that violence stemming from male entitlement is neither new nor rare—and must no longer be tolerated under the guise of culture or tradition.
“This mindset that a woman’s rejection is an insult, that her choices need to be controlled—it’s old, it’s cruel, and it’s killing our daughters. My mother, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, broke those walls with her own strength. She didn’t just lead—she opened doors for millions of women to follow. And we owe it to her legacy, and to young women like Sana, to keep those doors open.”
Addressing the wave of online abuse directed at Sana after her death, Aseefa rejected the idea that social media use or self-expression could ever be used to justify violence.
“There is nothing—no app, no photo, no video—that excuses murder. It’s disturbing to see people using Sana’s TikTok presence to explain away her death. If that’s the logic, are we saying millions of girls across Pakistan are also at risk? This kind of thinking is not just dangerous—it’s inhumane.”
She closed with a message of solidarity and defiance to young women across the country.
“To every girl watching this unfold—don’t let them silence you. You have the right to dream, to speak, to exist without fear. Don’t back down. If you do, they win. But if we keep pushing forward—together—we’ll shape a country where girls aren’t blamed for their own deaths, but celebrated for their lives.”
Teenager Sana Yousaf was well-known for her social media activities, with nearly 800,000 followers on her TikTok account and almost 500,000 on her Instagram account.</p><small>2025-06-10 08:16</small></div><hr>
