PTV, defending champions in the President’s Trophy, shot Sui Northern Gas (SNGPL) for a paltry 37 to win the match by a mere two runs on day three of the four-day game.
This becomes a new record in 253 years of first-class cricket, beating England’s Oldfield’s 1794 feat when they successfully defended 41 against MCC at the Lord’s Old Ground to win by six runs.







PTV’s head coach Mohammad Waseem praised his team’s historic effort.
“I am delighted with my team’s world record effort,” Waseem told AFP. “My team’s motto is to never give up, fight till the last ball,” he said.
“This is not the first time we have won all our three matches coming from well behind by remaining positive in all situations.”
The star-studded SNGPL batting led by Pakistan Test captain Shan Masood were bowled out in 19.4 overs with just one batter, Saifullah Bangash, crossing double figures with 14.
Masood was out without scoring while Test players, Mohammad Ali made six and spinner Sajid Khan just three.
Pakistan’s international players Omair Bin Yousuf made six and Abdul Samad five.
For the winners, left-arm spinner Ali Usman wrecked the batting with 6-9 and pacer Ammad Butt took 4-28 - the only two bowlers used in their second innings innings.
SNGPL’s head coach is former Pakistan Test skipper Misbahul Haq with another former captain Azhar Ali their batting coach.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar lauded the PTV team for their record win, saying: “Well done my boys! Kudos to you.”







“PTV’s rise is no coincidence,” he said, adding that “this is what happens when talent is backed, hard work is valued, and merit is rewarded”.
Tarar noted the previous as well as current success of the team was due to the importance of merit and refusal of favours. “Merit and only merit. Have refused all sifarish,” he said.
He said it was a proud moment for the entire PTV management.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1718270443769f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967495/no-handshake-between-india-bangladesh-at-toss-during-u-19-world-cup-match' target='_blank'><strong>No handshake between India, Bangladesh at toss during U-19 World Cup match</strong></a><br><p>Tensions between India and Bangladesh were apparent on Saturday as the two sides skipped the customary handshake between the captains during the toss of a U-19 World Cup match in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.
Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.







Dhaka-based Prothom Alo reported that it was “unclear which team’s decision it was to not follow the handshake tradition”.
It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a military conflict between the two countries.
Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has announced that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.
Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.
Subsequently, Bangladesh “formally requested” the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.
Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171757243da7749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967496/social-media-posts-case-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-imaan-hadi-reissued' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Non-bailable arrest warrants for Imaan, Hadi reissued</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A district and sessions court on Saturday reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, for their repeated absences from trial proceedings.
In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Court proceedings on Saturday were conducted over three sittings — 9am, noon and 2pm. At each stage, Imaan and Hadi were absent from the proceedings.
In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka — presiding over the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Court (Islamabad-West) — noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest.
At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad High Court.
The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused.
Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants.
The court ordered that once Imaan and Hadi were arrested, they could be produced via video link to join proceedings on Monday.
On Thursday, the same court had cancelled Imaan and Hadi’s bail following repeated absences and heated scenes in the courtroom.
The court had expressed displeasure over the conduct of the accused and the defence, revoked their right to cross-examination, and ordered that their statements under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) be recorded.
The prosecution, led by Special Public Prosecutor Rana Usman, had opposed adjournments, while the courtroom proceedings had been disrupted by a heated exchange between the prosecutor and Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, prompting the judge to briefly rise from the bench.
The case will now be taken up on Monday, subject to the execution of the arrest warrants.
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171639590f69121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967489/irans-khamenei-says-trump-guilty-for-the-casualties-in-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Khamenei says Trump ‘guilty for the casualties’ in protests</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for “casualties” during a protest wave in the country that rights groups said was met with a deadly crackdown.
“We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,” he told a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday.
“This was an American conspiracy,” Khamenei said, adding that “America’s goal is to swallow Iran … the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination”.
“By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition,” he said.
“We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals,” he added, saying that “international criminals” were “worse” and would also not be spared punishment.
Iranian authorities have blamed the United States for fuelling a “terrorist operation” that they say hijacked peaceful protests over the economy.
Iran was rocked by weeks of demonstrations sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic republic in more than three years.
Meanwhile, after repeated warnings, Trump on Thursday had changed his stance on military intervention in Iran, adopting a “watch it and see” posture instead.
He had cited assurances from “very important sources on the other side” indicating that Tehran had ceased using lethal force against demonstrators.
“They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” Trump said. Asked by a reporter if US military action was now off the table, the president replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.”</p><small>2026-01-17 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171644183f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967486/institutionalised-islamophobia-pakistan-condemns-profiling-of-mosques-in-occupied-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>‘Institutionalised Islamophobia’: Pakistan condemns profiling of mosques in occupied Kashmir</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday condemned the reported profiling of mosques and mosque management committees in India-occupied Kashmir, saying the “blatant intrusion into religious affairs constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief”.
The FO’s statement comes after police in the occupied valley distributed forms to “collect” financial and personal details of mosques and seminaries, including mosque leaders and members of management committees, according to a report by the Hindustan Times, which quoted local residents and Kashmiri leaders.







The action “reflects yet another coercive attempt to intimidate and marginalise the Muslim population of the occupied territory,” the FO said.
The forms included sections for seminary teachers and mosque leaders to provide details of their “Aadhaar cards, bank accounts, property ownership, social media handles, passport, ration card, driving licence, SIM cards and mobile phone model along with the IMEI”, the Hindustan Times reported. It added that details regarding the “religious sect” of the mosques were also sought.
A lawmaker from Srinagar called it “an infringement of the religious freedom guaranteed under the Indian Constitution,” saying the move aimed to “control religion and mosques”, the report said.
In the statement released on Saturday, the FO said, “The forcible collection of personal details, photographs and sectarian affiliations of religious functionaries amounts to systematic harassment, aimed at instilling fear among worshippers and obstructing the free exercise of their faith.
“These actions form part of a broader pattern of institutionalised Islamophobia driven by the Hindutva ideology of the occupying Indian government,” said the statement, adding the “selective targeting of mosques and Muslim clergy lays bare the discriminatory and communal character of these policies”.
The FO maintained that the “people of Jammu and Kashmir possess an inalienable right to practice their religion without fear, coercion or discrimination”.
“Pakistan will continue to stand in solidarity with them and will persist in raising its voice against all forms of religious persecution and intolerance targeting Kashmiris,” said the statement.
In November, United Nations experts sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p><small>2026-01-17 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171838352b516f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967493/thousands-join-anti-trump-hands-off-greenland-protests-in-denmark' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands join anti-Trump ‘Hands off Greenland’ protests in Denmark</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Denmark’s capital on Saturday to protest at US President Donald Trump’s push to take over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.
The protest followed Trump’s warning on Friday that he “may put a tariff” on countries that oppose his plans to take over mineral-rich Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.
They also coincided with a visit to Copenhagen by a bipartisan delegation from the US Congress that has made clear the opposition of many Americans to the Trump administration’s sabre-rattling.
Waving the flags of Denmark and Greenland, the protesters formed a sea of red and white outside Copenhagen city hall, chanting “Kalaallit Nunaat!” — the vast Arctic island’s name in Greenlandic.

Thousands of people had said on social media they would take part in marches and rallies organised by Greenlandic associations in Copenhagen, and in Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense and the Greenlandic capital Nuuk.
“The aim is to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland’s democracy and fundamental human rights,” Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, said on its website.
A sister demonstration was scheduled to happen in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, at 3pm GMT (8pm PKT) to protest the US’s “illegal plans to take control of Greenland”, organisers said. Demonstrators would march to the US consulate carrying Greenlandic flags.
The Copenhagen rally, which began at 12pm (4pm PKT), was due to make a stop outside the US embassy in the Danish capital.

‘Demand respect’
“Recent events have put Greenland and Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark under pressure,” Uagut chairwoman Julie Rademacher said in a statement to AFP, calling for “unity”.
“When tensions rise and people go into a state of alarm, we risk creating more problems than solutions for ourselves and for each other. We appeal to Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark to stand together,” she said.
The demonstration in Greenland was “to show that we are taking action, that we stand together and that we support our politicians, diplomats and partners,” Kristian Johansen, one of the organisers, said in a statement.

“We demand respect for our country’s right to self-determination and for us as a people,” added Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, another organiser.
“We demand respect for international law and international legal principles. This is not only our struggle, [but] it is a struggle that concerns the entire world.”
According to the latest poll published in January 2025, 85 per cent of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the United States. Only six per cent were in favour.
‘No security threat’
Speaking in Copenhagen, where the Congressional delegation met top Danish and Greenlandic politicians and business leaders, US Democratic Senator Chris Coons insisted there was no security threat to Greenland to justify the Trump administration’s stance.
He was responding after Trump advisor Stephen Miller claimed on Fox News that Denmark was too small to defend its sovereign Arctic territory.
“There are no pressing security threats to Greenland, but we share real concern about Arctic security going forward, as the climate changes, as the sea ice retreats, as shipping routes change,” Coons told the press.

“There are legitimate reasons for us to explore ways to invest better in Arctic security broadly, both in the American Arctic and in our Nato partners and allies,” said Coons, who is leading the US delegation.
Trump has repeatedly criticised Denmark — a Nato ally — for, in his view, not doing enough to ensure Greenland’s security.
The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland — as part of Denmark — being covered by Nato’s security umbrella.

European Nato members are deploying troops in Greenland for a military exercise designed to show the world, including the United States, that they will “defend (their) sovereignty”, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said this week.
Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced they are sending small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic.
The US has been invited to participate in the exercise, Denmark said on Friday.

In Sargodha, six children were among 14 dead, while nine others were injured in the early hours of Saturday when a truck carrying cargo and passengers fell into a canal from the Galapur Bangla bridge due to fog, said Rescue 1122.
According to Punjab Rescue 1122 officials, the truck was travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad with 23 people on board for a funeral when the unfortunate incident took place.
“Due to heavy fog, the motorway was closed, so the vehicle took a local route. In the area of Kot Momin tehsil, the truck fell from the Galapur bridge into the canal,” said a statement from Rescue 1122, adding that the truck “lost control because of poor visibility”.
The Rescue 1122 statement added that the canal was dry, but passengers were stuck beneath the truck when it overturned.
The injured were provided first aid on site and were then taken to Civil Hospital Kot Momin, along with the bodies. Three of the injured were later shifted to Kot Momin Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
“The incident was reported at 1:48am on January 17, 2026, after which rescue operations were launched immediately,” said the statement.
Dense fog often paralyses traffic on Punjab’s motorways and major thoroughfares during the winter months.
Earlier in the day, different sections of motorways, including the M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4 and M-11 were closed due to dense fog, according to the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP).







On Tuesday, 10 people died and 21 were injured in multiple fog-related accidents across Punjab.
Four lost their lives in a collision between a bus, a car and a motorcycle in Toba Tek Singh; three were killed when a car and a truck collided near Bhaban on the Indus Highway; three died in two separate accidents in Okara; and seven were critically injured in a multi-vehicle accident in Gujrat.
In early December, reduced visibility due to fog resulted in the collision of six trailer trucks on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5), leaving seven people injured.
10 dead, over dozen injured in Makran Coastal Highway accident
Separately, 10 people died and over a dozen were injured when a speeding passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway at Hudd Goth near Gwadar’s Ormara tehsil.
In an update, the Edhi rescue service said 10 individuals, including a girl, had died in the accident.
It added that an Edhi mobile morgue had been sent to Ormara to bring the bodies to Karachi.
The coach was heading to Jiwani from Karachi, according to Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police (SP) Aslam Bangulzai. Earlier in the day, the officer had said nine people died and 14 others were wounded in the accident.
He added that the deceased hailed from various parts of Sindh and were going to Jiwani for labour.
SP Bangulzai said the bodies and the injured were initially taken to PNS Darman Jah Hospital in Ormara.



Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti held a telephone conversation with Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah to discuss the accident, his office said on X.
They exchanged details regarding the condition of the injured passengers and the medical treatment being provided to them.
The statement added that on the directives of CM Bugti, critically injured passengers were being airlifted to private hospitals in Karachi for advanced medical care.
The chief minister instructed Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Naqeebullah Khan and other relevant authorities to ensure the “immediate shifting of the injured and timely completion of all administrative arrangements”.
DC Naqeebullah was quoted as saying that all passengers injured in the accident hailed from Sindh.







Condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed their deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the Sargodha and Ormara accidents, Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari offered condolences to the families of the deceased and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
He stressed that changing weather conditions were an undeniable reality and exercising caution while travelling was essential.
Affirming that safeguarding human lives was the state’s foremost priority, the president instructed provincial governments to enhance public awareness on safe driving.







In his statement, PM Shehbaz prayed for the deceased and directed the authorities concerned to provide the best treatment to the wounded.
He also instructed the authorities to ensure the implementation of traffic laws and safety measures on national highways.
The premier ordered strict monitoring of precautionary measures in view of dense fog to prevent any unfortunate incidents.







Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif also expressed her deep grief over the loss of precious human lives in the Sargodha truck accident, APP reported.
She emphasised the need for timely rescue and relief operations to support the victims’ families and mitigate the impact of the incident.
CM Maryam directed the commissioner to submit a detailed report on the circumstances leading to the accident and the measures taken for assistance.
She also urged authorities to ensure strict safety protocols on roads and near water channels to prevent such tragic incidents in the future.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
Earlier this month, five passengers lost their lives while 24 others sustained injuries after a bus plunged into a ravine in Punjab’s Talagang district when the driver opted for an alternative route.
On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus carrying players of a university and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road near the Adda Faqeer Di Kulli area.
According to Rescue 1122, the police and the district administration, the accident occurred due to speeding by both vehicles when one was overtaking while the other was crossing a sugarcane-laden tractor trolley.
Following the incident, four officials of the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) were suspended for failing to stop the overspeeding vehicles.</p><small>2026-01-17 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17171745f7f460b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967494/turkiyes-erdogan-egypts-sisi-receive-invitations-from-trump-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Turkiye’s Erdogan, Egypt’s Sisi receive invitations from Trump to join Gaza ‘Board of Peace’</strong></a><br><p>Turkiye and Egypt announced on Saturday that US President Donald Trump had invited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to join the Gaza ‘Board of Peace’.
The board is set to supervise the temporary governance of Gaza, which has been under a fragile ceasefire since October.
The White House said on Friday it had formed an executive panel tasked with implementing Trump’s Gaza peace plan, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, World Bank President Ajay Banga, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
The panel will supervise portfolios ranging from governance and regional diplomacy to reconstruction financing and investment mobilisation.
On Saturday, the Turkish presidency stated that it had received a letter from Trump, inviting Erdogan to join the panel.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian foreign minister said during a press conference that Trump’s invitation was being reviewed.
Separately, former UK prime minister Blair said on Saturday he was “honoured” to be tapped by Trump to help rebuild Gaza.
“I thank President Trump for his leadership in establishing the Board of Peace and am honoured to be appointed to its Executive Board,” the veteran politician and former UN quartet Middle East envoy said in a statement sent to AFP.
According to the White House statement, the broader ‘Board of Peace’ will provide strategic oversight, coordinate international resources, and ensure accountability during Gaza’s transition from conflict to development.
The US also plans to deploy an international stabilisation force and appoint a high representative to coordinate governance, security and reconstruction efforts in Gaza under the transitional framework.
The announcement came amid continuing tensions on the ground, with Hamas still refusing to disarm and yet to return the remains of the final hostage — a key requirement of the first phase.
Although the ceasefire achieved in October has reduced large-scale hostilities, it has been punctuated by sporadic clashes and airstrikes, leaving the outlook for lasting peace uncertain.</p><small>2026-01-17 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171712072bf5af5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967488/pakistan-us-agree-to-enhance-collaboration-in-security-border-management' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US agree to enhance collaboration in security, border management</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and the United States on Saturday agreed to enhance collaboration in bilateral security and border management.
The agreement was reached as Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held a meeting with a high-level US delegation led by US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker.
The meeting featured in-depth deliberation on boosting relations between the two countries and expanding cooperation in shared areas of interest.
It was mutually agreed to further strengthen existing cooperation with the US Anti-terrorism Assistance Programme and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
During the meeting, matters relating to the establishment of a centre for crime and an academy within the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) with US support also came under review.
The delegation also discussed training programmes for officers of the FIA, Federal Constabulary and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
‎It was also agreed that border security agencies, coastal guards and other institutions would be equipped with modern US-supplied equipment.
Naqvi stated that modern technology would enhance the capacity of border security agencies and coastal guards.
He also welcomed US assistance in the reorganisation of the Federal Constabulary and in strengthening the capabilities of the FIA and the NCCIA. He added that US support in activating FIA’s counterterrorism wing would prove highly beneficial, making it the first federal anti-terrorist wing with effective coordination with provinces.
‎Naqvi said that the NCCIA was carrying out an extensive crackdown on illegal call centres across the country. He noted that advanced software was vital for preventing financial fraud and terror financing, and US cooperation with the NCCIA in this regard was highly significant.
The minister emphasised the need to further expand collaboration with Pakistani institutions. Meanwhile, the US delegation appreciated Pakistan’s efforts to increase security cooperation and strengthen bilateral ties.
Baker acknowledged the ongoing collaboration between the Ministry of Interior and US agencies at various levels and reaffirmed that efforts would continue to further enhance the partnership with Pakistan.</p><small>2026-01-17 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17122900170576e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967481/police-submit-report-on-basant-security-plan-in-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Police submit report on Basant security plan in LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police on Saturday submitted a report in the Lahore High Court (LHC) detailing the security plan for the upcoming three-day Basant festival.
Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, that ended a suspension of the festival after almost two decades.
The report identified areas of concern for the 2026 festival, based on data from the last decade, and urged full implementation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
It stated that registration of every kite and spool of string is mandatory through a QR code and there would be zero tolerance for glass, chemical-coated, or metallic wire.
According to the report, Lahore has been divided into red, yellow, and green zones, while officials will continuously monitor kite-flying activities through drones, social media, and control rooms.
It also warned that strict action will be taken against aerial firing, drinking, and illegal activities on rooftops.
The report stated that it would be mandatory for motorcycle riders to wear a helmet and prohibited their entry into red zones without a safety antenna installed.
On January 6, the LHC sought reports from the Inspector General of Police and the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) regarding security and safety arrangements being taken for the festival.
Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel (JAP) through Advocate Azhar Siddique questioning the alleged failure of the government and the police to make security arrangements for Basant under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171259198d1e77c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967483/nobel-prize-inseparable-from-winner-but-medal-can-be-given-away-award-body-says' target='_blank'><strong>Nobel Prize inseparable from winner but medal can be given away, award body says</strong></a><br><p>The Nobel Peace Prize remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation that won it, though the medal can be given away, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday, a day after last year’s winner gave her medal to US President Donald Trump.
Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her medal on Thursday to Trump, who thanked her for it. The White House released a photo of Trump and Machado, with Trump holding up a gold-coloured frame displaying it, and a White House official said Trump intends to keep it.
Machado’s award also consists of a diploma and 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.19 million).
“Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,” the award body said in a statement.







“There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items,” it added.
‘Inseparably linked’
The medal and the diploma are physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the prize, said the five-strong award committee.
“The prize itself the honour and recognition remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee,” it said.
The committee, which did not refer to Trump and Machado by name in its statement, said it does not comment on a laureate’s statements, decisions or actions after the prize is announced.
It was not the first time a Nobel laureate has given away the medal. In 1943 Nobel literature laureate Knut Hamsun gave his to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
In 2022, Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov sold his medal for $100 million to raise money for the UN children’s fund UNICEF to help Ukrainian refugee children.
In 2024, the widow of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan donated his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma to the UN office in Geneva.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17125156a904b38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967482/un-biodiversity-treaty-enters-into-force-aims-to-protect-30pc-of-oceans-by-2030' target='_blank'><strong>UN biodiversity treaty enters into force, aims to protect 30pc of oceans by 2030</strong></a><br><p>A landmark global treaty to safeguard biodiversity in the high seas came into effect on Saturday, providing countries with a legally binding framework to tackle threats such as overfishing and meet a target to protect 30 per cent of the ocean environment by 2030.
The United Nations treaty, also known as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), was finalised in March 2023 after 15 years of negotiations, and will allow the creation of a global network of “marine protected areas” in vast and previously unregulated ocean ecosystems lying in international waters.
“It’s two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it’s half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime,” said Adam McCarthy, first assistant secretary at the Australian foreign ministry and a co-chair of the treaty’s preparatory committee, speaking at a media briefing.
The treaty reached the threshold of 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, meaning that it would go formally into operation within 120 days. The number of ratifications has since risen to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan adding their names to the list.
Others, including Britain and Australia, are expected to follow soon. The United States signed the treaty during the previous administration but has not yet ratified it.

 

“Whilst we only needed 60 for it to enter into force, obviously it’s really critical for its implementation and for it to be as effective as possible for us to achieve global or universal ratification of the treaty,” said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups.
“We’re really aiming for all UN member states to ratify the treaty.”
Under the treaty, countries must conduct environmental assessments of activities that have an impact on ocean ecology. It will also create mechanisms allowing nations to share the spoils of the “blue economy”, including “marine genetic resources” used in industries such as biotechnology.
Environmentalists say more than 190,000 protected areas would need to be established in order to meet the “30 by 30” target to bring 30pc of the oceans under formal protection by 2030. Currently, only about 8pc — or 29 million square kilometres — is protected.
But the treaty will have little impact on what some conservationists identify as one of the greatest threats facing the marine environment — the clamour to extract mineral resources from the ocean bed.
“BBNJ is very ambitious but there are certain defined limits,” McCarthy said.
“The question of mining in the substrate or in the seabed simply belongs to the ISA (International Seabed Authority). It’s not something where the BBNJ gets a role.”</p><small>2026-01-17 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171150056266a8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967480/dar-expresses-hope-for-peace-stability-in-iran-in-phone-call-with-araghchi-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Dar expresses hope for peace, stability in Iran in phone call with Araghchi: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
According to a post by the FO on X, Dar spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a phone call in which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region.
Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added.







On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country.
Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran.
Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.</p><small>2026-01-17 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17082011ea4305b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967434/number-of-special-economic-zones-surges-to-44-under-cpec-20' target='_blank'><strong>Number of special economic zones surges to 44 under CPEC 2.0</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The number of approved special economic zones has surged dramatically from seven to 44 in the second phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), including notification of 37 new SEZs through coordinated efforts led by the Board of Investment (BoI).
The increase in approval rate was revealed on Friday during a briefing on Pakistan’s engagement with China under the second phase of CPEC, with particular focus on SEZ-led industrialisation and Pakistan-China business-to-business (B2B) cooperation, which form the backbone of the upgraded CPEC framework.
The BoI serves as the lead Pakistani agency for the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Industrial Cooperation, with China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) as the counterpart lead agency. Since its inception, Project Management Unit of the CPEC-Industrial Cooperation Development Project (PMU CPEC-ICDP) has played a pivotal role in revitalising Pakistan’s SEZ framework.
Minister for Board of Investment, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, visited to the Project Management Unit of the CPEC Industrial Cooperation Development Project (PMU CPEC-ICDP) at the Board of Investment, Islamabad, to review progress on industrial cooperation and the development of SEZs under CPEC Phase-II.
Key achievements highlighted during the briefing included progress on the Karachi Industrial Park (KIP), development initiatives for the Gilgit-Baltistan SEZ, and the approval of the Land Lease Policy for Bin Qasim Industrial Park (BQIP), which has addressed a longstanding structural bottleneck for investors.
The minister was also informed of BoI’s facilitation in ensuring the provision of utilities to SEZs, enabling their transition from planning stages to operational readiness.
It was explained during the briefing that the long-term plan for CPEC Industrial Cooperation has been finalised and it is being implemented through a structured Action Plan aligned with the transition towards CPEC, dubbed ‘CPEC Phase 2.0’, emphasising industry-led growth, export-oriented manufacturing, technology transfer, and value addition, with SEZs serving as anchor platforms.
The alignment of CPEC Industrial Cooperation with the government’s “Uraan Pakistan” 5Es Framework was also highlighted, particularly in advancing exports, enhancing competitiveness, and promoting sustainable economic development through joint-venture-based industrialisation.
Mr Sheikh was further informed that 2026 will mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, and that PMU CPEC-ICDP has planned a series of commemorative and investment-focused initiatives during the year to further deepen bilateral industrial cooperation.
The BOI reaffirmed its strong commitment to proactive investor facilitation, policy coordination, and effective implementation of the second phase of CPEC industrial cooperation initiatives, and it will continue to work closely with all federal and provincial stakeholders to ensure a predictable, transparent, and investor-friendly environment for domestic and foreign investors.
The briefing underscored BOI’s structured approach to investment promotion and investor outreach, particularly with Chinese enterprises.

The top three districts for arrest and detention between Jan 1 and 10 were Chaghi, Pishin and Islamabad Capital Territory.
The latest ‘Flash Update’ jointly released by UN refugee agency, UNHCR, and UN Migration office, IOM, says from January 4 to 10, 73 per cent of the total reported arrests and detentions took place in Balochistan and 16 per cent in Islamabad Capital Territory.
Of all arrests and detentions of Afghan nationals during the period, Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders and undocumented Afghans represented 87 per cent of the total arrest and detentions while Proof of Reg­istration (PoR) card holders represented 13 per cent.
The data released by UNHCR and IOM shows that a total of 130,999 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained from September 15 to January 10, 2026. Most arrests took place in Balochistan with 68 per cent arrests, followed by Islamabad (19pc), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (6pc), Punjab (4 per cent) and Sindh (3 per cent). Data on the number of arrests by provinces shows the highest number of arrests were made in Balochistan (1489) followed by Islamabad (423), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (127), Punjab (86), and Sindh (75).

Report says 130,999 Afghans arrested, detained from Sept 15 to Jan 10

In 2025, the government issued several directives impacting Afghan nationals, and in January 2025, it announced that Afghan nationals should relocate from Islamabad Capital Territory and Rawalpindi, or face deportation.
In April, further announcements indicated the implementation of the second phase of the “Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan”, targeting ACC holders, in addition to undocumented Afghans.
In July, the government issued a Statutory Regulation Order (SRO) directing the repatriation/deportation of PoR card holders following the expiry of PoR card validity on June 30.
The government later issued a deadline of September 1 for PoR holders to leave Pakistan, before the start of the repatriation and deportation process.
A report of IOM on ‘Returnee Inflow from Pakistan’ says returnee inflows decreased from Pakistan by 17pc from December 21 to January 3, averaging 2683 individuals per day.
Despite the overall decrease in returnees from Pakistan, Afghans’ return through the Torkham border crossing point increased by 8pc compared to the last reporting period.

 

A situation analysis by International Federation of Red Crescent (IFRC) says since the beginning of 2025 until the end of November, Afghanistan has witnessed the return of over 5.2 million refugees (deportees and returnees) from Iran and Pakistan, an unprecedented movement, that has further strained a country already grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis.
More than 3.6 million Afghans have returned from Iran alone, of which 1.2 million were deported. The bulk of returns began after April 1, highlighting the intensity of recent developments in both host countries.
According to Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) data, the highest daily influx was recorded in November 2025. Most Afghan returnees cross through the official crossing points of Torkham (Nangarhar) and Spin Boldak (Kandahar), with smaller flows obse­rved at Angur Ada (Paktika) and via unofficial routes in Helmand.

According to a statement issued by the US Central Command (Centcom), American and Pakistani troops this week concluded joint training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center in Pabbi.
“This week, US and Pakistan Army Soldiers completed training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center during Exercise Inspired Gambit, which focused on combined infantry skills and tactics, and counterterrorism operations. Training exercises like this between the US and Pakistan strengthen our long-standing defense ties,” the statement said.







The exercise comes amid broader signs of re-engagement between the two defence establishments. In December, the United States approved the sale of advanced technology and upgrade packages for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter aircraft, a deal valued at approximately $686 million. The approval followed regional tensions after Pakistan and India fought a brief but intense five-day conflict in May 2025.
Pakistan is believed to operate 70 to 80 F-16s, including upgraded Block-15 aircraft, former Jordanian jets, and newer Block-52+ models. US officials have long described the F-16 programme as a cornerstone of bilateral military cooperation.
Political signaling from Washington has also drawn attention. President Trump has repeatedly praised Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, referring to him publicly as his “favourite field marshal”.
In a year-end news briefing on December 31, Trump said that Pakistani leaders had credited him with preventing a wider catastrophe following the India-Pakistan conflict.
“The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more,” Trump said.
During the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit on the Middle East in October 2025. Trump also acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was standing behind him, before again referring to Munir.
These remarks marked at least the tenth instance since June that Trump, who returned to the White House in January for a second term, publicly praised Pakistan’s army chief.
In June 2025, Trump hosted Field Marshal Munir at the White House for a lunch meeting — the first time a sitting US president formally received the head of Pakistan’s army. The meeting took place amid worsening disagreement with India over Trump’s repeated claim that he personally halted the May conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Analysts say Washington’s renewed focus on the Middle East, particularly Gaza and Iran, combined with the performance of Pakistan’s air force during the May conflict with India, encouraged the United States to improve its ties with Pakistan’s defence establishment.
Pakistan has also signalled its willingness to participate in a US-led international stabilisation force for Gaza, a controversial proposal advanced by Trump, further underlining Islamabad’s interest in closer security cooperation.
Pakistan was once a key US ally and was designated a major non-NATO ally following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Relations frayed in subsequent years, as US officials accused Islamabad of duplicity during the US-led war on terror.
But early in his second term, Trump struck a markedly different tone. Addressing a joint session of Congress in March, he publicly thanked Pakistan for arresting one of the alleged perpetrators of the Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport in August 2021, which killed 13 US service members.
Recent military exercises, arms sales and high-level engagement suggest that defence ties between Washington and Islamabad are entering a new, more pragmatic phase.</p><small>2026-01-17 03:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17081506e294c2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967432/imaan-hadi-challenge-arrest-orders-after-judge-demands-their-production' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan, Hadi challenge arrest orders after judge demands their production</strong></a><br><p>• Petition argues trial court unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued warrants without meeting mandatory legal requirements• Additional district & sessions judge orders FIA, police officials to arrest them ‘within 24 hours’
ISLAMABAD: Lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, on Friday challenged their arrest orders in a case linked to controversial social media posts.
In a petition filed before the Islamabad High Court, they argued that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production.
The petition challenged the trial court’s January 15 order as legally unsustainable and requested the IHC to declare the arrest warrants null and void and restrain the authorities from arresting the petitioners.
Earlier in the day, a district and sessions court once again ordered their arrest within 24 hours in the same case.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, who was hearing the matter, warned of contempt proceedings in case of non-compliance.
The court also expressed strong displeasure over the failure of the police and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to execute earlier arrest warrants.
During the hearing, an NCCIA prosecutor appeared before the court. Judge Majoka repeatedly questioned the authorities over the non-appearance of the accused, asking why Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha had not been arrested and produced before the court. “Where are the accused and why were they not produced?” the judge remarked, summoning the DIG Islamabad Police and FIA officials to explain the delay.
The public prosecutor submitted replies under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code on behalf of the accused during the proceedings.
After a brief recess, DIG Islamabad Police Jawad Tariq appeared before the court. Expressing anger, Judge Majoka questioned the credibility of law enforcement agencies, stating that the non-execution of warrants in Islamabad raised serious concerns. He directed the DIG to arrest the accused “from anywhere — whether in Pakistan, India or Afghanistan,” adding that they could be “at sea or in the air” but must be apprehended within 24 hours.
The DIG assured the court that the war­­rants would be executed. The judge stated that the warrants would be handed over by 10am and warned that failure to comply would result in contempt of court proceedings.
Later, the NCCIA director also appeared before the court and informed it that a four-member team had been formed to arrest the accused, but they were not found at their stated addresses and were allegedly deliberately hiding. Judge Majoka questioned how arrests could not be made in Islamabad if the accused were present in the city and ordered that a senior officer ensure execution of the warrants.
The court directed that no police officer below the rank of SP and no NCCIA official below the rank of deputy director be assigned the task. Fresh arrest warrants were issued, with orders to arrest the accused and produce them before the court via video link. The hearing was adjourned till Saturday (today).
In a written order issued later, the court observed that the accused had deliberately absconded to evade arrest and granted law enforcement authorities 24 hours to comply with its directions.

MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday moved to mediate the escalating crisis involving Iran on Friday, holding separate telephone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in an effort to “quickly de-escalate tensions”.
The Kremlin stated that Putin during both phone calls expressed Moscow’s willingness to “continue its mediation efforts and to promote constructive dialogue with the participation of all interested states”.
Pezeshkian briefed Putin on Tehran’s efforts to stabilise the situation, blaming the US and Israel for fomenting unrest.
The two men confirmed their commitment to a 20-year strategic partnership agreement signed last year, which includes joint economic projects, it added.
Meanwhile, fears of an immediate US attack have retreated slightly since President Donald Trump noted killings were easing, however, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted the president was keeping “all of his options on the table”.
The US has redirected an aircraft carrier and its strike group toward Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln is carrying fighter jets, guided missile destroyers and at least one attack submarine. The Israeli spy chief was also expected to meet White House envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday.
On the ground in Iran, a deadly state crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests for now. While state media reported more arrests on Friday, residents in Tehran noted the capital had been quiet since Sunday.
Munich conference scraps invite
Amid the crackdown, the Munich Security Conference withdrew its invitation to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi for its upcoming forum.
“In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations,” organisers said in a statement. Diplomatic reactions varied globally. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) condemned external interference and blamed Western economic pressure for the instability.
On the other hand, Pakistan urged the UN Security Council to uphold international law regarding non-interference. Ambassador Asim Ahmad, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, warned that unilateral actions would only deepen the crisis. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure,” Ahmad said, calling Iran a “brotherly country” and urging all parties to resolve differences through peaceful means.
Starlink behind the scenes
Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service has emerged as a primary tool for Iranian dissidents to bypass state-imposed internet blackouts following a violent crackdown on protests, according to activists and researchers.
The network, which uses thousands of low-orbit satellites to beam internet to terminals the size of a pizza box, has become a crucial lifeline for demonstrators.
Digital rights groups estimate 50,000 terminals have been smuggled into Iran, defying a law that bans the unlicensed technology. As Iran attributes the country’s tensions to foreign involvement, the extensive scale of this Starlink network implies that it may be receiving sophisticated external support.
Given the difficulty of transporting large quantities of restricted hardware across Iran’s tightly controlled borders, the logistics mirror the capabilities of foreign intelligence services; however, no official link has been con­fi­rmed.

Canadian PM Mark Carney shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the People’s Great Hall in Beijing.—Reuters

BEIJING: Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a raft of measures from trade to tourism on Friday at the first meeting between the countries’ leaders in Beijing in eight years.
The Canadian premier hailed a “landmark deal” under a “new strategic partnership” with China, turning the page on years of diplomatic spats, retaliatory arrests of each other’s citizens and tariff disputes.
Carney has sought to reduce his country’s reliance on the United States, its key economic partner and traditional ally, as President Donald Trump has aggressively raised tariffs on Canadian products.
“Canada and China have reached a preliminary but landmark trade agreement to remove trade barriers and reduce tariffs,” Carney told a news conference after meeting with Xi.
Under the deal, China — which used to be Canada’s largest market for canola seed — is expected to reduce tariffs on canola products by March 1 to around 15 per cent, down from the current 84pc.
China will also allow Canadian visitors to enter the country visa-free.
In turn, Canada will import 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) under new, preferential tariffs of 6.1pc.
“This is a return to the levels that existed prior to recent trade frictions,” Carney said of the EV deal.
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government’s decision to allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a low tariff rate is “problematic” and said Canada may come to regret the decision. “I think it’s problematic for Canada,” Greer told CNBC on Thursday.
Welcoming Carney in the Great Hall of the People, Xi said China-Canada relations reached a turning point at their last meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in October. “It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,” Xi told the Canadian leader.
“The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations serves the common interests of our two countries,” he said, adding he was “glad” to see discussions over the last few months to restore cooperation.
Ties between the two nations withered in 2018 over Canada’s arrest of the daughter of Huawei’s founder on a US warrant, and China’s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.
The two countries imposed tariffs on each other’s exports in the years that ensued, with China also accused of interfering in Canada’s elections.
But Carney has sought a pivot, and Beijing has also said it is willing to get relations back on “the right track”.
Canada, traditionally a staunch US ally, has been hit especially hard by Trump’s steep tariffs on steel, aluminium, vehicles and lumber.
Washington’s moves have prompted Canada to seek business elsewhere.

ISLAMABAD: Senators on Fri­day called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under 18, with the chair proposing a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries.
The issue was raised through a calling-attention notice moved by Senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan.
Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee comprising representatives of the ministries of information technology, interior, education and law, along with parliamentary parties and provincial governments. She said the final decision would rest with Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani.
Speaking on the notice, Senator Naz said most platforms were designed for adults and warned that children’s exposure to inappropriate content could make them vulnerable to online harassment, exploitation and dangerous trends.
She referred to last year’s killing of Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old TikToker, and said such incidents underscored the risks of unmonitored social media use for minors.
She called for a comprehensive legal framework and urged the government to introduce mandatory age verification, parental supervision and other protective measures.
She also demanded restrictions on the use of TikTok, Instagram, VPNs and similar tools by children below 18. “The matter is serious in nature and immediate and serious steps should be taken to prevent children from further dangers of social media,” she said, seeking a briefing from the IT ministry on existing laws and a future action plan.
Senator Fawzia Arshad said social media had become a serious concern for parents and required a collective response. She stressed the need for counselling in educational institutions to guide children and discourage harmful online behaviour.
“The age between 16 and 18 is very vulnerable and fragile,” she said, adding that the problem could worsen without proper guidance. She also said civics and moral development were insufficiently covered in the curriculum.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry described the matter as a national issue and said it should be referred to the relevant standing committee.
He said the issue was not limited to the IT ministry and involved the ministries of education and interior as well. He called for coordination among stakeholders to propose curriculum changes and appropriate restrictions for underage users in line with international practices. “This is not a challenge for Pakistan but an international issue,” he said.
The minister said law enforcement and cybercrime institutions, including the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should be engaged in efforts to address the issue.
“There is a need for a national debate to find a solution to save the underage children from the dangers (of social media),” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman noted that Australia had introduced legislation to restrict social media use for children under 16, but said she was not in favour of blanket bans. Describing social media as an educational tool as well, she said the Senate should consider all aspects and proceed “judiciously”.
PTI protest
Separately, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers criticised what they described as a continued ban on meetings with the party’s founder Imran Khan, alleging violations of court orders.
Speaking on a point of order, PTI parliamentary leader Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been kept in solitary confinement for the past two months, calling it the “worst form of torture” prohibited under the Constitution, domestic laws and international human rights conventions.
He alleged that the jail authorities were effectively punishing the couple without trial, arguing that prolonged detention under harsh prison conditions amounted to punishment in itself. The cases against them were being used as political tools, he said.
Senator Zafar rejected the government’s assertion that meetings were not allowed because visitors made political statements, saying this could not justify the denial of fundamental rights. “Legal rights cannot be suspended on political grounds,” he said.
He told the House that, despite being legal counsel for Mr Khan, he was not being allowed to meet his client, describing this as a violation of the sanctity of the lawyer-client relationship and a denial of the right to legal defence.
PTI Senator Falak Naz also said Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and that no one had been allowed to meet him for the past two months.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the jail superintendent had the authority to schedule meetings based on conduct. He pointed out that Adiala Jail fell under the jurisdiction of the Punjab government and that the federal government had no authority to issue directions in this regard.
The minister rejected the opposition’s claim that Mr Khan was being kept in solitary confinement.
Separately, the House also discussed reports of tree cutting in Chitral, with Senator Naz alleging that the timber mafia continued illegal felling. Senator Sherry Rehman said Chitral had “turned brown from green” over the past two decades, adding that the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change would take up the issue in its next meeting.
Senator Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said forestry was a provincial subject but noted that the federal government could write to the provincial authorities.

Members highlighted the problem of fake driving challans, as well as fraudulent messages from educational institutions, banks, mobile phone companies and other entities. It was also informed that in some cases people responded to such fake messages and later faced charges of blasphemy and anti-state activities, resulting in imprisonment.
On the other hand, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry claimed that necessary steps were being taken to introduce reforms in the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in order to effectively tackle cybercrimes.
PTI leader Sheryar Afridi informed the House that a large number of young people were facing cases and imprisonment after being declared guilty of committing blasphemy and anti-state activities.

House told NCCIA received over 150,000 cybercrime complaints in a year

“A number of people told me outside Adiala jail that they and their family members are facing cases after responding to some fake messages on the internet from people posing as representatives of educational institutions, banks and other organisations,” he added.
PPP legislator Shazia Marri drew the attention of the assembly to fake traffic challans (fines) sent by fraudsters and hackers. She said a large number of people had been cheated through such messages, as they believed them to be genuine and paid fines to the perpetrators.
In response, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said he had also received such messages claiming that he had committed traffic violations and was liable to pay fines.
Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhry said the NCCIA had received over 150,000 complaints last year. He said the best officers had been appointed to the agency and that efforts were under way to enhance its capacity.
He said over 81,000 of these complaints were related to financial crimes, and that 1,095 accused persons had been arrested. He added that cellular companies had been directed to enhance their security features for the issuance of SIMs.
Responding to a question, Mr Chaud­hry said the air quality of Islamabad had improved compared to a year ago. He said measures such as vehicle emission certification were among the steps taken to improve the environment.
To another question, the minister expressed the government’s commitment to purging Islamabad of all kinds of encroachments.
Responding to a calling attention notice, he said Vision 2027 would be announced this month for the development of the federal capital territory.
Privatisation
Later, State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani told the House that PIA had been privatised in the most transparent manner in accordance with the law and the Constitution. He clarified that only the core operations of the airline had been privatised, while PIA-owned hotels were not part of the transaction.
Expressing confidence in the move, Bilal Kayani said the privatisation would improve service delivery and strengthen the airline’s financial position.
Responding to a calling attention notice, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan said interventions had been made to achieve the target of $6bn in exports.
Bills introduced
Meanwhile, several bills were laid before the House. These included the Export Development Fund Amendment Bill, 2026; the National Tariff Commis­sion Amendment Bill, 2026; the Export-Import Bank of Pakistan Amendment Bill, 2026; the Pakistan Telecommu­ni­cation Reorganisation Amendment Bill; the Life Insurance Nationalisation Ame­n­dment Bill; the Federal Board of Inter­mediate and Secondary Education Amen­dment Bill; the Islamabad Capital Territory Condominium (Ownership and Management) Bill; and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Amendment Bill, 2026.

The employee earns these benefits through long, continuous, faithful and unblemished service, observed Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui in a six-page judgement that upheld the right of a former civil servant to receive pension benefits despite the fact that he had applied for pension 13 years after his resignation.

 

Justice Siddiqui was a member of a three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, which also comprised Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.
The bench had taken up an appeal filed by Muhammad Usman against the July 3, 2024 rejection of his plea by the Federal Service Tribunal (FST).

Sets aside ruling of service tribunal on plea by ex-auditor

The appellant was a former senior auditor (BS-11) in the office of the Military Accountant General, Rawalpindi. He was held disentitled to pension benefits on the grounds that he had tendered resignation from public service and applied belatedly for the release of pensionary benefits, notwithstanding the fact that the requisite length of service — i.e. 20 years — had already been completed by the employee.
Earlier, his department dismissed the application on the grounds that the qualifying length of service for pension benefits was 25 years. Likewise, his subsequent application for condonation of the shortfall period was also declined on Oct 27, 2020.
The SC noted that since the resignation was tendered in September 2007, the petitioner, for the purposes of pension benefits, was required to have served for a period of 20 years, as the relevant clause (i) to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, had been amended through Ordinance No XXXIV of 2001 on Aug 4, 2001, whereby the qualifying service was reduced from 25 to 20 years.
During the hearing, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rashideen Nawaz Qasoori did not object to the fact that, at the relevant time when the resignation was tendered, the petitioner had completed the requisite period of 20 years.
However, the AAG opposed the grant of pension benefits to the petitioner on two counts: first, that the petitioner had belatedly applied for the pension claim; and second, that since he had tendered resignation on his own from public service, Regulation 418 of the Civil Service Regulations would disentitle him from such a claim.
The petitioner had moved the department for the first time to claim pension benefits in the year 2020, i.e. after a lapse of 13 years from the date of tendering resignation, which was later accepted. This delay was considered sufficient by the relevant department to disentitle the petitioner from claiming pensionary benefits, the judgement noted.
However, treating CSR as an independent provision to oust a civil servant from claiming pension benefits after successful completion of the requisite length of service was misconceived and legally untenable, the SC ruled.
The apex court further held that both the FST and the concerned departmental authority had failed to understand the true spirit of Regulation 418 of the CSR, and that a belated application to claim pension benefits did not, by itself, constitute a ground for disentitlement.
While concluding, the SC set aside the FST order as unsustainable and converted the petition into an appeal, holding that the appellant was entitled to his pension benefits in accordance with law.

This charge sheet has been framed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) against the policymakers and power sector managers in its flagship ‘State of the Industry Report 2025’, while conceding that regulatory powers for correction had been diluted through administrative and legal challenges.
It said the inefficiencies of the distribution companies (Discos) contributed around Rs400 billion to the circular debt, while law-abiding consumers paid around Rs235bn in debt servicing surcharge (DSS) in 2024-25, not due to normal business practices but to inefficiencies.
It said that despite some structural and policy-level interventions, “overall progress remained limited and insufficient to instil confidence in its ability to drive sustained industrial growth and provide meaningful relief to electricity consumers across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential categories. The sector continues to face deep-rooted operational and governance challenges that constrain its efficiency and undermine its potential contribution to economic development”.

Nepra report says inefficiencies continue to fuel circular debt

It pointed out that underutilised generation capacity was resulting in a persistent financial burden in the form of capacity payments for idle plants, and the transmission network is both underutilised and constrained, contributing to higher transmission tariffs while also preventing the dispatch of electricity from cheaper and more efficient generation sources in accordance with the Economic Merit Order (EMO).
On the distribution side, many go­­vernment-owned Discos continue to exhibit poor governance practices, with T&D losses exceeding allowable limits, a low bill recovery ratio, and load-shedding practices based on Aggregate Technical and Com­me­rcial (AT&C) losses. These inefficie­ncies further exacerbate the underutilisation of generation, transmission, and distribution assets and con­tribute to the circular debt problem.
It said the challenges confronting power sector entities, largely driven by the entities owned by the government, were complex and spanned across planning, execution, and operational domains. “Persistent inefficiencies in strategic planning, project implementation, and routine operations have hindered the sector’s ability to achieve financial sustainability and contribute effectively to national economic growth”, it said adding that these issues were further exacerbated by weak governance, limited accountability, and the absence of performance-driven management practices, all of which constrain the sector’s capacity to optimise its assets and consistently provide affordable, reliable electricity to consumers.
The regulator pointed out that renegotiations and termination of contracts led to decommissioning of 2,829MW to 41,121mw as of June 30, 2025, from 45,888MW as of June 30, 2024, with the addition of a 884MW hydropower plant, but the utilisation factor of thermal power plants, including nuclear, in the national grid remained only 38.82pc in 2024-25. Generation cost represents the largest component of the electricity tariff at the consumer level, accounting for approximately 82pc.
It appreciated the government’s efforts to reduce electricity tariffs but pointed out persistent operational inefficiencies in public-sector power plants, such as the 747MW Guddu Power Plant, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Plant, and several other hydroelectric plants under Wapda, which were significantly undermining these initiatives. “Consequently, the intended financial relief from many IPPs’ tariff adjustments, as well as the retirement or decommissioning of other underperforming power plants, is being offset, limiting the overall effectiveness of sector reforms”.
On top of that, another factor adversely affecting overall generation costs was highlighted as the lower utilisation of coal-based power plants using Thar coal. 
Reduced plant utilisation has negatively affected both the capacity and energy purchase prices, as the fixed costs of mining operations are embedded within the EPP component. The utilisation factor of Thar coal-based power plants stood at 67.23pc during 2024-25. Moreover, the delay in establishing a regular supply of Thar coal to Lucky Electric Power Company Ltd has further contributed to inefficiencies and higher generation costs.
A notable example of inefficiency was the underutilisation of the 4,000MW capacity Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line, whose utilisation factor remained only 35pc during 2024-25, despite payments being made based on a 100pc availability factor. This adversely affects both the transmission tariff and the overall cost of electricity.
The regulator put on record that “KE, Pesco, Hesco, Sepco, and Qesco are the poorest performers, with T&D losses far exceeding Nepra limits, low revenue recovery, excessive AT&C losses, prolonged load-shedding, mounting receivables, poor service quality, and high consumer dissatisfaction. Their performance is weak across nearly all operational and financial indicators”.
Operational inefficiencies persisted across all Discos, including KE. Delays in new connections, meter replacements, and net-metering approvals were common. Overbilling practices, particularly detection bills issued without due process, and frequent inflated billing complaints further undermined consumer trust.
It said despite over two decades of their incorporation, the majority of Discos largely failed to function as true corporate entities and were increasingly being brought under centralised control, and their Boards of Directors (BoDs) show little interest in improving the financial health of these companies or transforming them into organisations of international standard.
As if that was not enough, there was a lack of accountability for board members, Chief Executive Officers, and other officers and officials. This absence of deterrence has emboldened these entities to maintain the status quo, perpetuating inefficiencies and poor performance across the sector. On top of that, the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement drive had “been diluted by lengthy review, appeal, and petition processes, which were so time-consuming that they undermine the very purpose of enforcement actions”. Furthermore, the limitation on taking action against delinquent individuals weakens the regulator’s monitoring and enforcement efforts.

In December, the PTI had denied dialogue with the government until “ensuring a level-playing field” was provided to the party through its ongoing “street movement” — an agitation campaign against the government.
Speaking during Geo News’s programme Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal, Sanaullah said that the government had been in contact with PTI leaders for dialogue, stating that “several of them are in favour of negotiations with the government.”
“Whenever politicians come to the table for talks, problems get solved, and a way gets paved,” he said.
Sanaullah reiterated that many PTI leaders were in favour of dialogue, but  “whenever they meet us, they say that the PTI founder is not in favour of any sort of dialogue with the government,” he added.
He further said that PTI’s arrangement, speeches, and mobilisation efforts for the upcoming protest on Feb 8 indicated that they were “standing firm on their decision and wouldn’t step back as per the government’s assessment”.
“However,” he added, “the PTI leaders think that if they get to meet Imran, they could convince him to postpone the protest and initiate dialogue with the government.”
When asked about the meeting of PTI leaders with Imran, Sanaullah said: “They have gone too far now; any initiation of dialogues or meeting with Imran Khan can be possible only after Feb 8.”
“They are preparing for the protest at full throttle, so meeting them before that would not be possible,” he said.
The former interior minister also implied that the government would deal with the protests “administratively”, and PTI would emerge “unsuccessful”.
He advised the PTI to “play its role” in the parliamentary processes and return to the committee proceedings from which they had abstained.
Earlier, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran.
It further maintained that it would not engage in negotiations with the government, as the stance it followed was in line with the directions passed on by Imran.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16191841f0895d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967317/russia-pakistan-relations-genuinely-mutually-beneficial-says-president-putin' target='_blank'><strong>Russia-Pakistan relations ‘genuinely mutually beneficial’, says President Putin</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that his country’s relations with Pakistan are “genuinely mutually beneficial” and that Moscow maintains close relations with Islamabad.
“We maintain close cooperation with Pakistan, a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the largest regional organisation in terms of economic, technological, and human potential. Russia-Pakistan relations are genuinely mutually beneficial,” the Embassy of Russia in Pakistan quoted President Putin as saying on X.







The statement came as Pakistan’s Ambassador to Russia, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, formally presented his credentials to President Putin during a ceremony held on Thursday at Moscow’s Grand Kremlin Palace, according to the Pakistani Embassy in Russia.
In recent years, Pakistan and Russia have significantly strengthened their economic ties, driven by mutual necessity. Following Western sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict, Moscow turned toward new energy outlets, while Islamabad simultaneously sought more affordable fuel sources to reduce national import expenses.
This diplomatic shift culminated in 2023, when Pakistan officially integrated Russian crude oil into its energy portfolio.
Last month, Finance Mini­ster Muhammad Aur­a­ngzeb said Islamabad and Moscow were in talks regarding a new potential oil-sector agreement.
Pakistan, which imports 70 per cent of its crude oil, is mainly dependent on Russian crude exports. Despite this, Pakis­tan has enjoyed lower tariffs from Washington and close relations with its current administration, even as India recently saw a punitive 25pc tariff impo­sed on its goods.
In November last year — as Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev visited Islamabad to participate in the 10th Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission — the two countries reaffirmed their resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation in diversified trade, energy, business-to-business engagements and social sectors like health and education.</p><small>2026-01-16 14:23</small></div><hr>
