The rains severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, along with disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced hours-long power and internet services outage. Due to the severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration anno­unced a public holiday in the city today.
According to separate statements issued by Karachi Rescue 1122, two more people died in rain-related incidents, in addition to yesterday’s six deaths.
Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of a 50-year-old man, identified as Abbas Mohsin, who went missing in a nullah near the Gurumandir area yesterday, Rescue 1122 said. His body was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).
In Defence Housing Authority’s (DHA) Phase 5, Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Yasir, after being informed about an electrocution incident. The man’s body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College (JPMC).
A man and a woman were injured after part of an old building collapsed in Ranchore Line area, a statement from Edhi Rescue service said. Both were taken to CHK in an ambulance.
The Sindh government has ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed today, after Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab declared a rain emergency.
 
 

Rainwater was still accumulated on some roads near I. I. Chundrigar, as Karachi witnessed sunny skies with no further rain so far.
On Tuesday, as many as six people died in rain-related incidents.
Four members of a family died and one was injured after the walls of a house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12 collapsed during the heavy rain. According to a JPMC statement, a boy aged between two to four years and a six to seven-year-old girl were among the deceased.
In another similar incident in Orangi Town, an eight-year-old child lost his life. An unidentified man, aged 20-24 years, died in a suspected electrocution case in DHA’s Phase 7.
Yesterday’s rains severely flooded Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road, and I.I. Chundrigarh Road, with hundreds of cars and motorcycles submerged and commuters stuck in traffic jams for several hours. Many had to wade through waist-deep water in the business district as they tried to return home.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept across the city, plunging several areas into darkness. Even upscale neigh­bourhoods, such as DHA and Clifton, were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the residents’ misery.
The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport were also affected, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to an alternative airport due to inclement weather.
More rains expected in Sindh, Balochistan
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast torrential rains in Sindh, parts of Balochistan, and other regions of the country in the coming days, advising the provincial disaster management authorities to make necessary arrangements.
 






According to the PMD, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Karachi, Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar and Jamshoro.
Scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro.

Swiatek — who on Monday had battled through a two-hour tussle with Jasmine Paolini to win the Cincinnati Open — looked full of energy as she and Ruud powered into Wednesday’s semi-finals.
Swiatek and Ruud needed just 39 minutes to dispatch the US pairing of Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe 4-1, 4-2 in their opening game at Arthur Ashe Stadium, and then reappeared roughly 20 minutes later to defeat Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti 5-3, 4-2 in their quarter-final clash.
The victories capped a gruelling 24 hours for Polish star Swiatek, who hot-footed it to the airport after Monday’s win in Cincinnati and only arrived at her
hotel in New York in the early hours of Tuesday.

“Honestly the last two days have felt like one day, but I’m super happy to be here,” Swiatek said.
Ruud and Swiatek had just enough time to fit in a quick practice before taking to the court in their first match as a doubles pairing.
“I was happy to team up with Iga,” Ruud said afterwards.
“She’s on the winning train these days so I’m just jumping on the train and let’s see if we can win some more before the mixed doubles is over.
“I was super happy to team up with Iga — I think everyone should show some appreciation to Iga today. She only got to her hotel 12 hours ago at 2:30am, and she’s here playing.”
McNally and Musetti had progressed to the last eight earlier Tuesday after taking care of Naomi Osaka and Gael Monfils 5-3, 4-2.
In other early results on Tuesday, US tennis icon Venus Williams and partner Reilly Opelka exited against Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev, losing 4-2, 5-4.
Italy’s reigning champions Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani ousted second seeds Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz 4-2, 4-2.
Earlier on Tuesday, world number one Jannik Sinner’s withdrawal from the mixed doubles was confirmed as expected.
Sinner, who retired due to illness in the first set of his Cincinnati Open final with Carlos Alcaraz on Monday, was due to partner Katerina Siniakova in the doubles.
Sinner and Siniakova were replaced in the draw by the American duo of Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison.
This year’s US Open mixed doubles competition is being held over Tuesday and Wednesday in the week before the main singles draws get under way.
The tournament is using a modified scoring system, with short sets to four games, no-advantage scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point match tiebreak in lieu of a third set.
The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games, featuring no-advantage scoring, with tiebreakers at six-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker instead of a third set, with the winning pairing pocketing $1 million.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2011083125535a6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932044/china-to-showcase-latest-military-hardware-at-september-parade' target='_blank'><strong>China to showcase latest military hardware at September parade</strong></a><br><p>China will unveil a slate of new domestically produced military hardware that will showcase its “powerful capability to prevail in modern war” at a parade next month, officials said on Wednesday.
The event, marking 80 years since the end of World War II, will see President Xi Jinping inspect troops in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and other world leaders expected to attend.
Millions of Chinese people were killed during a prolonged war with imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, which became part of a global conflict following Tokyo’s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The ruling Communist Party has held a series of blockbuster events in recent years to commemorate its wartime resistance.
On September 3, China’s military will showcase its latest equipment, “reflecting the evolution of modern warfare”, said Major General Wu Zeke, an official at China’s military commission.
“All of the weapons and equipment taking part in this review were selected from domestically produced, currently active main battle systems, with a significant proportion being newly unveiled equipment,” Wu told reporters at a briefing.
These will include strategic heavy weapons, hypersonic precision systems, as well as unmanned and counter-unmanned equipment making their first public debut, he added.
The parade, which will last around 70 minutes, will “fully showcase our military’s powerful capability to prevail in modern war”, Wu said.
It will also feature ground troops marching in formation, armoured columns, aerial echelons and other high-tech fighting gear.
The Kremlin has confirmed Putin will attend, and Chinese officials said other world leaders are also expected to take in the scene.
China in March raised its defence spending for 2025 by 7.2 percent.
The increase comes as Beijing’s armed forces undergo rapid modernisation and eye deepening strategic competition with the United States.
China has the world’s second-largest military budget, but lags well behind the United States, its primary strategic rival.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a4de08c4e6c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931920/medium-level-flood-in-river-indus-at-taunsa' target='_blank'><strong>Medium-level flood in river Indus at Taunsa</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Taunsa Barrage on the Indus River is having a flood situation where water flow has reached a critical 500,000 cusecs and it is expected to rise further.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Tuesday issued a high alert as flood situation intensifies across Punjab as the water in rivers is rising due to ongoing monsoon rains that lashed the upper regions of the province.
The PDMA directed the district administration to immediately evacuate the citizens living on or near the riverbeds in Taunsa and launch emergency rescue operations. All relevant administrations should remain present in the field to coordinate relief efforts.
Commissioners of Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur, along with deputy commissioners of Layyah, Kot Addu, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur have been put on high alert.

Boats used to rescue people in Mianwali; more rainfall expected across Punjab

Rainfall is expected in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, and Rajanpur, raising concerns about urban flooding in major cities and flash flooding in the seasonal streams and drains.
The river situation across Punjab is becoming increasingly precarious. At Tarbela, the Indus is flowing at low-level flood with 309,000 cusecs while Kalabagh is experiencing medium-level flooding of 440,000 cusecs. Chashma reports a medium-level flood situation with 492,000 cusecs, and Taunsa shows 489,000 cusecs with medium-level flooding.
The Ravi River at Jassar in Narowal has a low-level flood at 53,000 cusecs, with forecast predicting low to medium-level flooding within the next 24 hours. The Sutlej River at Ganda Singhwala and Sulemanki is also at low-level flood with 64,000 and 71,000 cusecs, respectively while Nullah Dek and Basantar near Shakargarh are similarly affected.
In response to the escalating situation, the Punjab government has established flood relief camps in the affected areas to provide basic facilities and medicines.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia urged the citizens to take precautionary measures, relocate from riverbeds to safe locations and avoid recreational activities near the water bodies.
He advised the public to use the PDMA helpline 1129 for emergencies and stay informed through announcements and local channels. He said that no negligence would be tolerated in protecting lives and properties, and citizens were called upon to cooperate fully with administration efforts during this critical period.
In Mianwali, the water flow in the Indus is increasing and there is a medium level flood in the river at Mianwali. The inflow at Jinnah Barrage was recorded at 440,586 cusecs while the outflow was 434,278 cusecs.
After the flood warning for the coming days, the district administration along with revenue staff and rescue personnel got active in the Katcha area of the district.

“Seventy-six citizens of the country… lost their lives in the incident, and three others were seriously injured,” Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi, Herat provincial government spokesman, said in a statement.
Police in Guzara district outside Herat city, where the accident took place on Tuesday night, said the bus collided with a motorcycle and a truck carrying fuel, sparking a fire.
The bus was carrying Afghans recently returned from Iran to the capital Kabul, Saeedi told AFP on Tuesday.
At least 1.5 million people have returned to Afghanistan since the start of this year from Iran and Pakistan, both of which have sought to force migrants out after decades of hosting them, according to the UN migration agency.
The state-run Bakhtar News Agency said Tuesday’s accident was one of the deadliest in the country in recent years.
Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, due in part to poor roads after decades of conflict, dangerous driving on highways and a lack of regulation.

• Four of a family die in house collapse in Jauhar
• Man electrocuted to death  • Many areas experience hours-long power outages
• Commuters suffer as submerged roads cause traffic mess
• Mayor, CM visit city areas to inspect rainwater drainage work
• Sindh govt announces public holiday in metropolis today
KARACHI: Heavy rains, described as “unprecedented” by the Met Office, paralysed life in Karachi on Tuesday and submerged many areas mainly due to clogged drains that could not handle the rainwater flow.
The rain also exposed the ill-maintained transmission and distribution system of K-Electric that collapsed with the first drop in the morning, causing hours-long power brea­kdowns across the city.
The intensity of the rain could be gauged from the fact that the city administration had to close down many underpasses and major thoroughfares for vehicular traffic as cars abandoned by their owners after breaking down were seen floating on the roads.
Almost every city road experienced prolonged traffic jams. Office-goers and students, particularly schoolchildren, were among those who suffered the most, having to wade through waist-deep flooded roads and streets to reach home.
Also, the provincial government has announced a public holiday in Karachi on Wednesday (today).
According to the Met Office, intermittent rains / thunderstorms are expected in Karachi over the next two days (Wednesday and Thursday) under the influence of strong monsoon currents penetrating from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah advised citizens to keep a safe distance from electric poles and fragile infrastructure to ensure their safety.
Six die in rain-related incidents
Six people, including three children, were killed in rain-related accidents in different parts of the city on Tuesday, officials said.
Five of them died in house and wall collapse incidents, while the sixth person died from electrocution.
According to rescue services officials, four people of a family, including two children, died and one was injured when a house collapsed due to heavy rains, which had weakened the structure in Gulistan-i-Jau­har on Tuesday afternoon.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the walls of a house in Block-12 collapsed due to heavy rainfall, trapping five family members under the debris. He said the Rescue’s Urban Search and Rescue Team, along with an ambulance and a rescue vehicle, arrived at the scene and retrieved all five individuals. Unfortu­nately, three died on the spot while the fourth succumbed to injuries during treatment. The fifth victim, a child, was admitted to a hospital for treatment.
All the victims belonged to the same family. They were identified as Maryam Afzal, 4; Hamza Afzal, 3; Sumia Mubeen, 24; and an unidentified 28-year-old woman. The injured child is around 10 years old.
In another incident, an eight-year-old child died when a wall of a house collapsed due to heavy rains in Orangi Town. The official said the house wall fell near Khalil Market. The Rescue 1122 team rushed to the scene and recovered the body of the boy, identified as Abdullah Abbas. He was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH).
In North Karachi, a man was electrocuted. The official said the victim died after receiving an electric shock. His body was shifted to the ASH for medico-legal formalities.
Rain data
According to the Met department’s data, the maximum rainfall was recorded in Gulshan-i-Hadeed, 170mm, or 6.69 inches, followed by Airport old area 158.5mm, Jinnah Terminal 153mm, Nazimabad 150mm, Surjani Town 145.2mm, North Karachi 144mm, Keamari and Saadi Town 140mm each, DHA Phase VII 134mm, Met Office University Road 133mm, Korangi 132.2mm, PAF Faisal Base 128mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 98mm, PAF Masroor Base 87mm and Orangi Town 66.2mm.
It warned of urban flooding in low-lying areas of Karachi and other parts of the province.
“Public, travellers and tourists are advised to avoid unnecessary exposure to vulnerable areas to prevent any untoward situation and remain upda­ted with the latest weather conditions,” it added.
The domestic and international flight operations at Karachi airport was also affected badly.
The Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) confirmed that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to alternative airport due to inclement weather.
Power outages add to rain woes
The widespread power outages added to the woes of Karachiites, who struggled to cope with heavy rainfall and urban flooding.
The power disruption also severely affected the water supply for citizens who rely on suction pumps due to the very low water pressure.
According to a K-Electric statement, around 800 fee­d­ers, out of over 2,100, fac­ed outage during the peak of the rain spell. “However, KE teams rem­ained depl­oyed, prioritising restoration work as soon as conditions permitted. Key infrastructure, including power plants and grid stations, continued to function normally,” the statement added.
It said that restoration efforts continued undeterred despite significant waterlogging and congestion. Areas with high levels of stagnant water, particularly in low-lying zones, were particularly affected due to restricted access and safety risks for residents and field teams.
Karachi returns to normalcy, claims KMC
A Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) statement said that although heavy rainfall resulted in a situation of urban flooding, Karachi returned to normalcy following the timely measures and directives issued by Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab.
Under the mayor’s instructions, the Municipal Services Department remained vigilant with its drain cleaning operations across the city. “As a result, major roads, including Sharea Faisal, Submarine Underpass, KPT Underpass, Mehran Underpass, Schon Circle Underpass, Clifton Underpass, and Drigh Road Underpass, were swiftly cleared and reopened for smooth traffic flow,” it added.
Throughout the day, the mayor personally visited various parts of the city and inspected major storm water drains and monitored the drainage operations to ensure uninterrupted flow and proper disposal of rainwater. At a chocking point on Sharea Faisal, the mayor himself supervised the cleaning work for over three hours, it added.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also paid a visit to different areas of the metropolis to inspect the drainage work.
He advised the citizens to stay home and said that he announced a holiday in view of their safety.

LOCALS work to restore a water channel in the Huracho area of Shigar.—Dawn

GILGIT: Thousands in Gilgit-Baltistan remained without potable water, electricity, and road access on Tuesday, as life returned to normalcy in the aftermath of flash floods that had ravaged the mountainous region since July this year.
On Tuesday, there were no floods in the GB rivers, and local volunteers had started to restore water channels and roads in several parts of the region. However, several roads remained blocked, including the Naltar Highway and the Ghizer-Shandur Road. The Baltistan Highway, which was blocked in the Roundu valley of Skardu, had finally been reopened on Tuesday, said officials.
Meanwhile, due to roadblocks, drinking water, irrigation, and road communication issues have compounded in the flood-affected areas, particularly in Ghizer, Skardu, Ghanche, and Gilgit. Similarly, residents complained of a severe water shortage in Danyor, Skardu and Ghanche.
A resident of Mazher Haldi village in Ghanche district in Baltis­tan said that their village had suffered four floods since mid-July. The repeated disasters have left the community in ruins, with hou­ses swept away, agricultural lands destroyed, and families forced to abandon their homes, he added.

Residents complain of water shortage in several districts

The district administration has provided temporary tents, and the affected families have been relocated to Payo Thang Haldi. However, the villagers have urged the authorities to declare a flood emergency in Haldi. The displaced residents taking refuge in Payo Thang Haldi were living without clean drinking water, electricity, proper sanitation, and food supplies. The destruction of the water supply lines, electricity connections, and road networks had made their survival even more difficult.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Ghizer Rescue 1122 teams continued their rescue activities in the flood-affected areas of Daen village for the fifth consecutive day. Patients and other vulnerable groups had been safely transported from Daen to safe locations in rescue boats.
As the weather becomes normal, locals citing indigenous knowledge said the weather starts changing from August 15, and snow starts freezing on the mountains by mid-August. On Tuesday morning, there was a little snowfall on the mountains as well.
A day earlier, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Ghizer was the most-affected district, as the mountainous reg­ion faced one of the worst floods that had killed 39 people, including tourists, since July. These disasters have caused damage to the tune of Rs30 billion, he had said.
“At least two dozen people have been injured so far; 35 small and large bridges have been washed away; a dozen mosques and ‘Jamaat Khanas’ have been damaged, and more than half a dozen buildings of educational institutions have been damaged,” he said. About 350 houses were completely destroyed and at least 600 houses had sustained partial damage, he had added.

The investigation will be led by former federal secretary Shahid Khan, following complaints from industrial and CNG consumers who received sudden bills for past gas dues, dating back to 2015.
Sources confirmed that the prime minister has constituted a special inquiry committee to examine the matter. The dispute centres around the Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Company Ltd (SNGPL), which issued revised bills for the period between April 2015 and June 2022. These bills were based on updated notifications from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to these notifications, the industrial sector owes Rs14.4bn, the power sector Rs40bn (ultimately payable by electricity consumers), the CNG sector Rs3.8bn, and the fertiliser sector Rs2.4bn. The total payables amount to Rs59.8bn, including Rs51.3bn in differential gas charges and approximately Rs8bn in general sales tax (GST), in addition to late payment charges.
 
 

The issue has sparked concern, particularly among the industrial sector, which claims to have secured stay orders in the past to avoid such payments. Around 2,950 industrial consumers and 1,200 CNG consumers have protested, arguing they have strong legal grounds to challenge the additional charges. These groups assert that over the past decade, they have either exported or sold products and had no means to pass on the extra billing costs.
This billing dispute is further complicated by a Rs76bn subsidy claim against the government. The differential in Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) prices for export-oriented industries and the fertiliser sector is subsidised by the government, but the amounts recoverable from consumers have been billed.
Both Ogra and SNGPL have blamed each other for the legal errors. SNGPL sources explained that Ogra issued actualised RLNG prices for the period from April 2015 to June 2022 in December 2024, but later removed the revised notifications from its website following amendments requested by Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL). Ogra subsequently re-issued the RLNG prices on March 28, 2025, covering a period of 84 months. SNGPL has charged the differential amount to RLNG consumers under the gas sales agreement (GSA) clause 3.
The sources further argued that Ogra should not have revised the RLNG rates from ten years ago. Instead, they suggested the authority should have pursued recovery of the differential amount between the provisional RLNG prices and the actualised rates on a prospective basis, similar to how the fertiliser sector handled its payments.
They warned that retroactive claims could be nearly impossible to collect, with consumers likely to seek stay orders in court. This could undermine confidence in the regulated gas sector and fuel the growth of private entities outside the regulatory framework.
Ogra spokesperson Imran Ghaznavi defended the regulator’s actions, stating that it had been determining monthly provisional RLNG prices, which were now actualised. He clarified that, according to the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) and the SNGPL Consumer Service Manual, the differential between the provisional and actual RLNG prices was recoverable in future bills, not in a single bill.

The rains also delayed export shipments as goods carriers were unable to move due to flooded roads and overflowing nullahs.
The industrial sector, which typically operates in three shifts, faced significant disruptions. The morning shift was only partially affected, but the torrential downpour in the afternoon led to widespread flooding, which caused a complete halt to the second and third shifts. Many industrialists had to reschedule export shipments planned for the evening, while some were forced to delay deliveries until Wednesday.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Junaid Naqi said that 20-30 per cent of workers in over 4,000 industries in Korangi could not make it to work due to the rains. Those who did arrive opted to leave early as the rains worsened in the afternoon.
“Overall, productivity in the area was 50pc lower due to workers leaving early,” Naqi said, adding that many workers were stranded on the roads due to the submersion of main thoroughfares.
 
 

In addition, many workers’ children were also reportedly stuck at their educational institutions until late at night, further compounding the situation. Industrial operations typically run across three eight-hour shifts, but the absence of workers due to the rains led to the cancellation of afternoon and night shifts.
Site Association of Industry (SAI) President Ahmed Azeem Alvi reported that while production remained normal in over 3,500 units, many workers left by 4pm, only to find themselves stuck in traffic caused by flooded roads and overflowing gutters. “Women workers in particular faced severe difficulties due to the lack of public transport in the evening,” Alvi said, adding that the cancellation of shifts would pose problems for export-oriented industries.
Alvi also pointed out that some workers had been forced to stay at the factories due to road closures and transport shortages. “It’s disappointing that no city authority has taken responsibility for managing the drainage system, despite Karachi’s vital role in generating revenue,” he said.
Sheikh Mohammad Tehseen, President of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), said attendance at over 1,000 units in F.B. Area was down by 20-25pc. He predicted that Wednesday would be even more challenging, as many workers who had struggled to return home on Tuesday may be unable to make it to work depending on the weather. “If the rains continue for another two or three days, industrial production will be severely impacted,” Tehseen warned.
In the retail sector, trading activity in the old city area, home to over 10,000 shops, was almost negligible. Sharjeel Gopalani, Patron-in-Chief of the All City Tajir Itehad, said that many shop owners stayed home after the morning rains, while those who did show up left by 3pm as rainwater flooded markets.
Haji Shahjehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, reported that the footfall of customers in the New Subzi Mandi Super Highway wholesale market had been very low due to the heavy downpour. Additionally, supplies of vegetables from the upcountry were delayed.
With more rain forecast for the coming days, the industrial sector and retail markets in Karachi face an uncertain future, as widespread flooding continues to hamper both production and transport.
North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI) President  Faisal Moiz Khan said 80pc of the 4,500 units in the area halted production due to worker absenteeism. With 70pc of NKATI’s industries export-oriented, the suspension of second and third shifts will cause major disruptions. He added that rain and road closures have severely affected the supply chain for goods and raw materials.

• City at a standstill as main thoroughfares closed off; underpasses submerged after storm drains overflow
• Flight operations at Jinnah International Airport disrupted
• Met Office warns of more rains to come as low-pressure area over Indian Gujarat likely to intensify
KARACHI: Unpre­cedented heavy monsoon rains lashed Karachi on Tuesday, claiming at least six lives, flooding neighbourhoods, and leaving people frustrated and helpless with the Pakistan Meteorological Depar­tment warning of more showers to come.
The rains severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure,  causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and bringing life in  the bustling “City of Lights” to a grinding halt. Even upscale neigh­borhoods like Defence Housing Auth­ority and Clifton were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the  misery of residents.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept  across the city, plunging several areas into darkness and compounding the challenges faced by residents. The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport, Karachi were  also affected badly, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA)  confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to alternative airport due to inclement weather.
By 10pm, the maximum rainfall was recorded in Guls­han-i-Hadeed 170­mm, or 6.69 inches, and the minimum rainfall was 66.2mm in Orangi Town, according to data released by the Met Office.
Due to the severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration anno­unced a public holiday in Karachi on Wednesday (today).
 


Anjum Niaz Zaigham, the focal person of the Met department, said that the rain did not broke previous records but “it’s unprecedented  heavy downpour”.
“A low pressure area over Indian Gujarat caused  heavy downpour in Karachi,” he said, adding that the next two days were very important for the city as another depression from Odissa, India,  would reach Gujarat and was expected to become   more intense on  Wednesday and Thursday and affect Karachi and other southern areas.
Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road,  and I.I. Chundrigarh Road, were severely flooded, with hundreds of cars  and motorcycles submerged. Thousands of commuters were stuck in  bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours, one of the worst jams in the city’s  history, with many abandoning their vehicles as fuel ran low, adding to  the chaos.
The worst affected were the home-returning people,  particularly women, who had to wade through waist-deep water in the business district of the metropolis. Thousands of them endured an agonising ordeal, taking over 10 hours to reach home from work due to  the city’s severely congested and flooded roads.
As many as six people died in rain-related incidents. Of them, five were killed in house and wall collapse incidents while the sixth died from electrocution, officials said.
The severity of the urban flooding in the city was starkly evident as  a high-rise building in Soldier Bazaar was inundated up to its first  floor during the downpour and 80 stranded residents were rescued.
A Rescue-1122 spokesperson told Dawn that the building was under water up to 1st floor with residents trapped. He  said their rescue teams rushed to the spot after receiving information  at around 5:41pm and rescued the residents.
However, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation claimed in a statement that despite the intensity of the downpour, the “metropolis returned to normalcy following the timely measures and directives issued by Mayor  Barrister Murtaza Wahab”.
PM concerned over situation
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, expressing concern over the heavy rains in Karachi and other cities.
CM House Spokesman Rasheed Channa said that the chief minister briefed the prime minister on the government’s relief efforts, noting that water drainage work began promptly after the rain subsided.
 






He said that he chief minister had ordered all relevant agencies to remain on high alert as heavy monsoon rains continue to affect the region.
The chief minister also instructed the traffic police to remain vigilant in low-lying and high-traffic areas, guiding the public during the inclement weather. Both leaders expressed regret over the loss of life and property, with the prime minister assuring the chief minister of federal support during the emergency.
Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori also called Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, briefing him on the rain-induced situation in Karachi and requesting federal assistance to alleviate the crisis.

“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” said an official announcement quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative, as saying at a high-level meeting.
The meeting was convened to review preparations for the forthcoming session of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) of CPEC, as well as the prime minister’s scheduled visit to Beijing.
While the JCC is expected to meet in October, official sources said the prime minister will travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO) summit (Aug 31-Sept 1). On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Both sides expected to set clear priorities, agree on tangible outcomes for the new phase

The planning minister stressed that the future of CPEC “must be anchored in quality rather than quantity,” emphasising that only carefully selected, high-impact projects should be advanced to ensure sustainability and institutional strengthening.
He also disclosed that during his recent visit to China, he had conveyed PM Shehbaz’s invitation to President Xi to visit Islamabad in 2026 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China.
 
 

Underscoring the need to expand Pakistan’s trade and export footprint in China, the minister directed the authorities concerned to resolve visa processing delays on priority to facilitate genuine businesspersons. He also instructed the preparation of an outcome-focused plan to diversify exports, enhance industrial linkages, and maximise benefits from market access under CPEC.
On human resource development, Mr Iqbal highlighted the importance of utilising the 10,000 training opportunities offered by China across multiple sectors. He stressed the need for a transparent framework to ensure that the right people receive training aligned with institutional needs, enabling Pakistan to secure durable capacity-building gains.
The meeting also reviewed progress in priority areas, including the Multan-Sukkur Motorway, IT graduate training, computational infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI), industrial relocation, industrial parks, mining, special economic zones, and agriculture.
It was decided to conduct data-driven studies on China’s industrial relocation trends and to map market segments where Pakistan has export strengths.
The minister noted that with China importing goods worth over $2 trillion annually, Pakistan should strategically aim to capture at least $30-50bn of this trade by building competitiveness and sectoral readiness.
He directed completion of an outcome-oriented study to identify high-potential export sectors, with the goal of creating an exportable surplus, attracting sustained investment, and strengthening the balance of payments over the medium term.
Calling for policy continuity and institutional reforms, the minister stressed the need for close engagement with the private sector, academia, and research institutions in areas such as industrial cooperation, technology, agriculture, energy, and human resource development.
According to projections, AI could contribute Rs24.9tr ($88.31bn) to Pakistan’s economy by 2030, raising the projected GDP of Rs171tr by 14.56pc. Agriculture, which makes up 24pc of GDP, could see 20+30pc productivity gains through AI-powered precision farming, while manufacturing and mining (15.1pc of GDP) may achieve 20-25pc improvements via automation.
Similarly, fintech (2pc) and the software industry (1.5pc) are projected to grow 20-30pc, while energy (3.8pc), defence (3.5pc), law & judiciary (1pc), and international collaborations (2pc) also hold 10-20pc growth potential, the minister said.

Those vague plans never came close to fruition. With the US serving as dishonest broker, the Bantustan-style deals Israel offered were understandably unacceptable to the Palestinians — as the Zionist state likely intended. The genocidal aim has simmered beneath the surface of every Israeli action since 1948. The difference now is that it is no longer latent.
The concept of ‘land for peace’ has re-emerged, though, in a different context. The czar-like ruler of Russia appears to have demanded the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, including parts that his troops have so far failed to conquer, as the price for halting the aggression he embarked upon over three years ago. The idea of ‘territorial exchanges’ presumably implies no more than a Russian withdrawal from some of the areas in the southeast.
 
 

President Donald Trump went into last week’s Anchorage summit with Vladimir Putin threatening “severe consequences” for Russia unless a ceasefire was agreed. He emerged somewhat chastened after three hours of what he had earlier described as a “listening exercise”, only to declare that a comprehensive peace agreement made more sense than a truce that might not last long. The notion that a ceasefire — desirable under any circumstances — could facilitate the trilateral Russia-Ukraine-US negotiations he wishes to arrange appears not have crossed his mind.
Announcement of the summit in Alaska — which was a Russian colony until Tsar Alexander II sold it to the US for less than two cents per acre — unleashed a flurry of diplomatic activity in Europe, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopping across the capitals where he is admired, and culminating in several European leaders deciding to rearrange their summer holiday schedules to accompany him to Washington. The heads of the EU and Nato were accompanied by the prime ministers of Italy and Britain and the presidents of France and Finland, alongside the German chancellor.

Save Ukraine, but don’t stop there.

The ‘Magnificent Seven’ (as they might see themselves) are likely to claim that they were there to safeguard Zelensky against the kind of bullying he experienced on his last visit to the White House. They could also be perceived as facilitators of the seven deadly sins that Trump revels in, given the level of kowtowing to his imperial majesty. Respectable economists have decried the EU’s recent trade deal with the US as a self-abasing disaster, involving commitments to, inter alia, invest in American fossil fuels and spend hundreds of billions on US weaponry.
 
 

Zelensky, too, resorted to abject obsequiousness after the tongue-lashing he received from the vacation-loving Vice-President J.D. Vance, and on Monday dressed up in a black suit for his White House appearance, while mouthing ‘thank yous’. Whether the brown-nosing will lead to direct talks between Putin and Zelensky, with Trump as a biased referee, remains to be seen. Trump dialled the Kremlin while the seven European leaders plus Zelensky were still in the White House, for what Putin’s spokesman described as a “frank and very constructive” discussion, implying some disagreement.
In Alaska, Putin was reportedly amenable to Western ‘security guarantees’ for what remains of Ukraine after an ongoing conflict that is said to have claimed a million lives on both sides. That’s a horrific toll, and there can be no question that ending the Russian-launched war would be a spectacular achie­vement.
Ceding a substantial chunk of its territory to the aggressor would be anathema to any Ukrainian leader, but it’s a bitter way out of an unwinnable war that Zelensky or any successor might eventually feel obliged to swallow as the price of peace. If that’s bound to be the unfortunate outcome, the sooner the better.
 
 

Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that while Trump trumpeted his discussions with the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen about “the massive Worldwide problem of missing children”, and in Alaska handed Putin a letter from first lady Melania Trump, touchingly requesting him to “restore … the melodic laughter” of children, neither of the women has offered evidence of concern about Gaza.
Washington Post reported recently that, according to the UN, “at least 55 children have been killed this year” in Ukraine, 43 of them in Russian attacks. That is a huge tragedy — while Israel’s Western-supplied munitions and starvation are killing an estimated 30 Palestinian children daily.
Unlike the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, Trump could halt the Palestinian genocide at a stroke. But he won’t, yet he hankers after the Nobel Peace Prize.

Once again, with regard to the merged areas, the drumbeats of change are becoming louder in the corridors of power. However, yet again, locals of the area are mere observers looking in from the outside.
In the aftermath of the US invasion of Afghanistan, then Fata, took centre stage in this region’s affairs. The Taliban took refuge along the Pak-Afghan border, with Tora Bora the most popular of the cave complexes. Soon after, by the mid-2000s, the Pakistani Taliban, or other militant groups, had taken control of most of Fata in Pakistan. A new great game took root in this belt that decimated the local culture, economy and lifestyle of its people. Unfortunately, the wrong conclusions were drawn.
The tribal nature of this area and its people, it was concluded, was the root cause for the spread of militancy and the area’s underdevelopment. So, it was decided by the then powers that be, that it was time to ‘mainstream’ Fata. National security experts saw it as a means to counter militancy, while West-influenced development specialists viewed it as the great liberation — freeing the barbaric tribesmen from their ‘past’, if you will.
 
 

Others decided it was time for Fata to cease to exist. Without any genuine consensus building, and on the illusion of a demand from a group of pseudo tribal youth, all major political parties of Pakistan, other than the JUI-F, voted for Fata to be merged with KP, with promises of peace, prosperity, legal rights and development.
It’s safe to say the merger has not gone as planned. It has failed to: secure the merged districts’ share in the NFC award, deliver functioning judicial services, provide promised government jobs or quota seats to residents, promote businesses or industry production, create employment opportunities, develop carefully planned urban centres, or even give the area sustained peace — all pre-merger promises.
If the merger of East and West Germany is an example of how to merge two developmentally unequal regions of similar ethnicity into one, Fata’s merger with KP is one of how not to. The tragedy is that local stakeholders, including the majority of the then elected members from Fata and influential elders and youth residing there, had highlighted these impracticalities that today the government is perplexed by. However, over the past few years, as political turmoil expectedly gripped the country, the merged districts’ problems took a back seat.

Residents of the merged areas have become too accustomed to decisions being imposed on them

Recently though, after global successes on the foreign policy front, following the conflict with India, the federal government seems to be willing to mend local fault lines within the country. In this regard, on June 3, 2025, a grand jirga by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was called in Peshawar of participants from all of KP’s conflict-affected districts, but predominantly the merged districts. Importantly, the jirga was also attended by the army chief and the KP chief minister, along with his cabinet and the province’s senior administrative staff. Two key demands of the provincial government were the release of funds for the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP), a special package for Fata following its merger with KP by the federal government but executed through the KP government, and the revival of the jirga system for administrative purposes.
Subsequently, by mid-June about Rs35 billion were released for the AIP scheme. To put this in context, in the first 11 months of the financial year prior to the jirga, only a little over Rs7bn had been released. That’s over 80 per cent of the total funds being released following this jirga. Similarly, a committee under the convenorship of Amir Muqam, federal minister for KANA & SAFRON, was formed by Mr Sharif, which included the chief minister, governor and senior representatives of the KP government to ‘explore the revival of jirga system and strengthening of civil administration’ for the merged areas.
However, this is where things start to become convoluted. Strong rumours are circulating that the aim of this committee is beyond just the extension of a jirga system. Rather it is to roll back the merger and restore the area’s semi-autonomous status as Fata, a claim the federal government rejects. While some merged district residents have welcomed this rumour regardless of the centre’s reasons, there are many others that fear the motivation behind this. Locals fear this is an attempt to take control of the merged districts’ mineral wealth after the failed attempt of passing a new mines and minerals law in KP.
Others fear that this might be part of a larger negotiated settlement with militant groups, since the rollback of the merger was a key demand of the TTP when negotiations took place with them during the tail end of Imran Khan’s government. Out of fear of public backlash, the KP government’s boycott of committee meetings, after originally asking for it and attending the initial meetings, has only added fuel to the fire. But trying to evade the problem won’t make it go away. The reality is that the current system is not working and reform is needed.
 
 

Unfortunately, the residents of the merged areas have become too accustomed to decisions being imposed on them and being made from the angle of ‘administering’ them. While the ongoing conflict against militants in the area has put reforms on hold for now, local apprehensions about the state’s intentions are understandable. Importantly, regardless of the policy the centre advocates, whether the revival of the jirga system or the merger’s rollback, the process by which they do it and for them to be cognisant of who they are doing it for, is key.
Regrettably, even the wording and membership of this committee seems to be for assisting the bureaucracy to regain their pre-merger control rather than for providing relief to the public. Overwhelmingly, locals are proponents of the jirga system, but community-led ones. Not the corrupted jirgas that had increasingly started under the supervision of the local administration. They want legal cover for community jirgas that even now take place.
Simply put, the federal government should ensure that local stakeholders are involved not just in the consultation process but also in decision-making for any reforms they intend.

• ‘Coalition of the willing’ discuss ways to press Putin to end invasion
• Geneva offers to host talks, grant Putin immunity from ICC warrants
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out sending troops, but envisioned extending US air power as Western nations began hashing out security guarantees for Ukraine before any potential summit with Russia.
Trump, in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at ending the war, brought Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and top European leaders to the White House on Monday, three days after his landmark encounter with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska.
Trump said President Putin, whom he called in the middle of Monday’s talks, had agreed to meet Zelensky and to accept some form of Western security guarantees for Ukraine against Russia – promises met with extreme caution by Kyiv and European leaders.
According to three sources familiar with the Trump call, Putin proposed holding the summit with Zelensky in Moscow. One source said Zelensky immediately said no to the Russian capital.
Trump, long a fierce critic of the billions of dollars in US support to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, said that European nations would take the lead by sending troops to secure any settlement, an idea that has been mulled by France and Britain.
“When it comes to security, they’re willing to put people on the ground,” Trump had said in an interview with Fox News.
“We’re willing to help them with things, especially, probably, if you talk about by air, because no one has the kind of stuff we have. Really, they don’t,” Trump said.
He added his “assurance” that no US ground troops would deploy to Ukraine, and he again categorically ruled out Ukraine joining the Western military alliance NATO.
Trump has sided with Putin in describing Kyiv’s NATO aspirations as a cause for the war, in which tens of thousands of people have died.
European leaders, Ukraine and Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden called the issue a pretext and pointed to Putin’s statements rejecting the historical legitimacy of Ukraine.
Allies discuss next steps
Following the Trump talks, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer brought together around 30 of Ukraine’s allies known as the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ for virtual consultations.
Starmer told them coalition teams and US officials would meet in the coming days to discuss security guarantees and “prepare for the deployment of a reassurance force if the hostilities ended,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.
“The leaders also discussed how further pressure, including through sanctions, could be placed on Putin until he showed he was ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion.”
Macron, speaking to reporters before leaving Washington, also called for additional sanctions if Putin does not show a willingness for peace.
Britain’s military chief, Admiral Tony Radakin, will travel to Washington on Tuesday for the talks on reassurances.
The military chiefs of staff of all NATO’s 32 member countries will also meet by video Wednesday to discuss Ukraine, officials said.
Geneva offers to host
Russia has warned that any solution must also protect its own interests. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state television channel Rossiya 24 that any deal must ensure the rights of “Russian-speaking people who live in Ukraine,” another issue cited by Moscow for the offensive launched in February 2022.
Moscow would surely be seen as a provocative location for a summit, with suggestions it would amount to a surrender by Ukraine.
Macron told French news channel LCI he wanted the summit to take place in Geneva, a historic venue for peace talks.
Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said the government would be ready to offer immunity to Putin, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court related to abuses in the war.
Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz have both said the summit could take place in two weeks.
Trump also is seeking a three-way summit involving him, while Macron has called for a four-way meeting to involve Europeans who will be vital to Ukraine’s security.

Speaking at a workshop organised by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the Pakistan Banks Association in Karachi recently, Mr Aurangzeb said the policy would soon be presented to the federal cabinet for approval. The reasons driving the government to frame an industrial policy framework are understandable: after years of painful macroeconomic adjustments that have seen industrial output shrink, factories close down, jobs lost and growth stagnate, the economy is showing tentative signs of stability.
Inflation has slowed, reserves have risen amid a stable exchange rate and an improved balance-of-payments position, interest rates are down even if they remain elevated and the fiscal deficit is narrowing under austere fiscal policies. Pakistan’s credit rating — though still in the speculative-grade category — has improved, while the bulls continue to lift the stock market. The hard-won economic recovery — even if fragile — has given the government confidence that the economy is poised to transition to the next phase of sustained growth. That is exactly why it wants to accelerate industrialisation and growth through business-friendly incentives.
 
 

Indeed, such strategies are important tools to attract fresh investments in priority industrial sectors. Global experience shows that fiscal, regulatory and other economic incentives and a positive business environment can foster industrial competitiveness, boost factory output and increase exports. Unfortunately, our own experience with previous industrial and export development policies has not been enviable.
We have seen successive governments formulate several ambitious policies, only to see them fail due to poor execution and an unreformed economic ecosystem. These strategies have mostly ended up rewarding inefficiencies in the economy through protectionism, subsidies and regulatory perks. Such ‘quick fixes’ have contributed more to the erosion of our economic competitiveness than to boosting resilience, and have prevented Pakistan from becoming part of global supply chains.
A new industrial policy isolated from complementary frameworks for the development of agriculture and services will not change anything. Besides, no strategy to grow the economy or industrialise the country can deliver results unless long-standing structural impediments like high energy costs and shortages, distortive taxation, low domestic savings, climate change challenges, and other factors are tackled alongside.
Without reforms in the entire ecosystem, even a well-drafted industrial policy will end up gathering dust. In the absence of complementary ecosystem reforms across industry, agriculture and services to create conditions conducive to competition, investment and innovation, even a meticulously prepared industrial policy will be doomed.

• Israeli forces kill at least 45 people in Gaza, Palestinian death toll hits 62,064
• UN says 265 aid workers slain in this year
JERUSALEM: A day after Hamas accepted a fresh proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, and signalled its readiness for a new round of talks aimed at ending nearly two years of war, Israel said it stood firm on its call for the release of all prisoners in any future Gaza ceasefire deal.
Mediators are awaiting an official Israeli response to the plan, with Qatar expressing guarded optimism for the new proposal, noting that it was “almost identical” to an earlier version previously agreed to by Israel.
But a senior Israeli official told AFP the government’s stance had not changed and demanded the release of all prisoners in any deal.
The two foes have held on-and-off indirect negotiations throughout the war, resulting in two short truces during which Israeli hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but they have ultimately failed to broker a lasting ceasefire.
Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have mediated the frequent rounds of shuttle diplomacy.
Egypt said Monday that it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel, adding “the ball is now in its court”.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said on Tuesday that Hamas had given a “very positive response, and it truly was almost identical to what the Israeli side had previously agreed to”.
“We cannot make any claims that a breakthrough has been made. But we do believe it is a positive point,” he added.
Mounting pressure
According to a report in Egyptian state-linked outlet Al-Qahera News, the latest deal proposes an initial 60-day truce, a partial hostage release, the freeing of some Palestinian prisoners and provisions allowing for the entry of aid.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to publicly comment on the plan, but said last week that his country would accept “an agreement in which all the [prisoners] are released at once and according to our conditions for ending the war”.
Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi said on social media that his group had “opened the door wide to the possibility of reaching an agreement, but the question remains whether Netanyahu will once again close it, as he has done in the past”.
Hamas’s acceptance of the proposal came as Netanyahu faced increasing pressure at home and abroad to end the war.
Over the weekend, tens of thousands took to the streets in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv to call for an end to the war and a deal to free the remaining priosners still held in Gaza.
 
 

The new proposal also comes after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to conquer Gaza City, fanning fears the new offensive will worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the devastated territory.
45 killed
Meanwhile, at least 45 people were killed by Israeli strikes and fire across the territory, the local civil defence agency reported on Tuesday.
A spokesman said the situation was “very dangerous and unbearable” in the Zeitoun and Sabra neighbourhoods of Gaza City, where he said “artillery shelling continues intermittently”.
The Israeli military declined to comment on specific troop movements, but later claimed that a strike in Khan Yunis overnight targeted a Hamas militant.
Sabra resident Hussein al-Dairi, 44, said “tanks are firing shells and mortars, and drones are firing bullets and missiles” in the neighbourhood.
“We heard on the news that Hamas had agreed to a truce, but the occupation is escalating the war against us, the civilians,” he added.
Israel’s campaign in Gaza has claimed the lives of at least 62,064 Palestinians so far, most of them civilians.
383 aid workers killed
A record 383 aid workers were killed last year, the United Nations said Tuesday, branding the figures and lack of accountability a “shameful indictment” of international apathy, and warning that this year’s toll was equally grim.
The 2024 figure was up 31 per cent on the year before, the UN said on World Humanitarian Day, “driven by the relentless conflicts in Gaza, where 181 humanitarian workers were killed, and in Sudan, where 60 lost their lives”.
It said state actors were the most common perpetrators of the killings last year, and most of the victims were local staff attacked in the line of duty or in their homes.
 
 

Besides those killed, 308 aid workers were wounded, 125 kidnapped and 45 detained.
“Humanitarians must be respected and protected. They can never be targeted,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.
“This rule is non-negotiable and is binding on all parties to conflict, always and everywhere. Yet red lines are crossed with impunity,” he said, calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice.

“On August 20 of this year, Mr Wang Yi, a member of the political bureau of the Chinese ruling party and foreign minister, and Mr Ishaq Dar, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Pakistan, will travel to Kabul to attend a trilateral meeting,” the Afghanistan foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
The discussions are expected to cover progress on earlier commitments, including counter-terrorism cooperation, extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan, and strengthening regional trade and connectivity.
“The participants of the meeting are expected to exchange views on the future of relations based on common interests, mutual understanding, and broad cooperation,” the ministry said. The gathering, the first of its kind hosted in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul, will bring together Wang, Dar and Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for a day-long dialogue.

Chinese diplomat to visit Islamabad on Thursday to co-chair high-level moot

Mr Wang will also hold bilateral meetings with senior Taliban leaders on political and economic cooperation. The last round of trilateral talks among the three countries’ foreign ministers was held in Beijing on May 21.
Islamabad visit
Following the Kabul meeting, the Chinese foreign minister is scheduled to travel to Islamabad to attend the Pakistan-China strategic dialogue on Aug 21, Dawn.com reported.
The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
According to the FO’s statement issued on Tuesday, “On the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar … Mr Wang Yi is visiting Islamabad for co-chairing the sixth Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on August 21, 2025.”
“The visit is part of the regular high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China to further deepen their ‘All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’, reaffirm support on the issues of respective core interests, enhance economic and trade cooperation, and reaffirm their joint commitment to regional peace, development and stability,” the statement added.
Last month, FM Dar met with Wang on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation event, where they discussed and reaffirmed mutual support in core sectors, including agriculture, mining, industry and security.

The final form was notified through SRO1561 of 2025 after a 40-day consultation period, following the draft version’s release for public feedback on July 7 this year.
The new form is currently available only in English, while the Urdu version is still awaited despite earlier government announcements. Weeks of delay in finalising the form had created uncertainty among taxpayers, which was finally resolved with the notification of the final version.
 
 

The interactive return form incorporates an auto-fill system that integrates data on purchases, assets, and tax deductions at source, ultimately generating a single return upon completion. It consists of eight digital windows, each with one input column, designed for a step-by-step process.
For instance, entering an employer’s name in the first window automatically fills in tax deduction details. Withholding tax deductions linked to CNIC numbers will also appear on the form. Similarly, entering bank account details will display closing balances, while registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will auto-populate, minimising manual entry.
The simplified return form is applicable to salaried individuals with additional rental income, as well as small businesses within a prescribed threshold. Taxpayers exceeding this threshold will be redirected to the standard filing process.
Through SRO1562 of 2025, the FBR has also introduced simplified electronic return forms for salaried individuals, associations of persons (AOPs), companies, and business professionals, with the aim of streamlining the filing process and enhancing transparency.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, taxpayers must begin filing returns soon after the close of the tax year, with September 30 set as the deadline.
SRO1562 also makes it mandatory for owners of immovable properties abroad to file an “Electronic Foreign Income and Assets Declaration for Resident Individuals”. Resident taxpayers must now disclose details of foreign rental properties, business income, overseas  assets, earnings, and bank accounts.
In addition, the FBR has notified separate electronic returns for non-residents with no Pakistan-source income, traders, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and salaried taxpayers.
Final versions of the electronic return for manufacturers, traders, and SMEs have also been issued.

• Other telcos also experience data service disruptions
ISLAMABAD: Heavy rainfall in Karachi caused widespread disruptions to PTCL internet and Ufone services, affecting subscribers across the country.
Since other telecom operators purchase wholesale internet from PTCL, users of Jazz, Zong and Telenor also experienced data service disruptions.
Netblocks, a global internet watchdog, confirmed a major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan, with PTCL being significantly impacted. National connectivity dropped to 20 per cent of ordinary levels.
Responding to a query, a PTCL spokesperson acknowledged the issue. “Our teams are diligently working to restore the services as quickly as possible. We regret any inconvenience caused,” the spokesperson said but did not mention the cause for the nationwide outage.
Sources in the Ministry of IT and Telecom suggested that the disruption might be due to a technical fault at the landing station of submarine cables in Karachi’s Clifton area.
“No submarine cable issue has been reported, so the problem is likely at the landing station and some technical fault in the main hub,” and official said. “As a result, it’s a nationwide outage now with upstream traffic facing issues too.”
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that technical teams were working to resolve the issue.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima attributed the disruptions to power outages and network congestion, with many towers down in Karachi.
“The other localised issue is temporary choking of the network as too many people were stranded at the same spot and almost everyone was either making calls or receiving them. And now with PTCL going dead, all connectivity has shifted at telephony creating more choking,” Ms Fatima added.
Karachi’s 12 million mobile phone subscribers were affected, with the load shifting to the remaining three telcos after Ufone’s service disruption.
A PTA official noted that running generators for 12 hours was not feasible, and supplying diesel to towers was challenging in the current situation.
He added that more than 200 telecom sites (towers) were damaged in the flood in KP and most of the towers were restored in flood-affected areas of Swat, Buner, Shangla, etc, and the teams were ensuring restoration of remaining sites.
As heavy urban flooding hit Karachi, residents faced telephony disruptions in many areas, losing connections with each other.
Saher, a Gulistan-i-Jauhar resident, expressed concern: “I received one call from my husband, Jamal, saying he was stuck on the street, but his phone isn’t connecting since sunset. I’m really worried.”

• Villages in flood-hit districts cut off due to landslides; bridges washed away in downpour
• Tarar says 25,000 people rescued in past two days, vows unified response to ‘national emergency’
• ISPR chief says nine units of military, paramilitary actively involved in KP, GB relief efforts
ISLAMABAD: As the government vowed to step up relief efforts in the flood-hit districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa continued to reel under the impact of torrential rains with more flash floods reported in several districts of the province.
KP Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) said the death toll since Friday had surged to 365, including 225 in the worst-affected Buner, while more than 180 people sustained injuries over the past several days.
On Tuesday, Upper and Lower South Waziristan districts fared the worst: one woman was killed in Upper South Waziristan. Upper South Waziristan’s Servekai subdivision was the hardest hit, where raging torrents washed away roads and bridges. The Tanga road was blocked due to landslides, while the Spalatoi, Bangashwala, and Madina Mor bridges collapsed due to the heavy flow, severing road links with remote villages.
Likewise, heavy rainfall triggered flash floods in the hill streams of Tank district and surrounding areas, sending powerful torrents into the city and submerging several localities. Offi­cials said a flooded stream coming from South Waziristan reached Tank’s Garah Baloch village and submerged the city. The floodwater rose above the Garah Baloch bridge, forcing the closure of the Tank-Waziristan highway to all types of traffic. The main South Waziristan road was also blocked, disconnecting the road link between the two districts.
The floodwater also entered low-lying neighbourhoods, forcing the residents in the vulnerable areas to move to safer places amid a rise in the water level.
Though the district administration, along with rescue teams and heavy machinery, remained stationed at the Garah Baloch bridge to monitor the situation, the officials feared incessant rainfall could worsen the flooding and pose a greater danger to Tank’s urban and rural settlements.
In Abbottabad, the downpour damaged the Lora Nagri Bridge and cut off access to hundreds of villages. The bridge, a vital connection between Tehsil Lora and Rawalpindi and Abbottabad, partially collapsed, causing a complete halt in traffic. The central structure is reported to be sinking, further threatening its integrity.
Swabi toll surges to 24
In Swabi, the death toll in the Gadoon Amazi area surged to 24, including eight children, as the search for people swept away in flash floods continued on Tuesday. Rahim Jadoon, the Topi mayor, told Dawn that 23 people had been buried. Seven bodies were recovered on Tuesday.
Mr Jadoon, present in the affected area, said that as per the locals, about a dozen people were still buried under the rubble: “Over 12 houses collapsed in Dalori,” he confirmed.
 
 

As the entire village of Dalori and its surroundings were reeling from the shock, the locals could not even mourn their dead. “No one is in a position to hold a traditional three-day mourning period, as more and more bodies are being recovered,” locals said, adding, “We are in a complete state of pain and misery.”
In separate development rescuers have recovered the dead body of man who drowned in the Karnal Sher Khan’s area on Monday.
Rangaiz Khan, provincial minister for transport who was elected from the area, said that the district authorities did not have excavators, forcing the district administration and other departments to hire them from private contractors.
 
 

In Mansehra, rescuers, including volunteers and officials of Tehsil Municipal Administration and Rescue 1122, on Tuesday recovered another body from the flood-hit Haleem Bandi Neelband area of the district.
“A total of 20 men, women and children were swept away in the flood earlier this week, and now 18 bodies have been recovered. The search for the remaining two is still underway,” Mazhar Muzafar Awan, Baffa-Pakhal tehsil municipal officer, told reporters.
‘Unified response’
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the government was dealing with this “national emergency under a national response and all relevant departments, including the armed forces of Pakistan, are working in complete unison in this regard”, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
He was briefing the media persons along with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and National Disaster Management Author­ity Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik in Islamabad.
The minister said at least 25,000 people affected due to floods caused by torrential rains had been rescued since Aug 17 and moved to safer places, adding that almost 70 per cent of the electricity infrastructure damaged by floods had been restored.
The NDMA chief said bodies of many missing people, trapped under the rubble, had been retrieved, adding that the authority had already dispatched two relief convoys carrying relief goods to Swabi, Malakand and Buner, while another convoy would leave for Shangla.
‘Search and rescue, and flood relief operations’
The ISPR DG, as per Dawn.com, provided a summary of the efforts by the military in the northern areas in the wake of the monsoon rains. He said that KP received eight units of Infantry and Frontier Constabulary (FC), who were directly involved in search and rescue, and flood relief operations, while GB had one, taking the total to nine units.
He also said that one engineer brigade, two engineer battalions and two urban search and rescue teams were deployed in KP, while two engineer battalions were sent to GB, where they were “working on road opening and removing landslides”.
“Three medical units were deployed in KP, while nine medical camps were deployed in GB. More than 6,304 people have been treated.”
“In search and rescue operations, 6,903 people have been rescued,” he added.
Gen Chaudhry also said that one-day rations were allocated, amounting to 585 tonnes, adding that army aviation was deployed to oversee medical casualty evacuation, emergencies, and transportation of food and medicine.
He highlighted that multiple bridges and roads were repaired, while the telecommunication infrastructure in affected areas, including Shangla and Buner, was being repaired alongside the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.
Speaking more specifically about affected regions, the DG ISPR said that the army deployed two battalions in Buner, two battalions in Shangla, one in Swat, one FC wing each in Bajaur and Dir, and one company in Swabi.
“These are dedicated resources … which were deployed 24 hours for flood relief rescue operations,” he said.
While speaking about logistics support, the DG said, “In Peshawar, there were 2,500 ready-to-eat meals and 20 tonnes of rations. In Nowshera, there are 5,000 ready-to-eat meals and 505 tonnes of rations,” he said, adding that they were being transported by road and helicopters.
He also highlighted that 90 roads were damaged in KP. Of those, nine roads were fully operational and 86 were partially restored, he added.
UNDP sends aid
On the other hand, the UNDP Pakistan said it was actively assessing needs on the ground to bridge immediate humanitarian gaps while also laying the groundwork for longer-term recovery and resilience as the crisis unfolds in the wake of floods across the country.
“Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones, homes and livelihoods,” said UNDP Officer-in-Charge Van Nguyen in a statement issued in Islamabad.
UNDP has provided emergency relief items to assist flood-affected families in the hardest-hit regions of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. These supplies include 180 tents, 103 stretchers, 230 sleeping bags, 130 floodlights and 53 first aid kits, among other essentials.
Muqaddam Khan in Swabi, Nisar Ahmed Khan in Manshera, A.K. Wazir in South Waziristan Lower,  Muhammad Irfan Mughal in Dera Ismail Khan and Rashid Javed in Abbottabad  contributed to this report.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants.
“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” age­ncy spok­esman Matthew Trag­e­sser said in a statement.
“Immigration benefits — including to live and work in the United States — remain a privilege, not a right.” The US Immi­gration and Nationality Act, which dates back to 1952, defines anti-Americanism which at the time primarily focused on communists.
But the Trump administration has already moved aggressively to deny or rescind short-term visas for people deemed to go against US foreign policy interests, especially on Israel.
The latest guidance on immigration decisions said that authorities will also look at whether applicants “promote anti-Semitic ideologies.”

Last week, National Assembly had passed the amendment to the ATA.
Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Muhammad Tallal Badar moved the Anti-terrorism Amendment Bill 2025 to amend the ATA in the House, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
A copy of the bill, available with Dawn.com read: “The government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case maybe, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this
regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording
reasons thereof, issue order for the preventative detention of any person.”
This amendment was made to sub-section (1) of Section 11EEEE of the ATA.
Any person suspected of activities against national security or safety will be detained, according to the bill, adding that persons involved in target killing, kidnapping for ransom, extortion can be detained for three months.
The bill also added that it applies “against whom sufficient grounds exist of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry”.
The bill available stated that the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
If a detention order is issued by the army or civil forces, the investigation will be conducted by a joint investigation team, according to the bill.
“The inquiry will be conducted by no police officer below the rank of of Superintendent of Police, Intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies,” the bill added.
JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza moved certain amendments to the bill but the House rejected them with majority of votes, APP added.
The house passed the bill through clause by clause reading.
The statement of objects and reasons of the bill said that the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework.
“The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the Act ibid are required to re-inserted to empower the government, Armed Forces and Civil Armed Forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed.
This will also provide law enforcement enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It would facilitate the use of joint interrogation teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.
Earlier, responding to various points raised by lawmakers in the Senate, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said: “Currently the country is facing menace of terrorism and amendments proposed by Syed Naveed Qamar have already been incorporated to make it more effective.”
The bill has also already passed judicial scrutiny tests, he said adding that that a three years sun-set clause has also been added in it.
Tarar said that under Clause 2 of the amendment, the detainee would have presented before the Magistrate within 24 hours.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar of PTI said that they were also against the menace of terrorism and wanted to curb it. However, he continued that “some of its clauses are against the law and constitution so the bill should be referred to the committee”.
Speaking on the occasion, PML-N Senator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui emphasised that no leniency should be shown toward terrorism.
“We do not want terrorists roaming freely while innocent people are slaughtered in different provinces, on passenger trains like the Jaffar Express, or in targeted attacks. These acts weaken our federation and create mistrust between the people and the state,” he observed.
Siddiqui urged lawmakers to view anti-terrorism legislation in its proper spirit as we have lost nearly 100,000 lives to the menace of terrorism. “We must either surrender to militants or legislate to resist them. Such laws can prevent crime and also curb forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions,” he said.
Senator Siddiqui urged all parties to take anti-terrorism legislation in good faith rather than perceiving it as a tool against political opponents.
He said that the government and opposition must ensure transparent communication with the public and media regarding legislative measures, according to APP.
PPP’s Senator Sherry Rehman in her speech said that her party has not passed  the bill without an “extensive review” of all the clauses.
“Our legislative committee noted that it was the same bill all parties had passed through a multi-parties conference after the Army Public School attack. It was in effect for two years,” she noted.
She continued that preventive detention is not a matter to be taken lightly.
“Many of us have personally experienced cases of missing persons.
“I request our law minister to clarify, for the civil society and opposition alike — including in press conferences — the definitions within this law and how they will be applied,” she added.
Section 11EEEE of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern over the passage.</p><small>2025-08-19 19:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2009134429b795f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931898/public-holiday-today-as-karachi-declares-emergency-in-the-wake-of-heavy-rain' target='_blank'><strong>Public holiday today as Karachi declares emergency in the wake of heavy rain</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government has declared a public holiday on Wednesday in Karachi following heavy rainfall lashing the metropolis.
 






In a separate notification, the Sindh government’s school department has ordered all private and public educational institutions under its purview in the city to remain closed today due to the heavy rainfall.
With citizens experiencing extended power failures, traffic jams and general mayhem as heavy rain on Tuesday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab declared a rain emergency amid warnings of more showers to come.
According to the Met Office, as of 8pm Tuesday, Gulshan-i-Hadeed had recorded the highest level of rain at 170 millimetres, followed by Airport Old Area at 158.5mm, Jinnah Terminal 153mm, Nazimabad 149.6mm, Surjani Town 145.2mm, Keamari 140mm, Saadi Town 140.2mm, Defence Housing Authority Phase VII 134mm, University Road 133mm, PAF Base Faisal 128mm, North Karachi 108.4mm, Korangi 132.2mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 98mm, PAF Masroor Base 87mm, Orangi Town 66.2mm and Bahria Town 4.8mm.
It continued to pour intermittently over large parts of the city late into Tuesday night, with prayers the only resort for citizens facing prolonged electricity breakdowns with no end in sight.
According to a notification issued by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), the mayor “cancelled all types of leave, including weekly holidays” for the essential services departments, directing them to remain available.
He also directed the municipal services, the fire brigade and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) departments of KMC to establish a Rain Emergency Cell in coordination with all essential services departments.
 






On the instructions of the Karachi East Zone’s Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Dr Farrukh Ali, the East Zone police is on high alert to deal with the possible effects of rains, the DIG’s Media Cell said in a statement.
“Clear orders have been issued to all SDPOs (sub-divisional police officers) and SHOs (station house officers) to remain present in their respective areas, ensure drainage, traffic flow and take immediate steps to deal with any emergency,” the statement said.
It added that the DIG had instructed that the protection of life and property of citizens should be ensured at all costs, paying special attention to low-lying areas. Rescue teams and helplines should be kept active, and timely guidance and assistance should be provided to the public.
 
 

The DIG statement also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary movement during bad weather, advising them to contact 15 or the nearest police station immediately in case of any emergency.
“Police are with the public at all times in all weathers,” it added.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani contacted various town chairmen, municipal committee chairmen and municipal commissioners over the phone to seek details regarding the situation after the rains.
The chairmen of all towns and union councils and the municipal commissioners should immediately use all resources to drain water from the roads on an emergency basis.
“In the first phase, all important highways should be cleared so that the delivery of machinery or other equipment to the affected areas can be ensured,” he said in a statement from his office, adding that small highways and roads should be tackled next.
He urged citizens to limit their movement due to water on the roads to avoid any accidents, and also urged them to stay away from power poles and other electrical installations.
“In some areas, due to the power outage by K-Electric, sewage pumping stations are facing difficulties. As an alternative, these pumping stations are being operated with emergency generators,” he said.
A rain emergency cell was also established at the Governor’s House, with citizens impacted by the rain and traffic directed to immediately reach out for help at 1366.
The cell will remain active around the clock and provide timely aid to victims.
“Citizens will not be left alone in difficult times; all possible facilities will be provided,” Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori was quoted as saying in a statement.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
On Monday, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani had said that arrangements were in place to deal with the upcoming monsoon spell as parts of Karachi received light rain on Monday.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains expected to impact Karachi and other parts of the province.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.</p><small>2025-08-19 19:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19212242ec5b6dd.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931896/flight-operations-disrupted-as-monsoon-rain-hits-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Flight operations disrupted as monsoon rain hits Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Flight operations were affected at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport on Tuesday as the city received heavy rainfall, according to a statement issued by the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA).

In June, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.
In January of 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death, sparking outrage across the nation.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-08-19 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1914031673b22d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931867/babar-rizwan-demoted-as-pcb-announces-central-contracts-for-2025-26-no-players-in-category-a' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Rizwan demoted as PCB announces central contracts for 2025-26; no players in Category A</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday announced central contracts for 30 male cricketers for the upcoming 2025–26 international season, with no players placed in the top-tier Category A.
Last month, the number of male and female players in the central contract lists rose, according to PCB’s 2025-26 budget documents.
According to a press release by PCB today, the contracts, effective from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, “reflect the board’s continued commitment to recognising and supporting national talent.”
This year’s roster sees ten players each placed in Categories B, C, and D, with the PCB acknowledging that “no player has been selected for Category A in this cycle.”
 






Pertinent to mention is that Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan were the only two players in Category A for the 2024-25 season.
The duo have seen their stock fall over the past year; the former batting mainstays having been sidelined from the T20 squad.
“Compared to last year’s list of 27 contracted players, the PCB has expanded the pool to 30, including 12 fresh additions, highlighting the emergence of promising new talent and the board’s strategic focus on squad depth and future development,” PCB said.
 
 

The new entrants are: Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Mirza and Sufyan Moqim.
Five players have been promoted owing to their last year’s performances, PCB said. They are: Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha and Shadab Khan — all promoted from C to B category.
Additionally, nine players have retained their positions in the same categories. They are: Abdullah Shafique (Category C), Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jnr — all in Category D, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Saud Shakeel — all in Category C and Shaheen Shah Afridi (Category B).
PCB noted that eight players have missed out on contracts this year, namely Aamir Jamal, Haseebullah, Kamran Ghulam, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Huraira, Muhammad Irfan Khan and Usman Khan — all in Category (D).
List of this year’s centrally contacted players:
Category B (10 players): Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi
