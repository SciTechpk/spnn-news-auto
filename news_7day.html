<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/282201550bd6a0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957944/sanaullah-voices-support-for-meetings-between-imran-and-relatives-subject-to-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Sanaullah voices support for meetings between Imran and relatives, subject to conditions</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah voiced support on Friday for meetings between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his family members, subject to certain conditions.
Imran has been in jail since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. His family and party members have protested outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding a meeting but have been repeatedly denied despite orders from the courts.
Imran’s sister Aleema Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier.
Speaking on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, Sanaullah said: “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this.”
He further said that political discussions could also not take place in the meetings, saying that no law allowed a prisoner to lead, plan and guide movements on the outside from jail.
The senator maintained that it was not permitted for family members to hold press conferences outside the prison premises and for a barrage of messages to appear on social media against the state and officials.
Sanaullah argued that the IHC’s order to facilitate meetings was also contingent on similar conditions as he laid out.
“They (Imran’s family and legal team) should sit down with jail authorities and settle matters,” he said, saying that the process of meetings should be better conducted without violations from either side.
Sanaullah later said the meetings were not being allowed because they were not being conducted in accordance with the law. “The meeting should be in accordance with the law,” he maintained, reiterating that there should be no violation from either side.
The contempt petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday.
Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema filed the contempt plea.
Meetings not subject to whims or wishes: Barrister Aqeel
Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said meetings could not be held on anyone’s ‘whims or wishes’.
He said meetings could only be held under existing prison rules and the prerogative in this regard rests with the superintendent.
Malik added that the prison administration could curtail a prisoner’s privilege to have meetings “in the public interest” if a necessary cause was found.
However, he did not elaborate on the criteria by which the Adiala jail superintendent decides when to allow meetings or not.
Malik also maintained that the rules prevented any political discussion.
Questioned about the KP chief minister’s threat to launch a protest on Tuesday if a meeting was not allowed, the minister said the government would take the necessary measures in such a situation.</p><small>2025-11-28 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28233835d3b47c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957949/afghan-suspect-in-us-national-guard-shooting-to-be-charged-with-murder' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan suspect in US National Guard shooting to be charged with murder</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members will be charged with first-degree murder, a US official said Friday, after one of the soldiers died of her wounds as Donald Trump pledged to suspend migration from “third-world countries.”
The announcement marks an escalation in charges facing the assailant, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who the US media said was part of the “Zero Units” — a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary force.
“There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” Jeanine Pirro, the attorney for Washington, DC, told the Fox News programme ‘Fox & Friends’.
“It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn’t know what was coming.”
Pirro’s announcement comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged on Thursday to “seek the death penalty” against Lakanwal, describing him as a “monster.”



Pirro said Lakanwal opened fire with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver on a group of guardsmen on patrol just a few blocks from the White House on Wednesday, the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member deployed in the US capital as part of Trump’s crackdown on crime, died from her wounds, the president said on Thursday. He said the other soldier wounded in the attack, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was “fighting for his life”.
“We still have hope,” Pirro said of Wolfe. “He’s still in critical condition. We are doing everything we can to assist his family.”
The shooting has brought together three politically explosive issues: Trump’s controversial use of the military on American soil, immigration, and the lingering legacy of the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan — America’s longest war.
‘Rigorous reexamination’
Late on Thursday, Trump pledged on Truth Social to “permanently pause” migration from “all Third World Countries” and threatened to reverse “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, in a new escalation in his anti-immigration stance.
When asked which specific nationalities would be affected, the US Department of Homeland Security pointed AFP to a list of 19 countries — including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar — facing US travel restrictions under a previous order from Trump in June.
Separately, Joseph Edlow, Trump’s director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said on Thursday he had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” When asked to specify the countries, the USCIS referred AFP to the same list of 19 countries.

More than 1.6 million US green card holders, roughly 12 per cent of the total permanent resident population, were born in the countries listed, according to the latest immigration data available on the agency’s ‘Eligible to Naturalise Dashboard’ analysed by AFP.
Afghanistan, which has over 116,000 green card holders, is also affected by a total halt of immigration application processing, ordered by the Trump administration after the shooting.
CIA director John Ratcliffe said the suspect, Lakanwal, had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.
He added that he had been brought to the United States as part of a program to evacuate Afghans who had worked with the agency after the Taliban toppled the American-backed government in 2021.
Lakanwal had been living in the western state of Washington with his family and had driven across the country to the capital, officials said.
The heads of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security and other senior Trump appointees all insisted that Lakanwal had been granted unvetted access to the US because of lax asylum policies in the wake of the chaotic final US withdrawal from Afghanistan under former president Biden.
However, AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the US after the military withdrawal, said they had undergone “some of the most extensive security vetting” of any migrants.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28222323bfe3eee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957947/lesco-restores-power-to-lahores-bahria-town-after-payment-of-dues' target='_blank'><strong>Lesco restores power to Lahore’s Bahria Town after payment of dues</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) restored power supply to four housing projects in Bahria Town Lahore after the society’s administration paid outstanding bills amounting to Rs682 million.
“The power supply has been restored to four Bahria town projects, including main Bahria Town near Mohlanwal,” a Lesco spokesperson told Dawn.
The power supply was suspended yesterday, inviting criticism from the residents, who also announced holding a protest demonstration in front of the Bahria Town offices after Friday prayers on this issue.
According to Lesco CEO Mr Ramzan Butt, the last date for bill payment was November 21, which was extended to November 23 on the request of the housing society’s officials.
After failing to pay, the officials had requested another day’s extension and continued securing more until Wednesday.
“Since the final and last date was November 27 (yesterday), they, instead of paying bills, approached the court, reportedly. But before they could get the court decision, we disconnected the power supply to four projects, including the main Bahria town (near Mohlanwal) that alone has dues of over Rs530m,” Butt explained to Dawn.
In 2024, Lesco had disconnected the power supply to Bahria Town over the non-payment of more than Rs762m in electricity bills.
The real estate company has come under scrutiny before as well for power issues. In June last year, scores of residents in Bahria Town’s operations in Islamabad petitioned against overbilling and deductions by the management on electricity generated through solar power.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/282219526d0edf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957946/un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-concerned-by-constitutional-amendments-immunity-provisions' target='_blank'><strong>UN high commissioner for human rights concerned by constitutional amendments, immunity provisions</strong></a><br><p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said on Friday that Pakistan’s hastily adopted constitutional amendments seriously undermine judicial independence and raise grave concerns about military accountability and respect for the rule of law.
In a statement issued in Geneva, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society.
Turk warned that the amendments run counter to the separation of powers that underpin the rule of law and safeguard the protection of human rights in Pakistan.
“Under the changes adopted on November 13, a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has been given powers over constitutional cases, replacing the previous authority of the Supreme Court, which will now only deal with civil and criminal cases,” the statement read.
It added that the systems for appointing, promoting and transferring judges changed in a manner raising “serious concerns about undermining the structural independence of Pakistan’s judiciary”.
Turk noted that the president and prime minister had already assigned the chief justice and the first set of FCC judges.







“These changes, taken together, risk subjugating the judiciary to political interference and executive control,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“Neither the executive nor legislative should be in a position to control or direct the judiciary, and the judiciary should be protected from any form of political influence in its decision-making.
“A core measure of judicial independence is a tribunal’s insulation from political interference by the government. If judges are not independent, experience shows that they struggle to apply the law equally and to uphold human rights for all in the face of political pressure.”
The UN also noted that the 27th amendment establishes lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrest for the president, field marshal, marshall of the air force and admiral of the fleet.
“Sweeping immunity provisions like these undermine accountability, which is a cornerstone of the human rights framework and democratic control of the armed forces under the rule of law,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“I am concerned that these amendments risk far-reaching consequences for the principles of democracy and rule of law which the Pakistani people hold dear.”

 

On November 13, the president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The House first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on November 10 and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28220245afa8b9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957945/monument-to-first-man-in-space-yuri-gagarin-unveiled-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Monument to first man in space Yuri Gagarin unveiled in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>The Russian Embassy on Friday announced that a monument to Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel to space and return, was unveiled in Islamabad’s Fatima Jinnah Park.
Gagarin became the first man in space in April 1961, when he uttered the famous words “Let’s go” as his Vostok rocket blasted off from southern Kazakhstan. After a voyage lasting just 108 minutes, the 27-year-old cosmonaut ejected from his capsule and parachuted down into a field in the Saratov region of central Russia.
According to a post on X, the unveiling ceremony was attended by Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Russian Ambassador Albert P Khorev, Pakistani Ambassador to Russia Faisal Niaz Tirmizi and pilot-cosmonaut Elena Serova.
“This is the greatest feat in our shared history. A huge number of scientists are engaged in space research. Let this work benefit all countries of the world,” the statement read, quoting Tsivilev.
The post added that the unveiling was scheduled to coincide with the 10th meeting of the Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation.
The embassy extended its gratitude to the International Charitable Fund “Dialogue of Cultures-United World” for providing a bust of Gagarin, the St Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange for its support in installing it and Pakistani authorities for their assistance in this project.
Tsivilev also announced that next year, a Russia-Pakistan conference on cosmonautics and space infrastructure would be held in Islamabad.

The border, which connects Lahore with the Indian city of Amritsar, is the only active land crossing between the two neighbours. It was closed to general traffic following a brief but intense military conflict earlier this year.
The high commission identified the prisoners repatriated today as Asghar Ali, Ramzan and Muhammad Idrees, saying that it would continue working towards the “release and repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in India”.







The Foreign Office (FO) told Dawn the identities of the arrested fishermen and when they were taken into custody.
Ramzan, 43, from Lahore, was arrested in 2010 by India on charges of illegally crossing the border and possessing narcotics. After receiving consular access, his status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in February 2011.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Idrees from Narowal was arrested in 1995 for allegedly crossing the border illegally and was awarded 16 years of imprisonment. He was verified as a Pakistani national in 2005, 10 years after his arrest.
Asghar Ali, 39, from Sadiqabad, was arrested for allegedly crossing the border illegally in 2002. His status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in 2006.
Earlier this month, the fisherfolk community in Pakistan called for the immediate release of fishermen imprisoned in India during a conference at a festival in the coastal belt of Badin, while in September, a Pakistani national imprisoned in India, Raqib Bilal, was repatriated via the Wagah border.
In July, the foreign ministries of Islamabad and New Delhi exchanged lists detailing the number of prisoners held in each other’s countries.
According to a statement from the FO in September, “The government of Pakistan handed over a list of 246 Indian or believed-to-be-Indian prisoners (53 civilian prisoners and 193 fishermen) to a representative of the Indian High Commission, Islamabad.
“Simultaneously, the government of India shared a list of 463 Pakistani or believed-to-be-Pakistani prisoners (382 civilian prisoners and 81 fishermen) to a diplomat from the High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi,” FO added.
Fishermen are frequently arrested and jailed by the authorities in both Pakistan and India. On November 1, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that a fisherman from Pakistan was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and coerced into carrying out tasks for New Delhi’s intelligence agency.
The minister said that law enforcement agencies had apprehended a fisherman named Ijaz Mallah while he was out fishing in the sea.
“In September this year, when he was out fishing, he was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and after the arrest, he was taken to an undisclosed location and was coerced and forced to do some tasks for the Indian intelligence agency,” he said.
Also, this month, the fisherfolk community called for the immediate release of Pakistani fishermen imprisoned in India, as dozens of families continue to suffer while their loved ones remain behind bars in the neighbouring country, despite constitutional protections and bilateral obligations regarding unintentional crossings of the maritime boundary.
Pakistani fishermen released and repatriated earlier this year reported being tortured by Indian authorities, including hard labour, beatings and being burned with metal plates.</p><small>2025-11-28 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/282135515d15c75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957943/fm-dar-elected-chairman-of-economic-cooperation-organisations-council-of-ministers' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar elected chairman of Economic Cooperation Organisation’s council of ministers</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was on Friday elected chairman of the Economic Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Ministers (ECO-COM), according to the Foreign Office (FO).
The ECO was founded as the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD) in 1964 by Pakistan, Iran and Turkiye, before it changed its name in 1985. The organisation’s website states that its purpose is “to create amenable and conducive conditions for the continued promotion of sustainable economic development in the region”.
The 10 member states include Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
According to an FO statement, today’s meeting of the COM was held virtually and Dar underscored the body’s important role in fostering prosperity, economic integration and connectivity in the region.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025 and expressed Pakistan’s intent, as incoming chair of the ECO COM, to work closely with member states in finalising the ECO Vision 2026-2035,” the FO stated.
“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister emphasised Pakistan’s priority to strengthen multimodal transport corridors, harmonise customs frameworks, and align transport systems for seamless regional integration,” it added.







According to the FO, Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to key regional connectivity projects, including the Islamabad–Tehran-Istanbul Rail Corridor, the Eurasian Multimodal Corridor and the Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan Railway.
The FM recalled the Regional Transport Ministers’ Conference in Islamabad last month and noted that Pakistan is “actively shaping regional transport cooperation in road, rail, maritime and digital connectivity”.
“He (Dar) also highlighted Pakistan’s liberalised visa policy, enabling easier access for businesspersons and tourists from 126 countries,” the statement read.
Dar stressed the need for ECO members to bolster cooperation in various sectors and spheres, including sustainable transport, transit trade, customs harmonisation, climate-resilient infrastructure and counter-terrorism.
In an address to the meeting, he said that Pakistan sees the ECO as a useful platform to reinforce ties among members through multilateral engagements.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its efforts to advance the goals of regional connectivity through integrated and efficient transport corridors,” he said, adding that establishing transport corridors in the region was a key goal of Islamabad’s.
“Despite the above efforts, we all need to acknowledge that there is significant untapped potential for improving the sustainability of transport and transit trade among the ECO regional countries,” he said, outlining four key areas  of focus:

Full implementation of the Transit Transport Framework Agreement (TTFA);
Development of a coordinated multimodal transport network;
Simplification and harmonisation of customs and border procedures through capacity building and technology transfer; and
Promotion of sustainable and climate-resilient transport systems aligned with our international environmental commitments.

Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban are at their lowest point in the four years since the group came to power. Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since October 11 and trade has been at a standstill following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The third round concluded without any concrete agreement.
The situation deteriorated again following Afghan accusations of Pakistani airstrikes earlier this week, which the military and government ministers denied. The Afghan side also threatened retaliation.
Questioned about the threat and the shaky ceasefire during his weekly press briefing, FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said: “The ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan does not imply a traditional ceasefire implemented after two belligerent states in a war or a conflict situation. Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire implied that there would be no terrorist attack by Afghan-sponsored terrorist proxies into Pakistan. There have been major terrorist attacks after this ceasefire.”
“So, interpreting in that sense, the ceasefire is not holding because the ceasefire was about ceasing terrorist attacks inside Pakistan by TTP, FAK, and Afghan nationals using Afghan soil.”

 

He continued that “if Afghan nationals are attacking, as they did so in Islamabad and elsewhere, so we cannot be very optimistic about the ceasefire, which, in any case, I mentioned, is not the traditional ceasefire between the two states, but to be understood in the context of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.”
The spokesperson said that security forces remained fully alert and the military’s preparedness was robust in response to any alleged threat from Afghanistan.
“The security challenges we face would be addressed with the seriousness that they merit.”







The spokesperson was also questioned about allegations from the Afghan Taliban about Pakistan harbouring the banned militant Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group to which he responded that it was an “outrageous” claim.
“It is a figment of the imagination of the Afghan Taliban regime. Afghan side wants to externalise this menace of terrorism, which inherently is on their own soil and of their own making. They want to externalise it to Pakistan, naming various organisations. Any extremist terrorist element in Pakistan is treated, is dealt, as per our laws. This statement, of presence of any ISIS in Pakistan is totally baseless.”
Even before this week’s current flare-up in tensions, the information ministry earlier this month said that all terrorists involved in an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens.
The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy. Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had also said that a suicide bomber who carried out an attack outside the Islamabad district and sessions court building was “not a Pakistani national”.
Twelve people were killed and 36 were injured in the suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in terrorism, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies following the two incidents.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also subsequently said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-11-28 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/282011507f76904.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956482/cricket-lifes-a-pitch' target='_blank'><strong>CRICKET: LIFE’S A PITCH</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is probably the only cricketing nation where the discussion around pitches becomes bigger than debates on team selection or performance.
This obsession did not appear recently. It really took shape three years ago, when Pakistan went through a painful home stretch. They lost a Test series to Australia with two dull draws and one defeat, were whitewashed 3-0 by England on lifeless tracks, and drew both home Tests against New Zealand.
These series exposed a major flaw. Instead of being an advantage, Pakistan’s home conditions had become neutral or even harmful. Flat pitches were presented as good for batting and supposedly good for long term development, but they killed any chance of producing results. When the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman at the time, Ramiz Raja, defended this philosophy by saying it would take a year for Pakistan to be able to prepare proper five-day Test pitches, fans felt even more frustrated. Pakistan was not only losing matches but also losing identity.
The shift that has happened under the new management is remarkable. A set-up featuring Aaqib Javed, Azhar Ali and Aleem Dar walked in at a time when England had already beaten Pakistan in the opening Test of a three-match series in 2024. From that difficult position, Pakistan bounced back to win the remaining two Tests. After three years without a single home Test victory, this was more than just a result. It was a sign of a new mindset. Pakistan started using pitches as a strategic weapon rather than defaulting to flat surfaces that pleased nobody.

Pakistan has finally figured out its home turf advantage and now it must trust it…

This new thinking carried into the next series against the West Indies. Pakistan again used spin-friendly pitches and, even though they lost one Test, the overall trend was clear. Matches produced results. Pakistan also lost one Test at home to South Africa in the current cycle, but the real highlight is that there have been no drawn Tests since this approach began. That is a huge shift from the previous era, where slow and dull pitches created repetitive draws.
With every change, however, comes noise. Once Pakistan started getting results on turning pitches, a new debate began to dominate social media and television. People began claiming that Pakistan would destroy its fast-bowling legacy. Some insisted that producing spin-friendly tracks would undo decades of tradition built by legends such as Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar.
Aaqib Javed addressed this in a recent interview on CricWick. Responding to claims that turning tracks would damage Pakistan’s identity, he asked a very simple question. He said that Pakistan play only two or three home Tests in a series, which takes about 20 days. If the best chance of beating strong teams is to create spin-friendly conditions for those 20 days, how could that possibly end the country’s fast bowling heritage?
He also clarified that Pakistan will not use the same approach for every opponent. He explained that fast bowling-friendly pitches will be prepared when Asian teams tour, because spin tracks would not make sense against sides like India, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.
For the first time in a long while, Pakistan seems to understand what home advantage truly means. Previously, flat pitches allowed teams like England and Australia to dominate Pakistan even in Pakistan. Now opposition batters must work for their runs, spinners come into the match early, and seamers still have a role through new ball assistance, reverse swing or uneven bounce. The logic behind this approach is clear. Pakistan cannot outbat top sides on flat surfaces, but they can challenge them on pitches that require skill, patience and adaptability.
This mindset has also filtered into white ball cricket. Recently, Pakistan have been preparing ODI and T20 tracks that offer something for both pace and spin. Aaqib Javed explained in the interview that the team is already preparing for the upcoming World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan is likely to play most of their matches in Sri Lanka, where conditions naturally help spinners. By playing on similar surfaces at home, the team hopes to adjust early, rather than waiting for the tournament to discover these challenges.
One of the most impressive aspects of the new system is how Pakistan have started producing different types of pitches at the same venue. The best example was seen in Faisalabad. One ODI was played on a surface that supported fast bowling and had carry, while the other two ODIs on the same ground assisted spin. This shows clear planning rather than random experimentation.
Aaqib also explained how the process works. Much of Pakistan uses Nandipur soil, which can be adjusted. A dry surface supports spin. Leaving some moisture and hardening the deck helps fast bowling. None of this is complicated. It just requires clarity, confidence and a willingness to back a strategy.
The benefits of this approach extend beyond immediate victories. Playing regularly on challenging surfaces will make Pakistani batters more complete. They will learn how to build an innings against turn, bounce and grip, rather than relying on flat tracks to pile up meaningless big scores. This is the type of experience they will need when playing in Sri Lanka, India or other spin-friendly countries.
For bowlers, especially spinners, these pitches provide the perfect platform to develop confidence, patience and the ability to out-think batters. Even fast bowlers can thrive in such matches through reverse swing, cutters and tactical spells.
This new philosophy also sends a clear message to the dressing room. Decisions will follow a defined home strategy. Players know what kind of cricket to expect. There is a clear template now. Pakistan identify the opposition’s strengths and weaknesses, prepare pitches accordingly, and select XIs that support the strategy. This clarity was missing during the era of flat wickets that produced neither entertainment nor results.
There will still be challenges. Spin-friendly pitches usually mean lower-scoring matches and more collapses. Some batters will struggle, and social media reactions will be harsh. One poor series may trigger calls from all sides to return to dead flat surfaces. That is where patience will matter. Players must adjust and fans must understand the long-term plan.
If Pakistan want to truly own this new identity, they must remain committed to it. They cannot panic after a single defeat and forget the purpose behind this approach. Three years of lifeless pitches showed what happens when a team has no idea of what it wants from its home conditions. The past year has shown the opposite. Pakistan finally looks like a team that understands what kind of cricket it wants to play at home.
The next step is simple but demanding. Pakistan must continue refining this template, trust the process, and accept that challenging, result-oriented pitches are the way forward. These are the conditions that will make Pakistan a fortress again, rather than a place where touring teams feel completely comfortable.

Reports about Imran’s ill health had swirled on social and foreign media a day ago, prompting both government and PTI leaders to dismiss the rumours and state that the former prime minister — currently held incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adial jail — was doing well.
Several PTI workers, including women, carried banners bearing slogans in favour of the former premier as they moved towards KPC today. The party workers and leaders chanted slogans and delivered speeches.







Authorities had sealed all routes leading to the KPC by placing barricades and parking vehicles.







A sizeable police presence was noted at the KPC and in the surrounding areas, supported by women personnel.
PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar said 20 PTI workers and leaders were detained; however, South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza later told Dawn the number was 24.







Among the detainees was the party’s provincial president, Haleem Adil Shaikh.







Bozdar said the party’s Insaf lawyers’ forum representatives arrived at Preedy Police Station and held talks with officials. Subsequently, all detainees were released.














South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali also confirmed that all protesters were released.
He said police took action as the crowd was ‘charged’ and the force feared they might indulge in vandalism and create a law and order situation.
“Therefore, the police just removed them, but they were not arrested,” the SSP said.</p><small>2025-11-28 15:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281855302f4aaa5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957921/pakistan-gets-offers-in-tender-to-buy-100000-tonnes-of-rice-for-supply-to-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan gets offers in tender to buy 100,000 tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>The lowest price offered in the tender from the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) to purchase 100,000 metric tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh was estimated at $394.95 CIF liner out, European traders said on Friday.
CIF liner out terms include cost, insurance, and freight shipping to a port in Bangladesh, as well as the seller’s unloading costs.No purchase has been reported and offers are still being considered, they said.Reports reflect traders’ assessments, and further price and volume estimates are still possible later.
The lowest offer was reportedly submitted by the company Jhulay Lal.
There were 11 participants in TCP’s tender, with other prices ranging from $397.25 to $424.80 a tonne CIF liner out, traders said. Bangladesh has been undertaking a series of import tenders in the past weeks to cool local prices.
The TCP tender seeks long-grain white rice to supply to Bangladesh. Price offers have to be valid for 21 working days after submission.
The rice must be available for shipment within 45 days of contract award. Traders regarded the tender as an effort to bring Pakistani rice into Bangladesh’s import supplies, with market expectations that Indian-origin rice will be used to supply some recent purchases by Bangladesh.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28184326295b2ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957920/nasa-rover-records-first-evidence-of-lightning-on-mars' target='_blank'><strong>Nasa rover records first evidence of lightning on Mars</strong></a><br><p>A Nasa rover has recorded evidence of lightning on Mars for the first time, its microphone picking up the sounds of tiny “zaps” whipped up by the dust storms constantly sweeping across the planet.
Scientists have long debated whether electrical discharges could be sparking in the dusty and little-known Martian climate - but proof has been hard to come by.
It turns out that Nasa’s Perseverance rover, which has been roaming the red planet since 2021, was inadvertently recording the sounds of lightning, according to a study published in Nature this week.
These are far from the thundering, kilometre-long lightning bolts we see on Earth.
Instead, they are “little zaps” similar to “what you might feel in dry weather when you touch your car door and there’s a bit of static electricity,” lead author Baptiste Chide of France’s CNRS research centre told AFP.
While low in energy, these discharges are happening “absolutely all the time — and everywhere” on Mars, the planetary scientist said.
The process starts when tiny grains of dust rub against each other. They become charged with electrons and release this energy in electrical arcs a few centimetres or even millimetres long, sending off an audible shock wave.

Here on Earth, dust storms and dust devils in desert areas also create electrical fields, but they rarely build up into electrical discharges.
However, on Mars, “because of the very low pressure and the composition of the atmosphere, the amount of charge that needs to accumulate to generate a discharge is much smaller,” Chide explained.
This phenomenon has been theorised since Mars first started to be explored and has been reproduced in the laboratory.
Chide said it had been “such an important issue for Martian science” that an instrument on the European Space Agency’s Schiaparelli lander was dedicated to searching for it. Unfortunately, the spacecraft crashed while trying to land on Mars in 2016.
Since then, “it was somewhat of a forgotten area for Martian exploration,” Chide said.
That is, until “by chance” the microphone on Perserverance’s SuperCam recorded signals of what appeared to be electrical discharges, he added.
Daniel Mitchard, a lightning expert at Cardiff University not involved in the study, commented in Nature that the research provided “persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges”.
But because the discharges “were only heard and not seen,” he expected debate between scientists on the subject “to continue for some time”.
Electrified astronauts?
The research could shed some light on the mysterious Martian climate.“Dust drives the Martian climate”, similar to the water cycle on Earth, Chide said. For example, a season of dust storms will have begun by the end of the year.
The electrical discharges could also kick off a process that destroys organic molecules — which are the building blocks of life — on the Martian surface.
It could also explain the surprisingly rapid disappearance of methane on the planet — a phenomenon that has baffled scientists. It may also have implications for future Mars missions.
Scientists will now be able to design their instruments to better protect the future robots sent to Mars, Chide said. There are also plans for humans to finally set foot on the planet’s red surface.
“In the long term, isn’t there a risk that the suits of the astronauts who stay on the Martian surface for a long time will be damaged by these discharges?” Chide asked.
“We will have to ask ourselves this question. “</p><small>2025-11-28 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2818172342a1706.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957918/new-air-traffic-control-tower-to-be-built-at-karachis-jinnah-international-airport' target='_blank'><strong>New air traffic control tower to be built at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has launched a project to build a new air traffic control (ATC) tower and a modern rescue and firefighting station (RFFS) at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, a PAA press release said on Friday.
According to the press release, the design phase of the project is expected to be completed within six months, with a two-year construction period for the tower and the station.
“The facilities will be designed and constructed by MM Pakistan in [a] joint venture with CEMOSA and Fairbanks Architects from Spain, bringing international expertise in airport planning and communication and navigation/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) systems integration,” the press release read.

It added that senior architect Bruce Fairbanks and CNS/ATM specialist Juan Cruz Canabate participated in a four-day workshop at Jinnah International, where they interacted with local aviation professionals to establish design parameters and decide on project requirements.
“After evaluating three potential locations, sites for both the ATC Tower and the new fire station have been finalised, ensuring alignment with operational, safety, and future development considerations,” the PAA said.
Jinnah International is one of the busiest airports in the country and serves as the main hub for flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines. According to aviation monitor FlightRadar, 64 tracked flights departed from Karachi on November 27.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2818263517d854f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957919/putin-to-discuss-privileged-partnership-with-modi-on-india-visit-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Putin to discuss ‘privileged partnership’ with Modi on India visit next week</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss all aspects of their countries’ “privileged strategic partnership” when Putin visits New Delhi next week, the Kremlin said.
India, a major buyer of Russian oil, has also bought its weapons for decades, though a top defence official said the country had bought US arms worth nearly $30 billion in the past decade and aims to produce more of its own equipment.
“They (the Russians) have been our friends through both fair and foul weather, and we are not going to sort of stop our defence cooperation with them anytime soon, but I do want to stress that India follows a policy of strategic autonomy,” Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said in New Delhi on Friday.
India was diversifying its suppliers, he told an industry event, adding: “But more than anything else we are trying to ensure that we increasingly do spend the bulk of our money within the country.”
Putin last visited India in December 2021, just a few months before Russia went to war in Ukraine the following February.
“This visit is of great importance, providing an opportunity to comprehensively discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations as a particularly privileged strategic partnership,” the Kremlin said in a statement.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged Modi to stop India’s buying of oil from Russia. In August, he imposed an additional tariff of 25 per cent on Indian goods in what Moscow said amounted to illegal trade pressure on New Delhi.
Trade and refining sources said this week that India’s December oil imports from Russia were set to hit their lowest in at least three years, off November’s multi-month highs, as refiners sought options to avoid breaching Western sanctions.
During his state visit from December 4 to 5, Putin will hold talks with Modi and have a separate meeting with President Droupadi Murmu, the Kremlin said, saying a number of unspecified intergovernmental and commercial documents would be signed.

The ruling PML-N secured close to 64 per cent of the total votes polled in the by-elections for six National Assembly constituencies held on Sunday as it emerged victorious on all seats. Five constituencies were located in Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These seats, except for one, were vacated due to the disqualification of the opposition PTI MNAs.
The PML-N also won six out of seven Punjab Assembly seats in the province by securing 82.41pc of the polled votes. On the seventh seat, it had not fielded its candidate in PP-269, Muzaffargarh, against PPP nominee Alamdar Qureshi.
The elections monitor had issued its by-election observation report a day earlier. In an accompanying press release, it noted: “The November 23rd by-elections for 13 National and Punjab Assemblies constituencies, though largely well-managed, were marked by recurring violations of campaigning restrictions, gaps in results transparency and a worryingly low voter turnout.”
The monitor also noted that “weak enforcement of campaigning restrictions” was among the persistent issues flagged in all polls. Furthermore, it said the overall turnout fell by 23 per cent for both men and women and only one constituency recorded a turnout of above 50pc.
It explained that at 238 (64pc) polling stations, at least 465 party camps were observed in close vicinity to the stations and transportation facilitation was observed at 184 (49pc) polling stations.
“Party camps were seen issuing voter slips at 216 (91pc) polling stations, and campaign material was found inside 16 (4pc) polling stations. While most polling stations had basic accessibility infrastructure, arrangements for women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and transgender voters were inconsistent.”
Referring to organisational preparation and setup for the by-elections, Fafen said around 89pc of presiding officers, 79pc of assistant presiding officers and 77pc of polling officers reported receiving training from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
“Ballot security and secrecy were generally upheld,” Fafen noted, adding that all four required ballot box seals were intact at 1,072 (98pc) booths and secrecy screens were properly placed at 1,044 (96pc) booths.
It stated that its observers closely monitored 366 polling booths and found polling organised and peaceful at 340 (93pc) booths, while only four (1pc) were described as disorganised or poorly managed.
Fafen noted that polling officers were observed performing key legal tasks such as verifying National Identity Cards (NIC), applying thumb marks, recording voter details and updating electoral rolls. However, at 92 (25pc) booths, they did not announce voter names and serial numbers as required under election laws.
“At 10 (3pc) booths, at least one eligible voter was turned away due to an expired NIC.”
Fafen added that assistant presiding officers “generally followed” proper ballot issuance procedures, but at 107 (29pc) booths, they pre-signed ballot papers, and at 102 (28pc) booths, they pre-stamped them.
“Although not illegal, these practices may increase the risk of ballot misuse,” Fafen pointed out.
“Of the 79 polling stations selected for counting observation, access to observers was denied at two. Presiding officers did not provide the Result of the Count (Form 45) to polling agents at six (8pc) polling stations and to observers at 13 (17pc) stations. Form 45 was also not displayed outside 15 (19pc) polling stations.”
“Similarly, Ballot Paper Account (Form 46) was not provided to polling agents at 15 (19pc) stations and observers at 17 (22pc) stations and it was not posted outside 16 (21pc) stations. At 33 (43pc) polling stations, presiding officers did not ask polling agents to sign the result forms.”
Fafen further said that around 97pc of polling agents interviewed during the observation process expressed satisfaction with the polling process, while only two expressed concerns. However, it said that all 137 polling agents interviewed after the counting phase reported satisfaction with the counting process.
The monitor also said it had deployed 122 trained and accredited observers, who conducted a “comprehensive observation” of opening, voting and counting processes at 373 polling stations and their 1,088 polling booths, including 626 male and 462 female booths. The observers also interviewed polling staff, security personnel, and 833 polling agents.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28180112f9a84b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957908/noor-zaman-retains-cas-squash-title-in-nail-biting-comeback-over-compatriot-hamza-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Zaman retains CAS squash title in nail-biting comeback over compatriot Hamza Khan</strong></a><br><p>Noor Zaman staged a stunning 3-2 victory over compatriot Hamza Khan to retain his title at the Chief of Air Staff (CAS) Serena Hotel International Squash Championship in a battle of the junior world champions.
Hamza dominated the first two sets 11-9, 11-7 before second seed Noor flipped the script and took the next three games 11-7, 11-4, 11-8 to win the final and retain his title at the Mushaf Squash Complex on Friday.
Noor kept his cool as he began his comeback in the third game before demolishing Hamza in the fourth.
The final remained relatively smooth-sailing as both players accepted the referee’s rulings and kept arguments to a minimum.







Noor dominated the fifth set with a massive 6-1 lead over Hamza before he scored another point, only for Noor to switch gears and take the score to 9-2.
Hamza was inching his way back to victory at 8-10 when Noor won the game and match, dropping his racket and throwing his hands in the air in celebration.
The two embraced in a long hug and exchanged words before walking out of the court to applause from the audience, where Noor’s grandfather and gloabal squash legend was seated in the front row.
The copper-level event was being staged in Islamabad from November 24-28 and carried a prize purse of $37,500.
Former world junior champion Hamza, currently ranked world 101, stormed into the final after defeating Swiss David Bernet 3-1 in a 55-minute semi-final thriller.
Noor joined him after compatriot Nasir Iqbal retired hurt in the other semi-final.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281741286d42d63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957915/fcc-to-hear-arshad-sharif-murder-case-on-dec-3' target='_blank'><strong>FCC to hear Arshad Sharif murder case on Dec 3</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Friday fixed a date for the Arshad Sharif murder case, where the request for an independent probe into the killing would be heard.
Prominent journalist Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car in October 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple cases of sedition were registered against him in different cities.
The suo motu case was taken up by a six-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan in the Supreme Court. However, after the passage of the 27th Amendment and the formation of the FCC, it was granted jurisdiction over both constitutional and suo motu cases.
On Friday, the FCC cause list showed that a hearing had been scheduled for December 3, with the attorney general, the Islamabad inspector general of police (IG), and the foreign secretary among other respondents.
It will be heard by a two-member bench comprising Justices Aamir Farooq and Rozi Khan Barrech, regarding an “independent and transparent investigation into the murder of renowned journalist Arshad Sharif in Kenya”.
In August last year, former chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa explained that the Arshad Sharif murder case was not fixed before a five-judge larger bench as it did not require any constitutional interpretation.
In July 2024, the top court had referred the case back to the three-judge committee constituted under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 to re-fix it before a five-judge bench.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28144133c861415.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957904/bond-of-respect-is-greater-than-politics-na-speaker-again-stresses-need-for-dialogue-with-opposition' target='_blank'><strong>’Bond of respect is greater than politics’: NA speaker again stresses need for dialogue with opposition</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on Friday that dialogue was the way to resolve issues.
He made similar offers to facilitate dialogue between the government and the opposition, the PTI, in the past as well. But, no substantial headway has been made so far, and differences between the two sides largely remain unresolved.
A handout issued by the NA Secretariat today said Sadiq met with opposition members of both houses of Parliament in his chamber in Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the NA session due to lack of quorum.
The visiting opposition members included Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Senator Faisal Javed, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan. MNAs Iqbal Afridi, Atif Khan, Sardar Latif Khosa and Jamal Ahsan Khan.







“Our bond of brotherhood and mutual respect is greater than politics. I have been in contact with you brothers since 2014. Politics does not last a lifetime — it ends eventually,” said the speaker according to the handout.
Sadiq said the members of Parliament “should have a relationship that lasts throughout life”.
The speaker further stated that he had always advocated for dialogue, stressing that dialogue was the means to resolve issues.
PTI’s Barrister Gohar, during the meeting, raised the issue of PTI founder Imran Khan’s family members not being allowed to meet the incarcerated leader, said the statement.
It added that the opposition members “appreciated” the speaker’s efforts to facilitate dialogue between the two sides.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.
After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December last year to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024, and the release of PTI prisoners.
The Shehbaz government had once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February as NA Speaker Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped.
However,  a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI.
Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country.
In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA.
The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.
The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill.</p><small>2025-11-28 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281231588e420fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957893/aleema-files-contempt-plea-against-adiala-jail-superintendent-after-repeatedly-being-denied-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema files contempt plea against Adiala jail superintendent after repeatedly being denied meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>Aleema Khan, the sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, has filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier.
The petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where Imran has been imprisoned since 2023. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday.
Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema has now filed a contempt plea.

Apart from Adiala Jail Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, Saddar Beroni Station House Office Raja Aizaz Azeem, Federal Interior Secretary Capt (retd) Muhammad Khurram Agha and Punjab Home Department Secretary Noorul Amin have been named as respondents in the plea.
The plea, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that Aleema had “remained deeply concerned about the well-being, legal rights, and humane treatment of her brother during his ongoing incarceration”.
The petition referred to the IHC’s March 24 order, in which the court had reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran. It said Aleema sought the initiation of contempt of court proceedings “on account of the wilful non-implementation of the orders passed by this honourable court, particularly with respect to the authorities’ failure to allow” her meetings with Imran, in line with the court’s directives in March.
It further stated that “due to the persistent non-cooperation” of the Adiala jail superintendent and “ongoing political victimisation”, Imran and others were “constrained” to file writ petitions before the IHC, seeking the enforcement of visitation rights.
“However, despite the clear and unequivocal directions of this honourable court, the respondents have failed to comply and have repeatedly denied access to the legal counsel, family members, and associates” of Imran on multiple occasions, it added.
The plea further recalled that in line with previous court orders, the respondents had devised on March 28, 2024 standard operating procedures (SOPs) for meeting Imran. According to those SOPs, Tuesdays and Thursdays were “designated for interviews with Imran by his family/ lawyers and friends, respectively”.
Despite directions for allowing visits to Imran on Tuesdays and Thursdays, “the respondents did not comply with or implement the same”, the plea said.
It recalled that the Adiala Jail superintendent had also submitted an undertaking to the IHC on November 8, 2024 that Imran’s friends would be allowed to meet him on Tuesday the following week and his family and lawyers would be permitted to meet him on Thursday, according to the list provided by the ex-premier.
But when several PTI leaders went to Adiala Jail to meet Imran on November 11, 2024, the superintendent “caused them to wait for several hours and thereafter unlawfully detained them in police custody”.
The plea alleged that the respondents were “wilfully flouting” the court orders and the undertaking submitted to it, and “conducted themselves to ridicule the authority” of the IHC.
It said their actions were an “apparent activity of serious contempt of this honourable court, for which they are liable to be dealt with under criminal proceedings”.
The plea sought the initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondents for not complying with the IHC’s March 24 order and urged the court to punish them in accordance with the law “to meet the ends of justice”.
It also sought the court’s directives for the respondents to comply with its March 24 order.
‘Was told CJ did not want to meet us’
Aleema, along with KP CM Afridi, had reached the IHC in the morning, where the two intended to meet the IHC chief justice.
However, while speaking to the media at the IHC, CM Afridi said that they were informed that the high court chief justice “did not want to meet them”.
The provincial chief executive lamented that no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27. “We know nothing about his condition,” he said.
“Neither his sisters are allowed to meet him, nor his [party’s] leadership, nor lawyers, nor doctors.”
He also recalled a sit-in staged by Imran’s sisters outside Adiala Jail on November 19. The PTI has alleged that police had manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion.
“The whole nation saw what happened. Imran Khan sahib’s sisters were dragged along the road by their hair, pushed down and disrespected. Even though they have no connection with politics; they just go to see their brother.”
The KP CM said he, along with six other people, had asked jail authorities yesterday to allow them to speak to Imran for “just two or three minutes”.







“We also assured them that we will not talk about politics or administrative matters. We said we just wanted to find out about his health.
“But we were still not allowed to meet.”
CM Afridi alleged that the KP and its government were facing discrimination, saying that “in other provinces, Pakistan Air Force planes were used for the chief minister’s travel”.
“By such actions, you are creating division. You are causing resentment and distances to grow,” he said.
He alleged that efforts were being made to “put Pakistan’s strongest political party against the wall” with its leader being discriminated against and his family, party and government in KP being targeted.
“You are worsening the situation yourselves,” CM Afridi said, warning that if it worsened further, “neither side would be able to bring it under control”.
He announced that the PTI had also decided not to let National Assembly and Senate sessions scheduled for today proceed “because we want our leadership and Imran Khan sahib’s sisters to be allowed to meet him”.
The legislatures were not of any use if they could not deliver justice to their representatives, he decried.
“Business as usual will not go on after this” until the PTI founder was allowed to meet his sisters and party leadership, he added.
The KP chief minister said that they had called on “all parliamentarians, from all over Pakistan”, to gather and protest peacefully outside the high court on Tuesday before proceeding to Adiala Jail.
“The Constitution and the law give us the right to protest,” he said. “We will definitely use this option,” he said, adding that if their constitutional right to meet Imran was granted, the PTI would not turn to protest.
‘Entire focus on one illegal demand’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI, including KP CM Afridi, of adopting an approach in which governance for the people was pushed to the back burner.
“And the entire focus is on one illegal demand that political guidance is to be taken only from the [party] founder serving a sentence in Adiala jail in a corruption case,” he added. “This is against jail rules,” he claimed.







Highlighting the importance of KP in the context of the fight against terrorism, he said: “Instead of the provincial government prioritising peace, progress and relief for the public, the party leadership kept itself busy in Islamabad by centering its politics on this illegal narrative”.
Continuing his accusations, he added: “Allegedly, a woman politician from the PTI […] ran a vile campaign regarding Khan sahib through anti-Pakistan accounts operating from Afghanistan and on the Indian media. This was an attempt to defame Pakistan worldwide.
“This approach is open enmity against Pakistan […] The PTI should abandon the anti-Pakistan narrative and [its] wrong priorities and now give preference to the interests of the people and the state.”
Failed efforts
Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
Among them, KP CM Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former prime minister since his election on October 13.
He had taken his oath as the provincial chief executive on October 15 and gone to Adiala jail to meet Imran the very next day after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court. However, he was turned away after a wait of two hours.
On Oct 17, he moved the IHC, seeking a meeting with Imran, and wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi with the same request.
The plea was taken up on October 23 along with several other similar ones by an IHC bench, which directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the high court’s March 24 order.
However, Afridi’s attempts to meet the PTI founder have failed so far.
Yesterday was the eighth time that he was denied a meeting with Imran since becoming the provincial chief executive.
Visuals reposted by the PTI on X showed CM Afridi, along with other party workers, offering Fajr prayers outside the jail on Friday morning before they ended the sit-in. Other images showed Afridi and others huddled around a fire.
Earlier, on November 19, the PTI had held a protest outside the jail as the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. The party alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion.
An hours-long sit-in was also held more recently on November 25 and was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir.
Concerns about Imran’s health
Meanwhile, the PTI had expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks.
Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings.
“His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters, demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him.
A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
Amid media reports that the 73-year-old former international cricketer might be moved to a high-security prison to make meeting him more challenging, international media outlets such as Japan’s Nikkei and the BBC also covered the concern over his status. His well-being became a talking point on social media with the trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trending on X in the morning. The interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
But yesterday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior PTI leaders dismissed reports of former premier Imran Khan’s ill health, with both sides stating that the PTI founder is ‘fine and nothing is wrong with him’.</p><small>2025-11-28 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281330525742e25.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957900/bahria-town-lahore-residents-left-stumbling-in-the-dark-as-power-supply-cut-over-non-payment-of-rs682m-in-dues' target='_blank'><strong>Bahria Town Lahore residents left stumbling in the dark as power supply cut over non-payment of Rs682m in dues</strong></a><br><p>The power supply of four housing projects in Bahria Town Lahore has been cut over the non-payment of bills amounting to more than Rs682 million, it emerged on Friday.
The move has prompted an outcry from residents, who have planned a demonstration in front of the Bahria Town offices after Friday prayers.
Muhammad Ramzan Butt, the chief executive officer of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco), said that Bahria Town had defaulted on its payments.
“They have failed to pay a total of Rs682m on four bulk power supply connections,” he told Dawn.
“We will not restore the power supply till the bills have been paid,” he asserted.
According to him, the initial deadline for paying the bills was November 21, which was then extended to November 23 at the request of the Bahria Town officials. However, they continued to file for extensions till November 26 (Wednesday), he said.
The Lesco official said that the last deadline was November 27. “Instead of paying the bills, they have reportedly approached the court,” he said.
“However, before the court could intervene, we disconnected the power supply to four projects,” Butt said.
According to the bills — copies of which are available with Dawn — Bahria Town (M/S Bahria Town PVT LTD) has to pay over Rs530m, followed by Bahria Orchard, which has to pay Rs137m to the power utility.
Meanwhile, Bahria Education City has to pay Rs5.465m, while another Bahria town project, by M/S Kingrete Associates, has to pay Rs2.70m.
“As soon as they clear the outstanding dues, our teams will immediately restore the power supply,” the Lesco CEO pledged.
On the other hand, residents criticised the Bahria Town administration as well as Lesco for not taking action to restore the power supply.
“Since yesterday evening up until now, we are functioning without electricity,” Fayyaz Ahmad, a resident of Bahria Town, told Dawn.
“The food in the refrigerator has also gone bad,” he said.
“It seems as if we are living in a jungle — no electricity and no warm water to take a bath either,” he said, adding he had decided to temporarily move to his brother’s house in light of the current situation.
In 2024, Lesco had disconnected the power supply to Bahria Town over the non-payment of more than Rs762m in electricity bills.
The real estate company has come under scrutiny before as well for power issues. In June last year, scores of residents in Bahria Town’s operations in Islamabad petitioned against overbilling and deductions by the management on electricity generated through solar power.</p><small>2025-11-28 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28143310b57f64d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957901/who-issues-unprecedented-global-guidelines-to-combat-infertility' target='_blank'><strong>WHO issues unprecedented global guidelines to combat infertility</strong></a><br><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday published for the first time directives to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of infertility, which affects millions across the globe.
“One in six people worldwide experience infertility during their lifetime,” said Pascale Allotey, the global health body’s head of sexual and reproductive health.
“The condition affects individuals and couples across all regions and income levels.
“And yet access to safe and affordable care remains highly inequitable.”
Allotey told reporters that the issue of infertility had been neglected “for far too long”.
The new guide would provide a “unified, evidence-based foundation” to ensure care is safe, effective and accessible for all, she added.
According to the WHO, infertility is a condition of the male and female reproductive system, defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual relations.
The situation can lead to major distress, stigmatisation and financial difficulties.
In several countries, most of the cost of infertility tests and treatment is borne by patients, which often leads to “catastrophic financial expenditures”.
“In some settings, even a single round of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) can cost double the average annual household income,” the WHO said.
The guide, published on Friday, sets out 40 recommendations and calls for the integration of fertility in national health funding, services and strategies.
It also wants to see steps for effective clinical management, in both diagnosis and treatment.
For example, the WHO calls for male diagnoses, which are often under-investigated, suggesting a range of approaches, starting with advice before moving to active treatment.
It also advises increased investment in prevention.
Health professionals need to address the main risk factors for infertility, which include untreated sexually transmitted infections and smoking, it says.</p><small>2025-11-28 09:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28134558ba88baa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957899/ncsw-strongly-condemns-justice-najafis-misogynistic-irresponsible-remarks-on-noor-mukadam-case' target='_blank'><strong>NCSW strongly condemns Justice Najafi’s ‘misogynistic, irresponsible’ remarks on Noor Mukadam case</strong></a><br><p>The National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), a statutory body working for women rights, on Friday condemned the “misogynistic and irresponsible remarks” made by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi on the Noor Mukadam case, saying that they reflected a “harmful mindset that shifts responsibility away from the perpetrators of violence and onto women themselves”.
Justice Najafi — a member of the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court that had upheld the death penalty awarded to Noor’s murderer — attributed the ghastly 2021 murder to what he described as a vice prevalent in society.
In his additional note, which surfaced on Wednesday, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”. It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.

 

The jud­ge also observed that societal compulsions in such non-marital long-term relationships were ignored to defy not only the law of the land, but also personal law under Islamic Sharia which, he regretted, amounted to a direct revolt against Islam.
In a statement issued today, the NCSW said it “strongly condemns” the “misogynistic and irresponsible remarks” made by Justice Najafi.
“Such statements constitute clear victim-blaming and reflect a harmful mindset that shifts responsibility away from the perpetrators of violence and onto women themselves,” the commission said.
“No woman’s choices, real or perceived, can ever justify or explain brutality, murder or any form of gender-based violence,” it added.
The commission further said that the remarks were also in contradiction of a previous judgment by Justice Ayesha Malik, where she emphasised that the language used for victims must be “sensitive, respectful and free from the personal biases of judges”.
According to NCSW, Justice Malik’s judgment clearly called on the judiciary to avoid moralising and stereotyping narratives that shame or blame women.
“The comments made in this case disregard that judicial responsibility and risk undermining public trust,” the statement stressed.
“The NCSW calls on all members of the judiciary to uphold constitutional values, maintain impartiality and ensure that courts remain spaces where survivors and victims are treated with dignity and respect,” the commission stated, adding that justice must be based on facts and law, “not personal judgment or bias”.
The NCSW was established by a presidential ordinance in July 2000 and is a statutory and autonomous body mandated to examine the policies and programmes for women development and gender equality. It also reviews laws, rules and regulations affecting the status and rights of women and suggests repeal, amendment or new legislation essential to promote the interests of women.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, had triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.
A day earlier, during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, Justice Najafi’s remarks were deemed “ridiculous”, with the committee questioning what would happen to the conviction rate in cases against women if a judge himself had made such remarks.</p><small>2025-11-28 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28121006b6072b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957894/pti-mpa-anwar-zeb-khan-says-one-injured-after-his-bajaur-home-targeted-in-drone-attack' target='_blank'><strong>PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan says one injured after his Bajaur home targeted in ‘drone attack’</strong></a><br><p>PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan has said that one person has been injured after his home in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district was targeted in a “drone attack” last night, it emerged on Friday.
In a video statement posted on his social media account on Thursday, the provincial lawmaker said, “My house in Raghagan, Khar tehsil, was targeted by a drone (quadcopter) attack by unknown individuals tonight, injuring one of my security guards.”
Khan, who said he was in Peshawar at the time of the incident, strongly condemned the incident. He also identified the injured as Zair Muhammad, saying he was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar.
Following the incident, police personnel arrived at the scene and initiated an investigation. However, local police have not yet released any official statement regarding the nature of the incident and those responsible.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, condemned the incident, terming it an act by “anti-peace elements”.
As per the statement, CM Afridi directed police and the relevant authorities to provide an immediate report on the incident.
“The provincial government stands with the people and its elected representatives during this challenging time and will not tolerate such terrorist incidents,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-11-28 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28123311e1a0ad4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957896/shooting-of-national-guard-soldiers-in-washington-heralds-troubling-resurgence-of-terrorism-globally-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Shooting of National Guard soldiers in Washington heralds ‘troubling’ resurgence of terrorism globally: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday strongly condemned the shooting of two soldiers of the United States’ National Guard in Washington, DC, saying that the incident “heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale”.
Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”. Trump has since announced that one of the soldiers had died.
In a press release, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns the shooting incident in Washington DC, reportedly involving an Afghan national.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the departed soldier, and (we) wish the injured a swift and complete recovery,” it said. It also extended sympathies to the families affected, as well as to the government and people of the US.
The FO said the attack was “undoubtedly an act of terrorism and a heinous assault on US soil”.
“For the past two decades, Pakistan has endured countless similar terrorist incidents, with clear linkages to Afghanistan,” it said.
“This incident signifies the challenges posed by transnational terrorism and underscores the need for enhanced global cooperation to confront this menace,” it said.
“The incident heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale. The international community must take note and reinvigorate collective efforts in counter-terrorism,” it said.
“Pakistan remains committed to working with the US and the wider international community to address the shared challenge of terrorism,” it said.







National Guard member dies
Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life,” Trump said on Thursday, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism probe.
The FBI searched multiple properties in a widening investigation, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the US in 2021 under a resettlement programme.
Agents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference.
US Attorney for Washington, DC Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon.
“I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation’s capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force,” Trump said in a Thanksgiving call with US military service members.
Casting blame on the administration of his White House predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump said the alleged gunman, who he described as having gone “cuckoo,” was among thousands of Afghans who came in unvetted as the US carried out a chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He provided no evidence to support his assertion.
Trump said the suspect’s “atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country”.
Armed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot the two National Guard members before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. He was in hospital in serious condition, Trump said.</p><small>2025-11-28 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28111211c6aaeb4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957890/hong-kongs-deadliest-blaze-in-decades-kills-at-least-128-scores-missing' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong’s deadliest blaze in decades kills at least 128, scores missing</strong></a><br><p>The death toll in a fire that ripped through a Hong Kong residential estate this week has risen to 128, the city’s security chief said on Friday.
Dozens were still missing, Secretary for Security Chris Tang told a press conference, adding that he sent his condolences to those affected.
Flames had moved quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Tai Po district on Wednesday afternoon, spreading through the eight high-rises and transforming the densely packed complex into an inferno.
After burning for over 40 hours, the blaze was “largely extinguished” by 10:18am local time on Friday, the fire services said, announcing the end of its operations.
Authorities are investigating what sparked the fire, including examining the bamboo scaffolding and plastic mesh wrapped around the complex as part of a major renovation.
At the charred apartment blocks, workers searched for survivors and pulled out bodies in black bags, with an AFP reporter counting four in one 15-minute period.
Vehicles unloaded corpses at a mortuary in nearby Sha Tin, another reporter saw, with families expected to arrive in the afternoon for identification.
Many remain unaccounted for, although the exact number of missing people has not been updated since early Thursday.
On Friday, authorities said more than 50 people were still hospitalised, with 12 in critical and 28 in serious condition.
At one hospital in Sha Tin, a woman surnamed Wong was looking for her sister-in-law and her sister-in-law’s twin, with no luck.
“We still cannot find them. So we are going to different hospitals to ask if they have good news,” the 38-year-old told AFP in tears.
“We were already waiting at the Prince of Wales Hospital on the first day but there was no news. We also came here yesterday.”
The last contact anyone had with the twins was on Wednesday afternoon, said Wong, around the time the fire was reported.
“One building went up in flames and it spread to two more blocks in less than 15 minutes,” a 77-year-old eyewitness surnamed Mui told AFP.
“It was very quick. It was burning red, I shudder to think about it.”
Investigations begin
The fire was Hong Kong’s deadliest since 1948, when an explosion followed by a fire killed at least 135 people.
Lethal blazes were once a regular scourge in densely populated Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods, but improved safety measures have made them far less common.
Hong Kong’s anti-corruption body said on Thursday it had launched a probe into renovation work at the complex, hours after police said they had arrested three men on suspicion of negligently leaving foam packaging at the fire site.
Residents of the estate told AFP that they did not hear any fire alarms and had to go door-to-door to alert neighbours to the danger.
Hong Kong authorities will immediately inspect all housing estates undergoing major work following the disaster, with an emphasis on shifting the sites to metal scaffolding.
Of the 94 people confirmed dead as of 6:00am (3:00am PKT), one was a 37-year-old firefighter and two were Indonesian domestic workers.
Hong Kong’s government announced a HK$300 million ($38.5m) fund to help victims of the fire.
City authorities said they had opened nine shelters and were organising temporary accommodation and emergency funds for those who had lost their homes.
Activities around Hong Kong’s legislative elections, on December 7, have been suspended.
‘Everyone lends support’
Some of the residents in adjacent blocks who had been evacuated as a precaution were allowed back into their homes on Thursday afternoon.
A spontaneous community effort to help firefighters and those displaced had by Friday become a well-oiled machine.
At a public square, separate supply stations for clothes, food and household goods had been set up, as well as booths providing medical and psychological care.
So much was donated that organisers put out a call on social media saying there was no need for more.
“It’s truly touching,” said 38-year-old Stone Ngai, one of the organisers of an impromptu aid station, on Thursday.
“The spirit of Hong Kong people is that when one is in trouble, everyone lends support… It shows that Hong Kong people are full of love.”</p><small>2025-11-28 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28105854ed6b895.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957889/trump-says-us-will-permanently-pause-migration-from-all-third-world-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US will ‘permanently pause’ migration from ‘all third world countries’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday unleashed a series of posts on Truth Social that could dramatically reshape US immigration policy, declaring that he will “permanently pause” migration from “all third world countries” and calling for “reverse migration” to remove certain immigrants.
“I will permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the US system to fully recover. This is necessary because unchecked migration has weakened American society and strained its resources. Until the system stabilises, no new immigrants from these countries will be allowed entry,” Trump wrote.
He did not identify any countries by name or give any specifics about what he meant by “permanently pause”. However, his posts signal a sweeping crackdown that could affect millions of residents from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and which could also alter refugee, Green Card, and other immigration programmes.
The development comes a day after the US government abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals, following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House. Trump had earlier announced that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard troops shot, had died, while the other soldier was “fighting for his life”.
In his posts, he also declared he would denaturalise migrants who “undermine domestic tranquillity, and deport any foreign national who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western civilisation.
Trump argued that US immigration policies had weakened the country despite technological progress and said the nation needed time “to fully recover” from what he called an immigration onslaught.
His posts outlined measures to terminate “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, including those signed by “sleepy Joe’s autopen”. He further said he would remove anyone he deemed “not a net asset” to the US or “incapable of loving our country”.







“Those who fail to contribute positively or respect American values will not be allowed to remain. The goal is to ensure that only individuals who strengthen the nation are permitted to live and work here,” he said.
Trump stressed that these reforms would not stop there.
“Only reverse migration can fully cure this situation. Individuals who have entered the US illegally or disrupted American society will be encouraged to return to their home countries. This step is presented as the only way to restore law, order, and stability in the US,” he said.
He also pledged to end all federal benefits for non-citizens, in an effort to ease the financial burden on American taxpayers.
“All federal benefits and subsidies for non-citizens of our country will be ended. This includes welfare, health care, and other support programmes that previously went to migrants. The policy is meant to stop the financial burden on American taxpayers and prioritise citizens first,” he said.
In one post, Trump attached a picture of Afghans being airlifted and wrote: “This is part of the horrendous airlift from Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into our country totally unvetted and unchecked. We will fix it, but will never forget what crooked Joe Biden and his thugs did to our country!”







The US president added that “these goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations”.
On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow announced that the president had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination” of every Green Card issued to immigrants from 19 countries listed in a June presidential proclamation.
These countries include Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, and Venezuela — but not Pakistan.
“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration’s reckless resettlement policies,” Edlow wrote on Truth Social.
Millions of Green Card holders and permanent residents from these countries could face scrutiny, even if they have lived in the US for years.
Trump had immediately linked the shooting of the two National Guard soldiers to immigration, stating that the shooter, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been flown into the US in September 2021 and later had his status extended under Biden-era policies.
CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that Lakanwal had worked with US forces in Kandahar and was admitted as part of partner forces, but described the admission as part of “the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan”.
The Pentagon confirmed the deployment of an additional 500 National Guard personnel to Washington, adding to the 2,200 already stationed in the capital.
USCIS also suspended all immigration requests from Afghan nationals pending a review of vetting and security procedures, leaving roughly 200,000 Afghans in limbo.
In his posts, Trump also framed immigration as “the single greatest national security threat,” asserting that the previous administration had admitted “20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world.”
“Any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country… If they can’t love our country, we don’t want ’em,” he said, signalling that his administration intended to pursue aggressive enforcement measures.
The combined directives point to an unprecedented federal review of immigrants, refugees, and Green Card holders from third world countries, potentially affecting millions of families abroad who seek to migrate or are already in the United States.

Tajik authorities said on Thursday that three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border. The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south.
“The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement. Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack.
Subsequently, the FO, in a statement issued early on Friday, expressed Pakistan’s condolences and solidarity with China and Tajikistan over the lives lost in a “heinous terrorist attack in Tajikistan near its border with Afghanistan”.







“Pakistan unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack on Chinese nationals. The use of armed drones in the incident underlines the gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it,” the FO said.
“As a neighbour that has repeatedly suffered terrorist attacks orchestrated from Afghan soil, the people of Pakistan fully understand and share the grief and anguish of our Chinese friends and Tajik partners,” it said.
“Pakistan has consistently stressed that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism against its neighbours or any other country. The repeated use of Afghan soil by terrorist elements and their continued presence under the patronage of the Afghan Taliban regime, is a matter of serious concern for the entire region and the wider international community,” it said.
It added that concrete and verifiable action against the perpetrators, abettors, facilitators and financiers of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil was the only way to address “this growing menace”.
“Pakistan will continue to work closely with China, Tajikistan and other regional partners to promote peace, stability and security in our shared neighbourhood,” the FO said.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
Last week, Denmark, in the capacity of the chair of the UN Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the TTP in Central and South Asia and said that the terror outfit was receiving “logistical and substantial support” from the de facto Afghan authorities.
Meanwhile, Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries.
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population.
At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity.
Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”</p><small>2025-11-28 02:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/280723278650ec9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957805/plea-seeks-return-of-military-trial-appeals-to-supreme-court' target='_blank'><strong>Plea seeks return of military trial appeals to Supreme Court</strong></a><br><p>• LHCBA petition wants ICAs ‘restored to their original forum’• Says 27th Amendment ‘unlawful, undermining judiciary’• Fears parliament can ‘abolish or replace forum for constitutional adjudication at will’ if permitted
ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court.
The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules.
On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians.
These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan.
In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases.
On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts.
The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9, 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional.
Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued.
‘Without lawful authority’
The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est.
The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.
“While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added.
The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary.
The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power.

 

It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles.
“If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared.
The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”.
“Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read.
“Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.”
The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment.
“It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.”
The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
“The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added.
“Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.”
