“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country,“ Trump said in a Truth Social post.
Multiple explosions rocked Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, earlier in the day, and columns of black smoke and aircraft could be seen.
Responding to the development in a video statement, Venezuela’s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said the country would resist the presence of foreign troops.







The strikes come after months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. Here is how the world is reacting to the development.

‘Violation of territorial integrity’
In a statement, the Iranian foreign ministry condemned the attack on Venezuela.
It strongly condemned the “American military attack on Venezuela”, declaring it a “flagrant violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country“.
Colombia calls for de-escalation
In a post on X, Colombian President Gustavo Petro reaffirmed his country’s “unrestricted commitment to the principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations, in particular the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes”.
“In this regard, the Colombian government rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk,” he wrote on the social media platform.







Petro said that Colombia had adopted a position “oriented toward the preservation of regional peace” and called for de-escalation. He further called on all parties to refrain from actions that deepen the confrontation and to prioritise dialogue and diplomatic channels.
“As a preventive measure, the national government has arranged measures to protect the civilian population, preserve stability on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, and promptly address any eventual humanitarian or migratory needs, in coordination with local authorities and competent organisations,” he added.
‘Criminal attack’
In a sharp condemnation, Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez denounced the “criminal attack by the US on Venezuela”.
In a post on X, he called on the international community to react against the US strikes.
“Our Zone De Paz (Zone of Peace) is being brutally assaulted,” he wrote, describing the US action as “state terrorism” against not only the Venezuelan people but also “our America”.







EU calls for restraint
The European Union called for “restraint” and respect for international law after the strikes.
“The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,” the bloc’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote on X after speaking with her US counterpart, Marco Rubio.
“Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint,” she wrote.







Spain offers to negotiate
The Spanish foreign ministry offered in a statement to negotiate and help find a peaceful solution in Venezuela.
It further called for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in the South American country.
‘Act of armed aggression’
Russia expressed deep concern over the development and condemned what it described as an “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela committed by the United States, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“In the current situation, it is important … to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue,” it said.
‘Great concern’
Germany’s foreign ministry said it was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern.
A written communication obtained by Reuters said the ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team would meet later in the day.
Italy says monitoring situation in Venezuela
Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome and its diplomatic representation in Caracas were monitoring any developments of the situation in Venezuela with particular attention to the Italian community in the country.
Tajani said in a post on X that Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was being kept constantly informed and that the foreign ministry’s crisis unit was operational.







Earlier, Italy’s Ambassador in Venezuela said that around 160,000 Italians currently live in the country, most of them with dual passports, as well as some who are there for reasons of work and tourism.
‘Services fully mobilised’
Belgium said it was coordinating with European partners in order to closely monitor the situation in Venezuela.
“Our embassy in Bogot, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilised. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners,” Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Prevot said in a post on X.

Trump says US forces have captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro after launching a “large-scale strike”; hails “brilliant” operation
Venezuelan vice president says govt does not know whereabouts of Maduro or his wife; defence minister calls for united front of resistance in the face of “the worst aggression” ever
US State Dept deputy chief declares ‘new dawn’ for Venezuela
Venezuela calls for emergency UN Security Council meeting following strikes


US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US forces had captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro after launching a “large-scale strike” on the South American country.
“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country,“ Trump said in a Truth Social post.







“This operation was done in conjunction with US law enforcement,” Trump added, saying he would give a news conference at 11:00am (1600 GMT; 9pm PKT) at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
In a brief phone interview with The New York Times, Trump hailed the “brilliant” operation.
“A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” the paper quoted Trump as saying.
Venezuela has since demanded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the US attacks.
“Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.
“A new dawn for Venezuela! The tyrant is gone. He will now — finally — face justice for his crimes,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on X.







US Senator Mike Lee said the country had completed its military action, quoting Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
“He anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody,” Lee, a Republican initially critical of the operation, wrote on X after what he said was a telephone call with Rubio.







Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, situated in the south of Caracas, and Carlota airbase in the north were among the targets of the strikes. Blasts were also heard in La Guaira, north of the capital, where Caracas’s airport and port are located.
A US official said Maduro was captured by elite US special forces troops.
Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the government does not know the whereabouts of President Maduro or his wife Cilia Flores, in an audio played on state TV.
“We demand immediate proof of life of President Nicolas Maduro and the first combatant Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said.

Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López accused the United States of hitting residential areas.
The “invading” US forces “have desecrated our soil, going so far as to strike, using missiles and rockets fired from their combat helicopters, residential areas populated by civilians,” Lopez said in a video statement shared on social media.
He also said the South American country would launch a “massive deployment of all land, air, naval, riverine and missile capabilities … for comprehensive defence“. The defense minister called for a united front of resistance in the face of “the worst aggression” ever against Venezuela.

The Venezuelan opposition, headed by recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, said in a statement that it had no official comment on the events.
Separately, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he ordered the deployment of military forces to the Venezuelan border.
Petro described Washington’s actions as an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America and said they would result in a humanitarian crisis.
Petro made no mention of Maduro’s capture, despite the Venezuelan leader being one of his government’s closest allies in the region.
The US has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega.

Trump’s stunning announcement follows months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on leftist leader Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy.
The US president said in December “it would be smart for (Maduro)” to step down and has also said that the Venezuelan leader’s “days are numbered”.
Trump’s claim of Maduro’s capture comes two days after Maduro attempted to engage with Trump, offering cooperation on fighting drug trafficking and illegal migration.
The US has accused Maduro of running a “narco-state” and rigging an election. Trump had also repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of its oil reserves, the largest in the world.

The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor.
Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.
Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death.
“Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia told Indian news agency ANI.
“They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.”
“BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement.
Reuters has approached Mustafizur for comment.
Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches.
He was signed by Kolkata in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history.
According to the Hindustan Times, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.
While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.
The Hindustan Times quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.
“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”
The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi following protests against her in 2024.
The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.</p><small>2026-01-03 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/03114302696593c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964858/pakistan-air-force-successfully-tests-indigenously-developed-air-launched-cruise-missile' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Air Force successfully tests indigenously developed air-launched cruise missile</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has successfully conducted the flight test of the indigenously developed “Taimoor” weapon system, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the development marked another significant milestone in the advancement of national aerospace and defence capabilities.
“Taimoor air-launched cruise missile is capable of engaging enemy land and sea targets with high precision at a range of 600 kilometres, carrying a conventional warhead,” it said.







“Equipped with state-of-the-art navigation and guidance system, Taimoor is designed to fly at very low altitudes, enabling it to effectively evade hostile air and missile defence systems,” it said.
“Its precision-strike capability significantly enhances the conventional deterrence and operational flexibility of PAF, further strengthening the country’s overall defence posture,” it added.
“The successful flight test underscores the technical maturity, innovation and self-reliance achieved by Pakistan’s defence industry. The launch was witnessed by senior officers of the Pakistan Armed Forces, along with distinguished scientists and engineers who played a pivotal role in the development of this advanced weapon system,” ISPR said.
PAF Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu also extended congratulations to the scientists, engineers and PAF team on the achievement, the statement said.
“He lauded their professional excellence, dedication and unwavering commitment to strengthening Pakistan’s defence capabilities,” it added.
The air chief also reaffirmed that such accomplishments “are a testament to the nation’s resolve to achieve technological self-sufficiency and maintain a credible conventional deterrent in the evolving regional security environment”.
“The successful test of the Taimoor weapon system reflects Pakistan Air Force’s continued pursuit of operational readiness, technological superiority and national security objectives,” he was quoted as saying.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to PAF for the successful test.
“The preparation of modern weapons at the local level is a clear reflection of national capability, resolve, and institutional expertise,” the president was quoted as saying.







The president said that the success of the test has “further strengthened national defence and bolstered Pakistan’s responsible defence policy for ensuring stability in the region“.
He lauded the “hard work, dedication, and spirit of national service of scientists, engineers, and the officers and personnel of the PAF”.
He added that the achievement marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan’s journey toward self-reliance in the arena of national defence”.
“The promotion of modern technology in the defence sector exhibited Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its security and sovereignty,” the statement added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also congratulated the PAF for the successful test, stating that the weapon system will “further enhance the country’s defence”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/03131014d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964871/man-killed-2-cops-among-3-injured-in-terrorist-attack-on-police-post-in-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Man killed, 2 cops among 3 injured in terrorist attack on police post in Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>BAJAUR: A man was killed while three others, including two cops, were injured after unknown terrorists attacked a police post in Bajaur district’s Barang tehsil in the early hours of Saturday.
Police and local residents said the attack on the police post, located in the hilly Kohi Sar area about 22 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters, occurred at around 2am.
Israr Khan, the spokesperson for the district police, told Dawn that the deceased was identified as 60-year-old Naseem Gul, a local resident. He added that the injured included two cops, 35-year-old Constable Suliman Khan and 58-year-old Constable Saz Muhammad, and 28-year-old Sahibzada, a school watchman.
He said the injured were taken to the District Headquarter Hospital in Khar for treatment, where their condition was said to be stable.
He said terrorists used both heavy and light weapons in the attack. The police spokesperson said that soon after the attack, a joint team comprising security forces and police reached the area and launched a clearance operation.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0311430793a6b1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964857/signs-of-torture-found-on-4-bodies-recovered-from-pit-in-karachis-mai-kolachi' target='_blank'><strong>Signs of torture found on 4 bodies recovered from pit in Karachi’s Mai Kolachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The decomposed bodies of four individuals discovered in a pit on Mai Kolachi Road last night bore multiple marks of torture, Karachi Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said on Saturday.
According to police, the four bodies — two of which were male and two of which were female — were found in a bushy area in the limits of the Docks police station on Friday.
Speaking to Dawn on Saturday, the police surgeon said the victims’ ages were between 10 to 40 years, adding that they were around four to five days old.
She said the corpses were taken to Civil Hospital, where medico-legal formalities were completed late on Friday night.
Dr Syed said that one victim, a boy between 13 to 14 years of age, had multiple injuries to the head, face and neck. She said that another boy around 10 years of age had injuries to the throat.
The third victim, a girl around 14 to 15 years of age, also had multiple injuries to the head, face and neck. The fourth victim, a woman around 40 years of age, had injuries to the skull, she added.
“All the relevant samples have been collected to test for intoxication and sexual violence,” she said.
Meanwhile, South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the identities of the victims had not yet been confirmed, adding that they had been moved to an Edhi morgue for identification.
He said there was no CCTV footage available of the area from where the bodies were discovered.
He added that a first information report (FIR) had not been registered so far as investigators were waiting for relatives to approach the police to identify and claim the bodies.
He added that if no one came forward, a FIR would be registered on behalf of the state.
Raza further said that the victims’ injuries appeared to have been caused by an axe or a sharp-edged weapon. However, he said that the exact cause of death would be determined once the autopsy report was finalised.
He surmised that since three of the victims appeared to be children and the fourth a woman in her 40s, they may all belong to the same family.
“So the gruesome killing may be linked with so-called ‘honour killings’,” he expressed.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031235465f719e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964861/pakistan-rejects-indian-fm-jaishankars-irresponsible-assertions-following-bad-neighbours-jibe' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rejects Indian FM Jaishankar’s ‘irresponsible assertions’ following ‘bad neighbours’ jibe</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday rejected the “irresponsible assertions” made by Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar, saying that New Delhi was again seeking to “deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability”.
Although the FO statement did not make a specific mention of the remarks by the Indian minister, its rebuke came after Indian media reported Jaishankar as saying on Friday that New Delhi had a right to defend itself against terrorism while talking about “bad neighbours”.
“You can also have bad neighbours … unfortunately, we do. When you have bad neighbours … if you look to the one to the West — if a country decides that they will deliberately, persistently, unrepentantly continue with terrorism, we have a right to defend our people against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying by The Hindu.
He also spoke about the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), which has been a major bone of contention between the two countries following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 blamed by India on Pakistan without evidence, saying: “Many years ago we agreed to a water-sharing arrangement — the belief was it was gesture of goodwill — because of good neighbourliness we were doing it … but if you have decades of terrorism there is no good neighbourliness and you don’t get the benefit of good neighbourliness.”
“You can’t say … Please share water with me but I will continue terrorism – that’s not reconcilable,” he was quoted as saying by the publication.
In a statement issued on Saturday, the FO said, “Pakistan firmly rejects the irresponsible assertions made by the Indian external affairs minister. Once again, India seeks to deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability.”
The FO said that India’s “documented involvement in promoting terrorist activities in the region, particularly in Pakistan, is well known”.
“The case of Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav remains a stark example of organised, state-sponsored terrorism directed against Pakistan,” it added.
Jadhav was captured in Balochistan in March 2016 and later confessed to his association with the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing and his involvement in espionage and terrorism in Pakistan. He remains imprisoned in Pakistan.
“Equally concerning are recurring instances of extraterritorial killings, sabotage through proxies, and covert support to terrorist networks. This pattern is consistent with the extremist ideology of Hindutva and its violent proponents,” the FO said.







“India continues its illegal and violent military occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to extend full political, moral, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle to realise their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” the statement added.
On the topic of the IWT, the FO said that it was an international agreement “concluded in good faith and at considerable cost”.
“Any unilateral violation of the treaty by India would undermine regional stability and call into question its credibility as a state that claims to respect international legal obligations. Pakistan will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights under the treaty,” it added.
The development comes after National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday during the funeral of the country’s former premier Khaleda Zia, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031020373dfa172.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964854/fresh-talks-on-gaza-stabilisation-force-to-focus-on-mandate-as-pakistan-maintains-caution' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh talks on Gaza stabilisation force to focus on mandate as Pakistan maintains caution</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: A fresh round of diplomatic talks on the formation of a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza is expected to be held in a Middle Eastern capital in the coming days, diplomatic sources told Dawn as Muslim countries, including Pakistan, continue to press for clarity on the force’s mandate, operational scope, and political objectives.
The ISF, a central element of a US-brokered Gaza peace plan, is envisioned to stabilise the territory following over two years of Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip, protect civilians and humanitarian corridors, and assist in establishing transitional governance through a proposed “Board of Peace”.
However, several core issues remain unresolved, including the force’s legal authority, chain of command, funding, duration, and whether it would play a role in disarming Hamas or other Palestinian groups.
Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other states have expressed willingness to participate in a stabilisation effort that genuinely restores order and facilitates humanitarian access.
“They are prepared to join any credible international force that brings stability to Gaza,” a diplomatic source said. “But they will not be part of a mission whose primary focus is disarming Palestinian resistance groups.”

 

Hamas has rejected the idea of an international force tasked with disarmament, warning that such a deployment would be considered a party to the conflict rather than a neutral stabilising presence.
This stance complicates efforts to secure broad regional participation and raises concerns about the safety and legitimacy of any deployed troops.
Last month, Reuters reported that international troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as 2026 to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force.
US signals gratitude, Pakistan remains cautious
Three weeks ago, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Pakistan’s willingness to consider particpating as “key” to the initiative and expressed gratitude for Islamabad’s engagement.
Pakistani officials, however, emphasise that no final decision has been taken yet, and that Islamabad has neither committed troops nor received a formal request.
In December 2025, Pakistan also attended a US Central Command–hosted conference in Qatar, with representatives from nearly 45 countries, where the operational framework of the ISF was discussed.
Reports suggesting Pakistan might deploy up to 3,500 troops remain speculative. Diplomatic sources stressed that any troop commitment would depend on a mandate that is fully transparent, politically neutral, and focused on humanitarian stabilisation rather than disarmament or law enforcement inside Gaza.
‘2025 saw positive trends in Pak-US ties’
Meanwhile, in a press briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington on Friday, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh framed discussions on the ISF alongside broader Pak–US relations.
He said that 2025 had been a year of positive trends in bilateral ties and that 2026 would be a year where concrete results were expected.
“The opportunities are positive and clear but 2026 will be a critical year for translating these possibilities into practical outcomes across every sector of our bilateral partnership,” he said.

 

The ambassador highlighted economic cooperation in minerals, energy, information technology, health, education, and counterterrorism as areas of particular promise.
Ambassador Sheikh also emphasised Pakistan’s competitive advantages, noting that the country’s production costs were lower than China’s. He drew attention to the skills of Pakistan’s youth, particularly in technology and English-language proficiency, which have earned global recognition.
Highlighting trade relations, he said Pakistan’s goods trade with the US rose 16.3pc in 2025, exports increased by 11.5pc, and services trade grew by 39.7pc.
Remittances from the US also rose by 5.4pc.
He stressed that while these achievements were commendable, sustained effort and institutional coordination would be required to translate potential into tangible results.
“Our partnership with the US is not just a matter of choice or convenience; it is a strategic necessity rooted in geography, economics, population, and shared interests,” the ambassador said.
Strategic and operational considerations
The ISF discussions, combined with Pakistan’s broader engagement with Washington, reflect the delicate balancing act Islamabad faces: supporting humanitarian stabilisation in Gaza while safeguarding Pakistan’s principles on Palestinian sovereignty.
Analysts say that unless a mandate acceptable to all stakeholders is clearly defined, the force may struggle to attract broad participation and could encounter operational and political obstacles on the ground.
Experts also note that the involvement of countries like Pakistan is politically significant.
Islamabad has traditionally played a mediating role in Middle Eastern conflicts, balancing ties with Arab states, the US and the broader Muslim world.
Any misstep in defining the ISF’s role could complicate Pakistan’s regional diplomacy, affect its credibility with partners in the Gulf, and influence its perception among Palestinians.
The coming meetings will be closely watched by both regional actors and Washington, as they may determine the pace at which the ISF is deployed.
While humanitarian objectives remain central, the debates over mandate, command, and responsibilities illustrate the inherent complexity of deploying a multinational stabilisation force in a highly contested environment.
Israel has banned 37 foreign humanitarian organizations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they had refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials, a move that the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said will “further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians”.
It is worth mentioning that eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have expressed concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, saying that severe winter weather has further worsened conditions and stressing the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts.
In a joint statement, Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — which had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza — have demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs can operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.

The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia’s worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.
The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia’s most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state.
Authorities on Saturday announced a “high-visibility” police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years.
Measures at the cricket ground, some 5km from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles.
“The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement.
Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia.
“Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe,” Lanyon said.
Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and “community members who bravely acted” would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday.
There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for “emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger”, the governing body said in a statement.
On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers.
Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.</p><small>2026-01-03 07:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031057581caffaf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964856/dar-heads-to-beijing-to-co-chair-strategic-dialogue-with-china' target='_blank'><strong>Dar heads to Beijing to co-chair strategic dialogue with China</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar on Saturday departed for Beijing to co-chair the seventh round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue which is scheduled for January 4 (Sunday), the Foreign Office said.
In a statement, FO said the foreign minister left for Beijing, adding that he will be the “first foreign dignitary to visit China in 2026“, at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
Yi will co-chair the dialogue along with Dar.
FO said that the dialogue “will review the full spectrum of bilateral cooperation, identify new areas of partnership, and further advance the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China”.







Earlier this week, the FO had said the dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism between Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
It said that during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers will also announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.







It had added that the visit formed an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflected their shared determination to broaden and deepen their cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development.
The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in August, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.</p><small>2026-01-03 06:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0309161403b1833.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964828/nur-khans-daughter-dies-in-us-road-accident' target='_blank'><strong>Nur Khan’s daughter dies in US road accident</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Dr Faiqa Qureshi — the daughter of PAF Air Marshal Nur Khan — passed away after a traffic accident in Dinwiddie County, Virginia.

A large fiscal adjustment has been carved out through massive taxation and cuts in subsidies instead of any hint of restraint in spending by the government either on itself or on its constituents and backers. On the contrary, the spending valves have been opened like never before. Discretionary expenditure has skyrocketed, much of it ‘pork barrel’ in nature, with public funds being lavishly used for patronage and cementing loyalties towards the making of a new political order.
In the process, the entire burden of adjustment has been placed on ordinary Pakistanis and tax-compliant firms. As a result, the country is experiencing permanent economic ‘scarring’, with businesses shutting down, unemployment surging, and nearly one out of every two Pakistanis now estimated to be below the poverty line. Even the country’s farmers have not been spared, with rural poverty now estimated to be significantly higher than the rest of the country. Worse, the IMF’s orthodoxy is set to consign Pakistan to a low-growth trap for years.

 

An examination of public finances since 2022 is revealing. A cumulative fiscal adjustment of 5.5 per cent of GDP has taken place, the largest over a similar period in Pakistan’s history. Much of this adjustment has come from new taxation measures. The government has imposed taxes and levies totalling over Rs50.4 trillion since 2022-23 (including federal as well as provincial taxes and the petroleum levy). This is equivalent to the cumulative tax collection over the 17-year period prior to 2022. Repeating the past pattern of failure, the additional taxation has not come through tax broadening but by placing demands on existing taxpayers.
At the same time, while the government has been imposing unprecedented levels of predatory taxation, it has been unable or unwilling to rein in its spending. Overall government expenditure (centre and provinces combined) has increased 60 per cent in nominal terms between FY2023 and 2026. Non-interest expenditure has ballooned 70pc during this period.

 

Much of the increase in government expenditure has been in the form of political favours and patronage — large increases in salaries, allowances and pensions for the civil and military bureaucracy, parliamentarians, and the judiciary, in addition to allocation of generous discretionary funds for MNAs and MPAs. Pork barrel-ridden ‘development’ spending, a surrogate way of handing out taxpayer money to ruling coalition politicians, has surged from Rs 1.9 trillion in 2022-23 to a budgeted Rs 3.1tr in 2025-26, inclusive of federal PSDP and provincial ADPs.

Pakistanis have been crushed by fiscal austerity while the ruling elite has never had it better.

Expenditure on new fleets of cars, all-paid overseas trips for embarrassingly large delegations to different parts of the world, lavish spending on offices and official residences, etc, is on top of the foregoing. Personnel-related expenditure (salaries, allowances and pensions of the civil bureaucracy and military) alone has shot up from Rs 3.7tr to Rs 5.9tr in the past four years, cumulatively accounting for 38pc of the taxes squeezed from the economy over this period.
The massive increase in government spending on its own constituents and institutional backers since 2022 has occurred under the watch of the architect of the fiscal austerity policies — the IMF. Either the IMF is a witting party to this regime-supporting and system-legitimising operation, or it has been completely negligent in its fiduciary responsibility to ordinary citizens of a member country. Either way it should be held accountable.
A key question is whether there was a better alternative to the approach adopted, one that would have placed a lower and more bearable burden on the economy and ordinary Pakistanis. The answer is an unequivocal yes. Spreading the burden of adjustment more widely and more fairly through equitable taxation and non-essential spending cuts would have lessened the hardship.
Unfortunately, the IMF has chosen to turn a blind eye to the government’s spending profligacy and unwillingness to broaden the tax base. As a result, the entire burden of adjustment has fallen on the already taxed — salaried individuals, compliant firms, less affluent Pakistanis. Worse, under the IMF’s cookie-cutter method, fiscal consolidation is the only way to treat a public debt overhang. This approach to achieve a sustainable public debt level, however, will consign Pakistan to a low-growth trap for years without an exit.
As an illustration, using the standard debt equation, and fairly benign assumptions about economic growth and real interest rates, reaching a targeted level of public debt at 60pc of GDP will require a primary surplus of between 1.4 and 2pc of GDP each year for the next five years. Under the current IMF methodology and forbearance, this primary surplus will be achieved by even more taxation on existing taxpayers.
A singular reliance on fiscal consolidation is precisely the approach ‘the troika’ took in the case of Greece in the aftermath of the latter’s 2009 crisis, with the IMF under Christine Lagarde being a conscientious objector. Recognising that without significant debt restructuring, Greece’s economy and population will suffer catastrophic consequences for decades, the IMF proposed a sovereign debt write-off. However, Germany, as one of the largest creditors of Greece, overruled the idea and insisted on imposing fiscal austerity. The result has been the decimation of the Greek middle class, a dramatic decline in overall per capita income and widespread impoverishment.
To put Greece’s fiscal austerity-created misery into context, at its lowest point after the start of fiscal austerity, per capita income had declined by 27pc and only recovered to its pre-crisis level after 16 years.
In our case, the IMF has kept debt restructuring off the table, even though if done right it can provide much-needed fiscal space while reducing the pain and suffering inflicted on citizens. Without a fundamental rethink of the current strategy, and a change in the sham nature of the fiscal austerity being imposed, the economy will continue to be impaired for the long term, while ordinary Pakistanis will continue to suffer needlessly.

Mirwaiz Umar Farooq

• Mirwaiz Umar Farooq says ‘enforced silence’ hides widening trust deficit; urges renewed dialogue• Hurriyat leader calls for ‘humanity’ after being denied access to Srinagar’s Jama Masjid• Says locals facing ‘existential crisis’ amid fears of demographic changes
JAMMU: In a hard-hitting statement posted on social media on the first Friday of the year, the chief cleric of India-held Kashmir, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, said that despite unilateral changes made in 2019, the reality is that the conflict continues to keep the region in a state of uncertainty that can erupt at any time.
Mirwaiz, who said he was not allowed to go to the Jama Masjid in Indian-occupied Srinagar to deliver the Friday sermon, wrote: “That is why wars are paused, not ended, and dialogue finds no takers.”
“Yet beyond these incidents, in which Kashmiris find themselves at the receiving end of suspicion and attacks in parts of India, not much has changed for them. The trust deficit between them and New Delhi has widened, not shrunk. Enforced silence is projected as acquiescence. Wounds remain open, problems unaddressed, and an elected government of a Union Territory complains of being powerless,” he said.



“A sense of hopelessness prevails, along with an existential crisis of losing one’s identity through demographic change since the state was downgraded to a Union Territory, constitutional guarantees withdrawn, and rules and laws tweaked.”
Highlighting his inherited role as a channel of lasting peace, brotherhood and reconciliation for his people and the region, Mirwaiz said: “In the past, I have engaged with leadership across the subcontinent and successive Indian governments — including former prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, as well as L.K. Advani — in sincere efforts at dialogue. My path remains the same.”
“Is real peace possible? Yes. Kashmiris are natural optimists. Dialogue has worked elsewhere, and our hope remains alive. When there is sincere willingness to engage in the spirit of ‘Insaniyat’ and ‘Jamhooriyat’, as Vajpayee ji once said, peace gets the best chance,” he wrote.
“As another year begins and we look ahead, painful memories of 2025 stay with us. It was a year marked by tragedy and uncertainty. The horrific Pahalgam attack shook us deeply. Unequivocally condemned by all in the Valley, it led to widespread anxiety as people were targeted and homes demolished. This was followed by another India–Pakistan war, a stark reminder of how fragile peace in the region continues to be.
“Today, we are operating in an environment where any expression of views contrary to the state, or any disagreement, is increasingly criminalised, branded as ‘anti-national’, and penalised,” Mirwaiz remarked.
“No public space is available to us, and mediums of communication, including most local media, are not ready to provide any platform for expressing people’s demands or views. I do not have the privilege of addressing press conferences. I cannot move without official clearance, and people cannot meet me without permission. My access to the pulpit of Jama Masjid — the spiritual heart of Kashmir — is also curtailed. Even last Friday, I was placed under house arrest, and again this Friday too.
“With Hurriyat constituents banned, all offices sealed and institutions closed, leaders and activists either in jail or under constant surveillance, social media remains the only platform that offers some space to connect with people and the outside world,” he added.

The BBC has seen several examples on the social media platform X of people asking the chatbot to undress women to make them appear in bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual situations.
XAI, the company behind Grok, did not respond to a request for comment, other than with an automatically-generated reply stating “legacy media lies”.
Samantha Smith shared a post on X about her image being altered, which was met with comments from those who had experienced the same — before others asked Grok to generate more of her.
“While it wasn’t me that was in states of undress, it looked like me and it felt like me and it felt as violating as if someone had actually posted a nude or a bikini picture of me,” she said.
The regulator Ofcom said tech firms must “assess the risk” of people in the UK viewing illegal content on their platforms, but did not confirm whether it was currently investigating X or Grok in relation to AI images.
The proliferation of AI image-generating platforms since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 has raised concerns over content manipulation and online safety across the board. It’s also contributed to an increasing number of platforms that have produced deepfake nudes of actual people.
In a related development, Grok on Friday blamed lapses in safeguards had resulted in “images depicting minors in minimal clothing” on social media platform X and that improvements were being made to prevent this.
Screenshots shared by users on X showed Grok’s public media tab filled with images that users said had been altered when they uploaded photos and prompted the bot to alter them. “There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing,” Grok said in a post on X.







“xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.”
“As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them CSAM is illegal and prohibited,” Grok said, referring to Child Sexual Abuse Material.

New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday accused New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani of “interfering” in India’s internal affairs by writing a note to jailed student leader Umar Khalid, asserting that New Delhi will not tolerate any such effort.
However, the BJP remained mum on a The Hindu report, which stated that eight US lawmakers have written to Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra, urging India to grant bail and a free and fair trial to Mr Khalid “in accordance with international law”.
Questioning Mr Mamdani’s locus standi to comment on India’s internal matters, BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia cautioned the New York City mayor against such efforts.
“If India’s sovereignty is challenged, 140 crore Indians will stand united under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership,” he asserted.
Mr Bhatia added that the peo­ple of India had “complete faith” in the country’s judiciary.
‘Words on bitterness’
The reaction came after Mr Mamdani wrote a note to Mr Khalid, recalling his words on “bitterness” and the importance of not letting it consume oneself.
The note was posted on X by Mr Khalid’s partner, Banojy­otsna Lahiri.







“When prisons try to isolate, words travel. Zohran Mamdani writes to Umar Khalid,” the caption accompanying the note stated.
“Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents. We are all thinking of you,” the handwritten note, signed by Mr Mamdani, read.
Reacting sharply, Mr Bhatia said: “If anybody comes out in support of any accused and interferes in India’s internal matters, the country will not tolerate it.”
“Who is this outsider to raise questions on our democracy and judiciary, coming in support of a person who wants to break India? This is not fair,” The Hindu quoted him as saying at a press conference at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi.
He was apparently asked to comment on Mr Mamdani’s note.
Mr Khalid and a few others have been booked under the draconian anti-terror law, Unla­wful Activities (Preve­ntion) Act (UAPA), 1967, and provisions of the Indian Penal Code, for allegedly being “masterminds” of the February 2020 northeast Delhi riots, which left 53 people dead and more than 700 injured.
Securing bail under the UAPA is difficult for those booked under this law as the burden to show that the case is false lies on them.
US lawmakers
In their letter dated Dec 30, according to The Hindu, the US lawmakers pledged support to the jailed student activist and asked the Indian government to “share the steps being taken to ensure that the judicial proceedings against Umar Khalid and those of his co-accused who remain in detention comport with international standards”.
The letter by the US lawmakers was shared by Dem­ocratic Congressman Jim McG­o­vern, who is also the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Hu­man Rights Commission. The others who had signed on it include Democrat Jamie Raskin, Indian-origin Congres­swoman Pramila Jayapal, US Representatives Jan Scha­kowsky, Lloyd Dogget, Rashida Talib, and Senators Chris Van Hollen, and Peter Welch.
As per the letter, Mr McGovern and others had met Umar Khalid’s parents earlier in December. “Representative Raskin and I are leading our colleagues to urge that he be granted bail and a fair, timely trial in accordance with international law,” he said, sharing the signed letter in a post on X.







The lawmakers claimed that human rights organisations, legal experts and global media have raised questions about the fairness of the investigation and legal process related to Mr Khalid’s detention.

DUBAI: Donald Trump warned on Friday that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters, prompting Tehran to caution that any intervention would destabilise the region already on edge as unrest spread across the country amid a spiralling economic crisis.
Clashes between demonstrators and security forces were reported in Iran’s several cities on Thursday, with at least six people said to have been killed in the first fatalities since protests over prices and the plunging rial escalated this week.

 

What began with shopkeepers striking in Tehran on Sunday has since rippled to at least 15 cities, largely in the west, in the most serious challenge to Iran’s clerical establishment since the nationwide protests of 2022.
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump issued a blunt ultimatum. “If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,” he wrote. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”
The comments drew an immediate rebuke from Iran’s leadership. Supreme National Security Council head Ali Larijani warned that American involvement would threaten US forces in the Middle East.
“US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interest,” Mr Larijani said in a post on the social platform X. ‘‘The US president “should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety”.
Other officials echoed the warning. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei scoffed at Trump’s offer to “rescue” protesters.
“Iranians will resolve their challenges through dialogue and mutual engagement, and will not permit any form of foreign interference,” Mr Baghaei said, citing the 1988 US downing of an Iranian passenger plane as evidence of American hostility.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iranian security is a “red line” and any interventionist hand would be “cut”.
Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Iranian parliament speaker, wrote on X that if the US interferes, “all American bases and forces across the entire region will be legitimate targets”.
Israel backs protesters
While Tehran lashed out at Washington, it also faced an aggressive social media campaign from Israel. Israeli government accounts and officials publicly encouraged the demonstrators, framing the unrest as the beginning of the end for the Islamic Republic.
The Mossad’s official Farsi-language account posted on Monday: “Come together to the streets. It’s time. We are with you — not just from afar and in words. We are with you on the ground as well.”







Israel’s foreign ministry posted a cartoon on X depicting a lion and sun — symbols of pre-revolutionary Iran — crushing the current regime’s emblem. “The rise of Iranian lions and lionesses to fight against darkness,” the post read. “Light triumphs over darkness.”







Gila Gamliel, Israel’s minister of innovation, shared a video declaring that the protests by “mothers and fathers are justified”.







Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli posted an image of a demonstrator waving the lion and sun flag, though some content shared by Israeli officials has faced scrutiny.







Several images and videos posted by Israeli accounts on social media platforms have been modified with the help of artificial intelligence tools.
One image posted by the Israel’s foreign ministry on X confirmed to have been manipulated using AI, according to detection tools.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented, reportedly to avoid giving Tehran an excuse to blame the unrest on “Zionist” meddling.

On a month-on-month basis, the export proceeds posted a negative growth of 4.26pc in December.
The falling trend in exports has yet to raise alarm among policymakers because no meeting was held to identify the reasons. The negative growth in exports continued since August of the current fiscal year, barring July which saw proceeds growing 16.43pc from a year ago.
Export earnings continued their downward trajectory for the fifth consecutive month, with proceeds declining by 14.54pc in November. This follows drops of 4.46pc in October, 3.88pc in September, and 12.49pc in August, reflecting persistent pressures on the country’s external trade performance.

Trade gap widens 35pc in first half, driven by fifth straight monthly contraction

In the first half (July-December), the export proceeds recorded a negative growth of 8.70pc to $15.184bn this year as against $16.631bn over the corresponding months of last year.
The persistent decline underscores mounting pressure on the country’s trade performance, as exporters grapple with subdued global markets and the high cost of doing business in the country. The textile exporters have already complained about contractions owing to the high cost of doing business.

 

In FY25, export proceeds rose 4.67pc to $32.106bn against $30.675bn in the preceding year.
The negative growth in exports is a major concern for the exporters.
Trade deficit
According to the PBS data, imports grew 2pc to $6.022bn in December 2025 from $5.904bn over the corresponding month of last year. Month-on-month, imports increased 13.49pc.
In the first six months of 2025-26, the import bill posted a growth of 11.28pc to $34.388bn against $30.902bn over the corresponding months of last year.
The import rose 6.57pc to $58.38bn in July-June FY25 from $54.78bn over the last year.
The trade deficit rose 23.79pc to $3.705bn in December 2025 from $2.993bn over the corresponding month of last year. The trade deficit swelled 34.57pc to $19.204bn in July-December 2025-26 against $14.271bn over the corresponding period last year.
The trade deficit FY25 widened by 9pc to $26.27bn from $24.11bn over the preceding year.

KARACHI: In an effort to protect young girls from cervical cancer, the Sindh Health Department, in line with a decision by the Federal Directorate of Immu­nisation, has included the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine in the province’s routine immunisation programme.
Other provinces are also expected to roll out similar initiatives in the coming months.
According to a notification issued by the Sindh Health Department, the decision has become effective from Jan 1 this year.

 

“The vaccination shall target girls aged nine years with an intended minimum coverage of 70 per cent,” the notification stated.
The department has directed all district health officers to adopt a mixed delivery approach, including facility-based vaccination, community outreach, and school-based vaccination activities, to ensure optimal coverage, equitable access, and sustainability.
“To ensure accurate monitoring, accountability, and transparency, HPV vaccination through routine immunisation must be fully integrated into the existing EPI [Expanded Programme on Immu­nisation] recording and reporting mechanisms,” the notification added.
Provincial government health officials have also been instructed to ensure preparedness, including micro-planning, staff orientation, logistics, cold chain management, and coordination with relevant stakeholders to support an effective rollout of the HPV vaccine under routine immunisation.
‘Free of charge’
According to officials, the vaccine will be available free of charge for nine-year-old girls at EPI centres, outreach vaccination sites, and during school-based vaccination sessions.

 

It may be recalled that the Sindh government launched a province-wide HPV vaccination campaign — the first-ever imm­unisation initiative against cervical cancer — on Sept 15, 2025, targeting 4.1 million girls aged nine to 15 years.
Despite official claims of over 65pc coverage across Sindh, parents’ lack of interest and negative social media campaigns emerged as major challenges, particularly in Karachi.
According to health experts, cervical cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women worldwide and remains a major public health concern in Pakistan, with a mortality rate exceeding 65pc.
HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer, and its vaccine is the world’s first-ever cancer prevention vaccine.
Health experts say the vaccine is safe, effective, and provides 100pc protection against cervical cancer.
According to officials, Pakistan is the 149th country to introduce this vaccine into its immunisation schedule. It is already being used in Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Indonesia.

A day earlier, the premier’s adviser had proposed “confidence-building measures” between the leadership of the PML-N, the PTI, and the PPP could bring down political temperatures.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz has not set any condition of minus Imran Khan [from politics]. We neither seek to minus anyone nor consider it politically viable. Similar efforts were made to sideline us in the past,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan.
As the leader of the House, PM Shehbaz has offered negotiations to the opposition, saying they [PTI] should sit with him as dialogue is key to parliamentary democracy, Sanaullah added.
Maintaining that the opposition PTI had to take a step forward, the senior PML-N leader said that dialogue on behalf of the president, the PML-N supremo and the establishment was the premier’s “responsibility”.
“The PM has invited the opposition to meet in the National Assembly chamber if they do not want to visit [his office],” he added.
When asked about the statement he made a day earlier, Sanaullah said the prime minister must have taken Nawaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari and the establishment in to confidence before extending the offer of dialogue to the opposition.
Sanaullah added that despite efforts by Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) and PTI’s second- and third-tier leadership to initiate talks, nothing could materialise unless “Imran Khan’s policy changes in favour of dialogue”.
The PM’s adviser noted that the PTI founder had not authorised anyone to hold negotiations, adding that his message, conveyed by his sister Aleema Khan, was that “anyone who talks about negotiations is not among us”.
“He sent a message of street agitation and a wheel-jam strike, and also asked Sohail Afridi to visit Punjab, Balochistan and Sindh for mobilisation,” he said, reiterating that Imran was the sole “hindrance” in negotiations.
Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.</p><small>2026-01-03 02:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/03071330fb90f17.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964713/lg-elections-in-capital-likely-to-be-postponed-again' target='_blank'><strong>LG elections in capital likely to be postponed again</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Local government elections in Islamabad are likely to be postponed once again, for the fifth time in a row, as the federal cabinet on Friday approved several amendments to the Local Government Act, 2015.
The elections are scheduled to be held on February 15. However, the cabinet’s approval of fresh amendments to the Act has made it almost impossible to hold the polls next month. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, has yet to officially announce the postponement.
The federal cabinet approved 14 amendments to the Act, including a change in the name of the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad, replacing it with “Town Corporations”.







According to the new proposal, there will be three town corporations in Islamabad and each town corporation will comprise, as far as practicable, the territorial limits of a National Assembly (NA) constituency within the capital. Islamabad has three NA seats.

Cabinet approves changes to ICT Local Government Act 2015

“The cabinet endorsed the decisions made in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee for Legislative Cases on December 30, 2025, which also include confirmation of action regarding the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025,” said an official statement issued after the cabinet meeting.
When the election schedule was announced by the ECP last month, the local chapter of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had claimed that the government would opt for an escape route and would not conduct the elections in February.
The claim was rejected by the local leadership of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), which said it had won the last elections and would win again, while arguing that amendments were required for improved service delivery.
The term of the last local government expired in February 2021, and since then the elections have been delayed under various pretexts. As a result, around 2.5 million residents of Islamabad continue to face issues ranging from water shortages to unpaved streets.
Earlier, the ECP conducted delimitations of constituencies multiple times and issued election schedules on several occasions, only for them to be cancelled later. A few years ago, the elections were even cancelled a day before polling.
It is pertinent to note that when the local government’s term ended in 2021, PTI was in power and elections were supposed to be held within 120 days. However, the PTI government did not take serious steps to conduct the polls.
When the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) came into power, it too delayed the elections.
During the PDM’s tenure, elections were set to be held in 50 union councils (UCs), but the government argued that the number should be increased to 101 UCs in the federal capital, leading to further delays.
Later, when arrangements were finalised to hold elections in 101 UCs, the PDM government proposed increasing the number of UCs from 101 to 125. Elections were then scheduled for 125 UCs, but in September last year the government decided to increase the number of general seats in the UCs.
Last month, the ECP decided to hold elections for 125 UCs, but the government has now introduced fresh amendments to the local government law, replacing the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad with town corporations and dividing them into three areas.
The first and only local government elections in the capital were held in 2015–16, which were won by the PML-N, with Sheikh Anser Aziz elected as mayor of Islamabad. At that time, there were 50 union councils in the capital.

Professor Syed Saeed Ashraf, a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales, was awarded for services to cardiac surgery, the training of overseas surgeons and his academic contributions. 
Swansea Bay University Health Board announced the honour on New Year’s Eve, describing Dr Ashraf as an outstanding clinician who extends life-saving expertise to developing countries.  
Dr Ashraf regularly uses his annual leave to perform voluntary, complex heart operations at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases in Karachi, Pakistan. 
He primarily treats young patients suffering from rheumatic valvular heart disease — a condition now rare in Western countries but prevalent in South Asia — and Afghan refugees receiving free care in Pakistan.  
During one six-week mission, Dr Ashraf worked seven days a week, dedicating Sundays to training Pakistani and Afghan surgeons in wet labs. Many of these trainees have since returned to peripheral hospitals, expanding the reach of specialised care. 
“I am deeply honoured and humbled to receive this OBE,” Dr Ashraf said. “This recognition reflects not only my work but also the support and dedication of my family, colleagues and mentors.” 
Richard Evans, executive medical director at Swansea Bay University Health Board, said Dr Ashraf’s commitment to delivering procedures in underserved regions is “truly inspiring”. 
Mr Ashraf described his visits as a way of “giving something back” to the country where he began his medical career.

Reports said the incident took place near a petrol pump near GBS, as Fawad was headed to his office.
The four security guards who were injured in the attack were rushed to DHQ Hospital. However, hospital authorities referred a critically injured guard to Faisalabad, but he succumbed to his injuries.
Jhang police, meanwhile, arrested four suspects, including two alleged gunmen and Fawad’s stepbrother, a statement from a police spokesperson read.
Police said that Fawad and his stepbrother were travelling in separate convoys when their vehicles collided with each other. The collision triggered a scuffle between guards from both groups.
The gunmen of another suspect, who was travelling with the stepbrother, allegedly opened fire on Fawad’s group, shooting four of his guards, the statement added.
Quoting Jhang District Police Officer Bilal Iftikhar Kayani, the statement read that strict action is being taken against the suspects and that “no concession would be made to those who challenge the law”.
“Turning a minor dispute into violence and firing is a threat to the peace of the society,” DPO Kayani was quoted as saying.
Recounting the incident on camera, Fawad said that he and his guards were unarmed at the time, as they were not allowed to carry weapons.



Meanwhile, Waqas issued a statement on his X account condemning the incident as a “cowardly and planned attack”.
“It is extremely alarming that a peaceful city, which had become a cradle of peace due to our collective efforts over the past several years, is today being dragged back into unrest due to a few miscreants and rogue elements,” Waqas wrote.
“I make an unequivocal demand from the Punjab Police that all suspects involved in the incident be arrested immediately, transparent and impartial investigations be ensured, and those responsible be given exemplary punishment in accordance with the law,” he added.







In a later statement, Waqas said that the deceased guard’s family blocked Gujranwala Road and placed his body in front of Jhang Civil Hospital.
“We stand with his family and will fully support him,” the PTI information secretary wrote. “We will never leave them alone—we will ensure Mohsin’s family gets justice and will knock on every door of justice.”







Reports said that over the past six months, Fawad’s stepbrother had joined hands with the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) to contest elections against Waqas and his father, provincial lawmaker Sheikh Muhammad Akram.
The GDA had also recently announced they would contest all future elections against the Sheikh family.</p><small>2026-01-02 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0222390797d3af5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964687/four-decomposed-bodies-recovered-from-ditch-in-karachis-mai-kolachi' target='_blank'><strong>Four decomposed bodies recovered from ditch in Karachi’s Mai Kolachi</strong></a><br><p>Police and rescue services recovered four decomposed bodies from a ditch on Karachi’s Mai Kolachi Road on Friday night.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza said four bodies were found in a deep ditch covered with bushes on the “jungle side” of the road in the limits of Docks police station.
Police rushed to the scene after receiving information from a scavenger about the presence of the bodies. Upon recovery, it was found that they were 10-15 days old and had decomposed. Two of the bodies were male and the other two female.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson in a statement said one of the deceased appeared to be a boy.
“The bodies have been sent to a hospital for legal formalities and the police are investigating the case from all aspects,” DIG Raza added.
Earlier this week, the body of an employee of the University of Karachi, stuffed in a gunny bag, was found at a desolate place in Safoora Town.
The police said that it appeared that the victim was bludgeoned to death.
A police officer elaborated that the victim was an employee of the H.E.J. Research Institute at KU.

Her relatives alleged that she was killed in the crossfire of a gunfight between police and suspected robbers.
Landhi Station House Officer (SHO) Salahuddin Qazi told Dawn that a 17-year-old resident of the Lines Area had accompanied her mother to visit a relative in Landhi.
She was returning home in a rickshaw when a bullet passed through the vehicle and struck her in the chest. She sustained critical wounds and was transported to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where doctors pronounced her dead.
The victim’s uncle told media persons at the hospital that his niece was gunned down during crossfire between police and suspects in the area.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the girl was dead on arrival at the hospital and added that her family did not permit any medico-legal procedures and took the body.
Inquiry ordered
Taking notice of the incident, Korangi Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari set up an inquiry committee led by Landhi Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Faiza Sodhar and comprising the Landhi and Awami Colony SHOs.
“The committee has been directed to conduct a thorough and transparent inquiry about the incident and submit a report immediately,” a police spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement added that personnel from Awami Colony police station chased a group of suspects who allegedly committed a robbery outside a bank in the Korangi area. The suspects allegedly resorted to indiscriminate firing on the police team.
The police continued chasing the suspects, wounding one of them in the gunfight, while his accomplice managed to escape. Police recovered a pistol and a mobile phone from the wounded suspect.
According to the statement, police later received information that the teenager was shot and injured in the gunfight.
Landhi SHO Salahuddin Qazi, who is also a member of the inquiry team, told Dawn that the initial probe revealed a discrepancy in timing between the two incidents.
He explained that the girl sustained a “straight bullet wound” at around 11:30am, while the Awami Colony SHO claimed that the encounter took place around 1pm.
Police also claimed that the deceased girl’s uncle, in a written statement, told the police and doctors that “this was an incident”, adding that they did not want any legal proceedings.
This is not the first instance of a bystander getting killed in the crossfire between police and criminals. Last October, two passersby were killed in a crossfire between two groups that clashed at Khyber Chowk in Karachi’s Ittehad Town area.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that armed men from the Mehsud and Afridi tribes fired on each other after a quarrel between their children.
The officer said that the passersby were wounded in the crossfire and were rushed to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital, where they succumbed during treatment.</p><small>2026-01-02 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02202045f632134.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964683/yemens-government-launches-operation-against-southern-separatists' target='_blank'><strong>Yemen’s government launches operation against southern separatists</strong></a><br><p>Yemen’s Saudi-backed government launched an operation to take back military positions from southern separatists on Friday and said it had reclaimed one of the largest military camps in Hadramout province.
The operation in Hadramout marks the latest escalation in Yemen.
Hadramout’s governor, Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi, said in a statement on Friday that his forces had taken control of a military camp in al-Khasha’a, the largest and most important base in the province.
The governor had earlier said his forces were launching what he called a “peaceful” operation.
A senior official of the Southern Transitional Council told Reuters the operation had not been peaceful.
Yemen’s government said it had appointed Hadramout’s governor to take overall command of the “Homeland Shield” forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order.
This is not a declaration of war, the governor said in a speech on Yemen TV, adding that the move aims to prevent the use of camps to threaten security and to protect Hadramout from sliding into chaos.
The oil-producing Hadramout province borders Saudi Arabia and many prominent Saudis trace their origins to it, lending it cultural and historical significance for the kingdom.
A spokesperson for the STC, Mohammed al-Naqeeb, said on Friday that forces were on full alert across the region and warned that it was ready to respond forcefully in a post on X.







The STC told Reuters that three of the airstrikes targeted the al-Khasha’a military camp.
Three Yemeni sources told Reuters armoured vehicles belonging to the government had been moving towards the Khasha’a camp, which has the capacity to house thousands of troops and was taken over by the STC in December.
The STC, which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, which in turn saw the move as a threat.
The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours.
OPEC+ members will meet online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates have said they will extend a policy of maintaining first-quarter production unchanged.
Aden airport shut
Today, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden.
A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown.
“For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation … but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi,” the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X.







Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden’s airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land.
Aden’s international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.</p><small>2026-01-02 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0213343429cd6bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964657/islamabad-atc-hands-double-life-sentences-to-youtuber-adil-raja-6-others-for-waging-war-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC hands double life sentences to YouTuber Adil Raja, 6 others for ‘waging war against Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) handed out two life sentences each to YouTuber Adil Raja, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, anchorperson Haider Raza Mehdi, analyst Moeed Pirzada and former army official Akbar Hussain in cases related to riots in the country on May 9, 2023.
The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest.
Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia.
The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws.
According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station.
Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station.
The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage or abetting in waging war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences.
They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC.
Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC.
They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences.
In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders.
The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentences handed out to them were to run concurrently.
“The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said.
The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”.
During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused.
Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court.
A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences.
The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023.
The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest.
Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023.
Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases.
“At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”.
“The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-02 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6955e30e90ac9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964435/rise-of-crypto-the-trump-binance-crypto-trifecta' target='_blank'><strong>Rise Of Crypto: The Trump, Binance, & Crypto Trifecta</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN already has widespread crypto adoption, particularly among the youth. Not regulating it is a recipe for disaster, crypto policy czar Bilal bin Saqib has said repeatedly in interviews.
Pakistan ranks among the world’s highest crypto adopters. In 2022, it stood sixth globally for crypto adoption and climbed to third place by 2025, according to Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analytics firm. While the country may be struggling to adopt digitisation, this is one sector where the regulation is trying to catch up with reality.
Over time, the government and state institutions have come to recognise that crypto cannot be ignored or wished away. In 2018, the State Bank issued a notice strongly indicating that trading in cryptocurrencies was illegal. As recently as May 2025, after the Pakistan Crypto Council was officially launched in March, both the State Bank and the Ministry of Finance said that cryptocurrency remains banned in the country and all its transactions are illegal under current regulations.
However, whether crypto is officially legal remains a grey area. The country’s virtual assets regulator, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, still displays “launching soon” across key sections of its website, including regulations, licensing, and its public register. That may be understandable: the authority itself is barely five months old, having been formally constituted in July 2025.
What is striking is the timing. Renewed official interest in crypto gathered pace around the same period that a high-profile delegation from World Liberty Financial visited Islamabad. World Liberty Financial is a decentralised finance project linked to the Trump family, with Donald Trump listed as co-founder emeritus, a role he relinquished after assuming office.

The crypto ecosystem in Pakistan is now intertwined with Binance, the Trump family’s crypto interests, and a regulatory framework still under construction.

In multiple interviews, his son Eric Trump, also a co-founder, has laid out the family’s pivot towards crypto. Following the January 2021 US Capitol incident, he claims the Trump family was “debanked,” with hundreds of accounts shut down by major financial institutions, including Capital One, Deutsche Bank, and Signature Bank. The family also faced civil and criminal investigations into its finances. Eric Trump has argued that the financial system was weaponised against them for political reasons.

 

Seeking to regain control over their finances, the Trumps entered the crypto space with World Liberty Financial in September 2024. Reuters estimates that the family earned more than $800 million from crypto asset sales in the first half of 2025 alone.
Under Donald Trump’s second presidency, the regulatory environment in the United States also shifted sharply. Several Biden-era lawsuits against crypto firms, including Coinbase and Binance, were dropped. Binance — one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges — had pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating US anti-money laundering laws and paid over $4 billion in penalties.
In 2025, MGX, a firm linked to the Abu Dhabi government, purchased $2bn worth of USD1 stablecoins issued by World Liberty Financial to acquire a minority stake in Binance. Soon after, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had served a four-month sentence for compliance failures last year, was pardoned by President Trump, effectively clearing his criminal conviction in October.
Before the pardon, Zhao met Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz in April, shortly after the Pakistan Crypto Council was formed, and was appointed its strategic adviser. Binance remains one of the most popular crypto apps in Pakistan, ranking seventh in the finance category and holding the third-most-downloaded finance app position for two consecutive years, according to the Pakistan State of Apps 2024 report by Data Darbar.
Binance has since signed a memorandum of understanding with JazzCash to explore crypto-linked payments and broader digital-asset use cases. It has also entered into a non-binding letter of intent with the Fauji Foundation — whose ecosystem includes Askari Bank — to examine collaboration across blockchain, Web3, and crypto infrastructure.
On the regulatory front, the government has issued no-objection certificates to Binance and cryptocurrency exchange HTX, allowing them to begin structured engagement ahead of full licensing. Separately, Pakistan and Binance have signed an MoU to explore the tokenisation of up to $2bn in sovereign bonds, T-bills, and commodity reserves.
In short, the crypto ecosystem in Pakistan is now intertwined with Binance, the Trump family’s crypto interests, and a regulatory framework still under construction.
“President Donald Trump is making crypto a national priority, and every country, including Pakistan, will ultimately have to follow suit,” Mr Saqib has said in an interview. Yet even as policy momentum accelerates, the true scale of Pakistan’s crypto economy remains opaque.
Some media reports suggest an informal market worth $25bn with roughly 20 million users. That works out to an average of $1,250 per user, a figure that does not seem implausible but remains impossible to independently verify in an ecosystem that has operated largely in the shadows.
According to Chainalysis’s 2025 Geography of Crypto report, stablecoins in Pakistan are used as a hedge against inflation, while many freelancers receive payments in crypto. Much of the crypto activity, however, takes place through peer-to-peer channels that operate without know-your-customer checks. This has raised red flags.
Earlier this year, Malik Bostan, chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, estimated that the country may have lost as much as $600m to illegal crypto transactions; flows that could potentially draw scrutiny from the Financial Action Task Force.
Regulating the crypto ecosystem, then, is not a policy choice so much as a national imperative. However, the speed of Pakistan’s regulatory pivot must be matched by infrastructure that is both robust and tailored to local risks, from consumer protection to financial crime oversight. If bringing crypto into the regulatory fold also aligns with Pakistan’s geopolitical interests and plays well in Washington, so be it. But the primary test of any framework will be whether it protects citizens first.</p><small>2026-01-02 05:41</small></div><hr>
