According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection on February 24.
Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later.
Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations.
The Pims doctor said: “Prior to the procedure, he was examined by a board of specialists: a consultant cardiologist who also performed echocardiography and ECG (result: normal) and a consultant physician.
“After obtaining informed consent, and under standard monitoring, precautionary measures and protocols in the operation theatre, he was injected with a second dose of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF under the guidance of microscopy by consultant phthalmologist, and a consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon of Pims and Al-Shifa Eye Hospital.”
It may be mentioned that Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital is located in Rawalpindi, whereas Shifa International Hospital — where Imran’s family and personal doctors want him to be taken — is in Islamabad.
The procedure was performed as a day care surgery, the Pims doctor said about Imran’s treatment.
During the course of his stay, Imran remained vitally stable before, during, and after the procedure, and was discharged along with instructions for care, follow-up advice, and the documents, the doctor stated.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, in a post on X, said it was “necessary to clarify that the government took him (Imran) to Pims under strict security arrangements while fulfilling all legal and humanitarian requirements”.
He further said that the PTI founder would be administered a third injection on March 24.
Chaudhry stated: “According to doctors’ instructions, there was an improvement in the eyesight after the first procedure, keeping in view which expert physicians recommended a second procedure.
“Today’s process was completed successfully and after clearance from the medical team, he was shifted back to Adiala.”
The minister reaffirmed that providing prisoners with medical facilities was the state’s responsibility, adding, “Even in this matter, all arrangements were transparent and according to the regulations.”







PTI objects to ‘clandestine actions’
Reacting to the development, the PTI’s official X account said: “The situation demands transparency, not secrecy.” The party said such “clandestine actions only give rise to more questions.”
“What are they hiding?” the party asked, reiterating its demand that Imran be taken to Shifa International Hospital for “independent and transparent medical care”.
The PTI re-shared a video showing a convoy passing through at night, in which a person can be heard saying the vehicles were “returning from Pims”.







It could not be verified whether the convoy was carrying the former premier.
In a post on X, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said, “At 2am today, I was informed this much in a message that Khan sahib was brought to Pims for administering an injection.”
“I was not informed in advance,” he claimed.
The PTI chairman stressed, “Our demand even today is the same that a complete checkup and treatment of Khan sahib be performed in Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors and family members.”







The government has said it had invited Gohar to be present during an examination of Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 15, but the PTI leader refused, citing party consultations.
In her statement on X, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum reiterated: “We do not trust the diagnosis or test reports from government medical facilities.”
She said: “From the news, we found out that Imran Khan was taken to Pims again in the middle of the night, supposedly for his second injection in the eye.
“When the law requires that family be informed before any medical procedure is conducted on a prisoner, why was the family not informed?” she asked.
Expressing her lack of trust in the government-affiliated treatments, she claimed, “There are already reports coming from PIMS that the doctors are being threatened with serious consequences if any information is leaked about Imran Khan.”
Aleema further said, “Our family rejects their reports, even if they issue these doctored reports to the public.
“We stand by our demand that Imran Khan be examined and treated in Shifa International (Islamabad) by specialists, under the supervision of Imran Khan’s personal doctors and in the presence of his family.”
She contended that Pims was “not equipped to treat anyone for the alleged condition that has developed in Imran Khan’s eye”.
“It is criminal what this government is doing, and they will be held accountable for each and every violation and crime they are committing against Imran Khan,” Aleema asserted.







Former PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed it “totally unacceptable” that Imran was treated in the absence of his personal physicians.
Addressing Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, he said, “Now is the time to stand and be counted. Issue orders to ensure PM Imran Khan’s treatment in the presence of his physicians and in the hospital of his choice (Shifa International Islamabad).”

The discussion comes amid a major US force buildup in the region and conflicting signals about Washington’s goals, with many experts warning that military capability is outpacing strategic definition.
Signaling through the media.
A report in The New York Times suggesting Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike, with the possibility of a broader campaign later, is widely seen as part of a pressure strategy on Tehran.
Vali Nasr, former senior advisor at the United States Department of State and professor at Johns Hopkins University, posted on X that “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.”







Adrian Calamel, Vice President of Research at Viking Strategies, pushed back: “You honestly believe Trump is using the New York Times for signaling purposes?”
The exchange reflects a broader uncertainty in Washington: whether these moves are part of a controlled coercive strategy or evidence of drift toward military conflict. Several analysts suggest Trump’s personal instinct is to avoid a major war while still using military pressure as leverage.
William F. Wechsler, Senior Director of Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and counterterrorism, said everyone he has spoken with in Trump’s circles “has come away with the same conclusion: Trump does not want this war. He is, with good reason, extremely concerned with where it could lead.”
Wechsler also highlighted operational limits of any regime-change scenario “I can’t imagine that any option will be presented to the president that would include US conventional ground forces.”
Thomas Wright, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, urged patience. “The United States does not need a comprehensive deal with Iran now … Nor is a war necessary. The clock is not ticking on America,” he wrote in The Atlantic.
Vali Nasr warned: “If Iran concludes that even after a deal, economic pressure, isolation, and ‘mowing the lawn’ will continue, then they may take their chances with rejecting capitulation and prepare for war.”
Ali Hashem, Middle East journalist and analyst, in a post on X quoted by Nasr, added: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.”







Danny Citrinowicz, fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, told the Atlantic Council: “Military action carries a high risk of regional escalation … and could draw the United States into yet another prolonged Middle Eastern conflict.”
Jason M. Brodsky, member of the Atlantic Council’s Iran Strategy Project Working Group, suggested a “whole-of-government approach aimed at weakening the Iranian regime, using diplomatic, economic, military, kinetic, cyber, and covert tools.”
Max Boot, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in The Washington Post “With Trump’s motives and objectives so unclear, it’s little wonder that talks aren’t working.”
Gideon Rachman, Chief Foreign Affairs Commentator at the Financial Times, warned: “Vague or unachievable war aims increase the chances of a prolonged US military operation.”
He added that past externally driven regime collapses in the Middle East produced prolonged conflict, mass casualties, refugee flows, and space for militant groups.
Military scenarios
From these assessments, three realistic pathways emerge:
Limited coercive strike — aligns with Trump’s stated preference for short operations but still risks retaliation across the region.
Sustained air campaign — a rolling effort to degrade Iranian capabilities, which could slide into a long war without decisive political results.
Regime-change strategy without ground forces — widely seen as militarily implausible.
Experts also urge Washington to consider the likely consequences:
Regional: attacks on US forces and partners, maritime disruption, multi-front pressure on Israel.
Iranian domestic politics: an external attack could consolidate, rather than weaken, the ruling system in the short term.
US domestic politics: tension between war fatigue and presidential credibility.
Global: energy market shocks, strain on alliances, and opportunities for rival powers.
The emerging consensus is not that war is inevitable, but that the risk of miscalculation is high because military movement is not matched by strategic clarity.</p><small>2026-02-24 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241041120b3fbca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975392/bloodbath-continues-as-kse-100-sheds-over-2000-points-during-early-trading' target='_blank'><strong>Bloodbath continues as KSE-100 sheds over 2,000 points during early trading</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, was trading in the red during early intraday trading on Tuesday, down 2,262.95 points by 10:30am.
The index has already witnessed a volatile trading session, swinging between an intraday high of 169,237.51 points and a low of 165,185.08 points before the midday mark.
The top active stocks were led by Hascol Petroleum Limited, declining 6.88 per cent to Rs16.10 at a volume of 25,404,479, followed by Bank of Punjab, falling 5.50pc to Rs28.53 at a volume of 19,130,495, and Worldcall Telecom Limited, falling 1.51pc to Rs1.30.
This 1.35pc fall from its previous close of 167,691.08 points comes on the heels of the index’s bloodbath on Monday, the third major meltdown at the PSX in the past two weeks, with the KSE-100 losing 5,149.80 points on February 16 and 6,683 points, the steepest single-day decline in history, on February 19.
Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, noted that the market is in “correction mode.” He stated that the current sell-off “appears to be driven by above-average foreign selling, Reko Diq-related concerns, softer corporate results, and stock futures unwinding”.
Interestingly, he cautions against deeming this as a bearish market, calling it an “11pc correction instead”.







AKD Securities believed that geopolitical developments and the outcome of the upcoming IMF review mission, due to arrive next week, will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.
Investors will also be looking towards corporate earnings reports for a possible upside.
Pakistan Oilfields Ltd announced its 2QFY26 results today. The company recorded a profit of Rs6.3 billion, down 17pc YoY but up 16pc QoQ. This takes 1HFY26 earnings to Rs41.29/share, up 16pc YoY, according to Topline Securities.
The brokerage house noted that earnings came out higher than expectations, driven by higher-than-expected other income and a lower Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which stood at 26pc in 2QFY26, compared to 37pc in 2QFY25 and 33pc in 1QFY26.</p><small>2026-02-24 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24105147cbef358.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975393/seven-killed-in-air-ambulance-crash-in-indias-jharkhand-state' target='_blank'><strong>Seven killed in air ambulance crash in India’s Jharkhand state</strong></a><br><p>All seven people on board a Beechcraft air ambulance that crashed in the Indian state of Jharkhand on Monday were killed, officials said on Tuesday, including two crew members, the patient and his relatives.
The Beechcraft C90 plane, operated by Redbird Airways, took off from state capital Ranchi but requested a change to its flight path due to weather, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on Monday.
The aircraft subsequently lost communication and radar contact, the regulator said.
Rescue and medical teams rushed to the site of the crash, which local media said was deep inside a difficult-to-access forest.
“The team of doctors found them, and declared them dead,” local administrative official Keerthishree G told reporters, adding that two of the seven people killed were crew members.
“We have pulled out the bodies and sent them for post-mortem and further investigation,” the official said.
Keerthishree G is the deputy commissioner of Chatra district, where the crash occurred during a thunderstorm.
A team from India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has been dispatched to investigate the cause, the regulator said.
Most air crashes are due to a combination of factors and can take at least a year to investigate, according to industry experts.
Relatives of the patient, Sanjay Kumar, told reporters he was injured in a fire and was initially undergoing treatment in Ranchi.
“His condition had become worse so we were taking him to Delhi by air ambulance,” said Vijay Sau, his older brother.
Last month, a Learjet 45 charter aircraft crashed killing all five people on board, including the deputy chief minister of India’s wealthiest state of Maharashtra and two members of his staff.

The US president’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Trump was “curious” about Iran’s resolve to resist his warnings if a deal was not reached on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
There are straightforward reasons to explain Iran’s refusal to surrender as Trump wants. But they may not make much sense to the world of pelf and plunder that the US president subscribes to like an addict. Let’s say the answer, if the so-called ‘most powerful man on the planet’ is indeed interested in one, lies in defiant deaths people throughout history have preferred to abject surrender.
One need not go too far from US shores to observe an instance in 1775 when an American patriot, for goodness sake, Patrick Henry, gave the world the slogan: “Give me liberty, or give me death.” Henry eventually succeeded in persuading Virginia to join the American war of independence against colonial Britain. Around 80 years later, Patrick Henry’s call was picked up by a host of Indian rebels against British rule and gave rise to a metaphor: 1857.
More recently, again not far from America, Trump and Witkoff should be able to understand Iran by simply reading about the life of 23-year-old American peace activist Rachel Corrie. While in Rafah on March 16, 2003, the activist-diarist joined other International Solidarity Movement volunteers in efforts to non-violently stop Israel’s demolition of Palestinian property; she was killed by an Israeli bulldozer that crushed her. The list only grows.

Trump and Witkoff should be able to understand Iran by simply reading about the life of American peace activist Rachel Corrie

The Vietnam war, the occupation of Afghanistan and the ignominious escape of the American forces from Kabul are worthy examples at par with the regime change effected in Iraq. They bear witness to the fallacy of the invincibility and problem-solving capacity of American military might. As for the current state of play underway in the Gulf — once described by Lord Curzon imperiously as a “British lake” — one would do well to revisit the circumstances and the ideological moorings that propelled the success of the 1979 Iranian revolution under Ayatollah Khomeini’s watch. The Islamic revolution was not an Islamic revolution when Iranians first began to rock the throne of the Shah of Iran.
The revolution was actually framed and led by the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party and the pro-China Mujahideen-i-Khalq, both secular radicals who saw the rural Shia populace as their mass base. It was an error of judgement they did that. Remember that Khomeini arrived in Tehran on board an Air France flight from Paris, that too after the Shah had been kicked out. A Soviet defector, meanwhile, gave away the file on Tudeh activists to London. It was duly passed on to the Shia clerics manning the upheaval.
When I met Tudeh chief Noureddin Kianouri in Tehran, he was lodged in the notorious Evan prison where he had turned into a calligraphist of religious texts. Pro-West leaders like president Abolhassan Banisadr fled to Europe, while others like foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh were executed. In walked Ronald Reagan with the treasures of Contra arms package as a reward for Khomeini’s help in not releasing US hostages before the results of the 1980 presidential elections. It was thus that Iran enabled the Republican candidate to defeat Jimmy Carter whose chequered political career it abruptly ended.
Secularism or religiousness of Muslim leaders was never the West’s concern. It toppled secular regimes in Libya, Syria and Iraq and it now wants a secular autocrat to supplant the clergy as rulers. The West has backed a religious autocrat like Ziaul Haq and aligned with a secular dictator like Pervez Musharraf. It courts a religious revivalist like Narendra Modi after blackballing him when ties were flourishing with the secular Manmohan Singh. The common thread between the CIA-led coup against Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mosaddegh in 1953 and the kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in a murderous assault on his home in Caracas are of a piece with the West’s all weather backup plan for faltering finance capitalism: colonial plunder.

 

Above all, the most important clue to answering Trump’s anxiety about Iran’s refusal to surrender to his bullying lies in the 680 AD battle of Karbala from where Shia Islam draws its main inspiration. The martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali and his family by the forces of Yazid ibn Muawiya holds the key. Indian nationalist leader Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar put the equation succinctly in a verse that seems to nicely describe the leitmotif of the current rulers of Iran. “Qatl-i-Hussein asl mein marg-i-Yazid hai/ Islam zinda hota hai har Karbala ke baad.” (The killing of Hussein in fact marked Yazid’s demise/ Islam thus became the martyr’s prize.) How does Trump hope to defeat a people whose battle cry craves martyrdom? Has the CIA not translated the Persian chant on the streets of Tehran and Qom to him: “Hussein Hussein Shah-i-ma/ Shahaadat iftekhar-i-ma!” (Hussein rules my heart and soul/ martyrdom fills my spirit’s bowl!)
Years ago, in the middle of an eight year-long lacerating war in which the West backed Saddam Hussein against Khomeini, a 13-year-old Iranian boy became the hero of his nation by standing his ground (not unlike Rachel Corrie) against Iraqi troops in Khorramshahr.
Hossein Fahmideh, according to Iranian lore, saw an Iraqi tank advancing. Having run out of ammunition for his RPG, he wrapped himself in a grenade belt, jumped under the Iraqi tank, and blew it up. Upon hearing of the event, Khomeini said: “Our leader is that 13-year-old child who, with his small heart, far greater than hundreds of our tongues and pens, threw himself with a grenade under the enemy tank… .” Does that make sense to Messrs Witkoff and Trump?

For me. To bore the readers by continuing with the theme of a recent piece where the eye spied some kaalakaala in the khichri of our politics. Little ol’ me thinks the problem continues. But it’s not the same dark shadow spotted in the past; there is a new one in another corner of the dish called Punjab.

 

Punjab is not just the biggest province in the country but also the most prized. The battle for Islamabad is always waged here and chances are for Lahore to be awarded to those who are the favoured ones for the centre. And it was no different this time around where N bagged the centre and Takht-i-Lahore (while PTI won both in 2018). And as the regime consolidated its hold, it was clear the government in Punjab was the most cherished.
The kind of coverage provided to Maryam Nawaz, chief minister Punjab, on mainstream media was unmatched, in comparison to her counterparts elsewhere. In fact, at times it seemed Punjab got more coverage than the prime minister himself. And the general opinion being expressed on these platforms was that she and her team were doing an excellent job of all things governance. Perhaps, there was space to say the ‘work’ might not be winning over voters but it was rare if not impossible to say that the governance was anything but superb. That was the general tone of the reporting and the commentary and the live coverage was lengthy too.
By the time Basant rolled around, the reporting and commentary became even more ‘gushing’.

Much of the Basant goodwill has been squandered by news of an unnecessary expense.

And then came the twist. The government of Punjab bought a plane — ostensibly for the use of the chief executive, for it is said to be one of those small aircraft used by corporates around the world for travel. When exactly this purchase happened is unclear for the knowledge of this became public via social media. An account on X tweeted the news recently. Not much is known about this account but people let their imagination run wild because the name/ handle can easily be associated or assumed to be associated with a certain actor in our political sphere.
Interestingly, the tweet was far from critical; in fact, it was rather positive, commending the government for its acquisition. But the impact, predictably, was the opposite. It unleashed a storm of criticism — but this time around it wasn’t just on social media, where anonymous and troll accounts can have a go at anyone, with safety. This time around, the usually generous mainstream media took umbrage at the lavish spending by the Punjab government, criticising its decision to buy an expensive executive plane at a time when the economy is not doing well, the people are suffering hardship and there is ample evidence of malnutrition and poverty.
Since then, there have been some efforts to stop the criticism and commentary but it still continues here and there. And even more intriguing is the identity of some of the ‘critics’ — the ones who are said to be close to the ‘powerful’ ones in this country and claim to not just know what they are thinking but also communicate it to the rest of us commoners. So the assumption is that their commentary, at the moment, also reflects more than just their own views.
Second, their analysis runs along very similar lines; Maryam had earned considerable goodwill from her decision to revive Basant, and now much of that has been squandered by the news of this unnecessary expense. It is a line of argument being heard again and again. Some commentary went further to communicate that there is concern in powerful quarters about the lavish events she holds to launch projects and how this expense might attract scrutiny at some vague moment in the future. Others still linked the reported purchase of the plane to the NFC and excessive spending by the provinces in these difficult times. Some of these could be personal flourishes but the consensus is that Basant has been undone by the purchase of the plane.
A further twist is the reaction of the Punjab government. Usually, it pounces on criticism with hawk-like precision. The journalist who was picked up for tweeting a clip of Maryam Nawaz’s slip of the tongue during a speech is a case in point. Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari rarely ignores any criticism, not even in tweets; this time around she made an early appearance to explain the plane was part of the new airline that the province was going to launch. But once questions were raised about this assertion, she has gone quiet as have the rest of her colleagues. This silence, too, is hard to understand. Has the assault quietened them or is it because there is realisation that this criticism is not organic? In the latter case, governments do tend to get paralysed.
And in our conspiracy-addled brains, all of this is adding up; or shall I say our brains are feverishly trying to put together jigsaw pieces?
Indeed, this is a long-winded way of saying that, some of us who are familiar with past events wonder if this newfound ‘story’ of bad decision-making by a government and the storm of criticism is yet another sign of change in the air. This is not to say the change is dramatic enough to signal the end of this set-up or that it is clear enough as to where it is headed. But something is up; some of us think we can smell it in the air.
We have been at this crossroads far too many times in the past to not recognise the signs.

Last week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that Pakistan would target Afghanistan if the terrorist violence continued. The latest strikes reported on Sunday bear out the minister’s comments.
The state says several TTP and IS-K camps have been hit in the neighbouring country, specifically in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, with security sources observing that at least 80 terrorists have been killed. Commenting on the military action on Monday, the parliamentary secretary for information has said that the country’s security is non-negotiable.
For its part, the Taliban regime says it will respond in an “appropriate” manner. Afghan officials have also claimed that civilians were hit, although Pakistani authorities term these allegations “false and malicious”.
In this month alone, there have been several major terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the bombing of an imambargah in Islamabad, which was traced to IS-K. More recent incidents include attacks in Bajaur and Bannu, which martyred several security men. These attacks were believed to be the handiwork of the banned TTP. Therefore, it appears that the state had little choice but to hit terrorist targets across the border.

 

As the information ministry noted, the regime in Kabul has failed to take any substantive action against violent actors on Afghan territory. The UN has pointed out in several reports that IS-K maintains a presence along Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. Though the Afghan Taliban oppose the IS-K, they have done little to dislodge the terrorist group from its perches along the border. In contrast, the TTP are ideological comrades of the Kabul regime, and it should be within the Afghan Taliban’s power to control their allies and prevent them from staging cross-border attacks.
Dialogue is always preferable to armed hostilities. However, when the other side does not make any attempt whatsoever to rein in terrorism emanating from its soil, then there remains no option but to target those who spill blood again and again. In the long term, the escalation of hostilities is in the interest of neither state, and all outstanding issues — particularly that of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan — need to be resolved diplomatically.
No state believes the Taliban when they say they do not host terrorist groups; the presence of lethal terrorists on Afghan soil is internationally well-documented. Therefore, the onus is on Kabul to put enough pressure on the TTP and other hostile actors to end attacks on Afghanistan’s neighbours. Achieving this would lead to better ties between Afghanistan and these countries. Left unaddressed, the issue will create a perilous regional situation.

During the proceedings, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo ordered the restoration of Ducky Bhai’s previously frozen bank accounts. He also granted him limited permission to upload videos on his YouTube channel.
However, the magistrate directed that the YouTuber must not discuss the sub-judice matter on his channel.
The magistrate observed that the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) raised objections to 27 videos uploaded on the suspect’s channel.
He said those videos should not be deleted at this stage.
A technical witness from the NCCIA appeared before the court for his testimony, however, the agency’s prosecutor was absent.
Due to the prosecutor’s absence, the magistrate adjourned the hearing till March 11.
The NCCIA had registered a case against several YouTubers and TikTokers on charges of promoting gambling apps on their social media accounts.
The agency had arrested Rehman during August last. The Lahore High Court had released him on bail on Nov 24, 2025.
After his release on bail, the YouTuber had accused the NCCIA officials of subjecting him to physical torture and humiliation during the custody.

KARACHI: While turning down an application of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) seeking to become a party in the proceedings, the Gul Plaza Judicial Commission on Monday recorded the testimonies of the municipal commissioner and various other officials in the Gul Plaza inferno probe.
As per the terms of reference (ToR), the single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court noted that the party could not become an intervener in these proceedings.
However, it advised the lawyer for the MQM-P to submit the information through email after the counsel asserted that the party has knowledge of some crucial facts and circumstances pertaining to the devastating fire incident.
The commission recorded the statements of the municipal commissioner, two police officials, the Civil Defence director, the president of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), a representative of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and a journalist.

Justice Agha Faisal rules commission’s ToRs do not permit intervention; advises Muttahida to submit their information via email

At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Tariq Mansoor submitted that the MQM-P has filed an application to become an intervener in these proceedings as the party was willing to provide information and crucial facts to the commission about the deadly inferno.
Justice Agha observed that the application could not be entertained as the ToRs of the commission have not allowed anybody to become an intervener in such proceedings.
However, he asked the counsel for the MQM-P to provide the information/data, if any, to the commission through an email. The lawyer replied that the information/data has been emailed to the commission.
Thereafter, the senior party leader Dr Farooq Sattar, who was also present along with another senior party leader Nasreen Jalil during the proceedings, attempted to address the commission.
However, Justice Agha asked him that he was disturbing the proceedings, and the commission would hear him after the hearing.
Municipal commissioner Sumera Hussain deposed that the plot of the ill-fated building was leased out in 1883 to the East India Company for tram services, and later, the company had sold out the same to five individuals who had handed over to the land to one Anwar Ali in 1976, and he had sold the plot to a private firm, Jeneka Group in, 1983.
When the bench asked about the purpose of the lease, she replied that the relevant documents were silent about it.
She also testified that the fire brigade department was under the administrative control of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). Responding to another question of the commission about the training and performance of the fire crew, she said that there was always room for improvement as the fire brigade was facing a shortage of manpower and a request was also made to the government for the purchase of equipment.
The municipal commissioner further said that the audit of Gul Plaza was carried out and that some of its recommendations were implemented.
‘Civil Defence lacks manpower to inspect all buildings’
Civil Defence Director Abdul Hameed deposed that the deputy commissioner (DC) had formed a committee in 2023 about Gul Plaza, and the body had also made its recommendations.
About a query regarding the inspection of all buildings, he said that the Civil Defence has lacked manpower and resources, and therefore, inspection was carried out randomly on a yearly basis.
When the commission asked him whether any action was taken for not implementing the recommendations made during an audit in 2025 about Gul Plaza, he replied that the DC concerned and the controller of Civil Defence could tell about the punishment or fine.
The director was also unaware of the issuance of the safety certificate to the building in question and said that the district committee would be in a better position to answer such questions.
SSP-City Arif Aziz deposed that four of the 17 gates of the ill-fated building were opened when the fire erupted. He was of the view that the watchmen, hired by the association of the building, were managing these entrance points and all such points had to be opened after the blaze.
When the commission confronted him about the CCTV footage, he replied that apart from the basement, the CCTV record was destroyed in the fire.
The SSP also stated that, as per initial information, a child of a shopkeeper was playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly broke out, and it spread sharply as inflammable material was available in the building.
SSP Traffic Aijaz Ahmed informed the commission that the city’s traffic police have the strength of only 5,200 personnel, and traffic personnel were called in from the surrounding areas shortly after the incident to make way for fire tenders.
He said that there was some disturbance on the M. A. Jinnah Road as the work was underway on a project about the extension of the Green Line.
KCCI president Rehan Hanif deposed that 11 committees have been constituted to consider and confirm the claims of shopkeepers of Gul Plaza.

 

He said that there were over 1200 shops in the gutted building, and around 850 claims were received and out of them 786 were admitted, three were rejected and the remaining claims were still under consideration due to some disputes.
Mansoor Shaikh, an officer of SSGC, said that four gas connections were provided to Gul Plaza, including two commercial and one each industrial and domestic, as the industrial connection was cut off in November. He was of the view that there was a gas loadshedding in the building when the fire erupted.
Adjourning the hearing till Feb 25, the commission also handed over questionnaires to the police officers about investigation & evidence, coordination & accountability, traffic management & access and provision of required documents.
Sattar alleges KE illegally set up gas turbine in basement
Meanwhile, speaking at a press conference, Dr Sattar was of the view that K-Electric had illegally installed a gas turbine and cylinders in the basement of Gul Plaza, one of the busiest commercial centres of the city, turning the entire area into a pile of explosive and why the provincial government was silent on such grave violations.
He claimed that they have approached the judicial commission as the party has evidence against corruption of the provincial government, irregularities in the construction of Gul Plaza building and inordinate delay in putting out the fire.

The prosecutors at the Hague-based war crimes court have charged Duterte with three counts of murder as a crime against humanity, involving dozens of victims that accusers say were only a fraction of the real death toll in his clampdown on alleged drug users and criminals.
“Duterte’s so-called war on drugs resulted in the killings of thousands of civilians and many of these victims were children,” prosecutor Mame Niang said at the opening of pre-trial hearings meant to confirm charges.

 

“Mr Duterte must be held to account and this case should be confirmed for trial,” he said. Under the ICC rules, judges will have to confirm charges before the case can move to trial. Duterte served as president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and was arrested and taken to The Hague last March.
According to the prosecutors, Duterte created, funded and armed death squads to target and kill alleged narcotics peddlers and users. Duterte has long insisted he instructed police to kill only in self-defence and has always defended the crackdown.



“Mr Duterte played a pivotal role in the committing of the charged crimes. His contribution was essential, as he was at the very heart of the plan to neutralise alleged criminals including through murder,” Niang said.
Opponents of Duterte gathered outside the court building, chanting “Hold Duterte accountable!” in Tagalog. “I hope, and I am quite confident, that the charges of murder and attempted murder will be confirmed” and Duterte’s guilt ultimately proven, Cristina Palabay, a worker at the human rights alliance Karapatan, said outside court. Duterte, 80, will not be present at the hearings, as his defence said he would not be able to understand proceedings due to his cognitive decline.
“For us, it’s cowardice,” said Sheerah Escudero, whose brother was killed during the war on drugs. “We know that Duterte will not be able to escape accountability.” After the hearings conclude on Friday, judges will take up to 60 days to decide if there is sufficient evidence to move the case to a trial.
‘High value targets’
Duterte faces three counts of crimes against humanity, with prosecutors alleging his involvement in at least 76 murders between 2013 and 2018. The true number of killings during his campaign in the Philippines is thought to be in the thousands, and lawyers for the victims have argued that a full trial could encourage more families to come forward.
Niang said the murders charges were “merely a fraction” of the real numbers killed.
Another prosecutor, Julian Nicholls, said: “The evidence shows… that Mr Duterte murdered thousands of his own people, Filippino men, women, and children.” Showing multiple videos of Duterte threatening to kill criminals, Nicholls said: “He repeatedly promised to kill people. He said it. He did it. That is who he is.” Duterte, who was president from 2016 to 2022, was arrested in Manila in March last year, flown to the Netherlands and has since been held at the ICC’s detention unit at Scheveningen Prison.

Now the 60-year-old, who makes a modest living selling dried seafood, is determined to return to his birthplace, having already missed the deaths of his parents and first wife in Bangladesh.
Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh finally resumed last month after a 14-year pause, reflecting a warming of ties.
Shah Alam has already started planning his trip to be reunited with remaining family.
“I will go,” he told AFP with teary eyes. “I am facing some financial issues but will certainly go with my son after Eid al-Azha,” referring to the festival expected in late May.
Shah Alam, who married again in Pakistan, still owns agricultural land and his family home in Bangladesh.
“Everything is there. I was stuck here,” he told AFP in Karachi, near the well-known Bengali market where he sells desiccated fish and prawns.
“I wanted to go back, but there was no way. The relationship [between Pakistan and Bangladesh] was not good. I had no money as well to go back home,” he said.
“Now, I want to see my elder brother and my married daughter who live in Bangladesh,” he added.
Hussain Ahmed, 20, whose family lives in Machhar Colony does not have Pakistani nationality or an identity card.
“How can I go [to Bangladesh]? I want to go there,” the fish factory worker told AFP. “Even my father doesn’t have an identity card. How can I get it then?” he added.
Most Bengalis rarely venture outside their home areas owing to fear of being interrogated by law enforcement agencies to prove their “identities” as Pakistani citizens.
Local politician Muhammad Rafiqul Hussain, who was born in Karachi, told AFP that Bengalis like him live across Pakistan and contribute to the economy like other Pakistanis.
He is one of the seven elected leaders from the Bengali community in Karachi’s municipal government.
For Hussain, the “cordial relationship” between Pakistan and Bangladesh has made a big difference for Pakistani Bengalis.
However, community activist and lawyer Hafiz Zainulabdin Shah said Bengalis living in Pakistan have lost some of their identity by adopting local languages.
But despite Pakistan-based Bengalis living “with a sense of deprivation”, Shah said “they feel content with the newly developed relationship between the two countries”.

“Any country that wants to ‘play games’ with the ridiculous supreme court decision, especially those that have ‘Ripped Off’ the US for years, and even decades, will be met with a much higher tariff, and worse, than that which they just recently agreed to,” Trump posted on social media.







However, China urged the United States to cancel the ‘unilateral’ tariffs announced by President Trump after the US Supreme Court struck down the oft-trumpted tariff measures on imports.
China’s commerce ministry said it was conducting a “comprehensive assessment” of the ruling’s impact, and called on Washington to lift the tariffs.

China urges US to cancel unilateral measures, warning that ‘there are no winners in a trade war’

“China urges the US to cancel its unilateral tariff measures on its trading partners,” the ministry said, reminding the US that there were no winners in a trade war and that “protectionism leads nowhere.”
EU plans to freeze trade deal
EU lawmakers said they would put on hold a key trade deal with the United States after the SC struck down many of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
European Parliament negotiators will meet to formally agree to freeze plans to approve the deal agreed last year.
The parliament’s trade committee had been due to give its green light on Tuesday to remove tariffs on US industrial goods as part of the accord.

GENEVA: The United Nations Secretary General on Monday called for a renewed international security architecture in response to a rapidly shifting global order.
“We are living through a period of chaos and change…The international order that defined security relations for nearly eight decades is shifting rapidly,” said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
“Moving forward, we need to create a renewed international security architecture. This needs to be based on sober analysis of the international situation,” he added.
“Human rights are under a full-scale attack around the world,” he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council’s annual session in Geneva.
“The rule of law is being outmuscled by the rule of force.” The UN secretary-general stressed that “this assault is not coming from the shadows, or by surprise. It is happening in plain sight — and often led by those who hold the greatest power”.
He did not mention specific situations, although he did voice outrage at Russia’s war in Ukraine, where he said more than 15,000 civilians had been killed in four years of violence.
“It is more than past time to end the bloodshed,” he said.
Guterres also highlighted the “blatant violations of human rights, hum­an dignity and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory”.
He charged that the trajectory in the conflict-torn territories under Israeli occupation was “stark, clear and purposeful: the two-state solution is being stripped away in broad daylight”. “The international community can­­not allow it to happen,” he insisted.
Rights attacked ‘deliberately’
In his final in-person address to the UN’s top rights body, Guterres said the worst conflict-hit areas were not the only places where rights were eroding.
“We are living in a world where mass suffering is excused away, where humans are used as bargaining chips, where international law is treated as a mere inconvenience.”
UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed the concerns.
In a “deeply worrying trend”, he warned that “domination and supre­macy are making a comeback”.
“A fierce competition for power, control and resources is playing out on the world stage at a rate and intensity unseen for the past 80 years,” he warned. “The use of force to resolve disputes between and within countries is becoming normalised.”
Turk highlighted how “the gears of global power are shifting”, calling for people to band together to protect rights and create “a strong counterbalance to the top-down, autocratic trends we see today”. Turk lambasted leaders, without naming them, who seem to believe “that they are above the law, and above the UN Charter”.
“They claim exceptional status, exc­eptional danger or exceptional moral judgement to pursue their own agenda at any cost,” he said, poi­nting to how “some weaponise their economic leverage”.

RAWALPINDI / GILGIT: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday warned that rising temperatures might accelerate glacier melt and increase the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in northern areas of the country.
According to the Met Office, rainfall and snowfall in northern Pakistan remained below normal during the winter season, consistent with the seasonal forecast issued by the PMD.
“Reduced precipitation and persistent clear-sky conditions have resulted in stable atmospheric patterns and significantly elevated temperatures across Gilgit-Baltistan during the first two decades (Feb 1-22) of February 2026,” it stated.
Daytime (maximum) temperatures were recorded 3-5°C above normal, while night-time (minimum) temperatures remained 1-3.5°C above the 1981-2010 climatological average.
The highest warming has been observed in Gilgit and Bunji, while Chilas and Bunji have shown notable increases in minimum temperatures, reducing overnight refreezing.

 

The sustained above-normal temperatures are accelerating snow and glacier melt, particularly at mid to lower altitudes. Reduced night-time cooling further enhances meltwater runoff into glacial lakes. Rapid melting increases water accumulation in both moraine- and glacier-dammed lakes, raising the likelihood of Glof events in downstream valleys.
Feb-April outlook
The PMD’s outlook for Febr­uary-April 2026 indicates a high probability of above-normal temperatures over northern Pakistan, including GB and Kashmir. If this warming trend persists, the risk of accelerated glacier melt and potential GLOF occurrences may increase in vulnerable areas such as Gilgit, Ghizar, Hunza, Bunji, Chilas and Astore.
The department said it would continue to closely monitor temperature trends, glacier melt conditions and hydrometeorological parameters, and issue timely advisories to relevant authorities and communities.
From Feb 1 to 22, the PMD stated that the average temperature in Astore was recorded at 4.3°C, with a minimum of 1.3°C; Bunji at 4.5°C, with a minimum of 2.6°C; Chilas at 4.1°C, with a minimum of 3.4°C; Gilgit at 4.7°C, with a minimum of 2°C; Gupis at 3.1°C, with a minimum of 1.6°C; and Skardu at 3.1°C, with a minimum of 1.8°C.
‘Changing pattern’
Experts in Gilgit-Baltistan said that over the past three years, snowfall in the region had started later, with many areas receiving less snow and temperatures remaining higher than usual. Snowfall was received in late January this year, raising concerns about flooding in the summer.
According to Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain, the region’s fragile ecosystem is being disturbed by climate change and environmental degradation. He said snowfall had increasingly shifted to mid-January and February, reducing the chances of snow compacting and turning into ice on mountains and glaciers.
“Late snowfall does not compact and can melt rapidly when the summer season starts, which increases the risk of floods downstream,” he said.
Rapidly melting glaciers, Glofs and cloudburst incidents severely affected residents of GB last summer. Experts said residents of the region, particularly those living downstream of rivers and glacial lakes, faced serious threats this summer.
Locals said snowfall usually began in late November. They added that temperatures remained unusually high until the end of December.
According to the GBEPA, the average temperature in GB rose by about 0.6°C between 1987 and 2013. The region has faced a rise in flash floods, accelerated glacial melt and other climate-linked hazards in recent years.

Saifullah Abro chaired the meeting of the Sub-Committee of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior and Narcotics Control to examine the theft case. The committee expressed strong displeasure at the FBR chairman’s absence and emphasised that his presence at the next meeting is mandatory to ensure the timely conclusion of this matter of significant public importance.
The committee was informed that the confiscated consignment was seized in 2024 and that three officials — a chowkidar, a Naib Qasid, and a driver — were dismissed on the recommendations of an internal inquiry committee.
However, serious concerns were raised regarding anomalies in the inquiry report. The convener questioned the rationale for dismissing lower-grade officials, given that reports from the police and FIA indicated that the godowns’ seals, ceilings, and locks were found intact. He further questioned whether such officials could have executed the theft with such precision.
The committee also expressed concern that the exact date of the theft remains unknown. It was observed that responsibility appeared to be limited to lower-tier staff while officers in higher grades remained unaccountable.
Members showed dissatisfaction over the submission of incomplete working papers. The FIA investigation team informed the Committee that, despite repeated requests, CCTV footage, stock registers, and the internal inquiry report had not been provided. The committee expressed serious concern about the failure to provide critical case records to the FIA.
The committee also questioned the decision to shift the confiscated consignment from a CCTV-monitored godown to another facility lacking surveillance cameras.
The convenor directed FBR to provide complete documentation, including the authority responsible for ordering the transfer and the proceedings of the internal inquiry committee.
While the committee was apprised that FBR has strengthened its security mechanisms and devised comprehensive SOPs, members highlighted recent theft incidents and sought detailed records of similar cases from 2012 onwards.

ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Monday issued a detailed 116-page judgement on the removal of one of its judges, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, declaring that his appointment to the bench was “without lawful authority” as he did not possess a valid law degree.
An IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muha­mmad Azam Khan held that ex-Justice Jahangiri’s foundational law degree was void ab initio, rendering his elevation to the high court a “legal nullity”.
The judgement relied heavily on original academic records produced by the University of Karachi (KU) registrar, concluding that the respondent’s academic credentials were tainted by fraud, impersonation and a deliberate attempt to circumvent a disciplinary ban.
According to the verdict, Mr Jahangiri first appe­ared in his LL.B. Part-I examination in 1988 under a fake enrolment number. He was later caught using un­f­air means and was debarred for three years thro­u­gh a university disqualification circular issued in 1989.
Instead of complying with the ban, the court held, he “chose a course of deliberate misrepresentation” and reappeared in the 1990 examinations under a different identity — “Tariq Jahangiri” — using an enrolment number originally issued to another student, Imtiaz Ahmad. He later appeared in the LL.B. Part-II examinations under his actual name but with yet another enrolment number.
Quoting the KU Controller of Examinations, the bench observed that a university issues only one enrolment number per programme and that it was “impossible” for a student to be allotted two numbers for the same degree. Consequently, the mark sheets and degree were declared invalid.
The principal of Government Islamia Law College also informed the court that Mr Jahangiri “was never admitted” to the institution — a claim the bench described as particularly damaging. Invoking the settled principle that what is void from the outset cannot be validated by subsequent administrative acts, the court declared the judge’s LL.B. degree a nullity in the eyes of law.
A key aspect of the judgement was the court’s criticism of Mr Jahangiri’s conduct during proceedings. Despite being granted repeated opportunities to submit a written reply and produce original documents, he failed to do so.
Instead, he filed applications seeking the constitution of a full court, recusal of the chief justice and adjournment sine die on the ground that related proceedings were pending before the Sindh High Court.
The bench termed these moves “dilatory tactics” and held that once prima facie documentary evidence had been produced by the petitioner, the burden shifted to the respondent to establish his lawful qualification. His failure to produce primary evidence, the court ruled, warranted an adverse inference.
Mr Jahangiri’s plea seeking recusal of Justice Dogar — on the basis that he had earlier challenged the chief justice’s transfer — was rejected.
The bench held that mere apprehension of bias was insufficient and reiterated that the constitution of benches was the sole prerogative of the chief justice.

 

It further described the attempt to exclude certain judges while implicitly favouring others as a “classic textbook manifestation of mala fide and bench-hunting”.
Addressing the question of maintainability, the IHC relied on a precedent of the Supreme Court in Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan, holding that the constitutional bar under Article 199(5) applies to judicial acts of a judge, not to questions relating to personal qualifications.
The bench clarified that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under Article 209 pertains to misconduct or incapacity during tenure and does not extend to determining whether an appointment itself was void from inception. “The SJC cannot cure a void appointment,” the court observed.
The appeal
The plea challenging ex-judge Jahangiri’s degree had been filed by lawyer Mian Dawood and was declared maintainable by the same division bench on Dec 9, 2025. Mr Jahangiri has already challenged both the maintainability order and subsequent proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
In his appeal, the former judge had contended that the IHC’s order declaring the petition maintainable, a Sept 16 order restraining him from performing judicial work, and what he termed the “unnecessary haste” of the division bench reflected bias, particularly on the part of the chief justice.
The appeal had stated that when the case was heard on Dec 2, 2025 and adjourned till Dec 9, no notice had been issued to him.
However, the Dec 2 ruling recorded the presence of two advocates as his counsel.
Mr Jahangiri had argued that the maintainability question — framed as one relating to “eligibility” rather than “conduct” — had been decided without issuing notice to him, thereby violating his fundamental right to due process and fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution.
He had contended that KU’s declaration cancelling his degree on Sept 25 had been suspended through an Oct 3, 2025 order of the Sindh High Court — a fact he alleged was not properly disclosed before the IHC.
Terming the IHC order unconstitutional and unlawful, the appeal had maintained that disputed factual questions regarding the validity of a degree could not be decided in constitutional jurisdiction and instead required a full-fledged trial involving recording of evidence before a competent court.

• Senate opposition leader asks govt not to complicate PTI chief’s health matters; says Imran not looking for deal
• Upper house approves criminal procedure code tweaks to prevent police from holding suspects incommunicado
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation.
The offer was made by PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah in his Senate address, while responding to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock.
“We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the current ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks, even when the PTI was in power.
This is not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial.
Speaking in the upper house, Mr Sanaullah blamed the incarcerated PTI leader, Imran Khan, for the impasse, claiming that the former prime minister’s “stubbornness” was a major hurdle in talks. The PM’s adviser said the opposition wanted a dialogue with those who did not want to engage in talks with it. “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so,” he said, adding that the government was ready to move forward democratically.
He said that the government wanted the PTI to become part of parliament by rejoining its standing committees, adding that the opposition was reluctant to become part of the political process.
Referring to Raja Nasir Abbas, the PML-N senator said that the opposition leader was part of the committee which refused to talk to the government at the direction of the top leadership.
He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations occur between political parties, not through external forces.
To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers.
Imran’s health
In his speech, Rana Sanaullah also touched upon the PTI’s concerns about the health of its jailed founder.
The PML-N senator said that the matter was before the court and the government had implemented its directions regarding his treatment. He claimed that the government included an eye specialist in the medical board at the PTI’s request, who examined Mr Khan in Adiala jail.
Commenting on the cases against the PTI founder, he said the courts were the appropriate forum and could grant relief in accordance with the law.
He said entry to Parliament House was sealed during the opposition sit-in earlier this month for “security reasons”. He said that the opposition had given a call to its workers to reach the protest venue, which prompted the police to make security arrangements.
‘Peaceful sit-in’
Earlier, in his speech, Raja Nasir Abbas regretted that parliament was shut down to confine opposition lawmakers who had been staging a “peaceful” protest on the premises. “Is this not an insult to parliament,” he asked.
He said that their only demand was that the PTI founder be provided treatment in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. “The founding PTI chairman neither wanted to come out of jail nor did his family make such a demand,” he said, adding that they only sought a fair trial for him.
Urging the need to restore confidence, the opposition leader requested that the government not transform this issue into a full-blown crisis and instead resolve the matter.
He assured that the opposition would never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government on the dictation of any dictator, even though the legitimacy of the incumbent setup was questionable. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions.
The proceedings also witnessed an uproar by the PML-N lawmakers when PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz raised questions about the purchase of a luxury jet by the Punjab government, which cost about Rs10 billion.
CrPC amendment
The upper house also passed some key legislation, including a landmark bill seeking to prevent the police from keeping individuals in custody without informing their family members.
The Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill moved by PPP lawmaker Shahadat Awan sought to insert a new section, 59-A, to the Code of Criminal Procedure which read: “When a person is arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled to have a family member, friend or other person known to him (or likely to take an interest in his welfare) informed by the officer in charge of the police station about his arrest.” It read that a police officer not below the rank of the superintendent of police may authorise a delay only if he has reasonable grounds to believe that informing the named person will lead to interference.
As per the bill’s statement of objects and reasons, the new section aimed to stop the abuse of process by the police officials who, in many cases, keep the suspect in custody without a formal arrest. It also said that an amendment to Section 431 and the insertion of 431A aimed to provide legal heirs the right to contest a case on behalf of the deceased to remove any kind of stigma.
The house also passed a bill to include the Senate opposition leader in the National Security Council. This bill was moved by Shahadat Awan.

Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation late on Saturday night, targeting groups responsible for recent attacks in its territory.
The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur, and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians.
Mentioning these incidents, Chaudhry said they were “linked” to Afghanistan-based actors, adding that it was subsequently decided to give a “decisive response” to the neighbouring country.







“As a result, our Air Force carried out strikes in three Afghan provinces, Paktika, Nangarhar and Khost on February 21,” he said, adding that there were reports of  the deaths of over 100 militants who “controlled terrorist networks” in the operation.
He said the February 21 strikes were “precise” and “intelligence-based”.
The minister insisted that they only targeted terrorists’ hideouts and training camps. He dispelled what he described as “false propaganda of civilians, mosques and seminaries getting hit” during the strikes.
Chaudhry warned that if terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil continued, Pakistan reserved the right to carry out strikes in its defence.
“We are not supposed to just attend funerals. The civilian leadership and armed forces are resolute that this cannot be tolerated anymore,” he asserted.
He said, “Every drop of blood of our martyrs, be they from the security forces or civilians, will be avenged. Every corner of the country will be defended.”</p><small>2026-02-23 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23234330049a0ac.' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975228/uk-police-arrest-ex-envoy-peter-mandelson-in-epstein-case' target='_blank'><strong>UK police arrest ex-envoy Peter Mandelson in Epstein case</strong></a><br><p>London police on Monday arrested Britain’s former ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, amid allegations over his ties to disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.
“Officers have arrested a 72-year-old man on suspicion of misconduct in public office,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
Images on UK television appeared to show Mandelson being driven away from his north London home accompanied by a man and a woman, after police raided his properties earlier this month.
“He was arrested at an address in Camden on Monday, 23 February and has been taken to a London police station for interview,” the Met added.
The arrest comes days after ex-prince Andrew, King Charles III’s younger brother, was arrested in a misconduct in public office probe also related to the latest release of documents related to Epstein.
Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics, is being probed over allegations that he sent sensitive documents to the late US sex offender Epstein when he was a government minister, including during the 2008 financial crash.
The ex-politician was sacked by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as envoy to Washington last year when an earlier release of documents linked to Epstein showed the extent of their friendship.
The latest Epstein files released by the United States on January 30 have resulted in the high-profile UK investigations.
Starmer has apologised to Epstein’s victims and accused Mandelson of lying about the extent of his ties to the financier during the vetting process for his appointment to Washington.
But Mandelson’s appointment has unleashed a political storm with two of Starmer’s top aides resigning over the row.
The government is to release tens of thousands of emails, messages and documents on Mandelson’s vetting procedure, which could ramp up the pressure on the prime minister and other senior ministers.
Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this month.
Officers from the Met’s specialist crime team were also deployed earlier this month to search two of his addresses, one in the western English county of Wiltshire and the other in London, according to the police.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23210449dc30531.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975221/abandon-this-dangerous-fantasy-senate-echoes-with-ppps-displeasure-over-remarks-on-creating-karachi-province' target='_blank'><strong>‘Abandon this dangerous fantasy’: Senate echoes with PPP’s displeasure over remarks on creating Karachi province</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Monday echoed with the PPP’s displeasure over recent statements regarding the creation of a separate Karachi province, asserting that it was an inseparable part of Sindh.
The development comes two days after the Sindh Assembly passed a resolution terming Karachi an “inseparable” part of Sindh and opposed any move that suggested otherwise. Opposing the resolution in the Sindh Assembly, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) had also declared it unconstitutional.
On Monday, PPP’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, Sherry Rehman, denounced recent statements by certain federal ministers, ostensibly a reference to MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal and Khaliq Maqbool Siddique.
Rehman said that such reckless talk was not only unconstitutional but also a direct provocation to the unity of the federation.
“Let me be clear: the PPP is the custodian of Sindh’s unity and no one will be allowed to undermine it,” she said.
She said Sindh had always opened its arms to everyone, adding that the province’s resources had always been shared with the country since 1947.
“To hear suggestions about dividing Karachi or Sindh is deeply alarming. This is not just an attack on a province, it is an attack on Pakistan itself,” she remarked.
Rehman reminded the House that altering a province’s boundaries was a constitutional matter that required a two-thirds majority.
“Those floating these ideas should first read the Constitution. Constitutional divisions require democratic majorities, not press conferences,” she remarked.
Speaking about coalition partners, she said, “Our friends in MQM-P have always been part of the federal government. They have governed with every administration. May God grant them even more respect, but let no one confuse local political debates with a licence to redraw provincial maps.”
She also stated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had said that no one would be allowed to divide Pakistanis based on language or identity.
“This party has shed blood, borne lashes, and endured imprisonment to uphold that principle,” she said. She further warned that Sindh had historically faced backdoor conspiracies.
“Let me say it plainly: the majority in Sindh belongs to the PPP. If that bothers someone, what can we do? If they want a majority, then earn it the democratic way — face the people, earn their votes, and withstand the political struggle like PPP workers have always done,” she said.
“From Shaheed Benazir Bhutto to President Asif Ali Zardari, our leadership has spent years behind bars for democracy. We have always put Pakistan before politics,” she said.
“Anyone dreaming of dividing Sindh should abandon this dangerous fantasy. We know how to resist, we know how to oppose, and we will not tolerate any assault on Pakistan’s federal unity. This behaviour is unacceptable and will never be allowed to succeed,” she maintained.
PPP Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi said that his party had always served the people without going into politics, whether or not people of any area voted for it.
He pointed out that both MQM-P and Jamaat-i-Islami each had three leaders who served as Karachi mayor.
“What had these six mayors given to Karachi? Nothing,” he said. He then said that the PPP’s mayorship of Karachi had delivered better results than MQM-P’s.
He pointed out that an education conference was held at the Governor’s House, which was also attended by Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. However, nothing about education was discussed, he lamented.
Meanwhile, MQM-P Senator Khalida Ateeb opposed the resolution passed by the Sindh Assembly, terming it against the Constitution.
Speaking on the floor of the Senate, she said the proposal to divide Sindh into rural and urban areas was initiated by the PPP-led Sindh government. She also questioned who introduced the quota system.
She made it clear that the MQM-P never advocated for dividing Sindh but said there were calls for administrative units in all provinces across the country.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232257121f26f07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975227/food-delivery-rider-killed-after-speeding-car-overturns-crashes-into-his-motorcycle-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Food delivery rider killed after speeding car overturns, crashes into his motorcycle in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A food delivery rider lost his life after a speeding vehicle flipped over and crashed into his stationary motorcycle in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area, according to police.
The video of the incident that took place on Sunday was widely shared on social media.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) told Dawn that the food delivery rider was on his motorcycle outside a bungalow in DHA’s phase IV when a speeding car turned over and crashed into his vehicle.
“Both the rider and the car driver were injured in the incident,” he said, adding that they were initially taken to a private hospital in the Clifton area. The rider was later taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in critical condition and died during treatment, the official said.
Meanwhile, the car’s driver was at the private hospital in Clifton, and a police mobile was deployed outside the facility for the arrest of the car driver after treatment, DIG Raza said.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232252577e9f6a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975226/west-indies-thrash-zimbabwe-in-t20-world-cup-clash-after-piling-up-254-6' target='_blank'><strong>West Indies thrash Zimbabwe in T20 World Cup clash after piling up 254-6</strong></a><br><p>The West Indies blew away T20 World Cup surprise package Zimbabwe by a colossal 107 runs in Mumbai on Monday as Shai Hope’s team opened their Super Eights campaign with a dominant victory.
Shimron Hetmyer blasted 85 off 34 balls as the West Indies piled up 254-6, the second-highest total in the history of the tournament.
Zimbabwe, who stunned Australia and Sri Lanka to reach the Super Eights, got off to an awful start chasing a monumental 255.
They were reduced to 20-3 in the third over when two wickets fell to Akeal Hosein’s left-arm spin and never threatened to get close.
They were all out for 147 in 17.4 overs with Brad Evans hitting some lusty late blows before being last man out for 43 off 21 balls with five sixes.
Left-armer Gudakesh Motie was the pick of the West Indies bowlers with 4-28 as he found some sharp turn. Hosein took 3-28.
Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza won the toss and opted to bowl, then saw his bowlers flogged to all parts of the Wankhede stadium.
Only Sri Lanka, who made 260-6 against Kenya in 2007, have scored more in a T20 World Cup match.
Coming in at 17-1, the left-handed Hetmyer was given a life Zimbabwe would come to regret.
A routine catch at deep fine leg was spilled by Tashinga Musekiwa when the batsman was on nine.
Hetmyer took full advantage, racing to his fifty off 19 balls, equalling South Africa’s Aiden Markram for the fastest half-century of the tournament so far.
Hetmyer and Rovman Powell, who came in at 54-2, completed their century stand in 45 balls.
They had added 122 off 52 balls when Hetmyer became the third wicket to go down with 176 on the board in the 15th over.
Hetmyer, having been dropped for a second time on 70 by the hapless Musekiwa, this time was held in the deep by Brian Bennett having smashed seven sixes and seven fours.
Powell was out soon after for 59, off 35 balls, with four sixes.
Sherfane Rutherford took up the mantle and guided his side past 200 and then 250 as he scored 31 not out off 13 balls with two sixes.
Romario Shepherd joined in the fun by smacking 21, and Jason Holder took 13 off three balls as 38 runs were bludgeoned off the final two overs.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232226111d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975225/lets-sit-together-and-strengthen-charter-of-democracy-govt-invites-opposition-for-talks' target='_blank'><strong>‘Let’s sit together and strengthen Charter of Democracy’: Govt invites opposition for talks</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government invited the opposition on Monday to hold talks and “strengthen and take forward” the Charter of Democracy — a 2006 document signed by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and late Benazir Bhutto, with the commitment to struggle against dictatorship.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the Charter of Democracy”, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said while addressing a Senate session in response to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas.
Sanaullah said the government was willing to hold dialogue with the opposition, which would strengthen democracy, rather than opting for confrontation and deadlock.
“We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks even when the PTI was in power.
However, PTI founder Imran Khan was not ready to talk to politicians, he said, saying that his “stubbornness is a big hurdle” in the way of talks.
Without naming anyone but seemingly referring to the establishment, Sanaullah went on to say that the opposition wanted talks with those who did not want to talk to it.
He added that the government wanted the PTI to “become a part of Parliament by rejoining its standing committees”.
The PTI had resigned from the standing committees in September last year.
Sanaullah criticised the party on Monday for what he described as its “reluctance to become a part of the political process”.
Continuing his rebuke of the opposition, the PM’s adviser stated: “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so.” But, he added, the government was ready to move forward in a democratic manner.
He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations were held between political parties and not “through external forces”.
On Imran’s health, he said the matter was before the court, and the government had implemented court directives regarding the PTI founder’s treatment.
“On the PTI’s request, even an eye specialist was included in the medical board that examined Imran,” he highlighted.
The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
Speaking before Sanaullah, Opposition Leader Abbas criticised the authorities in connection with a recent days-long sit-in at the Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health.
He claimed that “Parliament was shut down to block the entry and exit of parliamentarians who were staging a peaceful protest”.
“Is this not an insult to Parliament?” he questioned.
Abbas said the protesters’ only demand was Imran’s medical treatment should be carried out in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family.
He neither wanted a release from jail, nor his family made any such demand, Abbas said, adding that the PTI founder only sought a fair trial for himself.
Calling for the need to restore confidence on both sides, he urged the government not to transform this issue into a “full-blown crisis” and move forward.
He also gave the assurance that the opposition would “never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government at the dictation of any dictator, despite the legitimacy of the [incumbent] government being questioned”. But, he stressed, the government should address and resolve the issue of Imran’s eye ailment and treatment.
He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions.
While Sanaullah was responding to Abbas’ allegation of “shutting down Parliament”, he said the opposition’s call to its workers to reach the protest venue prompted the police to “make security arrangements”.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23214345b45f9ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975223/israeli-minister-says-army-will-occupy-all-gaza-if-hamas-does-not-disarm' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli minister says army will occupy all Gaza if Hamas does not disarm</strong></a><br><p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday that Hamas may soon be given a deadline to lay down its weapons.
“We estimate that in the coming days, Hamas will be given an ultimatum to disarm and completely demilitarise Gaza,” Smotrich said in an interview with public broadcaster Kan.
Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in 2023, in retaliation for Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack.
Under the first phase of a US-sponsored ceasefire in Gaza intended to halt two years of Isreali onslaught in Gaza, the Israeli army withdrew to positions behind a so-called Yellow Line, but still controls over half of the territory.
Both Hamas and Israel accuse each other of near-daily ceasefire violations, with the health ministry in Gaza reporting 615 people killed by Israeli forces since the truce started.
The Israeli military says it has lost five of its soldiers during the same period.
If Hamas does not comply with the Israeli ultimatum to disarm, the army “will have international legitimacy and American backing to do it itself, and the IDF (military) is already preparing for this and is making plans”, said the minister, who is a member of Israel’s security cabinet charged with approving large-scale military operations.
The second ceasefire phase, which officially began last month, calls for a gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army and the disarmament of Hamas, which the militant group has vehemently opposed.
“The (Israeli military) will definitely enter and occupy Gaza if Hamas does not disarm,” Smotrich said.
Asked how the military would do this, he said, “There are two or three alternatives right now that we are examining”.
The peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump also calls for the establishment of a 20,000-strong peacekeeping force, called the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which several countries have committed troops.
Asked how the Israeli army would operate against Hamas when foreign soldiers were deployed on the ground, Smotrich said the latter would “pull out very quickly and allow the (Israeli military) to enter. This is coordinated with the Americans.”
“By the way, I don’t yet see them going in that fast,” he added of the ISF.
A security source in Gaza, meanwhile, said on Monday that Israeli forces shelled Beit Lahia in the north.
The source also said that Israeli tanks opened fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, where at least two air strikes were also conducted.
Israel’s military said Monday that Israeli troops “eliminated” a fighter who had crossed the Yellow Line into Israeli-held territory the previous day.</p><small>2026-02-23 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232214472c3d079.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975190/pm-shehbaz-lands-in-qatar-on-2-day-official-visit-to-explore-new-avenues-of-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lands in Qatar on 2-day official visit to explore new avenues of cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reached Qatar on Monday night on a two-day official visit, state-run PTV News reported.







He was received by Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer and other diplomatic staff at King Hammad International Airport, a post by PTV News on social media platform X said.
The premier is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and his aide, Tariq Fatemi, according to the post.
Earlier, the Foreign Office (FO) said the premier would meet the Qatari emir during the visit.
The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the FO said in a press release.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will hold a bilateral meeting with Sheikh Tamim, “covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership, and people-to-people exchanges”, the FO added.
“The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export.”
The FO highlighted that both countries shared a “longstanding partnership characterised by mutual trust and close coordination at regional and international forums”.







“The visit will also provide an opportunity for both leaderships to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest, reaffirming their resolve to work closely for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” the statement added.
“The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between the two countries and underscores their shared commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation,” the FO noted.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
PM Shehbaz undertook two visits to Doha in September 2025 — one to express solidarity after Israeli attacks on the country and a second to attend a joint summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
He had held meetings with the Qatari emir on both occasions, reaffirmed Pakistan’s “all-out support and solidarity” for the Gulf state.</p><small>2026-02-23 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2320093981ff743.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975219/trump-renews-attack-on-us-supreme-court-vows-other-tariffs-and-licences' target='_blank'><strong>Trump renews attack on US Supreme Court, vows other tariffs and licences</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump renewed his condemnation of the Supreme Court on Monday after it ruled against his sweeping tariff programme last week, vowing to turn to other tariff powers and licences but giving no details.
“The court has also approved all other Tariffs, of which there are many, and they can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used,” he wrote in a social media post.







Trump said on Saturday he would raise a temporary tariff from 10 per cent to 15 pc on US imports from all countries, the maximum level allowed under the law, a day after the court ruled that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority when he imposed an array of higher tariff rates under an economic emergency law.
In his post on Monday, Trump also pointed to the potential use of licences to pressure countries, writing that “incomprehensibly, according to the ruling, (I) can’t charge them a Licence fee — BUT ALL LICENCES CHARGE FEES, why can’t the United States do so? You do a licence to get a fee! The opinion doesn’t explain that, but I know the answer!”







Wall Street futures and the dollar dropped early on Monday amid confusion over the US trade policy, while oil prices initially fell over uncertainty for global growth and fuel demand over the latest tariff hike before being steadied by news of planned US-Iran talks.
The decision and Trump’s subsequent actions are already impacting his trade deals struck over the past year, with China urging Washington to scrap tariff measures, the European Union set to freeze its agreement and India delaying planned talks.
Trump used his social media post to again lash out against the justices who ruled against him, which included two whom he had appointed during his first term in the White House.
In its ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, the court reasserted its power to check the power of the president.
The president also expressed concern that the top court could rule against his administration’s bid to restrict birthright citizenship in its forthcoming decision in that case.</p><small>2026-02-23 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2319353519a4146.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975150/security-forces-kill-9-terrorists-during-intelligence-based-operations-in-balochistan-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 9 terrorists during intelligence-based operations in Balochistan, KP</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to statements issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
According to the military’s media affairs wing, an IBO in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan was conducted on Monday, on the “reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban.
The ISPR said that security personnel “effectively engaged the khawarij location” during the operation, and after an intense exchange of fire, four terrorists were killed.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from “Indian-sponsored killed khawarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Earlier in the day, ISPR shared the details of the IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin in a separate statement.
It said security forces had killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during that IBO on Sunday.
The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and sent to hell.”
Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists during the Pishin IBO as well, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Both statements by ISPR stated: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.“
Separately, the spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO in Pishin and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement.
He said that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Pishin, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”.
He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism.







Last week, on February 18, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD.
A day later, ISPR said security forces had also killed four “Indian-sponsored” terrorists in an IBO in KP’s Lakki Marwat district.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
