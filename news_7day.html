• 95 bank accounts identified; parleys continue over fate of seminaries administered by the group
LAHORE: Authorities in Punjab claim to have traced the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the Muridke crackdown.
A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
The official said following the crackdown, several teams comprising senior officers from Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies had been tasked with tracking down the TLP chief and his brother.
He said Saad Rizvi and his brother were first spotted walking away from the protest camp in Muridke, and then fleeing on a motorbike.
At that time, an emergency message was circulated among the LEAs that a motorcycle rider carrying the TLP chief and his brother had moved towards nearby streets.
The three suspects, however, managed to dodge law enforcement personnel, any many rumours started to surface on social media regarding possible injury to them.
The officer said the special teams eventually traced the last location of the TLP leaders somewhere in AJK and sought the regional government’s help for their arrest.
It may be recalled that the Punjab government has formally sought the proscription of TLP and has sent a summary in this regard to the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Federal Inves­tigation Agency also traced nearly 95 bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi, the official said.
Of them, 15 were interest-bearing accounts, and the FIA was trying to get more details from the relevant banks to check the transactions made by the TLP chief, he added.
TLP seminaries
As a part of a wider crackdown on the radical outfit, the Punjab government also identified 61 seminaries run by the TLP across the province. The issue of these seminaries also came up during a meeting of Sunni clerics with the provincial authorities, as both sides discussed proposals about the fate of these institutions.
During the meeting, two proposals came under discussion to decide the future of these seminaries. It was suggested in the meeting that these seminaries be given under the administrative control of the Punjab Auqaf Department — this suggestion, however, was opposed by the majority of the participants who feared such a move would aggravate the situation. They said this action may create controversies in the future, particularly due to the huge financial expenses.
The second proposal pertained to handing over these seminaries to the moderate Sunni clerics – a move deemed workable. However, the authorities said in such a case, the clerics would run the TLP seminaries without the element of ‘militancy’. But a final decision on the fate of these seminaries is yet to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Multan district administration sealed 10 TLP seminaries and handed several over to the Auqaf department in line with the Punjab government’s orders. These seminaries were located in Multan, Shujabad, and Basti Malook.

• Urges overhaul of slow, debt-heavy climate finance system
ROME: Climate finance is being held back by bureaucracy rather than a lack of funds, Adviser to the Prime Minister Dr Syed Tauqir Shah told a global forum last week, stressing that frontline countries like Pakistan have been left struggling to access vital support.
Addressing the FAO’s Rome Water Dialogue, where he presented Pakistan’s national statement to an audience of leaders, ministers and civil society representatives, Dr Shah said, “Water crises are no longer an abstract policy discussion but an existential challenge for many countries in the Global South.”
 






He said Pakistan is among the wor­ld’s most climate-vulnerable nations and has now crossed the threshold into official water scarcity, with national food security threatened by extreme weather and chronic resource stress.
The crisis, he noted, manifests both as “devastating abundance” — the 2022 floods that affected over 33 million people, destroyed four million acres of crops and left 10 million without safe drinking water, with this year’s floods “equally catastrophic” — and as crippling scarcity, with total storage limited to about 30 days’ supply.
“Our need is clear and urgent: we require massive, timely investments in climate-resilient water infrastructure. This must be a mix of traditional, high-storage solutions alongside nature-based solutions like restoring floodplains, developing resilient irrigation techniques, and implementing watershed management,” he added.
Calling out the global climate finance institutions, Dr Tauqir said Pakistan requires an estimated $7-14 billion annually for adaptation efforts alone by 2030. “Yet, we are met with a global finance architecture that has turned the required investment into a paradox,” he said.
 
 

While building a case for reform of glo­bal climate finance institutions, he opined that the current global climate fund mechanism is characterised by critical failings that directly hamper our ability to invest and innovate in water resilience.
He said that despite the staggering national need, Pakistan has been unable to fully utilise available global climate funds because international criteria often demand highly specific, technically complex and “bankable” project proposals, requiring a level of institutional capacity that takes years to build.
He further highlighted that even once approved, funds are subject to slow disbursement rates and multi-year legal processes.
Criticising the climate finance modalities, Dr Shah said, “We find that the maximum available climate finance takes the form of debt and concessional loans, with only a small fraction available as grants.”
He lamented that debt is being loaded onto vulnerable economies that are already struggling with macroeconomic stability.
Citing the Green Climate Fund, he said the average time from concept to board approval is 24 months or more, and stressed that the first disbursement typically takes months after approval.
He referred to the GCF Independent Evaluation Unit’s finding that internal processes are “complex, fragmented and marked by bottlenecks”.
He said major climate funds are criticised by development experts for sluggish processing, excessive bureaucracy and disbursement delays.
“We call upon our global partners to shift the paradigm from an architecture of complexity and debt to one of speed and trust,” Dr Tauqir Shah said. “We need a financial innovation component which focuses on leveraging blended finance, green bonds, insurance mechanisms and incubation programmes to de-risk private investment and increase access to finance for smallholder farmers.”
While flagging the 2030 global development agenda, Dr Shah said, “The Sus­tainable Development Goals, especially SDG 6 (clean water) and SDG 2 (zero hunger), will remain beyond reach unless we confront this challenge head-on.”

Party officials said Pun­jab Chief Minister Mar­yam Nawaz also joined the meeting, where subjects such as the ongoing talks with Afgha­nistan, a crackdown against the TLP, as well as the forthcoming local government polls in Punjab also came under discussion.
According to reports, PM Shehbaz briefed his elder brother on the ongoing talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
During the meeting, Nawaz Sharif reaffirmed that “no one will be allowed to look at Pakistan with malicious intent”, adding that “Pakistan is our red line, and the sons of this nation are defending their motherland without regard for their own lives”.
Views were also excha­nged on the party’s strategy to ensure the victory of its candidates in the local government polls, following the Ele­ction Com­m­ission of Pak­istan’s decision to hold the long-delayed elections in December.
They said that as the first phase of the electoral exercise in which 9-member panels will be elected in each union council, will be party-less giving the winning candidates 30 days to join a political party of their preference, the meeting discussed holding the second phase of the polls in selected districts first where the PML-N has a strong following.
It was decided to take other party leaders onboard for selecting districts for the second phase of polls.
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met with Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the minister briefed the premier on the law and order situation in the country, as well as ongoing development projects in Islamabad.
Published in Dawn, October 20th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-20 02:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f554fd17590.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950014/tax-less-for-capital-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Tax less for capital growth</strong></a><br><p>It is all a fiscal problem. Effective tax rates have reached a point where there is no economic incentive to invest in the economy, in the absence of which, economic growth will remain a distant dream. Total consumption as a percentage of GDP was almost 100 per cent in 2024-25; the highest ever.
Any growth to be driven by consumption will be short-lived. Any sustainable growth requires massive investment in the economy’s production capacity, and that remains constrained by one of the highest effective tax rates in the world, both at a corporate and at an individual level.
 
 

The country needs an overarching and coherent industrial policy that brings together a stimulating tax policy, a marginal-price-driven power policy, and a savings regime that incentivises formal savings that can provide capital to drive investments in the economy.
Taxes paid by salaried individuals amounted to Rs545 billion in FY25 — 66.7pc of which is estimated to have been contributed by roughly 129,000 individuals that belonged to the top slab.

An investment in lieu of taxes programme through a five percentage point reduction in corporate and salary taxes could create investment stimulus, generating Rs800bn in productive capital stock

These are estimates, interpolated from public data; the availability of public data on slabs can further refine this calculation. The distribution of our distorted slab structure is such that 10.8pc of total income tax payers were in the top slab. Effectively, the sovereign takes away an average of 28.6pc of top slab taxpayers’ taxable income, largely to fund a perpetual deficit.
That capital can potentially be better utilised through channelising it to private savings, and investments through directed policy interventions, rather than stimulating consumption.
It is also estimated that taxes paid by corporations amounted to Rs2.5 trillion, with only a small 0.5pc of corporates contributing 81pc of total corporate taxes paid. These are large corporations that can effectively reallocate capital, and drive investment growth — but a distorted tax regime penalises any such ventures.
A policy structure where a reduction in corporate tax rates can generate surplus after-tax income that can be channelised to investment in the economy can stimulate the investment component of the GDP, rejigging the economy from consumption to growth.
A five percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate of corporations and individuals can unlock Rs453bn in after-tax income (approximately Rs293bn from corporates, and approximately Rs160bn from salaried individuals), that — instead of being allocated to service perpetual deficits — can be used to stimulate private investment in the economy.
An ‘investment in lieu of taxes’ programme can be initiated, where a certain proportion of tax savings can be reallocated to investments that enhance overall productive capacity. It is critical that the same is ring-fenced to prioritising high-impact investments, rather than accumulation of land and real estate that has an abysmal impact multiplier.
 
 

A sunset clause can be put into place, such that corporations are incentivised to accelerate investment in the economy, wherein any income generated from fresh investment can be taxed at a marginally lower tax rate, but results in an overall expanded tax base.
Similarly, surplus income available with individuals can be incentivised to be redirected towards savings in the directed capital market or banking instruments, which complements the overall industrial policy.
An industrial policy cannot be created in isolation, without taking into consideration the dynamics of income and capital. Incentives that enhance the participation of individuals in capital markets, or financial institutions, to fund incremental capacity will be able to redirect income away from consumption and towards investments.
Assuming 70pc of the hypothetical Rs453bn in after-tax income can be invested, it could also unlock private sector credit, which can be linked to reduced tax rates for the banking sector. Assuming a 60-40 debt-equity ratio for fresh investment, capital allocation of almost Rs800bn can be unlocked for investment in the economy.
Policy levers that link the allocation of capital investment for all participants in the economy need to be at the core of any coherent industrial policy.
However, a reduction in tax collection by Rs453bn would create a gap in the fiscal space, and considering the National Finance Commission conundrum — provinces carving out their share right at the revenue level — the quantum of such a carve-out needs to change for any investment growth to happen.
It has been demonstrated by economic performance in the last few years that the economy simply cannot grow sustainably with a distorted fiscal regime. The question that needs to be asked is whether the Rs453bn redeployed in investments could be used effectively by provinces to generate economic growth?
In the absence of economic growth, the population is suffering, irrespective of a federal or provincial jurisdiction. A pivot to investment-oriented growth will enhance economic activity across all provinces, which simply cannot be done by expanding government expenditure. Instead of giving market-distorting subsidies, there is a need to let the market find the equilibrium.
The surplus after-tax income can be financed by provinces either through increases in provincial tax income or through reducing expenditure by an equivalent amount. With a population that exceeds 250 million, the country needs more investment-oriented growth, more export-oriented investments, higher productivity, and higher-quality jobs. That simply cannot be provided by a debt-fueled government expenditure machinery.

• Remarks come as credit agencies, banks seek clarity on country’s security outlook
WASHINGTON: Cur­bing militancy is essential for financial stability, Fin­ance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said as he wrapped up a week-long visit to Washington.
Officials accompanying the minister to the World Bank and IMF annual meetings said the security-economy link surfaced repeatedly in many of the delegation’s 65 meetings during the seven-day visit.
“From credit rating agencies to commercial banks, everyone wanted to understand whether Pakistan’s security environment is now aligned with its economic recovery,” one official said.
In a media briefing, Mr Aurangzeb acknowledged that sustained stability and investor confidence depend on internal peace and political cohesion. “From a financial angle, this action is necessary,” he said, a rare admission that the country’s economic prospects are inseparable from its ability to curb extremism.
His remarks came at a time when Pakistan’s strategic significance is being increasingly recognised in world capitals. Under US President Donald Trump’s second term, Islamabad has regained Washington’s attention after years of estrangement.
 
 

Mr Trump’s unconventional approach has brought former adversaries into dialogue, and Pakistan has leveraged this moment adroitly.
Earlier this week, Mr Aurangzeb held an exclusive meeting with US Congressman French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee — the first time a Pakistani finance minister met the head of this key congressional panel.
Mr Aurangzeb used the meeting to stress the importance of enhancing economic ties between Pakistan and the US.
 






As the finance minister emphasised the link between geopolitics and economics, Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz told CNN that Pakistan’s ability to defend itself against a much larger adversary has impressed the US leader.
“Trump likes winners,” he said, noting that the US president sees the Pakistan army chief as “a winner who is willing to make quick decisions”.
That rapport, and the growing security cooperation — from rare earth exports to US arms sales — form a new strategic backdrop for Mr Aurangzeb’s economic diplomacy.
 
 

Michael Kugelman of the Asia Pacific Foundation added, “The current global moment does benefit Pakistan due to its geographic proximity to the Gulf and its close partnerships with key stakeholders there.”
Analysts say Washington’s renewed interest in Pakistan is shaped by both geopolitical convenience and economic opportunity.
Fiscal credibility
Against this evolving backdrop, Mr Aurangzeb’s Washington visit served to consolidate a narrative of fiscal stability and policy credibility. Pakistan’s credit ratings have improved, with Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global all upgrading their outlooks. The IMF’s recent staff-level agreement for a $1.2 billion disbursement further signalled institutional confidence in the country’s reform trajectory.
The IMF’s World Economic Outlook projected 3.6 per cent growth for FY2025, though it noted that the economic impact of this summer’s floods is still being assessed.
Still, global investors are beginning to return. Institutional funds, banks and advisory firms that had long viewed Pakistan as high-risk are reopening conversations — a shift attributed by senior officials to consistent fiscal signalling and a more stable security environment.
Privatisation
Mr Aurangzeb’s meetings with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) and JP Morgan reflected a focus on diversification and modernisation of Pakistan’s financing instruments. He briefed ADCB executives on the launch of the Panda Bond and the refreshing of the Global Medium-Term Note (GMTN) programme.
At a news briefing, the minister expressed optimism about the accelerated privatisation of the national carrier and disclosed that the government was close to achieving financial close on the Reko Diq project. He urged ADCB to expand its participation in Pakistan’s financial markets and trade flows.
At JP Morgan, Mr Aurangzeb discussed the forthcoming Green Panda Bond in China and the federal cabinet’s approval of the government-to-government sale of First Women Bank to a UAE conglomerate.
He also emphasised emerging digital cooperation with Saudi Arabia through the GO AI Hub and growing US interest in the Reko Diq mining venture.

Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti condemned the incident in a statement and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects.
“All resources will be used to provide justice to the affected family,” the CM said, according to a statement issued by his office.
According to the statement, the CM had sought a report from police regarding the incident.
Dawn.com has reached out to the police for further details.
Meanwhile, the NP also strongly condemned the incident in a statement, adding that the party would observe three days of mourning. It added that at the time of the incident, Waleed was celebrating his wedding.
It said that the incident was not only “the murder of an ordinary citizen but also the murder of a person belonging to a dignified and political family who has always believed in peace, non-violence, patience and tolerance and political values ​​and traditions”.
“The government has completely failed to protect the lives and property of citizens, and such incidents clearly indicate this failure,” the statement added, further calling the murder “a deep shock for the […] people and political classes of entire Balochistan”.
“Such violent incidents are conspiracies of anti-peace elements who are enemies of peace, development and political stability in Balochistan,” the NP said.
PPP leader Haji Ali Madad Jattak and adviser to the CM Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and alarming incident” that threatened the peace of the entire province.
Today’s incident comes around two months after another brother of Rehmat Saleh Baloch was injured in an attack at the Quetta-Karachi National Highway near Mastung. He was travelling along with the Panjgur deputy commissioner, who was killed in the attack.</p><small>2025-10-19 20:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1904552284939c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949845/pakistan-afghanistan-agree-to-immediate-ceasefire-after-doha-talks-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to immediate ceasefire after Doha talks: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following high-level negotiations in Doha, where both countries pledged to respect each other’s sovereignty and are expected to meet again on October 25 to further discuss matters, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Sunday.
Amid heightened tensions along the Pak-Afghan border, a high-level Pakistani delegation led by Asif travelled to Doha on Saturday for talks with Afghan Taliban officials, aimed at ending cross-border hostilities and addressing Pakistan’s security concerns.  Facilitated by Qatar, the talks followed days of clashes and Pakistani strikes on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, after a 48-hour ceasefire was extended to allow negotiations.
In a post on X, the minister announced, “A ceasefire agreement has been finalised. The terrorist attacks from Afghanistan on Pakistan’s soil will cease immediately. Both neighbouring countries will respect each other’s territory,” adding that delegations will meet again in Istanbul on October 25 to discuss matters in detail.
“We are sincerely grateful to both brotherly countries, Qatar and Turkiye,” the minister said.
 






Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar welcomed the announcement, calling it a “step in the right direction.”
Taking to X, FM Dar said, “[I] welcome the agreement finalised late last night in Doha. It is the first step in the right direction.”
 






“Deeply appreciate the constructive role played by brotherly Qatar and Turkiye,’ he added.
Dar expressed hope for the establishment of a “concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism” to tackle terrorism “emanating from Afghan soil” in the upcoming Istanbul meeting.
He stressed that “it is important to put all efforts in place to prevent any further loss of lives.”
Separately, the spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Zabiullah Mujahid, in a statement issued on Sunday, said: “Negotiations between representatives of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, held in Qatar, have concluded with the signing of a bilateral agreement.”
 






“Under the terms of the agreement, both sides reaffirm their commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the maintenance of strong and constructive [neighbourly] relations,” the statement added.
As per the statement, both countries mutually agreed that “neither country will undertake any hostile actions against the other, nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan.”
“Both sides will refrain from targeting each other’s security forces, civilians, or critical infrastructure,” it added.
Underscoring commitment towards diplomacy, the statement said: “Both sides are committed to resolving issues and disputes through dialogue”, detailing that “a comprehensive and meaningful ceasefire has been mutually agreed upon.”
“In the future, a mechanism will be established, under the mediation of intermediary countries, to review bilateral claims and ensure the effective implementation of this agreement,” it said.
The spokesperson also extended appreciation to Qatar and Turkiye for their role in facilitating the agreement.
In a subsequent post, he referred to the phrase “nor will they support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan” in his earlier statement. Mujahid clarified that it had been the the permanent position of  the Islamic Emirate that “it does not allow the use of Afghan territory against any other country”.
“It (The Islamic Emirate) does not support any attack against anyone and has always emphasised this stance,” he added.
 






Earlier, a post on the X account of PTV News, citing the Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had also confirmed the development.
 






“During the talks, both countries not only agreed on an immediate ceasefire but also decided to establish a permanent mechanism for bilateral peace and stability,” the post said.
The post further noted that both countries will hold follow-up meetings in the coming days to ensure the implementation and sustained continuity of the ceasefire.
“These measures will prove beneficial in promoting security and stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan,” it said.
According to the post, the negotiations, hosted by the State of Qatar with Turkiye acting as mediator, continued for 13 hours.
 


For its part, Qatar also uploaded a statement on X announcing the ceasefire. In the statement by the foreign ministry, Qatar expressed the hope that “this important step will contribute to ending tensions on the border between the two brotherly countries and form a solid foundation for sustainable peace in the region”.
However, the statement on the development on the foreign ministry’s website omitted the word “border” from this sentence.
 


Pakistan’s Foreign Office did not immediately comment on the difference in the statements.
Meanwhile, many saw the omission of the word border from the statement as a diplomatic victory for the Afghan Taliban, who have long refused to recognise the Durand Line as the legitimate border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
On Saturday, as talks were underway between the two sides, Pakistan had reiterated that it did not seek escalation. However, it urged the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities, a statement from the FO had said.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,“ it had added.
Cross-border escalation
On the night of October 11, Afghan forces launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, sparking a series of clashes that left 23 Pakistani soldiers martyred and over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants dead, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The Pakistan military responded with precision strikes inside Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul, targeting militant camps and border positions, while urging Kabul to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Clashes broke out again on Tuesday (Oct.14), with the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij exchanging fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO on Wednesday announced that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was extended, according to a senior diplomatic source.
Additionally, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
Deteriorating ties
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have remained strained since 2023, with Pakistan repeatedly raising concerns over the use of Afghan soil by militants carrying out cross-border attacks. The security situation has deteriorated further in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan following the outlawed TTP’s decision to end its ceasefire with Islamabad in November 2022.
While the two sides have attempted to hold dialogue from time to time, tensions have persisted. Kabul, while insisting that it does not permit its territory to be used against any country, continues to face criticism from Islamabad as TTP-led assaults continue in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-19 20:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/192357021ff4bb5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949966/police-say-terror-attack-foiled-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>Police say terror attack foiled in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>Law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, police said.
Police said in a statement that terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)  — tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance.
However, it added, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement using the “latest technology”. As a result, the statement said, the terrorists couldn’t come near the police station and fled.
According to police, “residents from nearby areas also fired at the attackers” and helped law enforcers.
The statement did not mention any loss of lives or property in the incident, which was earlier confirmed by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan. He told Dawn.com that the attackers had used a hand grenade to target the police station.
“Unidentified attackers threw a hand grenade toward the police station, but it fell at a distance, causing no damage,” he said.
The RPO added that the attackers fled after the attempt and a search operation to hunt them was under way.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Friday night, police intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.
On Saturday, unkn­own assailants launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan’s
According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the FC personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.</p><small>2025-10-19 19:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19213757b1d63ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949961/govt-approves-2025-26-wheat-policy-says-there-will-be-no-restriction-on-inter-provincial-movement-of-the-crop' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves 2025-26 wheat policy, says there will be no restriction on inter-provincial movement of the crop</strong></a><br><p>The government has approved the wheat policy for 2025-26, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Sunday, adding there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to ensure its availability across the country.
The development comes against the backdrop of the Punjab government tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a restrictive permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid soaring prices and wheat shortage there.
According to the PMO statement, a high-level meeting was held yesterday (Saturday) to discuss the 2025-26 wheat policy. It was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The statement said a representative of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM was also present at the meeting while the Azad Jammu and Kashmir PM and relevant stakeholders also attended the meeting.
It quoted PM Shehbaz as saying that Pakistan was an agricultural economy, for which wheat was of key importance.
“Wheat is not just a staple food item for the people of Pakistan but also the biggest source of earning for the farmers of the country,” he said, adding that the government was well aware of the difficulties of the farmers.
He assured that the all possible efforts were being made for the welfare of the farmers, the PMO statement said, further stating that the premier termed farmers the “backbone of the economy”.
PM Shehbaz told the participants of the meeting that the the government had consulted all stakeholders, including provincial governments, farmers’ associations and industrialists, over the wheat policy.
“We appreciate the cooperation of the provinces for this policy based on consensus,” PM Shehbaz stated.
He said the policy was aimed at safeguarding people’s interests while ensuring profits for farmers and hoped that it would contribute to progress in the agriculture sector.
The PM asserted that the policy would result in an increase farmers’ incomes and play an important role in in ensuring food security in the country.
According to the PMO statement, the meeting was told under the new policy, the federal and provincial governments would be able to acquire “strategic reserves of about 6.2 million tonnes” from wheat harvest in 2025-26.
It added that wheat would be procured at Rs3,500 per maund (40 kilogrammes), in accordance with the international import price.
“This measure will ensure market competitiveness along with fair prices and profits for farmers,” the PMO statement said, citing the briefing given to the meeting.
It further stated that the national food security would head committee, which would oversee the policy’s implementation. It would include representatives from all provinces and and meet every week, the statement said, adding that it would directly report to the prime minister.
According to the statement, the meeting’s participants were assured that fair pricing would be ensured for farmers and the government would by sufficient stock to ensure their security as well as “stable reserves”.</p><small>2025-10-19 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1922010395cb383.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949962/england-beat-india-by-4-runs-in-last-ball-thriller-to-qualify-for-womens-world-cup-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>England beat India by 4 runs in last-ball thriller to qualify for Women’s World Cup semi-final</strong></a><br><p>Four-time champions England booked their ticket to the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup after pulling off a nail-biting four-run win over hosts India in Indore on Sunday.
England had posted a competitive 288-8 thanks to Heather Knight’s century and held their nerve in the field to defend it, despite their bowling, usually their strong suit, being a touch off colour.
 






India looked to be cruising towards victory, needing just 62 runs off the last 10 overs with seven wickets in hand. But the dismissal of Smriti Mandhana turned the tide, as scoreboard pressure crept in and dot balls piled up. Soon after, Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma departed in quick succession, leaving the tail high and dry.
Reckless batting cost India dear. Mandhana’s downfall opened the floodgates when she danced down the track to left-arm spinner Linsey Smith but failed to clear long-off. Then, after reaching her half-century, Deepti Sharma perished trying to take on Sophie Ecclestone, a slog sweep that found deep mid-wicket to perfection. From there, the writing was on the wall.
“We probably needed 300, but we did well to pull things back and I’m very happy. Didn’t contribute much in the last couple of games, so it felt good to come up with a match-winning hundred,” said Knight, whose classy 109 off 91 balls, laced with 15 fours and a six, was the backbone of England’s innings.
England’s openers gave them a brisk start with 73 runs for the first wicket before Knight joined captain Nat Sciver-Brunt in a 113-run stand that kept the scoreboard ticking.
At one stage, England looked set to go past 300, but Knight’s run out attempting a second run triggered a slowdown, as India tightened the screws and conceded only 74 runs in the final 10 overs. Deepti Sharma was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with four wickets.
It was India’s third successive defeat, leaving their next clash against New Zealand a virtual knockout. With both teams locked on four points, it’s a case of do or die to stay in the hunt for the last semi-final berth, with Australia, England and South Africa already safely through.
England, meanwhile, have been clinical, through to the semis with two games in hand. They sit second on the table with nine points, level with defending champions Australia, separated only by a whisker in Net Run Rate.
“Not sure how we lost this game. We had it in the bag. We’ve worked so hard and when the last five overs slip away from you, it’s heartbreaking. This is the third straight game we’ve lost after coming so close,” lamented India captain Harmanpreet Kaur.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1922520051acfad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949968/manchester-united-stretch-liverpool-losing-streak-to-four-games' target='_blank'><strong>Manchester United stretch Liverpool losing streak to four games</strong></a><br><p>Liverpool slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in 11 years as Manchester United won 2-1 on Sunday to end their near decade-long wait for victory at Anfield.
Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header secured back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time in Ruben Amorim’s tenure as United boss.
Twelve minutes from time, Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s opener after just 61 seconds.
Defeat leaves Liverpool four points adrift of Arsenal at the top of the table and Arne Slot still searching for answers in how to get the right blend after splashing out nearly £450 million ($604 million) on new players in the transfer market.
United close to within two points of their historic rivals and up to ninth in the table to ease the pressure on Amorim after his biggest win in nearly a year in charge.
Liverpool had only lost one of the previous 14 Premier League meetings between the sides and United had not tasted victory at Anfield since the early days of Jurgen Klopp’s reign in January 2016.
However, the Reds are in a state of flux after transforming the squad that stormed to the title last season and the tragic loss of Diogo Jota, who died in a car accident in July.
After three consecutive defeats for the first time in Slot’s reign, Liverpool could barely have imagined a worse start.
Mbeumo sped past Virgil van Dijk with ease before firing past Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo’s pass after barely a minute.
The home side and support were furious that play was not stopped in the build-up after Alexis MacAllister went down with a head injury, inflicted by his own captain Van Dijk.
Slot left £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench for the second consecutive game as he looked in vain to find the right balance between defence and attack.
Gakpo should have levelled for the defending champions when he hit the post from Mohamed Salah’s through ball in Liverpool’s one flowing move of the first half.
However, it was United who should have been further in front by half-time.
Bruno Fernandes spurned a glorious chance to double the Red Devils’ lead when he hit the outside of the post when unmarked from the edge of the area.
At the other end, Senne Lammens was rarely troubled in the first 45 minutes, but produced a big save when called upon to deny Alexander Isak his first Premier League goal since joining Liverpool for a British transfer record £125 million.
A Gakpo deflected cross then came back off the post and the Dutchman rattled the woodwork for a third time early in the second half.
Slot turned to his near £200 million in forward options off the bench as Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike were introduced on the hour mark to join Salah, Gakpo and Isak in a five-man attack.
Salah has scored more goals than any other player in this fixture, but his lack of form showed in a wild finish to slice wide with just Lammens to beat at the back post.
Liverpool’s wealth of attacking talent finally broke the door down when Federico Chiesa, who had replaced Isak moments earlier, drilled in a low cross that Gakpo converted from point blank range.
Yet, their defensive frailties meant parity only lasted six minutes as Maguire was left unmarked to head in Fernandes’s looping cross.
Gakpo should still have rescued a point when he headed wide with the goal gaping from Jeremie Frimpong’s inviting delivery.
But Liverpool fell to their first league defeat at Anfield in over a year in another blow to their hopes of usurping United with a record 21st English top-flight title.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191405317e2d5c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949920/pakistan-relying-on-spin-again-to-seal-series-win-against-south-africa-azhar-mahmood' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan relying on spin again to seal series win against South Africa: Azhar Mahmood</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is relying on its spin strength to seal the Test series against South Africa after defeating the Proteas men in the first Test match in Lahore on Wednesday,  interim red-ball head coach Azhar Mahmood said at a press conference ahead of the second match on Monday.
Left-arm spinner Noman Ali was South Africa’s chief tormentor as Pakistan won the first Test by 93 runs. Set a daunting 277-run target for victory, the visitors and World Test champions were bowled out for 183 on day four.
“The pre-series camp was aimed at adapting spin on these types of pitches; different shots, scoring options,” Azhar said at the presser. “We’re trying that if we play this method at home, then we’ll know how to play spin.”
Azhar noted that the playing XI will be decided the morning of the match after seeing pitch conditions, saying there is a possibility of some changes, “but not too many”.
 


“With regards to the toss, we don’t want that the whole match is decided by the toss.
“I said this before the series as well, that these pitches are not West Indies pitches, this pitch played better than that one. So the aim is that even if we lose the toss, we try to make 350 (runs) in the first innings,” said Azhar, who was appointed interim coach of the men’s team in June.
When asked how important a 2-0 series win is, Azhar acknowledged the confidence boost that comes with winning against a team like South Africa.
“We hope to perform as best as we can. There is no guarantee of the result, because we need to improve our process and be consistent with our basics over a long period of time,” he said.
“When you play at home, you need to see how you’re going to take 20 wickets, whether it’s through spin or pace. Wherever we play, the aim is that we win. We have the fast-bowling ability.”
Azhar added: “Whenever the opposition comes from abroad, we can plan against them differently. The countries that struggle against spin, we’ll try to play spin and reverse against them.”
During the presser, Mahmood also cleared the air on criticism against him based on a “wrong narrative” being used against him.
 


“There’s been a lot of criticism on social media because I said last time that we don’t have quality spinners. You can see any press conference of mine and see that I said we don’t have any spinners in the squad; I never said we don’t have spinners in the country.”
Azhar also had praise for Pakistan’s batsmen, saying all seven who played scored runs and “everyone played their part.
“Unfortunately our lower order did not perform, so we expect that they not only perform with the ball. You must have seen in the previous series as well that Noman, Sajid performed well, so Hassan Ali can bat, Shaheen can bat.
“The top seven is the top seven, but the lower order runs matter as well, which we didn’t do in the previous test,” Azhar said, adding that South Africa made 90 runs in their last four wickets.
“We’re playing against the best team and they’re obviously not going to take this lightly, they’ll give it their all to comeback; they were relying heavily on one of their spinners, who’s one of the best in the world. It’ll bring a lot of challenges for us.
“In the camp, we had thought of all kinds of challenges that would come, of [Keshav] Maharaj, of Rabada, so we prepared accordingly.

The preparation is done, now it’s time to execute.

“We know what challenges will come, and we need to see how to tackle those. On the day, it’s all about execution and making the right decision when you bat, bowl or field,” Mahmood said.
With regards to winning the World Test Championship, he said Pakistan is playing six Test matches at home.
“Obviously, we need to go step by step to reach there — you need to play in conditions abroad, play in West Indies, Bangladesh, England. So the process that I keep talking about, we need to take the matches one by one. With Test matches we’ll take it session by session.
“This team has been playing for quite some time now, the boys’ morale is quite high, they knew it was important to win the match and you saw the effort they put in. They’re confident and they’re all getting along well and playing together. This is what a team needs to build up,” he said.
Spinner Maharaj to return for South Africa against Pakistan
South Africa have been boosted by the return of leading spinner Keshav Maharaj to the team for the second test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi as they seek to level the series, captain Aiden Markram said on Sunday.
Maharaj, 35, was recovering from a groin injury and missed the first test in Lahore.
“Obviously, its great to have him back in the camp, Markram told a press conference on Sunday.
 


He brings lots of experience and a really good skill set as well, so we’re looking forward to this game starting tomorrow, which is an opportunity for us to level the series, but also to keep improving in these conditions and fixing some of the stuff that we feel needs fixing from the first game.”
Maharaj’s 203 wickets in 59 tests make him South Africa’s most successful spin bowler.
The clash in Lahore was dominated by the spinners on a slow turning surface, and Markram is expecting the same from the pitch at Rawalpindi.
“We’re expecting it to spin. We’ve expected those types of conditions from day one, and it’s about us having done some homework post the first test and coming up with new plans to hopefully counter that and give ourselves a chance of succeeding in these conditions.
“I suppose when you get to spinning conditions, the guessing game is always how long until it really starts to spin exaggeratedly,” Markram said.
South Africa had three spinners in their line-up last week, and Maharajs return is likely to lead to Simon Harmer, Senuran Muthusamy or Prenelan Subrayen being dropped.
Pakistan’s victory in Lahore ended a 10-match winning streak in test cricket for South Africa.</p><small>2025-10-19 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191917017424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949953/lahore-ranks-second-most-polluted-city-in-world-in-terms-of-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ranks second most polluted city in world in terms of air quality</strong></a><br><p>Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality on Sunday, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI reading for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
 


Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were measured at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time last year, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘smog guns’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”</p><small>2025-10-19 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1911361470e6c73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949908/suparco-launches-countrys-first-hyperspectral-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>Suparco launches country’s first ‘hyperspectral satellite’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Sunday launched its first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from a Chinese launch centre, the country’s space agency said, describing it as “a breakthrough achievement”.
Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience.
Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
In a statement issued today, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said, “The nation’s space agency today announced a breakthrough achievement with the successful launch of Pakistan’s first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from China.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Detailing the function of the satellite, the statement said, “HS-1 satellite is engineered to capture ultra-precise hyperspectral imagery across hundreds of narrow spectral bands, offering unprecedented resolution for the analysis of land, vegetation, water, and urban features.”
“The cutting-edge technology is set to fundamentally transform Pakistan’s capacity in precision agriculture, rigorous environmental monitoring, urban planning, and proactive disaster management,” it said.
“HS-1 will empower the nation to precisely map crop vitality, soil moisture, and water quality, while rigorously tracking deforestation, pollution, and glacial melt.”
It added that the satellite will “enhance early warning systems and post-disaster assessments for catastrophic events like floods and landslides, especially across the northern regions”.
Per the agency, the satellite is also expected to aid “development initiatives such as CPEC by preemptively identifying geo-hazard risks and guiding sustainable infrastructure development”.
Chairman Suparco, Muhammad Yousaf Khan, “expressed profound gratitude for the Government of Pakistan’s support in bringing this pivotal national project to fruition”, the statement quoted him as saying.
“The data from the Hyperspectral Satellite is poised to revolutionise agricultural productivity, bolster climate resilience, and enable optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources.”
Underscoring the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and China in space science, the space agency continued: “The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development.”
“HS-1’s successful integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet marks a decisive step toward solidifying space technology excellence and reinforces Suparco’s vital role in driving national socioeconomic growth through innovative space applications.”
According to the press release, Project Director HS-1 Mushtaque Hussain Soomro stressed that the satellite “signals a definitive leap in Pakistan’s ambitious space roadmap, positioning the nation as an emerging leader in space technology for sustainable development”.
He also hailed the mission team’s collective dedication and technical brilliance, the statement said.
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his appreciation for Pakistani engineers and scientists for the successful launch.
“The cooperation between Pakistan and China in space research, like in other sectors, is exemplary and of key importance,” the PM was quoted as saying. “We are grateful to our great and long-standing friend and strategic partner, China, for this exemplary collaboration.
“The hearts of Pakistanis beat with the Chinese people and leadership,” he added.
According to the statement,  the satellite will help Pakistan research environmental changes and geographical variations.
“This progress will prove to be an important milestone in combating the harmful effects of climate change,” PM Shehbaz said. “The satellite will significantly increase national capabilities in areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.”
Separately, in a statement issued today, the foreign office termed the development a major milestone and called it “a pivotal step forward in Pakistan’s space programme.”
 






FO said that the launch “reaffirms Suparco’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development.”
It also “highlights the long-standing collaboration between Pakistan and China in the peaceful exploration of space and its application for socioeconomic progress.”
“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar commended the scientists/technical teams from Pakistan and China working on HS-1 for their commitment, professional excellence and exemplary cooperation,” the statement said.
On October 15, Suparco announced the upcoming launch of the HS-1 satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China.
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was integrating space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.
In July, the foreign ministry announced the successful launch of a remote sensing satellite from China, which aimed to “strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities”.
In August, Pakistan successfully launched a remote sensing satellite from a launch centre in China. The satellite aimed to strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities, according to a Foreign Office statement.</p><small>2025-10-19 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1919165796cd0df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949952/two-women-killed-30-injured-as-coaster-collides-with-mountainside-in-kps-haripur-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Two women killed, 30 injured as coaster collides with mountainside in KP’s Haripur: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Two women were killed and 30 others were injured on Sunday when a coaster carrying a wedding party collided with the mountainside on Jab road in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur, according to Rescue 1122.

Subsequently, four Rescue 1122 ambulances and a rescue vehicle were sent to the site, it said, adding that the bodies and most of the injured were taken to Trauma Centre Haripur. Two of the injured whose condition was critical were sent to Abbottabad.
In a similar incident in late September, 11 deaths were reported after a truck crashed in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan. Three people were also injured in the accident, which a Rescue 1122 spokesperson attributed to brake failure.
In another accident the same month on September 9, two women had died while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in KP’s Mansehra.

In a statement on X, Afridi said, “For the establishment of peace, a grand peace jirga of tribal elders, leaders, and youth — transcending  political affiliations — will be held on Saturday, October 25, 2025, in Khyber District, Bara Tehsil.”
Stressing the need for prioritising the will of KP’s people in deciding the matters of the province, he said, “The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will themselves decide their lives and their future.”
“No one will be allowed to impose decisions made in closed rooms on the people,” he said, vowing that the KP government “will stand with Imran Khan’s ideology and the interests of the people.”
 






The development comes as the province witnesses a rise in terrorist attacks, which escalated after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
In July, Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund in KP, which was then opposed by the provincial government of KP.
In July, a jirga was organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga.
In August, former KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced a series of jirgas to oppose the military operation in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre.
The recommendations by the Jirga were to ensure unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”</p><small>2025-10-19 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19140132cba4f56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949918/over-433-million-children-vaccinated-against-polio-in-first-5-days-of-campaign-neoc' target='_blank'><strong>Over 43.3 million children vaccinated against polio in first 5 days of campaign: NEOC</strong></a><br><p>Over 43.3 million children of up to five years of age have been vaccinated against polio in the first five days of an anti-polio campaign across the country, the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) said on Saturday, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic.
Yesterday’s data reported that more than 22.9m children have received the oral polio vaccine in Punjab, while approximately 10.2m children were immunised in Sindh.
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, more than 6.1m children have been vaccinated … in Balochistan, over 2.5m; in Islamabad, around 443,000; in Gilgit-Baltistan, nearly 294,000 and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, over 733,000 children have received the vaccine,” Radio Pakistan added.
Of those that received the vaccine in Punjab over the first six days of the campaign, over 2.2m were in Lahore, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said on Sunday.
The ongoing week-long anti-polio campaign in Lahore was launched under the vision of Punjab’s Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif for a Zero Polio Punjab.
According to Radio Pakistan, the ongoing national campaign aims to vaccinate over 45m children and is set to run uninterrupted until today. Meanwhile, in South KP, the campaign is scheduled to begin tomorrow (Monday).
The NEOC urged parents to ensure that every child under five years of age receives the polio vaccine, the outlet added.
Progress meeting
A review meeting to assess the progress of the Punjab campaign was held under the chairmanship of Lahore’s Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza at his office on Sunday, according to APP.
The meeting was attended by the additional deputy commissioner (general), Chief Executive Officer (Health) Dr Asif Arbab, assistant commissioners, officials from the health department, and observers from the World Health Organisation (WHO).
During the meeting, Arbab said that more than 2.212m children had been vaccinated across the provincial capital so far, while an additional 73,900 children who had missed out were covered during the first catch-up day. The district administration and health teams remained fully active in the field to achieve the set targets, he added.
Arbab further informed the meeting that the campaign achieved over 99 per cent of its target with more than 1.559m households successfully covered, marking the coverage rate as over 95pc. The WHO representatives expressed satisfaction over the overall performance of the district teams and appreciated the dedication and commitment of field staff working tirelessly to eradicate the crippling disease.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza emphasised that the anti-polio campaign must be made a complete success in every respect. He directed all Assistant Commissioners to minimise the number of missed-out children and instructed the Deputy District Health Officers (DDHOs) to ensure strict field monitoring.
 
 

He also said that 100pc coverage must be ensured in schools, adding that any operational issues were to be reported immediately to the district administration for prompt action.
“All children under five years of age must be vaccinated; achieving the targets is mandatory,” the DC stressed, warning that officers failing to meet their targets would be held accountable.
“Making Lahore polio-free is a shared responsibility. We must perform our national duty for the sake of our children’s future,” he added.
Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress. Over 200,000 polio workers and supervisors are participating in the current drive across Punjab.
Data from September showed that the number of children remaining unvaccinated due to parental refusals had come down in their recent immunisation drive compared to the previous campaign.
However, the global polio monitoring board issued a warning that efforts to eradicate the disease were failing as a new polio case confirmed in Sindh’s Hyderabad the same month brought the nationwide tally to 27 this year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
In August, two new poliovirus cases were reported, involving a six-year-old girl from KP’s Kohistan district and a 21-month-old girl from Sindh’s Badin.
Earlier that month, poliovirus was found in 36pc of samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July.</p><small>2025-10-19 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1913085896107b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949914/pakistans-jf-17-block-iii-jets-touch-down-in-azerbaijan-for-bilateral-aerial-combat-exercise' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s JF-17 Block-III jets touch down in Azerbaijan for bilateral aerial combat exercise</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, has landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
Pakistan regularly participates in bilateral and multilateral air exercises with countries around the world, showcasing its growing aerial capabilities and fostering military cooperation. These exercises allow the PAF to train in diverse operational environments, enhance interoperability with foreign forces, and demonstrate its cutting-edge aircraft and skilled personnel on the international stage. Such engagements also strengthen defence diplomacy and strategic ties with partner nations.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the exercise, called Indus Shield Alpha, aims to enhance mutual understanding, tactical coordination and interoperability between the air forces of Pakistan and Azerbaijan.

“In a remarkable display of operational prowess and endurance, PAF fighters accomplished a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Azerbaijan, executing flawless in-flight air-to-air refuelling operations,” the statement said.
“The intricate mid-air refuelling operation, executed with utmost precision by PAF’s own IL-78 aerial tanker, reaffirmed the long-range capability of PAF fighter jets and showcased the professional excellence and preparedness of PAF aircrew to undertake extended international deployments.”
Per the statement, the exercise will focus on modern aerial warfare tactics, joint mission planning and execution in an environment shaped by rapid technological advancements and evolving airpower dynamics.
It will also serve as a vital platform to exchange operational insights and strengthen collaborative responses to emerging aerial defence challenges.
The statement continued: “The participation of the Pakistan Air Force contingent in Exercise Indus Shield Alpha reaffirms PAF’s enduring commitment to regional stability and global military cooperation.
“It also demonstrates PAF’s unwavering resolve to continuously evolve and adapt to the demands of contemporary warfare, while maintaining its tradition of excellence in every domain of air operations.”
In July, PAF fighter jets won top awards in two categories at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) 2025 in the United Kingdom. The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the “Spirit of the Meet Trophy” for its “striking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling. The C-130H Hercules was awarded the “Concours d’Elegance Trophy”.
Last year, PAF conducted Exercise Indus Shield-2024, the largest multinational regional exercise with 24 countries taking part in it. The exercise aimed to foster interoperability and training through state-of-the-art facilities. According to the ISPR,  the event saw the participation of various air chiefs and high-ranking military officials from allied countries to witness the mega event.
The exercise highlighted the premier multi-domain warfighting capabilities of the PAF and reinforced the importance of collaboration among air forces worldwide.</p><small>2025-10-19 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19094906c43a0c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949810/karachi-hyderabad-face-dengue-outbreak-as-cases-spike-alarmingly' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi, Hyderabad face dengue outbreak as cases spike alarmingly</strong></a><br><p>• Health dept data suggests all is well on dengue front in Sindh with just 819 confirmed cases
• Figures obtained from four Karachi hospital show 2,972 positive cases reported from Sept 1 to Oct 16
• One public sector Hyderabad lab confirms 9,075 dengue cases between Sept 1 and Oct 14
• Govt says 215,270 malaria cases also reported this year in province
KARACHI / HYDERABAD: While the provincial health department puts the total number of dengue cases in Sindh this year at 819, figures obtained by three major Karachi hospitals and one public sector laboratory and its branches in Hyderabad suggest an outbreak-like situation, with the actual number exceeding 12,000 in a short span of just six weeks.
The government had confirmed one dengue-related death in July, but independent figures suggest four dengue patients in Hyderabad —a young girl and two men and an elderly woman — and two in Karachi had lost their lives after testing positive to the mosquito-borne disease.
As the government remained tight-lipped over the large data discrepancy, a senior Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) official cast doubts over the credibility of officials figures, saying their stats did not represent the ground reality.
Grim situation in Karachi, Hyderabad
According to official figures released by the health services director general, the total number of dengue confirmed cases in Karachi division and Hyderabad district this year was 579 and 119, respectively.
However, figures collected from three hospitals in Karachi — Indus Hospital (IH), Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) and the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre (SIDHRC) — showed that a total of 2,972 cases of dengue have been reported from Sept 1 to Oct 16. The fourth hospital — the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre — alone recorded 1,062 dengue cases from July to date.
The situation is no different at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) as sources confirmed a high number of dengue cases, comparatively larger than the last year’s, and a few deaths.
Hyderabad is facing an alarming situation as the figures obtained from the Diagnostic and Research Laboratory (DRL) of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Jamshoro and its branches showed 9,075 dengue confirmed cases from Sept 1 to Oct 14.
Question mark over credibility of govt data
PMA-Sindh President Dr Bashir Ahmed Khaskheli described the situation far more serious than what’s depicted by official data and said that official figures did not represent the ground reality.
“There is no official mechanism in place to get feedback from private clinics operating in every nook and corner of a locality as well as private hospitals, quacks and even hakeems. Many people constrained by their financial resources don’t even opt for laboratory tests,” he told Dawn.
Dr Faisal Mahmood, professor of infectious diseases and associate chief medical officer at the AKUH, also confirmed the surge in dengue cases, emphasising that the end of October was classically the season when most dengue cases were seen.
Talking to Dawn, he said: “It is important to note that dengue rates do vary from year to year, and this cyclic pattern of dengue peaks is something we have seen over the last decade or so. There are several reasons for this including weather patterns and changes in the strains. What is driving this year is hard to say, though I would think the [rains] floods have played a part.”
Dr Mahmood avoided making an observation on the disease severity, pointing out that the city was in the middle of the (dengue) season.
Prof Dr Imran Shaikh, a seasoned physician and dean faulty of medicine in LUMHS, said: “We had cases in June and July but nobody traced them. Burden of positive case has increased immensely since September. It is yet to show a declining trend.”
Alarming rise in malaria cases
According to the health department’s data, 215,270 cases of malaria have been reported this year across the province and the number of cases reported in Karachi from January 1 to Oct 15 stands at 3,072.
The official data shows the worst malaria-affected cities are: Jamshoro 22,293, Larkana 19,835, followed by Jacobabad 17,170, Badin 19,478, Mirpurkhas 12,699, Shaheed Benazirabad 12,467, Thatta 10,995, Tando Muhammad Khan 10,579, Khairpur 9,967, Sanghar 7,409, Hyderabad 7,054, Tando Allah Yar 6,702, Matiari 6,064, Shikarpur 6,875, Tharparkar 4,297, Kashmore 4,292, Qambar Shahdadkot 3,866, Sukkur 4,187, Naushehro Feroze 3,563, Ghotki 2,867 and Umerkot 2,327.
However, information gathered from different private and public sector hospitals contradicted the official data.
Figures collected from Indus Hospital, SIDHRC, LNH, and JPMC showed that over 1,800 cases of malaria had been reported in the city from Sept 1 to Oct 16.
According to Dr Faisal Mahmood of the AKUH, malaria has seen at least a month early onset this year.
Ineffective fumigation
Health experts have attributed the surge in dengue cases to lack of fumigation and timely drainage of water accumulated after the heavy spells of monsoon rains.
“If rainwater remains accumulated, it has the potential to become a breeding ground for vectors,” said Dr Mirza Ali Azhar of the PMA. “Entire rainwater doesn’t go into drains, and in many areas, water stands in the shape of ponds, only to serve as a home for mosquitoes,” he said.
Dr Khaskheli, the incumbent PMA-Sindh president, regretted that the high number of cases due to mosquito-borne illnesses could be easily prevented through effective vector control measures.
 
 

“It’s all has to do with poor sewerage and drainage system. One could see pools of standing rainwater or sewage and heaps of garbage everywhere, providing breeding grounds of all kinds of germs and insects,” he said and pointed that there were few government fumigation campaigns to effectively address the menace of vector-borne diseases.
Anti-dengue campaign intensified: minister
There was no response from the health department when its spokesperson was contacted to explain the large discrepancy in data, suggesting that actual numbers of dengue and malaria cases would be much higher.
However, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho urged the general public to take ownership of their localities and ensure that there no pools of stagnant water.
“The government is taking comprehensive measures to curb the spread of the disease. Anti-dengue campaigns have been intensified across all divisions, including Karachi, where fumigation and spraying operations are being carried out on a daily basis. Hospitals have been instructed to provide special medical attention and immediate treatment to dengue patients,” she said in a statement.
She added that health department teams were closely monitoring suspected and confirmed cases across all districts and were working jointly with the district administrations to take immediate preventive and remedial actions.

Solntsev said earlier this month that Ukrainian drones had tried to attack an unnamed industrial facility in the Russian city of Orsk near the border with Kazakhstan.

According to officials familiar with the development, the PTI may be unable to field its candidates in the polls since the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has yet to allot it a symbol — a prerequisite for participation under the new Local Government Act.
The officials said under the recently enacted law, any candidate elected as an independent councillor must join a political party within 30 days of assuming office. However, with PTI lacking formal registration and a symbol, independents supportive of the party will neither be able to affiliate themselves with it nor face disciplinary action from its leadership if they act against party lines.
The PTI’s intra-party election dispute has been pending before the ECP for the past 19 months. Legal experts said PTI’s lawyers have shown little urgency in resolving the matter, resulting in prolonged delays. The ECP has also suspended proceedings owing to a stay order issued by the Lahore High Court, effectively stalling the case.
Meanwhile, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan said the new Local Government Act, 2025, was still awaiting his signature.

Uncertainty prevails as governor is yet to assent to bill

Speaking at a reception, the governor remarked that he would decide on the bill after receiving a detailed briefing.
“I have yet to fully understand the new law,” he said. “The secretary for local government will brief me on Monday (tomorrow), and only then I will take a final decision.”
The Punjab Assembly had passed the new local government bill last Monday as the ECP began delimitation process under the PLGA 2022 to hold elections for local bodies in December, rejecting all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new law.
Observers say that with legal ambiguities unresolved and the local government framework awaiting gubernatorial assent, the timeline and political complexion of Punjab’s local elections remain uncertain — with PTI’s participation hanging in the balance.

Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn that 37-year-old Sabir Baber was riding a motorcycle when a water bowser (KJF-6195) hit him at Liaquatabad-10 in the limits of Sharifabad police station. He sustained critical injuries and was transported to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
The incident angered area people who set the heavy vehicle on fire, after which it was completely destroyed, said Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan. He added that it was a private company’s bowser. The driver responsible for the incident escaped from the spot. The mob also damaged a trailer (TMP-156), said a traffic police official.
In another incident, a motorcyclist was killed while two others were injured when a heavy vehicle hit them on M.M. Alam Road near Malir Cantonment.
Model Colony SHO Shaukat Awan told Dawn that three persons were riding the bike when the six-wheeler loaded trailer hit them. As a result, they sustained critical injuries and were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where one of them was declared dead.
The officer claimed that he was present at Model Mor when the incident occurred. He rushed to the spot and controlled the situation. The errant driver was arrested. The identity of the deceased could not be ascertained immediately.

• Pulses stay costly despite global drop
• Poultry prices fall amid overproduction
KARACHI: The price of tomatoes has surged, with rates reaching as high as Rs560 per kilogram in retail markets.
Wholesalers, however, claim that retailers are charging more than double the wholesale price, which currently stands between Rs250-300 per kg. The inflated prices have left many consumers buying smaller quantities, often just 250 grams, to meet their immediate needs.
Haji Shahjehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market Super Highway, attributed the high prices to a shortage of tomatoes in the wholesale market. He cited the declining Balochistan crop, which is nearing its end, and the thin arrival of tomatoes from Iran as key factors. The situation has been further exacerbated by the tense border conditions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, making tomato shipments from Afghanistan unlikely. New supplies from Sindh are expected to arrive next month.
Shahjehan added that the absence of price lists in markets allows retailers to set prices at their discretion, leading to substantial markups. Prices of other vegetables, including peas, ridge gourd, and ginger, have also risen, with some items seeing a price increase of Rs50-100 per kg.
Poultry prices decline
While vegetable prices are spiralling, consumers have seen some relief in poultry prices. The national average price of live poultry has dropped to Rs300-390 per kg, down from Rs440-540 per kg in Septem­ber. Similarly, the price of boneless chicken has fallen from Rs1,000-1,100 per kg to Rs650-800 per kg.
Kamal Akhtar Siddiqui, Sindh Poultry Wholesalers Association General Secretary explained that the drop in prices was due to overproduction at poultry farms. With shipments of live birds and eggs to Afghanistan suspended because of border closures, farmers have been forced to release overgrown birds into the market at lower prices. In some areas, live chickens are being sold for as low as Rs400 per kg, while chicken leg pieces are priced around Rs350 per kg. However, eggs have remained expensive, with prices between Rs310-360 per dozen, driven by high demand following the reopening of schools.
Pulses stay costly
In the pulses sector, wholesale prices have largely remained stable despite a decline in international prices. Masoor, mung, mash, and gram pulses continue to sell at Rs250-300, Rs320-500, Rs380-530, and Rs250-380 per kg, respectively, since September. Rauf Ibrahim, President of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association, noted that global prices for several pulses, including black gram, arhar, and masoor, had fallen sharply. However, these reductions have not been passed on to consumers at the retail level. Ibrahim emphasised the government’s responsibility to ensure that lower wholesale prices reach the public.
The international price of pulses has seen a noticeable drop, with black gram falling from $650 to $460 per tonne, arhar from $1,000 to $500 per tonne, and masoor from $660 to $460 per tonne. The price of Kabuli Channa has also fallen from $750-800 to $650 per tonne. Ibrahim anticipates that additional shipments of pulses from countries such as Burma, Australia, and Tanzania could further reduce prices next month.
Sugar concerns
Sugar prices in Pakistan have remained steady, with rates ranging from Rs177-200 per kg despite concerns raised by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA). On October 14, 2025, the PSMA discussed the ongoing issue with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) over the suspension of sugar sales through the S-Track Portal. PSMA officials warned that continued disruption to the portal could lead to a sugar shortage, which would drive prices up.
The association claims that the FBR’s actions are aimed at facilitating the sale of imported sugar while hindering the sale of domestic sugar. PSMA representatives argue that this could destabilise the market and increase prices, leaving the industry unable to shoulder the blame for rising costs.
Volatility impact on consumers
The Karachi food market continues to experience significant price volatility, which has left many consumers struggling to adjust to the shifting cost of everyday items. Retailers have faced criticism for overcharging, with no clear pricing guidelines in place to regulate the market. Wholesale prices, though, have seen a general downward trend in some sectors.

• Justice Arbab Tahir to hear petition along with office’s objections on Monday
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has raised objections to a petition filed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala jail.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir is scheduled to hear the petition, along with the registrar office’s objections, on Monday.
The petition was submitted by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal through Advocate Ali Bukhari on behalf of the provincial chief minister. The petition argued that a meeting with the PTI founder was essential to discuss matters pertaining to provincial governance and the formation of a new cabinet.
However, the IHC registrar’s office objected to the maintainability of the plea, noting that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.
The move came after CM Afridi was denied a meeting with PTI founder at Adiala jail. Following the refusal, the KP government approached the IHC, naming the federal and Punjab interior secretaries, the inspector general of Punjab Police, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
 
 

According to the petition, the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow the meeting, but no approval was granted. The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Advocate General Shah Faisal, who verified his biometrics at the IHC under a special power of attorney, told reporters that CM Afridi had personally attempted to meet the PTI founder but was denied access despite having sought the prime minister’s permission. He added that the chief minister also intended to raise the matter before the Chief Justice of Pakistan on the administrative side and might approach the Supreme Court if necessary.
PTI leader and counsel Ali Bukhari said the ban on political meetings, imposed on November 26 last year, was contrary to the Pakistan Prisons Rules and violated visitation rights. He argued that even court directions regarding such rights were being disregarded, asserting that “meetings with inmates are a right, not a privilege.”
The petition requested the court to direct the jail authorities to immediately allow a meeting between the KP chief minister and the PTI founder, and to issue guidelines for future consultations as part of routine governance communication. The IHC will take up the petition, along with objections, for hearing on Monday.

• Says govt ‘close to deciding’ fate of Roosevelt Hotel
• Backs global financial reforms to ease climate burden
• Briefs World Bank president on govt’s flood response
WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Saturday that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cannot impose any conditions on Pakistan that go against the country’s national interests.
Speaking at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, the minister said that all the reforms undertaken so far under IMF programmes were consistent with Pakistan’s own economic priorities and had contributed to improving the national economy.
“Please name any IMF-suggested reform that is not aligned with our national interest,” he asked in response to a question.
Mr Aurangzeb announced that the IMF is expected to release the $1.2 billion tranche pledged under last week’s staff-level agreement by Dec 31.
“The Fund’s executive board will soon meet to review the agreement, and the amount will be released shortly thereafter,” he added.
At the conclusion of his six-day visit to Washington, the minister also expressed optimism about finalising a trade and tariff agreement with the United States “within a week or two”.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb, who attended 65 meetings during the World Bank Group’s annual autumn session, said the government was also “close to deciding” the fate of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, a property owned by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
Seven international consortia, including Citigroup, have submitted bids to advise Pakistan on the privatisation of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York — a century-old Manhattan landmark considered one of the country’s most valuable foreign assets.
According to media reports, Islamabad is pursuing a joint venture model rather than an outright sale, seeking a redevelopment partner to maximise the property’s long-term value as part of a privatisation effort agreed under its $7bn IMF programme.
Pakistan backs V20 agenda
Separately, Pakistan joined 68 other nations on Saturday in calling for reforms to the global financial system to help vulnerable economies cope with the mounting impacts of climate change.
The appeal was made at a meeting of the Vulnerable 20 (V20) — a coalition of finance ministers from 68 countries most exposed to climate risks — held on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings in Washington.
 






The group seeks fairer access to climate finance and changes in global lending rules to support adaptation and recovery efforts.
“Pakistan strongly supports the V20 agenda to reform the global financial architecture, ensuring that climate finance is more accessible and affordable,” Mr Aurangzeb said while addressing the meeting.
He emphasised the need to align climate financing with the requirements of vulnerable economies to “ensure resilient growth”.
Ranked first on the Climate Risk Index 2025 despite contributing less than 0.9 per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan continues to bear disproportionate losses.
Experts warn that the country now requires $40-50bn annually to effectively mitigate and adapt to climate risks.
Mr Aurangzeb informed the V20 gathering that the government was pursuing its own reforms to align national policies with the group’s call for equitable climate finance. These efforts include developing creditworthy project pipelines, issuing green bonds and creating carbon market mechanisms to attract investment, he added.
Flood response
In a related development, the finance minister met World Bank President Ajay Banga in Washington on Friday and briefed him on the government’s flood response efforts. This meeting also took place on the sidelines of the plenary sessions of the IMF and World Bank, which Mr Aurangzeb attended during his six-day visit to Washington from Oct 13 to 18.
An official statement said Mr Aurangzeb briefed Mr Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the bank’s timely support following the post-flood damage assessment.
The minister also endorsed the proposal to leverage technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience,” the statement read.
The minister requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach to reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency.
The minister highlighted Pakistan’s Climate Prosperity Plan, which aims to shift the country from vulnerability to resilience and from risk to investment.
Separately, in a meeting with Turkiye’s Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Simsek, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted Islamabad’s ongoing reform efforts in key sectors, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), privatisation, and public finance.

• Taliban regime seeks confirmed coordinates of TTP hideouts; pledge to address concern
• FO says govt to press Afghan Taliban to honour commitments
• Tarar rebukes ICC over ‘biased, premature’ comment on ‘airstrike deaths’
ISLAMABAD: Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan were held on Saturday amid cautious optimism on both sides for de-escalation following a week of deadly cross-border clashes, though a breakthrough remained uncertain in the absence of concrete Taliban commitments on ending terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil.
The meeting, held in a cordial atmosphere, continued well into the night behind closed doors in Doha.
Participants of the Doha dialogue reportedly kept shifting their stance on the continuation of talks. Initially, both sides considered adjourning the negotiations for a week, but later agreed to reconvene on Sunday.
However, the latest word from sources familiar with the closely guarded proceedings suggested that the discussions, held in deep secrecy, continued late into the night, with a joint communique expected to be issued.
The talks were opened by a senior Qatari intelligence official before the Pakistani and Afghan delegations began direct discussions on outstanding issues.
The Pakistani side was led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, accompanied by National Security Adviser and ISI Chief Lt Gen Asim Malik. The Afghan side was represented by Acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid and Inte­lligence Chief Maulvi Abdul Haq Wasiq.
According to diplomatic sources, Pakistan pressed that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Afghan soil was “not acceptable” and urged verifiable action against the group.
The Taliban delegation, while signalling willingness to cooperate, reportedly asked Pakistan to provide verified details of TTP hideouts and promised to address the concerns “to Pakistan’s satisfaction”.
However, Taliban representatives also cautioned that it was “unrealistic” to expect Kabul to entirely stop TTP operations inside Pakistan.
 
 

Afghan negotiators further complained that Pakistan’s public narrative had negatively impacted the Taliban’s international recognition prospects and alleged that militants of the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K) captured in Afghanistan had claimed to have received training in Pakistan.
Taliban negotiators, during the course of the meeting, kept consulting their leadership in Afghanistan, according to a source.
In a statement issued earlier in the day, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the high-level delegation would “urge the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities”, including the Fitna Al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna Al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army).
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been high for the past two years over what Islamabad calls Kabul’s failure to curb cross-border terrorism. The situation escalated sharply on Oct 9 when Pakistan launched airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan, and reportedly sent fighter jets over Kabul after which explosions were heard.
The Taliban then launched attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11 in which at least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred. Pakistan’s counter-response left about 200 Taliban fighters dead, according to security officials.
The two sides afterwards agreed on a 48-hour ceasefire and to hold dialogue during that break. The ceasefire was later extended.
Friday night’s cross-border exchange, in which Pakistani forces targeted Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group positions across the border, briefly threatened to derail the Doha dialogue. However, both sides decided to proceed with the talks as planned.
 
 

The Afghan government spokesperson claimed that Pakistan had conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan hours after the ceasefire was extended on Friday for as long as the talks continued.
He claimed that the attacks targeted civilians. Afghanistan withdrew from the Twenty20 international tri-series in Pakistan next month following the alleged death of three local cricketers that the Afghanistan Cricket Board claimed were due to military strikes in Paktika.
Govt rebukes ICC
However, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistan has targeted verified camps of the “Khawarij-affiliated” Gul Bahadur group in the border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border.
In a post on X, the minister stated that during a 48-hour ceasefire, militants affiliated with the group and operating from Afghanistan attempted multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. He said all such attempts were effectively thwarted by the security forces. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan, he said.
In a later post, the minister said that Pakistan rejected the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) “selective, biased and premature comment that advances a disputed allegation, as established, that three ‘Afghan cricketers’ died in an ‘airstrike’. The ICC has cited no independent verification to substantiate these claims.”
“Pakistan strongly rejects the characterisation and contests the ICC’s claim and call for immediate correction,” he added. “Pakistan has consistently held that politics must not contaminate the sport, especially cricket, and urges the ICC to uphold its independence and the spirit of the game… Pakistan expects the ICC, led by its current Chair (Jay Shah), who happens to belong to India, to restore its neutrality, international standards of fair play and unbiased conduct.”
Amid the ongoing discussions, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim spoke separately with both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Afghan Prime Minister Muhammad Hasan Akhund, offering Malaysia’s assistance in mediating the conflict.

• Sets protocol on allegations, places limits on foreign invites
• Reviews 74 complaints; 70 closed, three to proceed
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Saturday approved far-reaching amendments to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges, barring them from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Munib Akhtar, while Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
 
 

Under a substituted Article V, judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
Judges are not to interact with the media, especially on issues liable to spark public debate or undermine institutional collegiality and discipline.
Where allegations are made public against a judge, the matter may be placed in writing before a committee comprising the CJP and four senior Supreme Court judges, through the registrar, for an institutional response. Judges may not publicly discuss judicial or administrative matters, nor disclose communications relating to personal or official affairs.
The council, acting on a decision first taken on July 12, deliberated on amendments proposed by the CJP. With some modifications, these were approved by the majority and ordered to be notified in the official gazette, circulated to all superior court judges and posted on the Supreme Court’s website.
The previous 2009 code had required judges to avoid publicity and political controversy, but did not contain the new media-interaction bar or response mechanism.
 
 

A new Article XII directs judges to abstain from presiding over or attending social, cultural and diplomatic functions.
Article XIII treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct; any such invitations received personally must be routed via the relevant chief justice. Article XIV bars judges from accepting dinners or receptions hosted in their honour by individual members of the bar.
Article XV says that judges must decide cases on merit alone, possess the moral integrity and intellectual capacity to resist internal or external influence, and, where legal powers are lacking, seek an immediate institutional response.
Judges must promptly inform, in writing, the CJP and the four most senior Supreme Court judges (via the registrar) of any such attempts; high court judges must also inform their respective chief justices.
High court chief justices are to place such reports before a three-judge committee within two days, with a decision due within a fortnight.
Matters sent for judicial determination are to be decided as early as possible by adhering to the principles of fair trial and due process. If a high court chief justice or committee fails to act within time, the CJP, with four senior Supreme Court judges, will take up the matter.
The code, originally framed by the SJC in 1962 and amended up to Oct 18, 2025, under Article 209 of the Constitution, is binding on all superior court judges.
Articles I to IV and VI to XI — covering personal conduct, recusals, financial dealings, extra-judicial roles, gifts, collegiality, timely judgements and fidelity to the constitutional oath — remain in place.
SJC on misconduct
Meanwhile, the SJC examined 67 complaints under Article 209 filed by different individuals, of which 65 were unanimously closed, one was deferred, and one was ordered to be processed further by the majority.
The council was later reconstituted under Article 209(3b) with the inclusion of Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah joining, after the Islamabad High Court chief justice expressed an inability to attend for certain agenda items.
The reconstituted council reviewed seven more complaints, closing five unanimously and deciding by majority to proceed further on two.
According to an informed source, the SJC deferred the complaint against Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri until Nov 20 and issued notice to another judge of the Islamabad High Court over allegations of delayed judgement.
After decisions on the 74 complaints taken up at Saturday’s sitting, 87 cases remain pending initial consideration. The SJC has dealt with 155 matters since October 2024.
