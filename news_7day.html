Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.







Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression.
“President Pezeshkian has ordered the opening of talks with the United States” on Iran’s nuclear programme, the Fars news agency reported on Monday, citing an unnamed government source.
The report was also carried by the government newspaper Iran and the reformist daily Shargh.
A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
‘Police the world’
Turkey has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”.
Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people. The economic troubles are back-breaking… The officials should do something tangible, not just talk.”
The protests were sparked in late December by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January.
Authorities have said the protests were “riots” inflamed by its arch-foes the United States and Israel, with Khamenei likening them to a “coup” attempt.
Ambassadors summoned
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.
Young Iranian Selina, who would not give her full name, travelled to Iraqi Kurdistan seeking some relief from “living in fear”.
“It’s not safe for us” in Iran, the 25-year-old told AFP.
“We don’t even dare to go out after 6:00 pm because soldiers are everywhere.”
The crackdown prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies.
The EU also issued fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, including the interior minister, a move echoed on Monday by Britain, which announced sanctions on 10 individuals over the “brutality against protesters”.
Baqaei said Monday the foreign ministry had summoned all the EU member state ambassadors in Tehran over the designation, and that other responses were to come.
Iranian state television also announced four foreigners had been arrested in Tehran for “participation in riots”, without specifying their nationalities.
Authorities have continued to announce arrests, with rights groups estimating at least 40,000 people have been detained over the protests.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/030917379fb62ed.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970792/pakistan-to-participate-in-us-critical-minerals-moot-seeks-strategic-partnerships-and-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to participate in US critical minerals moot, seeks strategic partnerships and investment</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is participating in the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial at the US Department of State on Wednesday, as Islamabad seeks to expand foreign investment and forge strategic partnerships in the minerals and energy sectors.
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik is representing Pakistan at the two-day conference, which is expected to bring together delegations from more than 50 countries to discuss strengthening and diversifying global supply chains for critical minerals—materials essential for advanced technologies, clean energy transitions and defence industries.
Hosting the meeting, the US State Department said the ministerial aims to “advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains” and to create momentum for international collaboration to secure resources “vital to technological innovation, economic strength, and national security”.
Opening remarks at the conference are scheduled to be delivered by US Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Global Supply Chains David Copley, and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg. Secretary Rubio is also due to hold a press availability with visiting delegations.
Pakistan plans to use the forum to highlight its largely untapped mineral potential, including reserves of copper, gold and rare earth elements. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation on the development and processing of critical minerals, reflecting what officials describe as expanding US–Pakistan engagement in this strategic area.
Minister Malik arrived in Washington on Sunday evening with a delegation of senior officials and technical experts who oversee Pakistan’s efforts to deepen foreign investment and international collaboration, particularly through enhanced engagement with friendly partners.
According to the State Department, “strengthening critical mineral supply chains with our international partners is vital to America’s economic and national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future.”
US officials say the discussions are expected to focus on supply-chain resilience, investment frameworks, and sustainable mining, processing and recycling capabilities.
The invitation list reflects a growing coalition of mineral-rich and industrial nations, including G7 members, India, South Korea, Australia and several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Kenya. The DRC, in particular, is expected to be represented at the highest level, with President Félix Tshisekedi attending alongside his mining minister.
For Pakistan, participation in the Washington gathering aligns with broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment, while avoiding entanglement in major-power rivalry over control of these resources.
Pakistan has invited both China and the US to the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF) 2026, scheduled for April 8–9 in Islamabad, aiming to secure investment for an estimated $6–8 billion in annual mineral export potential.
The forum will focus on copper, gold and rare earth minerals, with an emphasis on deepening China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)–related cooperation with Beijing, while also engaging other international partners.
Pakistan’s delegation is expected to remain in Washington through the end of the week to participate in related sessions and hold bilateral meetings with government and industry counterparts.</p><small>2026-02-03 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/030933239a737b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697/back-channel-talks-underway-after-pakistan-decide-to-skip-india-t20-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>‘Back-channel talks underway after Pakistan decide to skip India T20 World Cup clash’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The government of Pakistan’s decision on Sunday not to play its T20 World Cup group match against India, scheduled for Feb 15, has prom­pted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to initiate back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses, Dawn has learnt.
The decision was announced around 15 days ahead of the scheduled fixture, giving the ICC sufficient time to explore possible options, including accommodating any reservations Pakistan may have, sources said.
According to sources, a couple of other cricket boards have also stepped in to assist the ICC in its efforts to reach an amicable solution with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Pakistan announced its decision without citing a specific reason for boycotting the match against India. In the past, however, Australia and the West Indies forfeited their World Cup matches against Sri Lanka in 1996 on security grounds following instructions from their governments. England and New Zealand similarly forfeited matches against Zimbabwe and Kenya, respectively, during the 2003 World Cup on political grounds.
Some quarters have termed Pakistan’s move a mistake, noting that unlike previous instances involving other teams, no explicit justification was provided. Sources, however, said the PCB has factored this into its position and plans to rely on proceedings of the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in a case filed by Pakistan against India in 2018.
That case stemmed from India’s failure to honour a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the PCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2014, under which the two countries were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.
In return, the PCB had supported the ICC’s ‘Big Three’ revenue-sharing model, under which India, Australia and England received a larger share of ICC revenues.
“During the hearing, the PCB asked the BCCI to explain its refusal to tour Pakistan,” a sou­r­ce familiar with the 2018 proceedings said. “Initially, the BCCI stated that it was not obliged to provide a reason. Later, it claimed that the Indian government had not allowed the tour.”
When the PCB requested written instructions from the Indian government, the BCCI responded that such decisions were conveyed verbally and not documented, the source added.
Despite this, sources expressed concerns that, as in 2018, the BCCI influence within the ICC could again result in a ruling against Pakistan, potentially leading to financial penalties or sanctions. In such an event, the government of Pakistan may consider approaching an international court of arbitration, sources said.
It is believed that Pakistan’s decision was influenced by a recent ICC ruling involving Bangladesh. The ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to shift its World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka on security grounds and instead excluded Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing it with Scotland. The decision was passed by a 14-2 majority, with only Pakistan and Bangladesh voting against the move.
The India-Pakistan fixture is considered the most lucrative match in world cricket and a cornerstone of the ICC’s revenue model. Media reports estimate its overall commercial value at around $500 million, factoring in broadcast rights, advertising premiums, sponsorships, ticket sales and ancillary commercial activity. Advertising slots during an India-Pakistan T20 typically fetch between Rs2.5 million and Rs4 million for 10 seconds.
Following Pakistan’s announcement, the ICC issued a strongly worded statement, urging the PCB to “explore a mutually acceptable resolution which protects the interests of all stakeholders”.
“The ICC notes the statement made by the government of Pakistan regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026,” the statement said. “While the ICC awaits official communication from the PCB, selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event.”
“ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competition,” it added.
While acknowledging the role of governments in matters of national policy, the ICC warned that the decision was “not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan”.
There are reports that even if Pakistan maintains its stance, the Indian team will travel to Colombo for the scheduled match. If Pakistan do not field a team at the appointed time, India are expected to claim the points under tournament regulations.

On Aug 2, Iraq invaded the tiny emirate over a festering oil resource-sharing dispute. Saddam believed he had the approval of April Glaspie, the US ambassador in Baghdad. She had met him a week before the invasion. Controversy arose from reports that she told Hussein the US had “no opinion” on Arab-Arab conflicts, interpreted as a ‘green light’ to invade. She later defended her actions, claiming the transcript was misleading and she had warned against violence. In other words, Glaspie gave Saddam Hussein a go-ahead for conflict but without violence. Figure that out.
That year, a journalist friend requested some footage of the Muharram procession in my ancestral qasbah of Mustafabad about 100 kilometres from Lucknow. It so happened that Ashura in 1990 coincided in India with the Aug 2 invasion of Kuwait, the variation in date caused by a near routine difference of opinion among the clergy in the sighting of the new moon. I remember the date because the tension in the Middle East was a major discussion for radio addicts in Mustafabad. I took a friendly cameraman to film the Ashura procession replete with the tazias, zuljinah, horse depicting Imam Husain’s loyal and wounded steed, and a very high standard, the alam, held by a muscular adult and controlled by three others with the help of ropes. The cameraman found a perch on a balcony from where elite womenfolk usually got a clear view of the maatam. The practice involved copious bloodletting with self-flagellation. A sharp knife or qama was handed to willing adults to lacerate their scalps with turn by turn.
The cameraman was a genial Nair Hindu from Kerala. He was steeped in his work for a few short minutes. Then suddenly there was commotion in the balcony. The camera on the tripod was working, but the man was nowhere in sight. It turned out he had fainted, and some of the women were fanning him hard. I first thought it was the blazing sun and the humidity of August, which may have caused him to faint. But he had passed out, he told me later, after taking close-ups of the gushing blood that was mixed with rosewater by the procession’s monitors. The rosewater water is considered a healing agent.
Tatbir or ritual self-flagellation with blades has been officially banned in Iran since the mid-1990s by state authorities. While some Shias in India and Pakistan still practise this form of maatam, it is not common in Iran.

Perhaps Iran can still be wrecked as Donald Trump has threatened to do, but it’s difficult to see how.

Ayatollah Khomeini frowned on the qama zani or striking the head with swords and knives. His successor Ali Khamenei banned it, citing the harm it causes to the body and the negative image created by the practice. Mourning in Iran in memory of Imam Husain and his family focuses on emotional lamentation and seena zani or beating of the chest. The cameraman’s fear was writ large.
Iran’s detractors including Donald Trump or Benjamin Netanyahu would do well to understand this aspect of the faith. It’s practised in Iran by teeming followers of the revolution. Over the years and particularly in the early days of the revolution, Iran successfully endured major assaults from groups within the country largely due to its religious cohesion. The faux Marxist Mujahideen-i-Khalq (MEK) militants staged devastating attacks in the heart of Tehran without significantly denting the government’s hold on its supporters. They blew up prime minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar’s office killing him and president Mohammad Ali Rajai and several eminent members of the regime.

 

The closest MEK came to targeting the highest echelon of the revolution was their being linked to the assassination of Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti, Khomeini’s charismatic confidante and potential successor. They then exploded a bomb that crippled the current Supreme Leader’s right hand. All this was happening when Iran was fighting a bitter war with the US-backed army of Saddam Hussein over eight years. What threat can work against a culture that celebrates grief, annually, perpetually? Recent violence against the clerical regime spurred on by the US and Israel also leaned on the MEK, the communists turned CIA’s catspaw. Israel’s nearly successful attempt to decapitate Iran saw the country take the hit and bounce back to turn the tables on Israel. Perhaps the country can still be wrecked as Donald Trump has threatened to do, but it’s difficult to see how.
What Trump may benefit from knowing a little more laterally is the frequently doubted but steadily articulated Iranian doctrine against producing a nuclear weapon. There is indeed a conversation going on in the country about the merits of having or shunning nuclear weapons, but who are the interlocutors in case they are talking to each other, which they are probably not? The silent tiff has terrifying implications for the region, not least for Israel. A fatwa by Ayatollah Khamenei is cited as the basis for Iran forsaking nuclear weapons. In a religiously conservative country, who could challenge the Supreme Leader’s authority? One group does; the Hojjatiyeh, a traditionalist, largely conservative Shia lay organisation in Iran, founded in the 1950s by cleric Mahmoud Halabi.
Formed to target Bahais, the Hojjatiyeh believe in creating circumstances for the early return of Imam Mahdi. “Bia Bia Mahdi Bia, Ya Waaris-i-Khana-i-Khuda.” The chant implicitly beckons the early end of the world. Khomeini was wary of the group and got some vocal leaders arrested. A change of guard in Iran, something that Saddam Hussein attempted unsuccessfully, would only strengthen those that see themselves as destined for paradise as soon as a nuclear exchange is enabled. Which is neither good for the world nor the cameraman.

Published in Dawn, February 3rd, 2026</p><small>2026-02-03 04:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/69815afe5bbb2.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970772/the-day-after' target='_blank'><strong>The day after</strong></a><br><p>BALOCHISTAN witnessed a series of coordinated attacks on the weekend. Though details continue to be sketchy, a number of cities in the province were targeted, including Quetta, Gwadar and Noshki. It was reported that the attacks were repulsed and over 100 terrorists killed (the number continues to rise). Nonetheless the multiple events on Saturday morning have once again drawn attention to a conflict in our midst that everyone prefers to overlook.
Around a year ago, the province had experienced a similar spate of coordinated attacks in August 2024 on Akbar Bugti’s death anniversary. And for this reason for most of August 2025, there was a security clampdown in the province, with little to no internet coverage to prevent a repeat. The government ensured August passed quietly, only for January to turn explosive.
The attack had apparently begun much earlier than it was reported on the mainstream media, which is understandable at one level. The security organisations want to get the situation under control before it is reported so that the spread of misinformation and disinformation is limited. But in this day and age, the downside was that for a few hours, the information flow was dominated by the other side (on social media) while mainstream media in Pakistan kept running routine news of politicians and their speeches. The latter was of little interest to those who were busy scrolling on their phones.
The attacks have again set off a debate in which one side views the attacks as the desperate acts of externally supported militants who achieve very little eventually. On the other side is the view that such attacks show the weakening of the state’s writ and its ability to maintain normalcy in territory (which is different from losing it) and its ‘ability’ to win over the people.

The insurgency has been ongoing for 20 years now, the longest of any in Balochistan.

The province’s chief minister was on a talk show on Sunday evening where he argued that the attacks were an act of desperation because the terrorists had suffered considerable losses in the past year. He claimed that operations in the past year had eliminated around 1,000 of them and added that the total number of terrorists and facilitators was not more than 5,000 to 6,000. At a later stage, he said, according to a survey by the government, only two or three per cent of the ordinary people supported the militants.

 

He also described the insurgency as the swings of the pendulum and explained that appeasement in the near past had led to the terrorists becoming stronger; the appeasement was blamed on past civilian governments which did not support the military.
But the pendulum argument does not explain how this crisis will end — after all, this insurgency has been ongoing for 20 years now, the longest of any in Balochistan. And neither does it explain the increasing lethality of the attacks; most experts agree the militants are becoming more lethal and better trained with time. And neither does it throw light on their increasing success in recruiting educated, middle-class youth. Perhaps this is why the insurgency has continued for so long; instead of being led by individual tribal sardars, it is now being fuelled by a class which is proving more resilient. This educated class includes women some of whom are now seen as involved in the fighting as well.
These issues will need to be explored in more detail than simply focusing on the external support being provided. It is not enough to rejoice in the terrorists’ inability to hold on to territory but to ask why there is no normalcy in large swathes of the province, including its seat of government in Quetta. From one angle, instead of a pendulum swing, it might appear to be a steep decline.
Here, it is also important to address two more difficult questions. One is to ask how the imprisonment of women protesters, such as Mahrang Baloch, has helped with the security situation as it sends out the message that peaceful protests are not acceptable — leading many to conclude that for those who feel their voices are not being heard, violence is the only option.
Second, is the issue of genuine representation in the province, which is also inextricably linked to the popularity of women protesters. For there is a connection between the people of Balochistan opting for peaceful protests (and more) and the perceived unfairness of the elections in the province.
The widespread disillusionment with the electoral process has led many people to look at protests and violence as a means of influencing the state. And regardless of how legitimate or illegitimate the methods are seen to be, and the way to deal with them, it is essential that people be enticed back to the electoral process. And this is a problem that has become a widespread crisis of faith.
This was brought home last year when I was able to visit Quetta with the HRCP. It was evident that nearly every political party complained of unfair elections. From ethno-based political parties, which represented the Baloch as well as those which dominated the Pakhtun areas to the Hazaras, conversations with most of them were punctuated by the phrase ‘Form 45’. It is noteworthy that the representatives of the Hazaras did not speak of security but unfair elections. This is something that should worry us all; just as much as we fret about the interference of external forces and their support for terrorism. It is important the citizens of Balochistan need to be convinced of the options available to them in order to influence the state — and these options need to be more credible than simply holding a meaningless election.

The attacks in the province did not just occur in some far-flung corner of Balochistan; the terrorists managed to hit Quetta and Gwadar, indicating their reach and level of preparedness. The administration, therefore, needs to stay two steps ahead of violent actors not just in Balochistan, but across the country.
Security forces have managed to neutralise nearly 180 terrorists over the past two days in the province. While this may quell the immediate threat, in the long run better intelligence is needed to thwart violent elements before they can strike.
The year 2025 was exceptionally bloody where terrorist violence is concerned. As the military’s spokesman’s told a presser last month, there were nearly 5,400 terror incidents last year. This has resulted in the loss of over 1,200 security men and civilians, according to ISPR’s count.
In the first month of the current year, the signs do not look promising. As per the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, there were at least 87 terrorist attacks in January, up from 68 in December 2025, resulting in the martyrdom of at least 119 civilians and security personnel. And in keeping with past trends, the bulk of terrorist activity occurred in KP and Balochistan. Meanwhile, the US publication Foreign Affairs has said Pakistan could face more terrorist attacks originating from across the border in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
In light of these grim details, the state must act with alacrity. As many observers are pointing out, the Balochistan attacks signal a major security failure, and had LEAs not reacted in time, greater havoc could have been caused. The Balochistan chief minister highlighted the LEAs’ role while speaking on Sunday.

 

Whether it is Baloch terrorists backed by India, TTP terrorists supported by Kabul or any other terrorist group working to destabilise Pakistan, the state must shore up its defences to prevent more loss of innocent life. The ISPR head has said there were over 75,000 intelligence-based operations in 2025. The state — both its civilian and military arms — as well as counterterrorism experts, needs to examine the gaps that allowed such a large number of terrorist attacks last year despite such a high frequency of IBOs, and how violent actors continue to organise, as the Balochistan episode has shown.
Far too many security personnel have fallen fighting terrorists, while a large number of civilians have also been martyred. A revised and more effective CT policy is, therefore, needed to permanently quell the terrorist menace.

Talking to media persons here on Monday, Mr Reza said suspect Waseem Akhtar Sheikh had escaped with the gold belonging to his fellows of the same market.
He was later booked in multiple FIRs lodged by the victims with the Ichhra police besides his stepmother.
The DIG said the mystery of fraud involving gold worth hundreds of millions of rupees of the traders of Ichhra Sarafa (gold) Market has almost been resolved.
“The investigation police recovered from the nominated accused person 1,734 grams of gold,” Zeeshan Reza said.
A cash of more than Rs30 million was also recovered from him in addition to some vehicles.
After snatching gold from traders, the suspect had fled the market and gone underground in Islamabad.
“Before committing the [pre-planned] crime, the suspect had sold his house and all vehicles belonging to him and his family,” he said.
Immediately after registration of the FIR, different teams of the investigation police were tasked, said Reza.
“During the course of the investigation, we also ensured that the suspect does not flee abroad and is arrested as soon as possible”, said the DIG.
Investigation was carried out using modern technology and human intelligence from both aspects so that maximum recovery could be ensured.
To a question, he said some 20 cases were registered against the suspect at the respective police station so far.

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday frowned upon the tendency of approaching appellate courts by government departments in a mechanical way by filing frivolous petitions on settled principles.
In a six-page judgement on a tax matter, a three-member SC bench observed that the state is expected to act responsibly as a fair litigant and not as a compulsive appellant/petitioner and directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman to determine whether the questions of law sought to be agitated before the court has already stand settled by superior court judgements.
Authored by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, a member of the bench headed by Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, the judgement declared it imperative for the FBR chairman to consider constituting committees to vet each reference before filing it in a court of law.
To address the problem, according to the judgement, these committees should have the mandate to timely examine each case and function with the highest degree of independence. The committees may include a retired judge of the superior judiciary, an experienced tax practitioner and a senior serving or retired officer of the FBR with distinguished record and impeccable credentials.
The ruling came on an appeal of Assistant Commissioner, Inland Revenue Unit-III Zone-Cantt, Regional Tax Office, Rawalpindi, against the March 10, 2025 decision of the Lahore High Court (LHC) in favour of a private taxpayer.
The dispute originated when a notice was issued by the RTO, Rawalpindi, to one Umer Tariq Khan on Nov 15, 2023, alleging inadmissible input of Rs4 million tax. The order imposing the tax liability was passed on March 20, 2024, beyond the 120-day period stipulated under Section 11(5) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
The taxpayer challenged the order before the LHC, which while relying on an earlier precedent in Inland Revenue Commissioner vs. POF Welfare Packages SC judgements ruled that “time limit was mandatory”. The FBR then filed an appeal before the SC, which rejected it.
The SC judgement noted that government departments have tendency to file appeals/petitions mechanically, particularly when the outcome was foreseeable in light of settled law, but that had already been deprecated by the apex court in a number of judgements.

 

The bench made it clear that the courts possessed both constitutional authority and jurisprudential tools to address the problem of repeated appeals or petitions by government departments on settled questions of law. It explained the courts could dismiss such appeals/petitions in limine (rejecting pleas at a very initial stage even before issuing notice to respondents), sought identification of the officer for authorising the appeals/petitions, and even impose costs. With this explanation, the court emphasised on “internal accountability” by government departments and “careful legal scrutiny” before filing appeals/petitions.
“Had such scrutiny taken place before the filing of the instant petition, it would have been realised that the primary question of law sought to be agitated by the petitioners already stands authoritatively settled by a number of SC judgements,” the judgement explained.
‘Serious institutional harm’
When the government departments routinely file appeals/petitions, often up to the high courts and the SC on questions of law that have already been authoritatively settled, it noted, the practice results in “serious institutional harm” such as piling up of other cases with courts spending scarce judicial time revisiting the settled issues at the cost of undecided legal and constitutional questions, criminal appeals involving personal liberty, and civil disputes pending for years. This whole exercise undermines the constitutional mandate of speedy justice, it observed.
In the present petition, the department did not take the ground that the delay in passing of the ‘Order-in-Original’ was due to the frequent adjournments taken by the respondents. The department attempted to introduce this ground by filing an application wherein it was pleaded inter alia that the taxpayer had sought multiple adjournments from Nov 27, 2023 to Jan 4, 2024 in the proceedings before the assessment officer.
However, the department did not bother to file a copy of the order sheet of the proceedings before the assessment officer, the judgement regretted, adding this assertion of the department was belied before the high court.
When the state itself disregards binding precedents, it sends the wrong signals to subordinate courts, tribunals, and litigants. Such appeals/petitions result in unavoidable litigation costs, consumption of public funds for counsel, court fees and administrative processing, the judgement regretted.

The fact that neither answer is particularly clear invites a deeper concern, whether this dramatic gesture was fully thought through at all.
To begin with, let’s be clear on a few points. The ICC is controlled by India. It is a governing body that behaves like a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI. The ICC does not run international cricket, the BCCI — and therefore the Indian government — does. This is realpolitik. The rule of “might is right”. India is in charge, both as policymaker and paymaster, however you describe it.
India’s malign dictatorship of international cricket is to be condemned, just as the previous dominance of England and Australia had been condemned. Today, India is the Pied Piper of cricket, playing a seductive tune that brings the rats of the world’s cricket boards under its control. Something does need to be done, namely ICC’s power and independence must be restored. But is this what Pakistan’s unilateral boycott will achieve?
India has a political dispute with Pakistan, which it chooses to operationalise by “boycotting” bilateral series with Pakistan and refusing to set foot in the country. No other nation would be allowed to behave in this despotic manner. We’ve just seen what has happened to Bangladesh. Despotic rule is hypocritical. It is self-serving, and it is brutish.

India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole where its money and friends should be

The next tier of cricket nations, when it comes to financial might, England and Australia, are reliant on India for their revenues. They have sold their integrity and independence for Indian rupees. The remaining countries are too weak and irrelevant when it comes to tackling the excesses of India’s cricketing hegemony.
The same applies to the corporations and the broadcasters who invest in cricket. Without India’s billion-plus population, they don’t have a big enough market.
In the world of cricket commerce, India’s gravitational pull is too great. Fans might care about some of these hypocrisies and inequalities, but the global audience doesn’t care enough about whether Bangladesh is expelled or Pakistan boycotts.
There is, of course, value in a Pakistan-India contest in a major tournament, otherwise why else would it be a manufactured feature of every single major competition. The match is a money spinner; it is good for India’s coffers. And given the fact that Pakistan seems unable to compete on these occasions, it is a perfect morale booster for the Indian nation, with profit built in.
Therefore, Pakistan’s boycott of the India match will hurt India a little. India will feel the pinch in its pocket, and so too will the other ICC members. But that pinch will only be a pinch. India will pocket the points instead and move closer to the next round of the tournament. Pakistan will lose valuable revenue and the points. Would Bangladesh have done the same for Pakistan? It hasn’t in the past.

 

Indeed, considering the long history of India’s unfair sidelining of Pakistan, we know other nations have not and would not do the same for Pakistan. Pakistan is now a middle nation, at best, in the world of international cricket. It does not have financial muscle and it is not good enough on the field to pull other nations to its side. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole in its pocket where its money and its friends should be.
In the language of Donald Trump, Pakistan has no cards. All this leaves Pakistan in a mess. It cannot genuinely hope to achieve anything meaningful as a result of its boycott. The deck is stacked against Pakistan.
Principle, then, is all that Pakistan has left. But what is the principle here? If the principle is taking a stand in support of Bangladesh, then it is an empty gesture, admittedly a noisy one.
If the principle is to protest India’s long history of mistreatment of Pakistan, the mistreatment will continue. If the principle is to protest India’s unconstitutional rule of international cricket, the cause is just but the means of protest amateurish.
What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip.
But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field.
It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India.
Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking.

AIN QANA: Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike targeted a building in this southern Lebanese village, violating a truce.—AFP

BEIRUT: One person was killed and eight others were injured on Monday as the Israeli military conducted strikes on multiple locations in southern Lebanon, targeting civilian areas in two villages.
Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war between Israel and the group, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon and has maintained troops in five areas it deems strategic.
Justifying the destruction, the Israeli military claimed that it was targeting “weapons storage facilities”. It further attempted to legitimise the bombing of residential neighbourhoods by reciting its standard claims, saying fighters hiding among “civilian infrastructure”.
The Israeli army had previously sent evacuation warnings for the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Ain Qana in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported strikes on the targeted buildings in both towns.
Earlier on Monday, the Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli strike on Ansariyeh in southern Lebanon killed one person and wounded four others.
Another strike on Qleileh, elsewhere in the south, also wounded four people, according to the ministry.
The NNA reported Israeli strikes on vehicles near both areas, which came without warning. Lebanon has repeatedly protested Israeli strikes on Lebanon as violations of the ceasefire. More than 360 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire.

Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir exchanges views with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar.—PPI

ISLAMABAD: Weeks after signing a more than $4 billion arms deal, Pakistan’s armed forces and Libya’s eastern military on Monday pledged to continue their engagement and collaboration.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The ISPR said Field Marshal Khalifa Abu al-Qasim Haftar, commander in chief of the armed forces of eastern part of Libya, called on Field Marshal Asim Munir, chief of army staff and chief of defence forces, at the General Headquarters. Mr Haftar was accompanied by Osama Saad Hammad, prime minister of Libya’s eastern-based parallel government.
The statement said the discussions underscored the importance of continued engagement and collaboration between the two armed forces, with Field Marshal Munir reaffirming Pakistan’s support for peace, stability and institutional development in Libya.

Field Marshal Munir, Khalifa Haftar discuss regional security dynamics, military cooperation

Mr Haftar’s visit to Pakistan comes roughly six weeks after Islamabad and Libya’s eastern military finalised a major defence agreement during Field Marshal Munir’s visit to Benghazi in December. The deal, signed with Saddam Haftar, Khalifa Haftar’s son and deputy, is valued at over $4bn and is among Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons export agreements.
Under the agreement, Pakis­tan is to supply 16 JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter jets, co-developed with China, along with 12 Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft and other unspecified equipment for air, land and naval forces.
The deal also includes provisions for training, capacity building and potential joint manufacturing, with deliveries expected over the next two and a half years.
Analysts see the reciprocal visit as a signal of follow-through on the December pact for translating the agreement into concrete timelines for deliveries, training and broader military cooperation.
It also projects the relationship between the two sides as a long term strategic partnership rather than a one-off commercial transaction.
If fully implemented, the sale would represent the first export of JF-17 fighter jets to an Arab country, placing Pakistan more firmly within Libya’s eastern military orbit and signalling Islamabad’s intent to expand its defence footprint despite international sensitivities surrounding Libya’s prolonged conflict.

ISLAMABAD: As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the lower house of parliament exhibited rare unity on Monday in condemning the deadly terror attacks in Balochistan, with varying opinions on the way of tackling the menace, Def­e­nce Minister Khawaja Asif asserted that backwardness of any area was no justification to stand against the state.
Suggestions came from across the aisles that instead of a mere debate on the grave issue of terrorism, the government should take decisive action to eliminate terrorists with full force so that the life of a common man could be safeguarded.
However, when proceedings concluded, only 10 members were sitting in the house, indicating the seriousness of lawmakers in addressing one of the biggest challenges confronting Pakistan.
Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who was presiding over the NA session, earlier suspended its agenda and confined its proceedings to the issue of fresh terror attacks in Balochistan.
In his speech on the floor of the house, the defence minister said a total of 177 terrorists were killed within a few days following the deadly attacks in Balochistan that claimed the lives of 10 policemen, one Levies man, six FC personnel and as many as 33 civilians.
The defence minister warned that political polarisation and fragmented national narratives were undermining Pakistan’s fight against terrorism, cautioning that internal divisions only served the interests of militant groups and hostile foreign actors.
He said the country continued to pay a heavy price for past policy decisions, particularly those linked to regional conflicts, adding that the burden of those choices was being borne by civilians and security personnel rather than by those who had made the decisions decades ago.
He urged parliamentarians to demonstrate unity on matters of national security, saying a divided political discourse weakened public confidence and emboldened hostile forces.
Highlighting the human cost of terrorism, the defence minister said civilians in affected areas faced daily threats, while members of the armed forces continued to make sacrifices to safeguard national security.
He ruled out the narrative of disparity and backwardness in Balochistan, saying that banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which he described as India-sponsored, exploited this narrative to gain the sympathy of Baloch youth.
While presenting a comparison between the current situation and that at the time of independence in 1947, he said, “In 1947, there were only 114 schools in Balochistan, whereas today there are 1,596. There was no university in the province at that time, but now there are 12 universities.
Today, Balochistan has five medical colleges, 145 other colleges, 13 cadet colleges, 21 technical institutions, 13 hospitals, 18 teaching hospitals, 23 district headquarters hospitals, 756 basic health units, 841 dispensaries, four cardiac centres and 24 dialysis centres,” he added.
But Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai rejected the claims and figures presented by the defence minister, saying Mr Asif had no understanding of the situation in the province.
He said the unjust distribution of resources had created a sense of deprivation among the people, which fuelled terrorism. “The first right over resources rests with the people of the areas from where those resources are extracted. We can overcome terrorism in a short time by giving due rights to the people,” he added.
An ‘inhuman’ act
Mr Achakzai, however, condemned the attacks and said the killing of innocent labourers, teachers and people from other provinces in Balochistan was an inhuman act and could not be justified.
He urged the National Assembly speaker to hold a marathon session on terrorism lasting two days and to allow all members to speak on the issue.

 

Tracing the history of Balochistan since the British Raj, the opposition leader claimed that the Pashtun population was equal to the Baloch population in the province.
When Mr Achakzai held the country’s intelligence agencies responsible for failing to prevent the attacks, Speaker Sadiq commended the role of the security forces and intelligence agencies and urged the defence minister to provide details of how many terrorist attacks had been thwarted in the recent past.
A critical moment
Taking part in the debate, senior PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf said political disagreements were a part of democratic life, but should not overshadow issues of terrorism, national integrity and security.
He cautioned against targeting national institutions for political gain, saying such actions damaged morale and could be exploited by hostile neighbours. He warned that political infighting and confrontational narratives were weakening the country at a critical moment.
Referring to the sacrifices of soldiers deployed along the borders and in terrorism-affected areas, the PPP lawmaker said any impression that their sacrifices were being undermined could have serious consequences for national resolve. He urged all political parties, including the opposition parties, to rise above partisan interests and present a united front on matters of national security.
The PPP leader called for comprehensive parliamentary engagement on security challenges, proposing that the House hold full debates and form committees to examine the situation and present concrete recommendations.
He stressed that Balochistan’s stability must remain a national priority and should be addressed through consensus rather than political confrontation.
The debate was held following the adoption of a motion to discuss the prevailing law and order situation in the country.
During their speeches, Mehmood Achakzai and Barrister Gohar demanded the release of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and called for him to be allowed to meet his doctors and family particularly in light of reports that he was suffering from ‘a serious medical condition’.

In absolute terms, export proceeds reached $3.061 billion in January, up from $2.951bn in the corresponding month of last year, reflecting an increase of 3.73 per cent, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said on Monday. On a month-on-month basis, export proceeds grew by 34.96pc in January.
Negative growth in exports has continued since August of the current fiscal year, barring July, when proceeds grew 16.43pc year on year. Export earnings posted negative growth, with proceeds declining by 20.41pc in December.

 

This follows a 14.54pc drop in November, 4.46pc in October, 3.88pc in September, and 12.49pc in August, reflecting persistent pressures on the country’s external trade performance. In the first seven months (July-January), export proceeds recorded negative growth of 7.09pc to $18.195bn compared with $19.583bn in the corresponding period last year.

Trade gap widens 28.22pc to $22.038bn in July-January FY26

The government has recently announced several measures, including a reduction in the energy rates and others, to minimise pressure on the country’s trade performance. Last week, the prime minister announced a decrease of Rs4.4 per unit in the electricity tariff for the industrial sector, in a bid to improve productivity and exports. He also announced a reduction in wheeling charges for industries, stating that “it will be less than Rs9 per unit.” He hoped that the move would help “industries sell their power to neighbouring industries”.
To provide additional relief, the premier said that “with the cooperation and support of Pakistan’s banks, we are announcing a reduction in the export refinance rate from earlier 7.5pc to 4.5pc”.
Currently, the exporters are grappling with subdued global markets and the high cost of doing business in the country. The textile exporters have already complained about contractions owing to the high cost of doing business. In FY25, export proceeds rose 4.67pc to $32.106bn against $30.675bn in the preceding year.
Trade deficit
According to the PBS data, imports fell 1.4apc to $5.786bn in January from $5.904bn over the corresponding month of last year. Month-on-month, imports decreased 4.85pc.
In the first seven months of 2025-26, the import bill grew by 9.42pc to $40.233bn, up from $36.771bn in the corresponding period last year. The import rose 6.57pc to $58.38bn in July-January FY25 from $54.78bn over the previous year.
The trade deficit narrowed 6.61pc to $2.725bn in January from $2.918bn over the corresponding month of last year. The trade deficit swelled 28.22pc to $22.038bn in July-January 2025-26, up from $17.188bn over the corresponding period last year. The trade deficit for FY25 widened by 9pc to $26.27bn, up from $24.11bn in the preceding year.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Uzbekistan resolved on Monday to expand the scope of their Preferential Trade Agreement to increase their trade beyond $2 billion in two years — from around $450 million last year —and to deepen cooperation in various economic fields.
At a meeting of the Pak-Uzbek Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), the two sides agreed to more than double the list of items for bilateral trade from 17 at present. The two sides had signed the agreement in March 2022 and it came into effect in 2023.
The 10th IGC on Trade, Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation was co-chaired by Haroon Akhtar Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Industries and Production, and Uzbe­kistan’s Trade Minister Laziz Kudratov.
“The engagement enabled a comprehensive review of bilateral relations and established a forward-looking roadmap to strengthen joint efforts in major economic and social sectors”, a joint statement said.
The parties welcomed the progress on Phase II concessions of the Preferential Trade Agreement, the statement added.
The two sides “agreed to expedite institutional mechanisms to achieve the agreed target of $2bn in bilateral trade”.
Both sides expressed satisfaction over the steady progress achieved since the previous IGC session last year and reaffirmed their resolve to expand bilateral trade, investment, and economic engagement.
Emphasis was placed on trade facilitation, improved logistics, customs digitalisation, transit trade cooperation, development of regional trade corridors, and enhanced business-to-business engagement, supported by impro­ved visa facilitation for business communities.
The two sides also agreed to establish a joint working group on labour relations, tasked with addressing labour mobility, skills development, workplace safety, and practical considerations linked to employment visas.
Transport and communications
In transport and communications sector, the commission welcomed interest in launching direct air services, reviewed progress on regional railway and connectivity projects, and agreed to advance alternative transport corridors to improve regional trade and transit connectivity.
Cooperation in agriculture and food security featured prominently, with both sides welcoming progress on phytosanitary protocols facilitating the export of fruits from Uzbekistan to Pakistan.
The parties agreed to expand collaboration through additional protocols, joint working groups, and technical cooperation in plant protection, livestock development, and agricultural research, with a shared focus on food security and sustainable agricultural growth.
In higher education, science, and technology, the commission welcomed progress on academic and research partnerships between leading institutions of the two countries.
Both sides agreed to promote joint research, faculty and student exchanges, vocational and technical training, innovation, and capacity building, supported by newly signed agreements in scientific, technical, and innovation fields to strengthen long-term knowledge cooperation and human capital development.
Environmental and climate cooperation was recognised as a shared priority, with both sides agreeing to collaborate on climate resilience, protection of glacial ecosystems, sustainable water management, environmental governance, gender-inclusive climate action, and comm­unity-based adaptation approaches.

A highly-placed source confirmed to Dawn that the government has given approval to change the Punjab police high command.
The source said that a summary has been submitted to the prime minister for final approval.
It added that Anwar’s posting as the FIA DG was likely on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, reports suggested that the provincial government has prepared a panel of three candidates for the role of the Punjab police chief.
Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana, Punjab Counter Terrorism Department Additional Inspector General Wasim Sial and Special Branch Additional Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem are among those under consideration.
As per reports, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed is also in the race.
Dr Anwar was appointed Punjab IG during a large reshuffle by the Punjab caretaker government in January 2023. He was performing his duties with the National Highways and Motorway Police before being appointed Punjab’s police chief.
He was posted at the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department while he served as the Faisalabad senior superintendent of police (operations) and the Rawalpindi chief traffic officer.
Dr Anwar also performed duties in the Prime Minister’s Office in Islamabad.

The two leaders met at the PM House in Islamabad. During the meeting, which CM Afridi said was held at the premier’s invitation, the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism.
According to a statement reported by state broadcaster PTV News, the prime minister stressed the need for cooperation between the Centre and the provincial government for the progress and prosperity of KP’s people.
“Close and effective communication between the Centre and the provinces is indispensable for national progress and public service,” the premier was quoted as saying.
PM Shehbaz assured CM Afridi of the Centre’s cooperation as per its jurisdiction for KP’s development projects, infrastructure improvement, education, health and job opportunities.







The prime minister termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”.
“There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to counter terrorism.
Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, PM Shehbaz said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare.
“The provincial government is empowered. Steps should be taken for the health and education of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s people. The federal government has always been striving for the betterment of the KP’s people,” he was quoted as saying.
Noting that KP was an “important unit” of the federation, PM Shehbaz assured CM Afridi that the Centre would “continue its full efforts in accordance with its jurisdiction” for the public’s prosperity.
Highlighting that the federal government was determined to work with all provinces, the prime minister said, “The targets of national unity, stability and prosperity can be achieved effectively through mutual consultation and collaboration.”
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam were also present during the meeting.
Pending funds among other issues discussed: KP CM
Speaking to the media after their interaction, CM Afridi termed the meeting a “demand of his role”.
Noting that the premier had invited him, the chief minister said he expressed his condolences over the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan and condemned the terrorist act.
“We have always condemned terrorism wherever it has taken place and we will also condemn it in the future,” he asserted.
Asked about a “clarity” in his condemnation of the Balochistan attacks, the KP CM affirmed he had always had that clarity.
“Terrorism has no province or country or religion, and whoever carries out terrorism, we all should condemn it as a Pakistani,” he said.
“Issues concerning our province — whether it is the NFC (National Finance Commission), the CRBC (Chashma Right Bank Canal), NHP (Net Hydel Profit payments) or our other pending funds due on the Centre — were discussed,” Afridi said.

 

He further said that a “joint course of action” to combat terrorism was also discussed.
The PTI leader said no discussions were held regarding him being denied meetings with party founder Imran Khan, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
“There were no talks on anything political,” he said.
The chief minister asserted that the KP government had provided Rs26bn from its fund in the merged districts under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP).
Afridi said PM Shehbaz issued directives to Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal to meet Adviser to the KP CM on Finance Muzzammil Aslam later on Monday and make “every possible effort to solve these issues”.
“After this, two to three more meetings will be held,” the PTI leader said, adding that “one to two” meetings would be convened on counter-terrorism as well. “When decisions will be taken, they will be made public to you.”



“Perhaps as a political worker, I would never have sat there. But I deemed it appropriate for my people and my province, where the conditions are getting serious — whether financially or due to decisions made in closed rooms,” he said, adding that the meeting was necessary.
Asked whether the issue of displacement in Tirah or the Rs4bn corruption allegations made against his government were discussed, the KP CM alleged that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had issued a “charge-sheet” against the federal government for corruption to the tune of Rs5,300 billion, referring to its report issued in November.
“Rs4bn is a small amount. They are nothing compared to the sacrifices that my people in Tirah, Kurram and Bajaur are giving,” the chief minister said, adding that objecting to that amount was akin to “dismissing those sacrifices”.
In a post on X shortly after 12pm, PTI’s North Punjab chapter confirmed that CM Afridi had reached the PM House.







Excellent coordination needed between Centre, KP: Muqam
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Muqam welcomed the meeting. “Better late than never,” he quipped.
Noting that the KP CM was also invited previously but he did not come, the minister underscored the need for “excellent coordination” between the Centre and the province.
According to Muqam, it was agreed during the meeting that such communication should be maintained. He further said the point that “speaking against institutions was not right” was also brought up.
Pointing out that the people of KP were badly affected by terrorism, he called for politics to be kept aside and a “collective stance” adopted against militancy.
On CM Afridi’s complaints regarding pending funds, the minister said the federal government had paid all such amounts but if there were differences, they should be sorted out through talks.
Muqam further said it was agreed that there should be consensus between the Centre and KP. The minister also said no political matter, including Imran, was discussed.



Sanaullah divulges details of meeting
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that the meeting between the premier and CM Afridi was held in a “good manner”.
“PM Shehbaz gave Sohail Afridi a very warm welcome,” he said, saying: “Both sides reviewed and exchanged views on law and order, terrorism, and the counter-terrorism department (CTD) in KP.”
According to Sanaullah, PM Shehbaz said that civil law enforcement agencies must play an equal part with the armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
“CM Afridi assured that the provincial government will play its role in the fight against terrorism, and shared his plans for expanding CTD and funds approved for it,” he added.
Sanaullah said that PM Shehbaz responded to some of CM Afridi’s questions regarding the funds for his province and then directed Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal to sit with chief minister’s team and resolve the matter.
“PM Shehbaz said the amount agreed between both teams will be immediately transferred,” Sanaullah said.
According to Sanaullah, PM Shehbaz had made it clear at the beginning of the meeting that they were sitting for Pakistan and their constitutional roles, setting political affairs aside.
“CM Afridi didn’t request a meeting with Imran Khan, nor did he ask for anything else, which was a good gesture,” he said.
KP CM’s attitude must change: Tallal Chaudhry
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that the meeting between the prime minister and CM Afridi should have happened before.
He emphasised that without coordination between the Centre and a province, the people of that province suffer.
“Better late than never,” Chaudhry remarked, adding: “It was good that they (PM Shehbaz and CM Afridi) met.”
Asked whether the KP CM’s attitude towards the Centre should change, the minister replied in the affirmative.
“It should, otherwise the people of his province would grab his collar. In 13 years of your government in the province, what have you given them? Slogans, songs? Nothing else,“ he remarked.
Responding to another query, the state minister said the National Assembly speaker’s office was open for talks, and a special committee formed for that purpose was also present.
He noted that the opposition had previously abandoned the talks one-sidedly.
When asked about the possibility of allowing Imran — who recently underwent a procedure for an eye ailment — to travel abroad for medical treatment, Chaudhry denied the need for it, saying the PTI founder was “absolutely fine”.
‘Outstanding dues’
Since becoming the chief minister in October last year, CM Afridi has repeatedly accused the federal government of stalling the release of funds allocated for KP.
The meeting comes a week after the KP CM wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz over what he dubbed the Centre’s “persistent failure” to release “constitutionally guaranteed” funds allocated for KP, particularly those committed for the merged districts under the NFC.
Contending that the lack of funds had “now translated into an acute fiscal and governance crisis for the province”, Afridi had demanded the “full and unconditional” release of all outstanding federal dues.
The KP CM maintained that his province was entitled to receive Rs658.4 billion under the NFC, but it had received just Rs604bn so far, leading to a shortfall of Rs54.4bn.
Addressing a jirga in Khyber on Sunday, the chief minister had said he was set to meet the premier in Islamabad on Monday to “plead the case of KP’s rights and secure our outstanding dues”.
PTI views meeting positively
Further, PTI’s joint parliamentary committee expressed the hope that the meeting between PM Shehbaz and CM Afridi would resolve issues faced by KP.
The committee held a meeting on Monday, attended by KP CM Afridi, PTI leader Amir Dogar, PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, and party leaders Asad Qaiser and Junaid Akbar, among others.
The meeting discussed the country’s overall political, security, and provincial situation and urged the federal government to immediately release all outstanding dues to KP, particularly under the NFC award, to enable practical solutions to the problems faced by the people of the province.
It also emphasised that the federation must fulfil its constitutional responsibilities in that regard.
The participants also condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan and extended their heartfelt condolences and solidarity to the families of the martyrs.
The committee expressed concerns over reports about the health of PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan, which caused widespread anxiety among people across the country.
It was demanded that Imran be given immediate and unhindered access to his personal physicians and that meetings with him be restored without delay.
Additionally, the meeting endorsed the decisions of the KP jirga and called upon all relevant institutions to play an active role in establishing sustainable peace in the tribal districts and ensuring the effective resolution of public issues.
Moreover, to ensure the effectiveness of the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike scheduled for February 8, the meeting decided to further intensify the street movement.
The committee reiterated that the public mandate was stolen during the general election on February 8, 2024, and that people across the country will close their businesses and record their protest.
They also condemned the arrests of party workers and raids on their homes in Sindh and Punjab, stating that such tactics were a blatant violation of democracy, the Constitution and fundamental human rights, deeming them unacceptable.

In a post on social media platform Truth Social, the US president said that he and the Indian premier spoke about “many things”, including trade and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
Trump added that “out of friendship and respect” for Modi, the US would lower its reciprocal tariff rate from 25 per cent to 18pc, while India would reduce tariffs on US goods to zero.
“He (Modi) agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,” Trump wrote, adding that this would “end the war” between Russia and Ukraine.







The US president, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends, and a powerful and respected leader of his country”, said that he agreed to “buy American” at a much higher level.
Trump added that India would buy, “over $500 billion of US energy, technology, agricultural, coal, and many other products”.
Later, Modi took to X to hail the discussion and express his happiness with the reduced tariffs.
“Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,” he wrote.
“When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,” Modi said.
The Indian prime minister called Trump’s leadership is “vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity”, adding that New Delhi fully supports his efforts.
“I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” Modi said.







The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country’s leader Nicolas Maduro in a military operation in January.
Trump hit India, the world’s most populous nation, with 25pc reciprocal levies during his waves of “Liberation Day” tariffs last year. He then stacked another 25pc on top of that over India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January 2025, but that has not stopped difficult trade negotiations over the past year.
Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.</p><small>2026-02-02 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022246219bb9e48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970620/nuclear-talks-between-us-and-iran-slated-for-friday-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Nuclear talks between US and Iran slated for Friday: officials</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkiye, Iranian and US officials told Reuters on Monday, while a regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would participate.
US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.
Turkiye and other regional allies have sought de-escalation.
“Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt, as well as some other countries, will attend the Istanbul meeting. There will be bilateral, trilateral and other meetings,” the diplomat said.
Earlier today, the Iranian news agency Fars reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington.
“President Pezeshkian has ordered the initiation of nuclear negotiations with the United States,” the agency reported, citing an unnamed government source.
“The source said Iran and the US will hold talks strictly within the framework of the nuclear issue,” Fars added.
The report was also carried by the government newspaper Iran and the reformist daily Shargh.
Iran said it was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
“Several points have been addressed and we are examining and finalising the details of each stage in the diplomatic process, which we hope to conclude in the coming days,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said, without giving details on the content of any negotiations.
US Naval buildup near Iran
Tensions are running high amid a US naval buildup near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.
US President Donald Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast.
He said last week Iran was “seriously talking”, while Tehran’s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were underway.
Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.
Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.
Preparations for potential US-Iran talks
Baqaei said Tehran was considering “the various dimensions and aspects of the talks”, adding that “time is of the essence for Iran as it wants the lifting of unjust sanctions sooner”.
A Turkish ruling party official told Reuters that Tehran and Washington had agreed to re-focus on diplomacy and possible talks this week, in a potential reprieve for potential US strikes.
Witkoff was expected to visit Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s military chief, two senior Israeli officials said separately on Monday.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was in Turkiye last week and held further calls with his Egyptian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts, he said on Telegram.
“President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” Araghchi told CNN on Sunday. “Of course, in return, we expect sanctions lifting. So, that deal is possible. Let’s not talk about impossible things.”
Baqaei said the rallying of neighbouring states around a diplomatic solution demonstrated a fear that any US attack would drag the region into conflict, echoing Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who warned on Sunday that a US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
‘Ball in Trump’s court’
The Iranian official said, “Diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution”.
However, he added, for the start of talks, Tehran wanted US military assets moved away from Iran.
“Now the ball is in Trump’s court,” he said.
Satellite imagery shows repair work at Iranian sites
Tehran’s regional sway has been weakened by Israel’s attacks on Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq, as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
In June last year, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings.
No other rebuilding was visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.
Washington-based think tank Institute for Science and International Security said satellite images from late January showed construction work on tunnel entrances at Isfahan that could “indicate a preparation for additional military strikes”, as was seen ahead of last year’s US raid.
It could also signal the movement of assets from other facilities, it added.
Nuclear talks standoff
After five rounds of talks that have stalled since May 2023, several hard-to-bridge issues remained between Tehran and Washington, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.
The UN nuclear watchdog has called on Iran repeatedly to say what happened to the highly enriched uranium stock since the June attacks.
Western countries fear Iran’s uranium enrichment could yield material for a warhead. Iran says its nuclear programme is only for electricity generation and other civilian uses.
The Iranian sources said Tehran could ship its highly enriched uranium abroad and pause enrichment in a deal that should also include the lifting of economic sanctions.
Ambassadors summoned
The supreme leader also likened the recent protests to a “coup” attempt.
Authorities have said the protests, which were sparked by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January, were “riots” inflamed by its arch foes, the United States and Israel.
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday, the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022225254e9bb08.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970639/son-of-gangster-rehman-dakait-arrested-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Son of gangster Rehman Dakait arrested in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The son of slain Lyari gangster Abdul Rehman alias Rehman Dakait was arrested in Karachi, police said on Monday.
“Kalakot police have apprehended Jibran s/o Abdul Rehman alias Rehman Dakait and recovered one illegal pistol from his custody,” a statement by police said.
The statement added that the suspect held was a “habitual criminal” who had been arrested and sent to prison in several cases in the past.
There were two First Information Reports (FIRs) against him registered at Lyari’s Kalakot police station between the years 2023 and 2024.
Rehman Dakait was killed in 2009 by Karachi police, along with three of his accomplices.
He was reportedly involved in more than 80 criminal cases and was a central figure in the gang wars of Lyari — one of the most populous and oldest localities of Karachi.
In 2024, another one of his sons was shot dead in an alleged encounter in Karachi.
According to the police, he was organising a gang of criminals in Lyari. Police also said he was previously involved in drug trafficking and kidnapping for ransom cases.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022158074131096.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970637/4-punjab-districts-allowed-to-manufacture-kite-flying-material-to-meet-basant-demand' target='_blank'><strong>4 Punjab districts allowed to manufacture kite-flying material to meet Basant demand</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday gave approval for the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material in four more districts of the province owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of these commodities ahead of the much-anticipated Basant festival in Lahore.
Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, albeit under tight curbs, following the Punjab government’s move to lift the ban on the festival after a hiatus of 18 years. Celebrations, however, will remain restricted to the provincial capital, which until now was the only district where the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material was allowed.
According to a February 1 letter by the Punjab Home Department to deputy commissioners (DC) concerned, the provincial cabinet has given approval for manufacturing the kite-flying material in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura as well.
The letter, seen by Dawn, said that the manufacturers should register themselves with the relevant DCs and through the Punjab government’s e-Biz digital portal and manufacture only “permissible kite-flying material”.
According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying on Basant whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
Under the code of conduct, the sizes for a 1.5 Tawa Gudda (width 40 inches, length 34 inches) and a 4.5 Guddi Kite (width 35 inches, length 30 inches) have been fixed, and the manufacturing or flying of kites larger than these will not be permitted at all.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
The Home Department’s letter also said that registered manufacturers in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura should only sell their products to sellers and traders registered with the Lahore DC “for use in the district of Lahore on Feb 6, 7 and 8, 2026 […] and not in any other district”.
“Sale of permissible kite-flying material by registered manufacturers of these four districts to any person or entity, other than the registered traders and sellers in Lahore, shall be strictly prohibited,” the letter read.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told Dawn that the provincial cabinet gave the approval in light of soaring prices and to bridge the demand-supply gap.
In addition to manufacturing, traders and sellers in Lahore had also been allowed to procure “permissible” kite flying material from other provinces, he further said, adding that material was already being procured from Peshawar, Haripur and Abbottabad.
The traders and sellers, however, are required to get permission from the Lahore DC to procure these items from other provinces.
In a post on X, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said every pinna (twine ball) would be QR-coded, “allowing it to be tracked from the manufacturer to the seller, and ultimately to the buyer”.
“All manufacturers are registered with the government and are fully compliant with approved safety regulations and specifications. In view of the increased demand for kites and strings, supplies from outside Punjab have been permitted strictly for products that meet the prescribed safety standards,” she said.







Ban around Lahore Airport
Qazi also told Dawn that the provincial cabinet had approved the exclusion of several areas, identified by the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA), from kite-flying during Basant.
He added that the Lahore DC would notify Section 144 for those areas under Section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Act 2025.
The PAA had written a letter to the Punjab additional chief secretary last month, requesting that a complete ban on kite-flying be imposed in certain areas during Basant for the safety of flight operations.
The PAA had requested that the Nadrabad, Gulshan Ali Colony, Nishat, Bhatta Chowk and DHA’s R, S, P and Q blocks be declared no kite-flying zones, as they fall in the aircraft approach path at the Allama Iqbal International Airport.
Similarly, the PAA had sought a ban on kite-flying in Al-Faisal Town, Joray Pul, Canal Bank Road and Tajpura, located along the aircraft take-off path.
The PAA further requested, “Impose Section 144 in the identified areas to ban kite flying on the rooftops of houses, as kites and kite-strings can be ingested into aircraft engines or strike critical aircraft surfaces, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences”.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02210530dae9437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970635/fire-at-mobile-market-in-karachis-saddar-brought-under-control' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at mobile market in Karachi’s Saddar brought under control</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A large fire that erupted on Monday evening at Saddar’s mobile market was brought under control, according to police and rescue officials.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the fire broke out on the 7th floor parking of the Al Najeeb mobile market at around 07:45pm.
He said the fire had erupted in a parking area located on the 7th floor of a high-rise building. He said that three cars were damaged in the blaze. He said the fire had been controlled while cooling work was ongoing.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that two persons were adversely affected due to suffocation, who were rescued and provided first medical aid on the spot.
He said the fire had erupted due to a short circuit failure in an electronic vehicle parked at the scene, which spread and engulfed two other vehicles.
He said four fire tenders and one snorkel managed to control the blaze, however, cooling work was ongoing.

 


Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the situation was “under control so far” and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) fire tenders and snorkels were present on the ground to tackle the situation.
“People are being evacuated as we speak. Will keep everyone posted,” he said.







He also urged the crowd to “stay back” so that rescue work could be carried out. He also shared a video of a large crowd surrounding a fire truck.







A statement by his office said he had taken immediate notice of the fire and directed the fire brigade to reach the site immediately.
“Ensure the safety of people’s lives and assets at any cost and speed up the rescue operation,” he directed. He also instructed officials to be on standby.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, meanwhile, contacted the Karachi mayor, commissioner and the inspector general, according to a statement issued by his office.
“Our first priority is to safely rescue the people stuck inside the building,” he directed. He also directed the police to manage the crowd at the scene so that the rescue operation would run smoothly.
He also directed that water be supplied to the fire brigade through the bowsers in a timely manner.
The incident comes a little over two weeks after a huge fire erupted at Karachi’s Gul Plaza, which claimed the lives of 73 people on January 17.</p><small>2026-02-02 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02213948303230f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970627/govt-rules-out-talks-with-terrorists-as-senate-condemns-spate-of-attacks-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt rules out talks with terrorists as Senate condemns spate of attacks in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday ruled out talks with terrorists as the upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan, while also urging the government to ensure a transparent investigation into the incidents.
Speaking in the Senate, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah ruled out talks with terrorists.
He urged all political forces to adopt a unified national stance against terrorism, fully support law enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and honour the sacrifices of martyrs and their families.
Responding to the points raised by opposition leader Raja Nasir Abbas, he said: “No one is angry in Balochistan; there is no issue of rights. They are taking action against Pakistan on the instructions of the enemy.”
He said that terrorists should be called terrorists without any ifs or buts and that action should be taken against them without any ambiguity. He pointed out that the enemy was humiliated during Marka-i-Haq and these terrorists would also face a similar fate.
He went on to say that criminal and terrorist activities could be carried out anywhere by small armed groups, even in relatively secure areas, but the pattern of violence witnessed in Balochistan reflected organised terrorism rather than isolated criminal acts.
Sanaullah said terrorists in Balochistan had repeatedly stopped passenger buses, checked travellers’ identity cards and executed innocent citizens in front of their families, including women and children.
He said such brutality had also been witnessed in attacks on trains, including the Jaffar Express.
“These are acts of extreme savagery that no sane human being can justify,” he said, questioning the narrative that such groups were merely “disgruntled”.
He said the terrorists were acting as the operatives of a hostile country, seeking to avenge the defeat suffered by enemy forces during Marka-i-Haq.
He said security forces had thwarted attempts to breach the Quetta Red Zone and neutralised the terrorists wherever they attempted to operate. “They could not withstand direct engagement with the forces and were forced to flee back to their hideouts,” he added.
He rejected any linkage between terrorism and political demands such as elections, saying the terrorists had no public mandate, no political agenda and no belief in the democratic system.
Meanwhile, in his speech, the Senate opposition leader called for moving toward the rule of law to steer the country out of crisis. He also called for initiating dialogue and taking everyone on board.
“We should have talked to the angry people; Those who talk about the Constitution, talk about Pakistan, hold sit-ins — their words are not heard. And, when their women come to Islamabad, they are treated badly,” he noted.
He said most of the sitting lawmakers were not true representatives of the people and therefore cannot represent them.
Referring to the attacks in Balochistan, he said, “They (terrorists) freely moved around for three or four hours, and security was breached. Banks were blown up … no one stopped them.”
He questioned whether anyone had resigned in the wake of the incidents. He said Rs 80 billion were spent annually on security in the province but regretted there was no government writ at night. He said that those responsible should be held accountable.
Meanwhile, PTI’s parliamentary leader Ali Zafar rejected attempts to create the impression that the party was siding with terrorists, declaring that the enemies of Pakistan were also the enemies of the party.
He said those who kill, set the national flag on fire and damage state property were enemies of the country and should be treated as terrorists. He, however, said the PTI supported all peaceful movements for rights.
He noted that people’s support was essential to effectively tackle the menace of terrorism, for which incarcerated party founder Imran Khan must be taken on board. He regretted that the government was labelling the PTI as a terrorist organisation and was not ready to give political space to it.
“You will meet the fate of failure if you do not include the PTI in your national plan. You need us because we have the true public mandate”, he remarked.
Senate passes resolution
Meanwhile, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the attacks in Balochistan. Moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law.
It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan.
The resolution condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs. It also lauded the courage and sacrifices of the security forces and law enforcement agencies, and reiterated the nation’s resolve to foil terrorist attempts.
“The unity of the state and the will of the people will prevail over all forces of violence, extremism, and terrorism,” the resolution said.
It also reaffirmed the Senate’s commitment to peace, development and political inclusion in Balochistan, recognising that “sustainable security is inseparable from socio-economic progress, good governance, and respect for constitutional rights”.
As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”. It said that said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the spate of attacks.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.”
He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.</p><small>2026-02-02 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02200005ddbbcd1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970633/annual-consumer-price-index-rose-58pc-year-on-year-in-january' target='_blank'><strong>Annual consumer price index rose 5.8pc year-on-year in January</strong></a><br><p>Consumer price inflation rose 5.8 per cent year-on-year in January, official data showed on Monday, underscoring the central bank’s warning that price pressures could temporarily breach its target band as economic activity picks up.
The reading comes a week after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held its policy rate at 10.50pc, saying inflation could exceed its 5pc to 7pc medium-term target range for a few months this year, even as growth gains momentum and imports push the trade deficit wider.
The reading from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PSB) compared with 5.6pc in December, when prices fell on a monthly basis due to lower perishable food costs.
On a month-on-month basis, inflation increased by 0.4pc in January.
The SBP said it viewed the real policy rate as sufficiently positive to stabilise inflation over the medium term, even as it flagged stronger domestic demand and external pressures as upside risks to prices.

“The team will play a warm-up match against Ireland on Feb 4,” PCB added.
The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on Feb 7.
On Sunday, the government gave the go-ahead for Pakistan’s participation in the tournament, but barred it from playing against arch-rival India on February 15.
The announcement came amid uncertainty regarding a possible boycott of the tournament over Bangladesh’s withdrawal following tensions with India.
A government source told Dawn that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.</p><small>2026-02-02 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02194551d7b0d99.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970632/air-india-grounds-boeing-dreamliner-plane-after-pilot-flags-fuel-control-switch-issue' target='_blank'><strong>Air India grounds Boeing Dreamliner plane after pilot flags fuel control switch issue</strong></a><br><p>Air India said on Monday it had grounded one of its Boeing Dreamliners after one of its pilots reported an issue with the fuel control switch, which is at the centre of an ongoing probe into a deadly air crash last year.
“We have grounded said aircraft and are involving the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis,” the airline said, adding that the matter has been communicated to India’s aviation regulator.
Boeing and India’s civil aviation ministry, which houses the aviation regulator, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.
The Tata Group and Singapore Airlines-owned carrier has faced intense scrutiny since a Dreamliner crash in June last year killed 260 people.
Air India said on Monday it had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the regulator last year, and had found no issues.
A cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the June 12 Air India flight suggested that the captain cut the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines, a source briefed on US officials’ early assessment of evidence told Reuters last year.</p><small>2026-02-02 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/021841009b5ba3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970630/cdf-munir-vows-to-strengthen-pakistan-libya-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir vows to strengthen Pakistan-Libya ties</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Staff (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations with Libya, according to the military’s media affairs wing.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Libyan Arab Armed Forces Commander-in-chief Field Marshal Khalifa Abu-al-Qasim Haftar and Deputy Commander-in-chief Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar called on CDF Munir at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” the statement said.







“The discussion underscored the importance of continued engagement and collaboration between the armed forces of Pakistan and Libya,” it said.
CDF Munir welcomed the distinguished guests and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations with Libya, it said.
“He emphasised Pakistan’s support for peace, stability, and institutional development in Libya,” it added.
“The meeting was held in a cordial and constructive atmosphere, reflecting the longstanding friendly relations between Pakistan and Libya,” the statement said.
Earlier, upon his arrival at Noor Khan Airbase, Field Marshal Haftar was received by CDF Munir, it added.
“The dignitary also paid homage to shuhada and laid wreath at martyrs memorial at GHQ,” it added.
In December, Pakistan had signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell conventional military equipment to the Libyan army. According to the Reuters news agency, the over $4 billion deal, one of Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons sales, will see arms sold to the Libyan National Army (LNA).</p><small>2026-02-02 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/021409347c03c2f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970610/pm-shehbaz-appreciates-partnership-support-from-world-bank-in-meeting-with-president-banga-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz appreciates partnership, support from World Bank in meeting with President Banga in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: World Bank Group (WBG) President Ajay Banga called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday as Pakistan acknowledged the group’s valuable support, which has been instrumental in advancing the country’s economic development and reforms.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister welcomed Banga for his first official visit as the president of the WBG.







The premier appreciated the group for its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and its commitment to supporting the development priorities of the country, especially through the 10-year WBG Country Partnership Framework (CPF).
Shehbaz also appreciated Banga’s leadership in transforming the WBG into a more impactful development partner.
He said that the government of Pakistan was vigorously working on an economic reform agenda, with a multi-pronged, comprehensive, structural, homegrown programme aimed at sustainable economic stability.
The prime minister also appreciated the support of the global financial institution in resilient infrastructure, agribusiness, digital development, energy, human capital, fiscal reforms, and increasing productive private investment for job creation and growth.
PM Shehbaz and Banga reiterated the need to fast-track implementation and ensure strong oversight to deliver impact at speed and scale on Country Partnership Framework (CPF)-aligned priorities. These measures would duly assist the prime minister’s initiative to address and resolve implementation bottlenecks in development projects.
PM Shehbaz also expressed the government’s commitment to structural reforms that would unlock job-rich growth and further strengthen investors’ confidence.
Speaking on the occasion, Banga expressed his gratitude to the prime minister for his reception and hospitality in Pakistan. He commended the government’s ongoing reform efforts and reaffirmed his commitment to deepening cooperation through a One World Bank Group approach.
He said that greater leverage of private resources, in addition to strong coordination with development partners, was necessary to meet the ambition of the government’s reform agenda.</p><small>2026-02-02 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02155537367fe22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970607/militant-violence-surges-in-january-after-december-lull-picss' target='_blank'><strong>Militant violence surges in January after December lull: PICSS</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After a noticeable decline in violence in December 2025, the first month of the new year witnessed a renewed surge in anti-state violence, leading to higher fatalities among militants, civilians and security personnel, according to official statistics.
Data released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) shows that combat-related deaths in January 2026 rose by 43 per cent compared to December 2025.
During the month, 242 militants were killed, while 73 civilians and 46 security force personnel lost their lives. Twelve militants were injured, while at least 71 civilians and 52 security personnel were also wounded.
PICSS reported that January saw 87 militant attacks nationwide, marking a 28pc increase from the 68 attacks recorded in December 2025. Of these, 38 attacks took place in mainland Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20 in the province’s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 27 in Balochistan and two in Punjab.
Balochistan emerged as the primary theatre of militant activity as well as security operations. The province reported the highest monthly militant toll since the current wave of militancy began there in 2001.
Although Balochistan experienced relative calm for much of the month, violence escalated sharply during the final two days. Simultaneous attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security force operations, brought the province into sharp focus.
The month recorded at least three suicide attacks, two of them in Balochistan and claimed by the BLA. The province witnessed the deaths of at least 172 terrorists, most of them during the final two days of January.
Compared to the previous month, civilian deaths increased by 143pc, militant deaths by 35pc and security force fatalities by seven per cent.
Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals.
Punjab reported only two militant attacks; however, security forces carried out a coordinated crackdown across central Punjab, including Lahore, Sahiwal, Pakpattan and Mianwali.
At least 53 suspected militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore. Analysts say these arrests likely disrupted a major militant buildup aimed at targeting the city.
No militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad or Gilgit-Baltistan.</p><small>2026-02-02 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0214141236b11ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970608/ttap-condemns-spate-of-terrorist-attacks-in-balochistan-labels-it-security-failure' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP condemns spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan, labels it ‘security failure’</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Monday condemned the spate of attacks in Balochistan last week, and called it “a security failure on the part of the provincial government and law enforcement agencies”.
On Saturday, the military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan. 18 civilians and 15 personnel of security forces were martyred in the attacks on Saturday.
In a statement, posted on X, the TTAP condemned the attacks and expressed sorrow with the martyrs. It noted that “a terrorist attack in the province on such a large scale was a failure on the part of the provincial government and LEAs”.







The opposition alliance stated that the series of attacks showed the “extent to which the rule of law has become limited in the province and the lack of concern for the lives and property of citizens.”
“For how long will we turn a blind eye to the fact that the provincial government — which does not have the public’s support — is only interested in prolonging its time in power,” TTAP said.
The opposition alliance maintained that “only governments whose own moral standing was not under question were capable of combating terrorism”.
TTAP reiterated its demand for “free and fair elections” in reference to the 2024 General Elections.
It further stressed that “representative governments were the only solution to the problems, not rulers and systems imposed against the will of the public”.
During the early morning hours on Saturday, multiple terrorist cells attacked more than 10 cities and towns in Balochistan. The targets were primarily security and government installations.
Suicide bombers, including female attackers, were part of the assault force. Security forces engaged the terrorists in gun battles across the province.
During the skirmishes, 15 security personnel were martyred and 18 civilians lost their lives. As the attacks subsided, security forces launched a series of cordon-and-sweep operations to clear towns, cities, and the countryside of terrorist presence.</p><small>2026-02-02 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02140455c5af504.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970602/security-forces-kill-22-more-terrorists-in-balochistan-taking-48-hour-total-tally-to-177' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 22 more terrorists in Balochistan, taking 48-hour total tally to 177</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 22 more terrorists during the ongoing security sweeps in Balochistan, taking the tally of terrorists killed over the past two days to 177, said security officials.
Terrorists carried out a large-scale coordinated attack in the province on Saturday. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed more than 150 terrorists.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The terrorists were killed overnight as security sweeps continued across the province following Saturday’s attack, with security officials adding that the “noose is tightening”.
Mobile internet services remain suspended
Residents of Quetta and other cities in Balochistan continued to face difficulties on Monday as mobile internet services remained suspended for the third day in a row.
Mobile phone data was suspended in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan and other cities on Saturday.
Balochistan’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn that the services would remain suspended today, but were expected to be restored tomorrow.
This is not the first time that the government has suspended internet services in Balochistan for security reasons: in November, it suspended mobile internet services in all 36 districts of the province for about a week.

Addressing the media on Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti expressed firm resolve to eliminate terrorists. Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that peace has been established in Balochistan after Saturday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.</p><small>2026-02-02 09:50</small></div><hr>
