<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30222010706aea4.jpg?r=222919' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907591/despite-wars-end-afghanistan-remains-deep-in-crisis-un-relief-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Despite war’s end, Afghanistan remains deep in crisis: UN relief chief</strong></a><br><p>Climate change, women’s rights, displacement, poverty: Afghanistan remains a priority as it faces overlapping crises, the UN’s relief chief Tom Fletcher told AFP on Wednesday, deploring “brutal” aid budget cuts.
“We’ve identified 17 crises across the world where our engagement is most urgent, most vital. Afghanistan is high on that list,” said the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs in an interview with AFP during a visit to northern Afghanistan’s Kunduz province.
Fletcher’s visit comes after US President Donald Trump’s decision to slash foreign aid sent shock waves across the globe.
 
 

Washington had been the top donor to Afghanistan, having spent $3.71 billion in humanitarian and development aid since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
“We’re in a period when we’re having to massively prioritise, take brutal choices … literally life and death choices, about where to operate and which lives to save,” Fletcher said.
“You can look at Sudan for the scale of the crisis, you can look at Gaza for the intensity, the ferocity of the killing there,” he added. “Afghanistan is a different kind of challenge, but it’s a huge challenge nonetheless.”
Climate change is hitting the country “particularly hard” and it “will drive the needs even more than conflict will in the period ahead”, he said. “You’ve got that combined with the existing levels of poverty and these decades of instability and conflict.”
‘Dialogue’ on women’s rights
The situation of women’s rights in the country adds to the layers of a “building up of crisis upon crisis”, Fletcher added.
The Taliban authorities have imposed restrictions on women that the UN has denounced as “gender apartheid”. Women and girls have been banned from education beyond primary school as well as many sectors of work and public spaces.
“I think this particular dynamic around women and girls is something that can surely cut through to even the most hard-hearted and cynical, transactional politician right now,” Fletcher said.
After meetings with Taliban officials this week in Kabul and the Taliban heartland of southern Kandahar, Fletcher noted the need for “dialogue in order to try and change the mindset” on women’s rights.

“It’s encouraging to me that people were willing to have the conversation and not have it in a purely defensive way,” he said.
Afghan women are particularly affected by humanitarian aid cuts, especially in the healthcare sector, which has been heavily dependent on foreign support.
In Afghanistan, maternal mortality rates of 620 per 100,000 births and infant mortality rates of 55 children under five per 1,000 births are among the highest in the world, according to Unicef.
“I challenge anyone who celebrates aid cuts to sit with a woman who has lost her child because she had to cycle for three hours while in labour to get the care that she needed,” said Fletcher, after having met Afghan women at a mobile health centre.
‘Humanitarian reset’
When Amina, a 28-year-old housewife, fell ill, she walked for an hour and a half to reach the centre in the rural countryside.
“There are no clinics, no doctors who come here, nothing nearby. We don’t even have electricity,” she told AFP.
The small facility, supported by the local non-governmental organisation JACK and UN agencies, is under strain.
Already overwhelmed, it now has to accommodate patients from US-funded clinics that had to close, as well as Afghans who have been expelled from Pakistan since early April.

“The reality with the cuts was that we didn’t see the impact straight away,” Fletcher said. “It’s now that we’re really coming to understand how brutal these cuts are going to be.”
Under these conditions, he said, “we’re in the process now of a massive humanitarian reset”.
“We’ve got to rediscover that sense of coexistence and care for the most vulnerable people on the planet. I don’t think that’s gone away just because of a few election results,” he said. “I don’t think you can put tariffs on humanitarian action,” he added, referring to the trade war recently launched by Trump.</p><small>2025-04-30 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30191552300918c.png?r=212448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907576/pakistan-wont-initiate-but-will-respond-strongly-to-any-indian-escalation-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan won’t initiate but will respond strongly to any Indian escalation: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Amid rising tensions with India, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Wednesday that Pakistan will not initiate any escalation but warned of a strong response if provoked.
His statement came during a joint press conference in Islamabad with Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan, where they addressed recent border confrontations with India along the Line of Control (LoC) and accused New Delhi of supporting terrorism inside Pakistan.

What was said:

FM Dar says entire region facing serious threat to peace
Says Pakistan will respond very strong to any escalatory move
Says durable solution for India in focusing on internal problems
Raises questions about Pahalgam incident
FO spokesperson highlights irregularities in Pahalgam FIR registration
DG ISPR pokes holes in Indian narrative
Says India uses illegally held Pakistani prisoners in fake encounters
Says army monitoring the situation very carefully in all terrains
Says Pakistanis will defend territorial integrity and sovereignty at all costs
Says law enforcement agencies fully capable of taking on all threats simultaneously


Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks on civilians in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has strongly denied. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
FM Dar said the entire region was facing a serious threat to peace and stability owing to the “politically motivated and highly provocative environment being created by India” in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
“The world leaders have been requesting the exercise of restraint in recent days. I have made it very clear, on behalf of the government and the nation, that Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move. However, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” he said.
“Let me start by reiterating that Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. No cause or objective can justify taking the lives of innocent people. This is the national and Islamic policy: killing of a human being is tantamount to killing entire humanity as per the [Holy] Quran and saving a life is tantamount to saving entire humanity.”
The deputy prime minister said the targeting of innocent civilians was sorely condemnable and deplorable, adding that Pakistan had been raising its policy in this regard wherever it was happening in the world.
“We are concerned over the loss of life during the Pahalgam attack. We also extend our condolences. Being a victim of terrorism itself, no one can feel the pain of those impacted by this scourge like Pakistan,” Dar said.
On the other hand, he said: “India glorifies and even celebrates its assassination campaign and sponsoring of terrorism in Pakistan and other countries. No other country has sacrificed so much or suffered as much as Pakistan due to terrorism.”
 


Recounting the loss of over 80,000 lives and economic losses of over $150 billion, Dar said that in total, the overall loss incurred by Pakistan amounted to $500bn. He said Pakistan had been working closely with the international community to address the common threat.
He said the sacrifices made by Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies and civilians had helped to address the threat of terrorism and contributed towards regional and international peace and stability.
“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism that has been planned, orchestrated and sponsored by India,” FM Dar said, adding that in such a backdrop, it was “preposterous to even suggest any kind of association of Pakistan with this [Pahalgam] incident”.
He said the furore and media hype created over “each and every incident in India seems to be deliberate and choreographed”, adding that it was “unfortunate that India continues to weaponise unsubstantiated accusations and allegations as part of its disinformation strategy for narrow political ends”.
 
 

Dar alleged it was not the first time that India had resorted to this practice. “They have done it before and resorted again to the same to what they did in the Pulwama incident,” Dar said, adding that it had become a “very familiar template aimed at diverting attention from India’s inability to suppress the inalienable right of Kashmiris to self-determination, its security failures in [occupied Kashmir] as well as its decades-long state terrorism and oppression”.
The foreign minister said India deliberately raised tensions with Pakistan to distract the international community’s attention from the “horrors” of what was happening in occupied India.
“A durable solution for India lies in focusing on its internal problems instead of pointing fingers at other countries. India has been deploying allegations of terrorism to achieve its strategic objectives for a long time,” Dar said, adding that India had a history of using the excuse of terrorism to introduce “draconian laws” to suppress Kashmiris in the occupied territory and to defy UN Security Council resolutions on the issue.
“India needs to explain why such incidents usually coincide with high-profile visits … The root cause of instability and conflict in South Asia is the unresolved and long-festering Jammu and Kashmir dispute. India’s illegal occupation … in stark violation of UNSC resolutions and grave violations of human rights, must remain a matter of grave concern for the international community.
“At the same time, all such incidents are used to whip up domestic political sentiment for narrow political gains. We remain extremely concerned at the very vitriolic, highly inflammatory and blatantly Islamophobic narrative being directed against Kashmiris and Indian Muslims.

He said the Indian media and political leaders were directing a similar discourse against Pakistan, which he criticised as a “highly irresponsible ploy for narrow objective gains” that was pushing the entire region towards “extreme instability”.
“India made allegations against Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack without an iota of evidence and with such dramatic speed. Pakistan has nothing to do with it and we have said so right from the beginning, and I repeat: Pakistan has nothing to do with the Pahalgam incident, period.
“We demand an independent and transparent probe by neutral investigators, as announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Any TORs (terms of reference) in this regard should be credible and mutually agreed upon.
“Pakistan has neither any connection … nor is the potential beneficiary. At a time when the economy is stabilising and we are making significant progress against terrorism, we need to question why this situation is being created by India all of a sudden and what is the motivation behind it.”

He said the recent actions and announcements by India after a meeting of its cabinet security committee were “illegal and highly irresponsible”.
“Holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty is unilateral and illegal. There are no such provisions in the treaty, it cannot be amended or terminated without consensus and in case of disagreements or issues, there are forums provided in the treaty which should be invoked,” he added.
Dar said the above actions showed India’s “blatant disregard” for the sanctity of international treaties and set a dangerous precedent. “It strikes at a fundamental ill of regional cooperation with profound implications for regional and global stability,” the foreign minister explained.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy, millions of people are dependent on the waters being regulated by this treaty. We gave up three rivers in this treaty and I can hardly find a water distribution treaty in the world whereby, a part of dealing with the distribution of water, the rivers could have also been given up.”
Dar said the National Security Committee had made it “very clear” that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan, as per the IWT and the usurpation of the rights of the lower riparian, would be considered an “act of war”.
“It is equal to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy. Other diplomatic measures by India are indiscriminate and unnecessary. India’s actions and inflammatory rhetoric over the last few days are highly irresponsible. Being a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan believes in restraint and remains committed to regional peace and stability.
“However, in case of any act of aggression, Pakistan remains determined to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in exercise of its inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter.”
Questions about Pahalgam incident
FM Dar said he wanted to raise some questions about the Pahalgam incident that needed to be considered.
“One, is it not time for the international community to hold India accountable for its transnational assassinations in different countries, including Pakistan? Two, is it not important to distinguish between the international community’s sympathies with the victims of the incident and the unwitting endorsement of Indian belligerence?
Three, is it not that Indian propaganda is aimed at fabricating a case for military adventure? Four, don’t you think that India’s blatant disregard for international law and whimsical approach towards its obligations would lead to a highly unstable and unpredictable regional order?
“Five, isn’t it high time for the international community to step in and condemn India and prevent it from targeting people on the basis of Islamophobia and religious hatred?
Six, can we deny that the dangerous Indian brinkmanship and efforts aimed at escalation can potentially lead to disastrous consequences in a nuclearised region and beyond?“
The foreign minister said Pakistan was cognisant of the developing situation. “We are very alert, the armed forces are alert, and the NSC resolve is very much there. We are vigilant, our armed forces are vigilant and the nation will thwart any misadventure, responding in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing,” he added.
Dar pointed out that it took no time for Pakistan to issue the statement expressing its condolences. “I was with the prime minister in Ankara on an official 36-hour visit. After we landed, the news came,  and the moment the meetings ended in the evening, for which we had gone, I was in touch with the FO and the foreign secretary, and the team and I finalised in consultation with the stakeholders, Pakistan’s statement on this incident,” the foreign minister said.
“So don’t tell me that Pakistan has not condemned. There are different forums of condemnation. Pakistan has condemned at the international forum where it is responsible, one of the 15 members of the UNSC. Pakistan’s highest security forum, which is the NSC, has condemned it.
“We have condemned terrorism in all its manifestations and forms. The prime minister has given a very clear condemnation statement when he offered an independent inquiry … by independent actors.
“So this is rhetoric which the other side has been playing that we did not condemn, that is all wrong.”
Irregularities with Pahalgam FIR
Following Dar’s remarks, FO spokesperson Khan highlighted irregularities in the registration of the first information report for the incident and criticised the speed with which Indian accounts began blaming Pakistan without offering any evidence.
“The timing raises serious questions about how information was processed so quickly,” he said.
Meanwhile, DG ISPR Lt Gen Chaudhry noted that the attack site was located far from the nearest town of Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, emphasising that Pakistan was presenting facts rather than engaging in baseless allegations.
“If the allegation is that the Pakistan-based so-called terrorists did this incident, then you need to be cognizant of where it lies, how deep within [occupied Kashmir]. If you see the terrain, you will see it is quite hilly, it is not the sort of terrain that is friendly and not the sort of terrain where all-weather fair roads exist. It’s mostly [four-wheelers] that travel,” he said.

Showing visuals of the area’s geography, he said the distance from the incident site to the nearest police station was 30 minutes and questioned how an FIR could be registered in 10 minutes.
The military spokesperson poked holes in the Indian narrative, saying that the other side mentioned reports of indiscriminate firing, while also putting forward a stance on the act of terrorism carried out based on religion.
Link between Indian propaganda and terrorism
Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Indian social media account spreading propaganda against Islam and Pakistan had previously been linked to terrorist attacks in the country, including the November 4, 2023, assault in Mianwali and the October 6, 2024, attack on Chinese nationals in Karachi.
“There you see the collusion, how the choreography is carried out: first projecting and predicting where we will strike, then the attack happens, followed by its glorification on social media,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “If you observe the pattern, their electronic media jumps in within minutes. The same sequence was visible in Pahalgam.”
He said a similar pattern of hinting at a major incident, followed by a terrorist attack, was also observed in the Jaffar Express train bombing.
The military spokesperson said the questions raised by FM Dar were those being asked by common Kashmiris and Indians themselves.
“Is it the first time it is happening? No, there is a litany of using terror incidents for political ends. This is important — these terror incidents have a political objective. We saw last time, in Pulwama, how the terror incident in February was used for … change of status of Kashmir.
“We are seeing now that a terror incident that happened in Pahalgam is being used for the purpose of IWT, distracting [from] Pakistan’s continuously and hard-fought won war on terrorism and successful efforts in reviving the economy.”
He said another important fact that needed to be considered in the situation the region was facing today was the phenomenon of fake encounters using illegally held Pakistani prisoners in India.
“We have reports, the information that hundreds of Pakistanis held in jails in different locations by India are used in fake encounters projected as terrorists and infiltrators.”
Turning to India’s “state-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan, Chaudhry said the spokesperson of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) had appeared on multiple Indian news channels after the Jaffar Express attack, where he was openly glorified.

DG Chaudhry said Indian media was the first to show footage of the attack that was shot by the BLA.
He said the issue of Indian-sponsored assassinations and terrorism was transnational, affecting Canada, the US and Australia as well.
“Once we say that we have gotten nothing to do with Pahalgam and once we say that the only way out is an independent, credible transparent investigation, we have strong reasons, empirical evidence, and facts on the basis of which we are saying this.”
The military spokesperson further said: “We have credible intelligence that Indians post-Pahalgam have tasked all their proxies to undertake terrorist acts everywhere in Pakistan. Whether these proxies are operating in Balochistan or other parts of Pakistan.”
DG Chaudhry said the country had seen 3,700 terror incidents since January 24 with 77,816 operations, 1,666 terrorists killed and 3,896 casualties.
“This is terrorism that is being abetted and sponsored by India. It’s for the whole world to see, they feel it, its effects. We must be cognizant that Pakistan is the last bulwark standing against this scourge of terrorism.”
DG Chaudhry lashed out at India, saying that for the sake of its “short-term myopic objectives, it is facilitating this terrorism, it is abetting this perverted creeping ideology. Why? For short-term political objectives”.
Regarding the subsequent rhetoric against Islam and action against Muslims in India, the DG ISPR said: “I talked earlier that there is a planned and choreographed campaign of Islamist terrorism, but the acts speak differently.
“This is what some sane people are saying, the tourists who came in taxis belonging to Muslims, they stayed in hotels owned by Muslims, they ate food cooked by Muslims … and after the attack, they were covered and protected by Muslims. The first person to die was Muslim.”
He questioned why an effort was being made to label the whole community of Indian Muslims as terrorists. “Is this part of some agenda? is it part of that hate that is being systematically put into society?”
Chaudhry said that those questioning the Indian narrative were being clamped down upon.
“What the Indians are trying to do is … internalisation of external problems and externalisation of internal problems. Kashmir is an external problem and they are externalising it.
“Terrorism and extremism are an internal problem of India. Instead of handling it, and addressing it, they are externalising it. This cycle is manifesting itself in this Pahalgam incident.”
Pakistan response to escalatory moves
Questioned on Pakistan’s response and the options available to it, the DG ISPR said: “We are monitoring the situation very carefully in all terrains and accordingly, our responses and countermeasures in all domains are ready and as you must have seen in the NSC declaration, the statement of the government that came last night as well, that there will be decisive and assured actions.”
He said he would not elaborate on the details but “rest assured that the people of Pakistan, with its full resolve will defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan at all costs.”
Dar added: “Pakistan will exercise restraint for the purpose of regional peace, but and that is very clear, that if provoked, any action from the other side will be responded to in a befitting manner and in a stronger way.”
He further said: “The nation is united, the resolve of the leadership is in front of you in the NSC press release … I must compliment all political parties represented in the federation, all federating units, in the Senate … there is a unanimous resolution … the message is loud and clear.
“In terms of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no compromise and we are one united [nation] with a clear resolve that if provocation takes place then don’t blame us.”
The DG ISPR said Pakistani authorities would take up the case of India’s state-sponsored terrorism with all forums, including the international community.
Questioned about a fight on two fronts, the DG ISPR said law enforcement agencies were “fully capable” of taking on all threats simultaneously and effectively with full force.

“Terrorists are being hunted down. We are vigilant and watching everywhere,” he said with appropriate countermeasures in place for “fitting and decisive responses”.
Questioned about any need for mediation in the matter, FM Dar said: “There is a need for investigation, not mediation. Our friends have offered it and they must be trying. The need of the hour is, because both countries being nuclear, any escalatory move can go to a direction which would be unsustainable not only for the two countries but the entire region so it is my responsibility, of friends and regional actors to make sure India doesn’t make this mistake [of an attack].
“On behalf of armed forces, they’re alert, they’re ready and in a position to give a befitting response and we will choose the time and mode of our liking.”
Meanwhile, the DG ISPR confirmed that Pakistan and India’s military discussed ceasefire violations. He said the two sides held a routine weekly call in which Pakistan “raised the ceasefire violation issue” on Tuesday along the LoC.
Reuters earlier reported that despite the heightened tensions, India and Pakistan’s top military generals held their normal weekly phone call on Tuesday, according to two Indian military sources and a Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter.
“The Indian side objected strongly to unprovoked firing happening from Pakistan,” one Indian source said.
A Pakistani official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the talks had happened, but gave no details.
The DG ISPR said this routine weekly contact was normally not made public. “We don’t know for what reason the Indians thought it necessary to make it public,” he said.
AJK president calls for international mediation
Meanwhile, AJK President Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called for international mediation and said that his administration was preparing a humanitarian response in case of any further escalation.
“There is a lot of activity going on and anything could happen, so we have to prepare for it. These few days are very important,” he told Reuters in an interview, calling for rapid international diplomacy to de-escalate the situation.
“We expect some mediation at this time from some friendly countries and we hope that that mediation must take place, otherwise, India would do anything this time,” he said. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates could be in a position to mediate, he added.
He also said he hoped major players such as the United States and Britain might also get involved.
He said activity along the LoC was “hot” and that Pakistan had shot down two Indian drones in the last few days.
“There had been regular firing by Pakistani and Indian soldiers day and night, though so far there had been no casualties,” he said, adding that Pakistan had also detected Indian Rafale fighter jets flying near the LoC, though they had not crossed.
He said he had not received intelligence on when and where India was expected to strike, but his administration was working with groups such as the Red Crescent Society to prepare extra medical and food supplies in case of any conflict.
“Red Crescent are working on it and we are working on displaced people in affected areas,” he said.
He added that the international community also needed to pay more attention to Kashmir’s long-term future.
“I think this is the right time for the international community as a whole and the UN to play some mediating role in Kashmir,” he said. “It’s been a very long time and the people of Kashmir have suffered a lot.”</p><small>2025-04-30 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/301238234bcdfd5.jpg?r=124201' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907537/indian-rafales-patrolling-above-held-kashmir-retreat-after-paf-scrambles-jets-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Indian Rafales patrolling above held Kashmir retreat after PAF scrambles jets: state media</strong></a><br><p>Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media reported on Wednesday, adding to tensions between the two countries in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan’s political and military leadership have strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
The tensions between the arch-rivals have intensified in the past few days, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan had reinforced its forces and was ready for any incursion by India, while on the other side, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “operational freedom” to act on the Pahalgam attack.
PTV News and Radio Pakistan, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting “patrolling overnight” in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.
“PAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,” Radio Pakistan added.
“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” PTV News reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were “fully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India”.
The government and the military have yet to provide details on the incident.
The development comes after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.
In a televised statement issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
The April 22 attack killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.
The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
Deputy PM Ishaq Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Today’s incident also comes after the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, official sources said.
The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.
 
 

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the night of April 25.
Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) faced a major fall in intraday trade today.
Pakistan responds to unprovoked Indian firing on LoC
Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV reported that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC in AJK.

“According to security sources, on the night of April 29 and 30, India violated the ceasefire on the LoC. India opened unprovoked fire in the Kayani and Mandal sectors of the LoC,” PTV reported.
India used small arms in the unprovoked firing incident, the state broadcaster added.
“Security sources have confirmed that the Pakistan Army has responded forcefully and given a befitting reply to the Indian Army. The enemy has been silenced with an effective response,” the report said.
The state broadcaster cited reports of the destruction of several Indian bunkers due to the effective response of the Pakistan Army, adding, “Security sources have said that India’s Chakpatra post has been destroyed”.

“Earlier, India had also evacuated the border areas of occupied Kashmir while a crackdown against Muslims is underway,” PTV said, adding that the Pakistan Army was always ready to defend the integrity of the country.
FM Dar holds meeting with US Cd’A
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) said US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker called on FM Dar for talks in which they exchanged views on recent regional developments.
Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Baker conveyed the United States’ desire for de-escalation, saying that the country would stay engaged with both Pakistan and India on the evolving situation.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi.
Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including “India’s inflammatory propaganda, illegal unilateral actions, and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a clear violation of international law”, the FO said.
The Omani FM underscored the importance of de-escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy to address issues.
FM Dar appreciated Oman’s efforts for Iran and US talks, and conveyed best wishes for their success.
Separately, the Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concern regarding the escalating tension between Pakistan and India and the continued exchange of fire in the border areas.
“The kingdom calls on both countries to reduce tension, avoid escalation, resolve differences through diplomatic means, respect the principles of good neighbourliness and work to achieve stability and peace for the benefit of their peoples and the peoples of the region,” the statement said.
PIA flights from Gilgit, Skardu cancelled
Amid heightened tensions, all Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights operating from the Skardu and Gilgit airports to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad — and vice versa — were cancelled today, according to PIA officials.
However, two Airblue flights destined between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, the sources added.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”. When the passengers reached the airports, they were told that the flights had been cancelled due to security concerns.
 
 

Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 also confirmed the cancellations of a total of 10 PIA flights and departures of the two Airblue flights.
Iqra Khan, a flight inquiry officer at Islamabad International Airport (ISB), also told Dawn.com that PIA cancelled its flights today from the federal capital to Gilgit and vice versa, citing “airspace security” as a reason.
Yesterday, amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities had refuted rumours of a possible closure of airports.
According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled earlier in the week.
The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
Ex-PM Imran says peace is ‘priority’, calls for unity
Amid the ongoing situation, the opposition PTI has proposed a multi-party conference with incarcerated former premier Imran Khan in attendance.
A statement posted on Imran’s X account, which is handled by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”
Recalling the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.
“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi sarkar is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.
 
 

He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a “nuclear flashpoint”.
“I have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,” Imran stressed.
“Needless to say, to win the war against an external enemy, the nation must first be united. It is high time to put a halt to all actions that are further polarising the nation,” he said, adding that the “state’s excessive focus on political victimisation at this critical time is deepening internal divisions”.
“Ironically, Narendra Modi’s aggression has united the people of Pakistan in one voice against Indian hostility,” the ex-premier noted.
India okays ‘operational freedom’ to army amid calls for restraint
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
India’s cabinet committee on security (CCS) — consisting of Modi and his interior, defence, home and finance ministers — is scheduled to meet later today, a government source told Reuters.
This would be the second such meeting of the CCS since the attack on April 22. In its first meeting, the committee had decided to take a series of measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
Last night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.
She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.
Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.
Following the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump had extended his “full support” to India. He later downplayed the regional tensions, saying the dispute would get “figured out”.
 


Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. In the past few days, Dar has also spoken to the foreign ministers of China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary to brief them about Pakistan’s concerns.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday offering “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.
In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the PAF undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.

“It’s going to be a pretty dramatic slowdown from the fourth quarter,” Moody’s Analytics economist Matt Colyar told AFP.
The gross domestic product data for the quarter will be published on Wednesday, the 101st day since Trump’s return to office on January 20.
In that time, he has announced several rounds of tariffs, laying out plans in March to impose sweeping levies on top trading partners from early April in a bid to reset US trade relations.
The introduction of those tariffs sparked a selloff in financial markets, sending volatility surging to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic and spooking investors.
“Usually, government policy doesn’t change that much, particularly not in the first 100 days of a presidency,” George Washington University economics professor Tara Sinclair told AFP. “But this one’s different.”
“I think it’s pretty clear that there were dramatic policy changes that are directly weakening the economy,” she said.
Following April’s dramatic market movement, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause to the higher tariffs for dozens of countries to allow for trade talks, while maintaining a baseline 10 per cent rate for most countries.
It also announced sector-specific measures on steel, aluminium and automobiles and parts not made in the United States, and new sweeping tariffs totalling 145pc on China.
Beijing responded with its own steep, targeted duties against US goods.
Rising recession risk
The US economy grew 2.8pc last year, according to the US Commerce Department. Heading into the new year, analysts had widely expected growth to cool, but to remain at around 2pc in 2025.
Since Trump’s return to office, and the introduction of new tariffs, many analysts have sharply cut their growth outlook. Some economists — including those at Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley — now predict an economic contraction in the first quarter.
But even if the economy does not contract for the first quarter — which ended before Trump’s sweeping tariffs came into effect — the scale of the slowdown analysts expect would nevertheless be significant.
“Our expectation is kind of shockingly on the higher side, and we’re at 0.5pc,” said Colyar from Moody’s Analytics.
The market consensus estimate is for annualized GDP growth of 0.4pc for the first quarter, according to Briefing.com — a marked change from the 2.4pc annualised rate seen in the final quarter of 2024.
If the economy cools as expected, it will be largely down to a surge in imports, as consumers and businesses scrambled to buy what they needed before the tariffs kicked in, analysts told AFP.
“This spike in imports, that’s coming directly from people trying to get ahead of tariffs,” said Sinclair from George Washington University. “And that is in direct response to the policies of this president.”
Beyond the effects of tariffs, the GDP data is likely to paint a “very complicated story,” Belinda Roman, associate professor of economics at St Mary’s University in San Antonio, Texas, said in an interview.
Roman pointed to better-than-expected employment figures, which suggest that “clearly there’s something else changing that we’re not seeing just yet” in the data.
“I think there might be a small contraction,” she said.
“That may be offset by the fact that we’ve seen what I think is a very interesting increase in employment,” she said.
“I think we’ll start to see in second quarter and third quarter more negative impacts, because it takes it a while,” she said. “It doesn’t happen immediately.”</p><small>2025-04-30 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30153641d041b27.jpg?r=153659' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907569/ccp-slaps-rs155m-fine-on-major-poultry-hatcheries-over-cartelisation' target='_blank'><strong>CCP slaps Rs155m fine on major poultry hatcheries over cartelisation</strong></a><br><p>In the light of cartelisation and price fixing of day-old broiler chicks (DOCs), the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) slapped a collective fine of Rs155 million on eight major poultry hatcheries, said a CCP press release on Wednesday.
Last week, the National Price Monitoring Committee showed concerns over the rising trend in perishable products, directing the Ministry of Food Security to develop a price control mechanism for poultry.
The CCP took suo motu notice of cartelisation in the DOC market, initiating an inquiry which found that eight major hatcheries were engaged in a coordinated effort to fix their prices.
The CCP named the following hatcheries: Sadiq Poultry, Hi-Tech Group, Islamabad Group, Olympia Group, Jadeed Group, Supreme Farms (Seasons Group), Big Bird Group, and Sabir’s Group.
Detailing the mode of operation of the cartel, the CCP noted that the hatcheries discussed the prices in a WhatsApp group titled “Chick Rate Announcement.” The group was administered by a senior Big Bird group official, while the Marketing Manager of Big Bird Group, Dr Shahid, coordinated the daily price updates.
It further noted that the cartel regularly announced uniform DOC rates for Punjab. With minor freight adjustments, it also influenced rates in Multan and Karachi.
It was pointed out that the group members discussed and shared next-day prices approximately 198 times from 2019 to 2021. The Price-Sensitive Information was exchanged 108 times via text messages and 87 times through WhatsApp, the CCP further noted.
The CCP observed that between March 2020 and April 2021, the price of DOCs rose by 346 per cent, from Rs17.92 to Rs79.92 per chick, contributing to inflated chicken prices.
Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) Hatchery Affairs Committee Chairman Abdul Karim, PPA Secretary retired General Major Syed Javaid Hussain Bukhari, along with other senior officials from the PPA were also present in the WhatsApp group.
As per the CCP, the eight groups are in direct violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010, which prohibits collusive arrangements to fix prices, control supply, or restrict production.
The CCP commented that such practices damage competition in the market and drive up food prices, calling it a shameful exploitation of society.
“Trade associations are meant to help develop their sectors, not to share price-sensitive information or facilitate cartelisation. Price-fixing through associations is a serious market distortion and an exploitation of consumers. Prices must be determined by free demand and supply forces,” said the press release.
Citing fresh complaints of price hikes, the CCP highlighted that the fair market rate of DOCs should be around Rs78 per chick as opposed to the recent price surge of up to Rs230 per chick.
The CCP encouraged anyone aware of anti-competitive activities by trade associations to file a complaint via the CCP’s complaint portal.</p><small>2025-04-30 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/301618284d72559.jpg?r=161901' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907572/iran-says-next-nuclear-talks-with-us-set-for-saturday-in-rome' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says next nuclear talks with US set for Saturday in Rome</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States will hold a fourth round of talks on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme in Rome on Saturday, Iran’s foreign minister said.
The longtime adversaries have held three rounds of talks aiming for a deal on the programme, which the West believes is intended to develop nuclear weapons — an allegation Tehran denies.
The talks, which began on April 12 and are mediated by Oman, are the highest-level contact in years between the two sides.
“The next round of negotiations will take place in Rome,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
The top diplomat said Iranian officials would also meet on Friday with representatives from Britain, France and Germany — all parties to the 2015 nuclear deal.
The deal called for the lifting of sanctions in exchange for curbing Iran’s nuclear activities, but fell apart when Washington withdrew from it in 2018 during Donald Trump’s first term as US president.
After France threatened that the European trio could reimpose sanctions, Iran’s UN mission said that “threats and economic blackmail” were “entirely unacceptable”.
“Genuine diplomacy cannot proceed under threats or pressure,” the diplomatic mission said in a letter carried Wednesday by Iran’s ISNA news agency.
Trump sent a letter in March to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused.
Since he returned to office in January, Trump revived his “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign, mirroring his approach during his first term.
Tehran has insisted that the ongoing talks should be solely focused on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions.
During the last round in the Omani capital Muscat on Saturday, both sides reported progress.
Iran hangs ‘high-ranking spy’ for Israel: judiciary
Iran has executed a man convicted of espionage for Israel’s Mossad spy agency and involvement in the 2022 assassination of a Revolutionary Guards colonel, the judiciary said.
Mohsen Langarneshin, described as “a high-ranking spy” who supported Mossad operations inside Iran, was hanged in the morning, said the judiciary’s Mizan Online news website.
The report did not specify when Langarneshin had been arrested or sentenced.
It said he was implicated in the killing of Guards colonel Sayyad Khodaei, who was gunned down by two motorcyclists on his way home in Tehran in May 2022.
According to The New York Times, Israel told the United States that it was responsible for the killing.
The judiciary accused Langarneshin of having “bought a motorcycle to monitor” Khodaei’s movements.
State television in Iran said Khodaei was a member of the Quds Force, the Guards’ foreign operations arms, and that he was “known” in Syria, where Tehran had provided military support for the government of now ousted president Bashar al-Assad.
Iran often announces the arrests of alleged spies, including operatives said to be aiding Tehran’s arch-enemy Israel.
A man was executed in December 2023 after he was found guilty of collaborating with Mossad. Four others were hanged a year earlier over alleged ties to Israel.</p><small>2025-04-30 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30140140f0597a0.jpg?r=140419' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907559/pcb-confirms-two-additional-mens-t20is-against-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>PCB confirms two additional men’s T20Is against Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday said that the Bangladesh men’s team will tour Pakistan in May for a five-match T20I series.
Pakistan last played international cricket against New Zealand earlier this month, where the Green Shirts lost both the One-day International series (3-0) and the Twenty20 International series (4-1).
The Pakistan Super League is currently ongoing in the country with the final set to take place on May 18.
 

The schedule for the series. — PCB

The PCB said in a press release: “The series, which is part of the Future Tour Programme (FTP), originally consisted of three ODIs and three Twenty20 internationals (T20Is).
“However, with the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup scheduled for next year, both the boards have mutually agreed to replace the ODIs with two additional T20Is.”
The five-match T20I series will be played in Faisalabad and Lahore from May 25 to June 3, the PCB added.
Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, which successfully hosted the inaugural Champions One-Day Cup in September last year and National T20 Cup last month, will stage the first and second T20Is of the series, scheduled on May 25 and 27.
Iqbal Stadium, which has previously hosted 24 Tests and 16 ODIs between 1978 and 2008, will welcome back international cricket after a 17-year hiatus, the press release noted.
The historic venue’s last international fixture was an ODI between Bangladesh and Pakistan in April 2008.
Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium will host the remaining three T20Is, scheduled on May 30, June 1 and 3 with all five matches set to begin at 8pm.
The Bangladesh team will arrive on 21 May and will undergo training sessions at the Iqbal Stadium from 22 to 24 May, the press release concluded.
Bangladesh last toured Pakistan in September of last year for two tests, where they beat the hosts 2-0 to complete their maiden whitewash over Pakistan in that format of the game.

According to police spokesperson Ghulam Muhammad, the incident occurred in the morning near the Gulshan Kabir area of Ghanche district when labourers working on a construction project were travelling on the tractor-trolley.
The driver lost control of the vehicle and it fell some 150-200 feet into a deep gorge. As a result, four people, including the driver were killed, while 16 labourers were injured.
However, Ghanche district Rescue 1122 Media Coordinator Zulfiqar Ali said the number of injured was 12.
The injured were administered first aid at a nearby dispensary, and later shifted to a hospital on the recommendation of the medical staff, the spokesperson said.

The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.
At 10:38am, the index declined by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.
By 1:50pm, more selling pressure ensued at the stock market as the KSE-100 index plunged by 3,255.42 points, or 2.83pc, from the last close.
Finally, the index closed at 111,326.57, down by 3,545.61 or 3.09pc, from the last close of 114,872.18.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.
He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.
“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, also credited the slump primarily on geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.
Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, albeit without proof.
On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.
Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.
Yesterday, the KSE-100 index had bounced back on the trading floor after the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
Pakistan dollar bonds drop amid rising tensions
Pakistan’s international bonds dropped more than 1 cent after the information minister’s statement.
The 2036 bond suffered the biggest decline, falling 1.3 cents to be bid at 71.85 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed, though bid-ask spreads of around 1 cent pointed to limited liquidity.
Indian shares flat as HDFC Bank offsets Bajaj Finance losses, Pakistan jitters
Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.
Both benchmarks swung between 0.2pc gains and 0.2pc losses in early trade.
“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Pahalgam, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack.
Six of the 13 major sectors declined on Wednesday, while the small- and mid-caps fell 0.6pc and 0.1pc, respectively.
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.

The incident took place in the vicinity of Saddar police station near Kot Adil.
According to Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, Station House Office (SHO) Waseem Sajjad and his personnel were on a routine patrol when two unidentified men opened fire on them.
“The policemen fired back at them, killing one of the attackers and injuring the other, who managed to escape from the scene,” he continued.
The official further said the SHO and a constable named Hayatullah suffered injuries and were shifted to the hospital. Both of them are out of danger.
The RPO said that he and Bannu DPO Saleem Abbas Kalachi immediately reached the hospital to enquire after the health of the injured.
“A police operation is under way to find the person, while the deceased attacker has been shifted to the hospital for identification,” he added.
“Modern weapons, hand grenades, Kalashnikovs, and ammunition were recovered found on the slain attacker.”

Several people were rescued from rooms and roof of the budget hotel, Kolkata police chief Manoj Verma told AFP, after the fire broke out on Tuesday evening.
“The death toll has risen to 15, including two children and a woman,” said Verma, adding an investigation had been launched to find out what triggered the blaze.
“The hotel turned into a gas chamber and it appears that many people suffocated to death.”
The Rituraj Hotel, which had 88 guests when the fire broke out, is located in a congested business district of central Kolkata. About a dozen people suffered burn injuries and were undergoing treatment.
Building fires are common in India due to a lack of firefighting equipment and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
Last year, six people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Patna in the eastern state of Bihar.
The Press Trust of India news agency, which filmed images of soaring flames from the Kolkata building, reported that “several people were seen trying to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building”.
Kolkata’s The Telegraph newspaper reported that at least one person died when he “jumped off the terrace trying to escape” the fire.
Verma said the fire had been tackled and that “cooling operations are underway”.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the families of those killed. “May the injured recover soon,” his office said in a statement.

Having lost five of their six matches so far in this Pakistan Super League season, and two on the bounce, they were gasping for air in stifling conditions; looking for some inspiration.
The Quetta Gladiators, on a two-game winning streak, had their tails up and they would give the Sultans no way out; Fah­eem Ashraf picking a wicket each in his first two overs. Two days after ripping apart Peshawar Zal­mi, they scythed through the Sultans and bundled them out for 89 with only skipper Mohammad Rizwan offering a semblance of resistance.
The Gladiators then cruised to their target  off just 41 balls without losing a wicket — skipper Saud Shakeel hitting four sixes and three fours in a 20-ball 42 and Finn Allen striking five sixes and two fours in a 21-ball 45 — to climb up to second place in the standings.
On a pitch laid using soil from Western Australia and offering bounce, the Sultans — who are now only mathematically in the playoffs race — never got going after they had been put into bat.
Fast bowler Khurram (4-23) struck with the first ball he delivered; opener Yasir Khan spooning a catch to Mohammad Wasim Jr at mid-on. Three balls later, he was followed by Usman Khan, who tried to hit his way out of pressure but only found Mohammad Amir at mid-on.
 


The incoming Kamran Ghulam saw Hassan Nawaz drop a sitter on the last ball of the third over but was gone next ball as Khurram returned to have him caught at slip and then had Curtis Campher lbw four balls later; the Sultans in all sorts of trouble at 20-4 before ending the powerplay with no further losses but the scoreboard reading just 31.
Opener Rizwan was running out of partners and soon lost another when Faheem — on the back of a five-wicket haul against Zalmi — came into the attack; Iftikhar Ahmed going long only to be caught in the deep in the eighth over before Michael Bracewell edged to the keeper in the 10th as the Sultans reached the midway point of their innings at 47-6.
Such was the Gladiators’ dominance that the Sultans couldn’t even capitalise on missed chances. Abrar Ahmed had dropped David Willey in the 12th over off Mohammad Amir but made amends when he settled under a skier from the Englishman in the next over by Wasim.
Number eight batter Usama Mir finally got the first six of the innings in the 14th over, hitting Faheem over the square leg fence, having cut the bowler away for four the previous delivery as the Sultans looked for a late flourish.
But Usama (11), the only Sultans batter to reach double figures apart from Rizwan, was run out on the first ball of the next over. Another run out followed soon after, seeing Mohammad Hasnain return to the dugout.
Rizwan, who made a painstaking run-a-ball 44 not out with just four fours, pulled away Wasim for the only six of his stay but the fast bowler soon put the Sultans out of their misery when he had last man Ubaid Shah caught behind with the last ball of the 17th over.
Quetta began their chase tentatively, just eight runs coming off the first two overs with just one four by Allen. But once they made sure there were no demons on the pitch, the Sultans were thrashed to all parts; Allen depositing Willey for two sixes and a four in the third over and Saud getting a six and a four off the next by Hasnain.
Any flickering Sultans hopes had been extinguished and as Saud got going, it became a matter of how soon the Gladiators would win. Ubaid was hit for two sixes and a four in the fifth over by Saud, who then hit another six and a four off the sixth over by Hasnain.
Allen also hit a six in the same over as the Gladiators ended the powerplay at 74-0 before the New Zealander ended the game with a couple more big hits off Usama in the seventh over.

During a public hearing on Tuesday presided over by Chairman National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Waseem Mukhtar, representatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) said there was the possibility of increasing monthly fuel cost adjustments in the coming months given 20pc higher load demand and lower hydropower availability.
Responding to a question, a case officer of Nepra reported that the impact of about Rs52bn reduction in quarterly tariff adjustments would be about Rs1.52 per unit for the coming three months — May, June and July. Conveners representing export sector demanded that its application should come into force in April to June for which the prime minister had announced and on that basis they had booked export orders.
Nepra did not go beyond the earlier explanation of its application for May to July but it was evident that April bills were already out in some areas and could not be called back.

Consumers will not see relief in their April bills as promised by PM Shehbaz

The Nepra chairman disallowed representatives of Hyderabad, Multan and Quetta electric supply companies for the absence of their senior leadership and called for their explanations.
Mr Mukhtar also expressed displeasure over the absence of power division representation and directed that a letter should also be written to the federal secretary of power.
The CPPA reported about 4.4pc increase in power consumption in March over last year and sought about Rs1.52 per unit negative quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for the January-March 2025 period and another three paise per unit negative fuel price adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in March.
The Rs1.51 per unit negative QTA, involving a total of Rs51.5bn already overcharged by all Discos for the third quarter of FY25, was already made part of the tariff reduction announced by the prime minister for three months –April to June 2025.
The lower QTA stems from a combination of lower capacity charges, operations and maintenance costs, fixed costs on account of incremental sales and fewer system losses mainly because of relative stability in the exchange rate and decline in interest rates.
The decline in fuel cost is mainly because of substantially higher costs allowed by Nepra through a 20pc increase in base tariff effective July 1, 2024. About 75pc of the total power supply during March came from domestic fuel sources, almost 20pc of that at zero fuel cost.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for negative adjustment of fuel cost for March, said the power consumption was 4.4pc higher than the same month last year and almost 22pc higher than February. It reported that electricity delivered to Discos stood at 8,114 gigawatt hours (GWh) in March against 6,666 GWh in February.
The power companies have claimed in their petitions that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs9.22 per unit in March compared to Rs9.34 per unit in the same month last year.
The CPPA said about 8,409 GWh of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs79.5bn (Rs9.46 per unit) in March, of which 8,114GWh energy was delivered to Discos at a cost of Rs74.85bn (at Rs9.22 per unit). However, the reference fuel cost already charged in March stood at Rs9.256 per unit, hence a refund of three paise per unit.
Hydropower lost its top position with about 15.42pc share in the overall grid owing to unfavourable hydrological conditions. Last year, hydropower contributed 28pc electricity to the grid in March. Nuclear energy emerged as the largest electricity supplier to the national grid with 26.4pc share.
The third biggest share in the national grid came RLNG at 18.17pc, followed by local coal at 16.57pc. This was followed by 11.64pc share from local local gas. Imported coal contributed 6.5pc to the national grid.

The leakage in main supply line is set to add to water woes of residents in most parts of the city as they would suffer nearly 40 per cent water shortage for the next four days due to the ensuing repair works.
The affected neighborhoods include Chanesar Town, Jinnah Town, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad, Pak Colony, Golimar, Shershah, Old City Area, Landhi, Korangi, and PAF Base Masroor.
The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) will get 400 MGD water out of regular supply of 650MGD due to repair work on the Siphon No. 19, the 84-inch diameter pipeline that developed the leakage near Karachi University.
KWSC spokesman Abdul Qadir Shaikh said that the repair work was expected to be completed in 96 hours and water supply to different parts of the city would be partially suspended.

Campus inundated; repair work will take several days, says official

He said that the leak developed on Tuesday morning, prompting swift emergency action by the water utility. The repair would cause partial disruption in water supply in various areas of the city, he added.
He said that KWSC Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui had directed the relevant teams to begin repair work without delay.
He said that the water supply from the Dhabeji Pumping Station had been suspended immediately after the leakage and the repair work would start as and when the water receded. “To ensure the safety of repair crews and facilitate the operation efficiently, water pressure in the affected pipeline has been temporarily reduced,” he added.
The spokesperson said that the full-scale repair activities had already commenced and would continue uninterrupted around the clock.
The water utility advised the people to store water in advance and use it carefully to avoid any inconvenience.

On Monday night, Canada delivered a verdict that seemed less an embrace of Mark Carney and more a desperate clinging to the idea that someone — anyone — could out-think Donald Trump.
Carney, the rookie Liberal leader once better known for polishing interest rate forecasts than kissing babies, managed the improbable: he steered the battered Liberal Party to a fourth consecutive mandate. If not quite a coronation, it was nonetheless a remarkable reversal of fortune in a political landscape that had seemed destined, mere months ago, to turn Tory blue.
Victory, however, came with an asterisk. The Liberals are perched at 168 seats — enough to govern, but short of the 172 needed for a majority. Carney will lead a minority government, where survival will depend on managing a fractured parliament.
The election, a compressed five-week sprint, had been pitched as an epic duel between Carney’s supposed steadiness and Pierre Poilievre’s populist fervour. In the end, neither man’s vision truly captured Canadian hearts. Instead, it was Donald Trump, Canada’s accidental kingmaker, who overshadowed all.

With a fractured parliament at home and a belligerent Trump abroad, new PM now faces a daunting road ahead

Trump’s incendiary musings about annexation, his tariffs on Canadian goods, and his open contempt for Canadian sovereignty spooked voters more effectively than any Liberal attack ad could. A contest that would have been about housing affordability and carbon taxes turned into a referendum on national survival.
 
 

In an eerie echo of old fears, Carney sounded the alarm across the land: America is trying to break us so they can own us.
The Liberals’ campaign, with Carney at the helm, became less about Trudeau’s legacy and more about existential dread. The message: steady hands were needed to navigate the storm.
It worked — just enough to secure another mandate.
It is tempting to paint Carney as a man forged by the moment. A political outsider, coaxed into leadership by a desperate party. The narrative writes itself, and Carney leaned into it: “My government will work for and with everyone,” he declared early Tuesday morning, promising to heal divisions and govern for all Canadians.
But the shiny technocratic armour came with dents. Throughout the campaign, Carney struggled to reconcile his carefully crafted image of competence with the blood sport of electoral politics. And while voters may have ultimately chosen his brand of managerial steadiness over Poilievre’s ideological fury, it was no sweeping endorsement. The Liberals squeaked past, not soared.
For a man whose career had been built in the vaulted halls of global finance, the House of Commons will feel claustrophobic.
Meanwhile, Pierre Poilievre, who had appeared just months ago to be on the verge of a major breakthrough, faced a significant setback in his own backyard.
Losing ground to Liberal Bruce Fanjoy in Carleton, Poilievre delivered a concession speech with the tone of a politician determined to regroup and re-engage. The Conservatives may have lost the election, but they made tangible gains, particularly in Ontario, where they clawed back blue-collar ridings and suburban belts.
The irony? Poilievre was punished not for fighting Trump, but for not knowing how. His early campaign was a confused mess — one part MAGA cosplay, one part grievance-mongering — while Trump steamrolled his way into the centre of the Canadian electoral conversation.
By the time Poilievre tried to pivot, it was too late.
And then there was Jagmeet Singh — the man who lost not just his party’s relevance but his own seat.
The NDP’s collapse, especially in BC and Atlantic Canada, turned the 2025 election into a two-party race. Singh, ever the optimist, defended his legacy even as he walked off the stage. But there was no mistaking the NDP’s irrelevance; Canada’s progressive heartland shifted, not left or right, but inward — voting for survival in an age of trade wars and nationalist sabre-rattling.
Singh’s resignation was not a shock. It was an inevitability.
Carney now inherits a challenging mandate. His task: to stare down a belligerent US president while holding together a minority parliament that may not share his urgency or priorities.

Domestically, he has pledged to end interprovincial trade barriers, build infrastructure, and craft a unified economic policy. Lofty promises. Delivering them will require dealing with a parliament where support is tenuous, and enemies lie in wait.
Internationally, he must sit across from Donald Trump and navigate a negotiation that often feels more like a hostage situation.
Carney’s much-vaunted technocratic competence may keep the wolves at bay for now. But competence alone rarely stirs lasting loyalty. And as history shows, minority governments in Canada often falter — whether through ambition or inertia.
The Liberals have bought themselves time. How long it lasts, and at what cost, is still to be seen.
In an election shaped by uncertainty and hard choices, Canadians have once again opted for caution over upheaval.
The coming months will test whether this can deliver the stability Canadians hope for.

Addressing a press conference at the bypass, Ka­­rachi Bar Association Pre­sident Amir Nawaz Wara­ich and Sindh High Court Bar Association President Sarfraz Ali Metlo said the decision to end the sit-in was made after receiving assurances from the government and the issuance of an official notification addressing their concerns.
They confirmed that the notification issued by the government incorporated all points raised by the lawyers’ community. Based on this, the lawyers’ committee decided to end the protest, they said, adding that further meetings regarding the canals issue will continue.
The lawyers’ leaders said the government had pledged to provide the ne­­cessary legal documentation by May 7.

Traffic restored on National Highway after protest camps removed

These documents will detail all matters related to the legal and professional rig­hts of lawyers. Following this as­­surance, the lawyers’ committee expressed satisfaction with the outcome.
The lawyers reiterated their commitment to def­ending national interests and pledged that the legal community would maintain an active role in monitoring the government’s implementation of its pro­mises.
 
 

They expres­sed hope that similar issues would not arise in the future and that lawyers’ rights would be fully safeguarded. They descri­bed their movement as a successful struggle ag­­­­a­­i­nst injustices done to Sindh.
The lawyers’ leaders appealed to their colleagues to return to their professional responsibilities, highlighting the importance of unity in resolving national issues through dialogue.
Meanwhile, the process of dismantling protest camps began, and two-way traffic was restored on the National Highway.
Earlier, the Sindh government delegation held talks with the lawyers’ co­­mmittee at the High Court Bar Association office in Sukkur. The delegation was led by Law Minister Zia Lanjar and included District Council Chairman Kumail Haidar Shah, Suk­kur Commissio­ner Fayyaz Abbasi and Deputy Com­missioner M.B. Dharejo.
The lawyers were represented by Amir Nawaz Waraich, Sarfraz Ali Metlo, Qurban Ali Malano and others.
After the meeting, Zia Lanjar and Kumail Shah held a joint press conference. “We came here for negotiations with the lawyers’ committee and appe­aled to our friends to end the sit-in at Babarloi Bypass,” Mr Lanjar said.

The court announced the discharge of 11 individuals, including Mr Ash­raf, in the long-running Karkey Ship Rental Power reference, where the Nat­ional Accountability Bur­eau had alleged corruption amounting to Rs22 billion.
The Turkish energy com­pany involved, Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uret­­im A.S., had also filed a $1.2bn arbitration claim against Pakistan at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The claim was later withdrawn, reportedly following backchannel negotiations facilitated by the Pakistani government.
In a second reference concerning the Bakhi Power Project in Sheikhu­pura, the court discharged six more individuals, in­­c­luding a former chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).
Separately, in the Sha­rqpur Power Project reference, the court acquitted all accused, effectively closing proceedings in all three major cases.
The Rental Power Pro­jects were introduced during the PPP’s tenure to ad­­dress the chronic power shortages plaguing the co­­untry. However, the initiative was marred by widespread allegations of corruption, inefficiency and lack of transparency.

Barrister Aqeel Malik, the minister of state for Law and Justice, told Reuters that the government was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, which is the treaty’s facilitator.
It is also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it could argue that India has violated the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Barrister Aqeel said, adding that a decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon”, and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.

Barrister Aqeel says issue will be taken up on multiple fronts; SCBA forms body to provide legal assistance in the matter

Indian officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request seeking comment.
 
 

New Delhi had last week held the World Bank-mediated Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 in abeyance after an attack in the Pahalgam tourist resort in occupied Kashmir, saying the suspension would last until “Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
Islamabad flatly denies any involvement in the attack, and in response to New Delhi’s actions, also suspended all trade and closed its airspace to Indian airlines.
Barrister Aqeel added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he told Reuters.
“The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is no provision within the treaty,” said Malik.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months and farmers, already hit by climate-change related water shortages, have raised concerns.
SCBA body to assist govt
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has constituted a committee to provide legal assistance to the federal government to help raise the issue of Indus Water Treaty of 1960 at appropriate forums.
The committee will be chaired by its president along with SCBA Secretary Salman Mansoor, Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Mir Attaullah Langove, Sindh High Court Bar Association President Barrister Sarfraz Metlo, as well as Barrister M.H. Subhani and Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar.
In a statement, the country’s apex body of lawyers said it remains steadfast in its role as a watchdog for the protection of fundamental rights, adherence to international treaties and the preservation of national dignity and sovereignty.
 
 

Beyond being a formal accord, the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 is essential to Pakistan’s very existence and prosperity.
The treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank, expressly asserts that none of its signatories can unilaterally terminate, withdraw from, or hold it in abeyance, the statement said.
Yet, India has suspended this very treaty in contravention of international laws, the statement said, adding that the association viewed the unilateral suspension of the treaty as an unnecessary move, aimed at disrupting the downstream water flow.

In an official statement issued on Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission condemned the latest attack, which took place at approximately 5:18am on April 27.
The assailant, identified by British police as Ankit Love, reportedly hurled stones and splashed saffron paint on the outer wall of the High Commission, shattering several windows and staining the building’s nameplate. He was apprehended shortly after the incident by the Metropolitan Police.
The High Commission linked the act of vandalism to a larger, more aggressive protest that occurred days earlier on April 25, involving members of the Indian and British Indian community.

UK minister calls for calm among diaspora communities

Protesters shouted anti-Pakistan and Islamophobic slogans, and clashed with law enforcers.
 
 

“We expect that the British law enforcement agencies would prosecute Ankit, as well as the raucous protesters detained on Friday, in accordance with the relevant British laws,” the statement said.
Expressing concern over the escalating hostility, the statement from the mission reminded the UK government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic missions. It also reiterated its demand for enhanced security at Pakistani diplomatic posts across the UK.
“This is not the first incident where the High Commission of Pakistan or our Consulates in the United Kingdom have been attacked,” the statement read.
The Pakistan High Commission confirmed it is in contact with British police to obtain further details about Ankit Love, whose nationality has not yet been disclosed.
Reuters adds: Meanwhile, UK Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has called for calm between Indian and Pakistani communities, after lawmakers voiced concerns that tensions over the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir could spill into the diaspora.
“These issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets  and we call on sides, all community leaders, all involved to call for  calm at a time of tension in the region,” Hamish  Falconer told parliament.
Falconer appeared in parliament to answer an urgent question  on the situation, where lawmakers raised concerns about media reports of  ill-tempered protests outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions in London.
The British government’s long-standing position is that India and Pakistan are responsible for finding a solution to the situation in held Kashmir that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he told parliament.

• PPP lawmaker endorses call for Imran’s participation in proposed multi-party moot
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate, as he concluded his speech in the Senate on the recent tensions with India and diplomatic overtures deployed by Islamabad to contest New Delhi’s allegations in light of the Pahalgam attack.
The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country.
The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message.
 
 

PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail.
However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom.
Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue.
Stern response
Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakis­tan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack.
Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns.
He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis.
“I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances.
“I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].”
According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.
Meanwhile, the House unanimously passed “The Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (Implementation) Bill, 2025” and “The National Commission for Minorities’ Rights Bill 2025 brought before it as a supplementary agenda.

ISLAMABAD: Military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tues­day accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Lt Gen Chaudhry was sp­e­aking at a press conference convened to show “how India is executing” terrorism inside Pakistan and said terrorism was the “basic thing” in the ongoing tense phase of ties bet­ween the neighbours. Pak­is­tan and India downgra­d­ed ties after tensions spi­ked in light of the April 22 att­ack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed.
“It has been seven days since the Pahalgam att­ack, yet not a single shred of evidence has been provided to substantiate the baseless allegations levelled against Pakistan,” Gen Chaudhry said.
Based on intelligence ava­ilable with the Pakis­tani security agencies, he claimed India had activa­ted its terror networks to carry out attacks inside Pakistan.

“…they tasked all their assets, terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Kha­w­arij (the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan) and the ind­e­pen­dent terrorist cell like one presented today to inc­r­ease their activity,” he said.
He specifically cited the killing of 54 TTP fighters — described as the largest ever in a single incident — during a recent cross-border attack attempt from Afg­hanistan. He said the attack by the TTP’s largest formation, or “Tashkeel”, was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.
India’s terror network
Gen Chaudhry provided details of Abdul Majeed, a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India, who was arrested last Fri­day (April 25) and linked to one of the terror networks.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said. He added that the evidence could be examined by any independent agency.
According to Gen Chaudhry, Majeed was apprehended from a bus terminal in Jhelum, where he was planning to carry out an attack. “An IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered from him,” he said.

Investigations revealed that the network he was a part of included four Ind­ian military personnel in addition to Majeed. These Indian operatives were part of Indian military intelligence.
Majeed was allegedly recruited by Major Sandeep, an officer stationed in India-occupied Kashmir. His handler was identified as Subedar Sukvinder, a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian Army. Major Sandeep and Subedar Sukvinder were said to have tasked and guided Majeed. Other network members included Havildar Amit, also known as Adil Aman, and an unidentified Indian soldier.
Intercepted conversations between Majeed and his handlers were also played during the briefing and a timeline of Majeed’s activities and the funds he received was also shared. Majeed is accused of involvement in four sabotage attempts, including a botched one.
The first IED was delivered to Majeed last September in Parnala, Bhimber district. He used it to attack a military vehicle on Oct 13 in Pir Kanthi, Bagh district, injuring three Pakistan Army soldiers. He received Rs180,000 for the attack.
The second IED was delivered on Nov 22 near Head Marala. The drone used in the operation crashed, and its wreckage was retrieved by Majeed. He later used the device to attack a military vehicle in Jalalpur Jattan, resulting in four “casualties.” For this, he received Rs656,000.
On March 18, Majeed planned a third IED attack near Kotli. He became cautious after observing troop movements in the area. The following day, local schoolchildren discovered and reported a suspicious package. Two IEDs were recovered from the site.
Following the recovery, Indian media falsely claimed that five bombs had been discovered in occupied Kashmir, which Gen Chaudhry dismissed as “blatant propaganda.” The fourth IED was delivered near Nadala on April 22. Majeed was instructed to target a bus station in Barnala or Bhimber, but he instead suggested Jhelum due to higher passenger traffic.
“While he was in Jhelum to do this nefarious act of terrorism, he was apprehended by law enforcement agencies,” Gen Chaudhry said. “What’s this happening? And they are serving officers, serving JCOs, serving NCOs. This is what you call state-sponsored cross-border terrorism,” he added.
‘Credible evidence’
In a late-night statement, Federal Minister for Information Atta Tarar warned that India intended to launch military action against Pakistan.
Using the baseless allegations levelled in the wake of the Pahalgam attack as a justification, India could try to launch an incursion within the next 24-36 hours, he said.
The international community should realise that India would solely be responsibility for any destruction in the case of a conflict, he said.
 


Separately, Pakistan Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffar Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release.
As per the statement, Pakistan possessed “credible evidence establishing that the attack on the Jaffar Express passenger train — in which at least 30 Pakistani nationals were slain and dozens taken hostage — was externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), three terrorists were killed during an operation near Turbat in Kech district. The operation was launched based on intelligence about the presence of militants in the area.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively eng­a­ged the khawarij location, as a res­ult of which, three terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a sta­tement, adding that a heavy exc­h­ange of fire took place between sec­urity forces and armed terrorists.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who the ISPR said were involved in numerous attacks against security forces and the killing of civilians.

PM praises security forces, terms terrorists enemies of peace

“A sanitisation operation was conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are det­e­rmined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” it said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operation in Kech. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, he lauded the professionalism and bravery displayed by the troops and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to eradicating terrorism.
The terrorists are enemies of peace in Balochistan and oppon­e­nts of the province’s prosperity, he said, adding that the governm­ent would continue the journey of progress and development. The prime minister also reiterated that the entire nation stands by the security forces in defence of the motherland.
Ziarat IBO
In a separate incident, security forces killed seven   terrorists during an operation conducted on intelligence reports in the Choteer area of Ziarat district.
 
 

Officials said the targeted operation took place between the Chot­eer and Sanjavi areas between Mon­day night and early Tuesday. Armed militants hiding in the area opened fire on the security forces, who retaliated after taking positions.
“Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours, during which hand grenades were also used by the militants,” an official said, adding that seven bodies were recovered from the area once the firing ceased.
Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani confirmed the deaths and said the bodies were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Ziarat, by Levies personnel.
He said residents had earlier blocked the Sanjavi-Ziarat road in protest against the presence of militants in the area, suspending all traffic. They initially refused to reopen the road despite negotiations by the assistant commissioner.
However, following talks led by Deputy Commissioner Durrani, the protesters agreed to end their blockade and traffic was restored in the afternoon.
