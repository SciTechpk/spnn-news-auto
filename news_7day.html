The premier will visit Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the Foreign Office. The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.
The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, according to the FO.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.
While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.
As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had conveyed his solidarity to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.
Following the tit-for-tat airbase attacks and a US-brokered ceasefire between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “warmly congratulated PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
Iran had also offered to mediate during the escalation and paid a visit to both Islamabad and New Delhi in peace efforts, which were appreciated by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.
 
 

The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people cancelled their holidays in popular resorts in the two countries.
The moves intensified as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.
Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.
PM Shehbaz’s tour adds to Pakistan’s spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.
Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were “exchanged on current regional situation”.
The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project, the FO said.
They expressed the hope that the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project would be finalised soon.
 






A high-level diplomatic delegation is also set to visit important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” Radio Pakistan had said.</p><small>2025-05-25 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6831f161c4429.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913086/the-night-bitten-dawn-of-the-fata-merger' target='_blank'><strong>THE NIGHT-BITTEN DAWN OF THE FATA MERGER</strong></a><br><p>For Najibullah Wazir, a resident of North Waziristan, May 28, 2018, marked a historic turning point. On that day, Pakistan’s Parliament passed the 25th Constitutional Amendment, formally abolishing the colonial-era Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) and merging the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The decision was hailed as a watershed moment — an end to more than a century of legal and political exclusion for the region’s residents.
The merger held out the promise of equal rights, access to courts, regular policing, improved infrastructure, and civic inclusion. For young voices such as Wazir, who had long advocated for the mainstreaming of Fata, it signified the dawn of a new chapter. “We believed we would finally be treated as citizens, not subjects,” he recalls. “They promised us development, peace and justice.”
Seven years later, those promises remain largely unfulfilled. Despite legislative success, the implementation has faltered, undermined by bureaucratic inertia, political ambiguity and chronic funding shortfalls.
“We were betrayed,” Wazir says flatly. “Forget roads and hospitals. Our only demand now is security. We cannot survive being caught between Taliban militants and another military operation.”
Field observations and local interviews reveal a growing sense of frustration and abandonment. The hopes of rapid development have been eclipsed by rising insecurity, especially since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which revitalised cross-border militancy. Incomplete infrastructure, poorly resourced courts and police, and stalled public services underscore the state’s limited presence.

The May 28, 2018 merger of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas into Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was meant to herald the abolition of colonial-era governance, and provide equal rights to their citizens, as well as access to courts, regular policing, improved infrastructure and civic inclusion. Seven years on,  many of those promises remain unfulfilled. Eos looks at the reasons why discontent is rising…

Exacerbating the crisis, international aid cuts, especially following the Trump administration’s reorientation of US foreign policy, have disrupted critical stabilisation projects.
This piece evaluates the outcomes of the 2018 Fata-KP merger, questioning whether the legal victory has translated into substantive change. It situates the issue within broader historical and geopolitical contexts, highlighting the urgent need for structural reform and sustained engagement.
COLONIAL LEGACY AND TRANSITION
The roar of trucks bound for Afghanistan echoing through the Khyber Pass marks a route that has been a corridor of trade, migration and imperial ambition for centuries. This vital artery slices through the Khyber, one of the seven former tribal districts that had made the erstwhile Fata a region steeped in history. 
British colonial engagement with the region began in the 19th century, culminating in the establishment of the Khyber Agency in the 1870s, the first formal administrative unit in what later became Fata. Situated at the crossroads of British India, Afghanistan and the Russian Empire, the region was treated by colonial authorities as a buffer zone rather than an integral part of the state. The demarcation of the 19th-century Durand Line institutionalised this strategic ambiguity, by creating a semi-autonomous tribal belt.
 
 

Initially, the British established four agencies — Khyber, Kurram, South Waziristan and North Waziristan. The Fata region expanded after Pakistan gained independence, with the addition of Mohmand in 1951, Bajaur in 1971 and Orakzai in 1973, the latter being the only agency not bordering Afghanistan. 
Following the merger in 2018, these seven agencies were merged into KP and re-designated as the Newly Merged Districts (NMDs) of KP for administrative purposes, alongside six Frontier Regions (FRs) that were incorporated into adjacent districts of KP.
Covering roughly 27,000 square kilometres — less than five percent of Pakistan’s territory — the former Fata area is home to over five million people. However, this figure remains contested, with significant displacement caused by conflict and military operations, leading to widespread migration to urban centres.
GOVERNED WITHOUT RIGHTS
For Muhammad Shoaib, a construction material trader from Mohmand, an incident in 2002 remains vivid. “A man was killed near our farmland and, under the FCR’s collective responsibility clause, 30 of our men — including my father and brothers — were detained,” he recalls. “We were punished until the culprits were produced. It’s a long story — how much we suffered, how long we were imprisoned and how many homes were demolished.”
Shoaib’s experience is a powerful illustration of the arbitrary and punitive governance under the FCR, a colonial-era legal framework introduced by the British in the late 19th century. Enacted to control the strategically sensitive Pakhtun frontier and quell tribal resistance, the FCR institutionalised collective punishment, allowing entire communities to be penalised for the actions of a single individual. Suspects were denied access to formal courts, with tribal jirgas replacing due process.
The British emphasised control over inclusion, granting sweeping powers to Political Agents (PAs) and tribal elites (Maliks), who operated with near-total impunity. Legal rights and civil liberties were systematically curtailed.
In a recent scholarly article, Dr Adeel Malik, an academic at the University of Oxford, alongside Rinchan Ali Mirza and Faiz Ur Rehman, critiques the enduring legacy of colonial governance. They reference Sir Olaf Caroe, a former colonial administrator, who observed that “the line of administration stopped like a tide almost at the first contour” of the frontier. They argue that this “rule of difference” created a profound institutional discontinuity, legally disenfranchising the frontier population and excluding them from the broader judicial and electoral frameworks of the state.
Following Independence in 1947, successive Pakistani governments maintained this colonial structure. The constitutions of 1956, 1962 and 1973 all preserved Fata’s exceptional status. Though the FCR underwent amendments, its coercive core persisted.
THE COLD WAR’S GEOPOLITICAL LEGACY
During a 2022 visit to Tari Mangal, a Sunni-majority village near the Gavi border crossing near Parachinar in Kurram, I encountered an unsettling silence. Once a vibrant market town, it now stood in quiet ruin, with shuttered shops and dilapidated buildings marking the passage of time. In 2023, the village once again made headlines when seven Shia teachers were killed in a sectarian attack, underscoring the persistent sectarian tensions in the region.
Tari Mangal’s strategic location made it a key transit point during the Cold War. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the village became a vital corridor for Afghan mujahideen fighters backed by the US, Pakistan and Arab states. This shift turned the village into a target for Soviet and Afghan retaliatory strikes.
The broader Fata region became the epicentre of Cold War covert operations. Hundreds of madressahs [religious seminaries] and training camps were established, channelling fighters into Afghanistan. “Fata had transformed into a launch pad for one of the largest covert operations in modern history,” noted a former Pakistani diplomat.
In From Muhajir to Mujahid, Dr Fazal-ur-Rahim Marwat, a Peshawar-based academic, records that the number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan rose from 400,000 within days of the Soviet invasion to over 3.2 million by 1990. Though Pakistan was not party to international refugee conventions, it managed the crisis independently. The Afghan Cell and Commissionerate categorised refugees into ‘muhajireen’ [refugees] and ‘mujahideen’ [freedom fighters], though this distinction was often blurred. Publicly, it was claimed that refugees resided in settled areas, while the mujahideen were based in tribal regions. In practice, however, these distinctions were often blurred, according to Marwat. 
Niyaz Ahmed Karbalai, a community elder from Parachinar, recalls how Afghan refugees settled on Shia-owned land in the 1980s. “Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hizb-i-Islami set up a training centre there,” he says. “Not only were attacks launched into Afghanistan, but sectarian harmony in Kurram also began to unravel.”
Following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, Afghanistan plunged into civil war among rival mujahideen factions. Pakistan continued backing the ‘Peshawar Seven’, a coalition of Sunni Afghan groups, which established further camps in Fata.
As the Taliban rose in the 1990s, recruits from Pakistani madressahs and tribal areas once again flowed into Afghanistan, reinforcing Pakistan’s influence in shaping its neighbour’s future. Meanwhile, Fata itself descended into lawlessness, becoming a breeding ground for arms smuggling, kidnappings and criminal networks — legacies of a Cold War fought on its soil.

FATA POST-9/11
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Fata region underwent profound transformations that redefined both its internal dynamics and its geopolitical significance. Located along the porous border with Afghanistan, Fata’s rugged terrain and minimal state presence rendered it an ideal sanctuary for Al-Qaeda operatives and Afghan Taliban fighters escaping US-led military offensives in Afghanistan. As American forces dismantled Taliban strongholds across the Durand Line, waves of militants infiltrated Fata, often welcomed by sympathetic local elements. 
The influx of foreign and local militants began to reshape the socio-political order of the region. With the central government largely absent and traditional tribal structures already weakened, these groups filled the power vacuum. The situation reached a critical juncture after the Lal Masjid operation in Islamabad in July 2007, which sparked a nationwide radicalisation and served as a rallying point for militant factions. In December that year, Baitullah Mehsud consolidated various insurgent outfits under the banner of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), formalising a militant umbrella organisation that entrenched itself across Fata.
The TTP’s ascendancy marked the collapse of the traditional tribal governance model. Tribal elders, or maliks, who once mediated conflicts and upheld customary law, became prime targets of assassination campaigns aimed at dismantling any alternative authority. Fata quickly became emblematic of global jihadist activity. By 2009, then-US President Barack Obama famously referred to the region as “the most dangerous place in the world.”
Efforts by the Pakistani state to regain control alternated between military operations and peace deals, often with limited success. It was not until Operation Zarb-i-Azb in 2014, following the TTP’s attack on Karachi airport, that a concerted and sustained military campaign began to roll back insurgent strongholds, signalling a critical shift in Pakistan’s counterterrorism strategy.
By 2018, the Pakistani government declared a significant victory over the TTP, characterising the outcome as a transformation from being “victims of terrorism” to emerging as “victors” in the fight against militancy. 
PUSH FOR REFORM IN FATA
In a modest hall in Islamabad on a cold winter day in 2016, an NGO convened a rare gathering to address one of Pakistan’s most intricate political questions: the future of Fata.
The event brought together a diverse array of voices from the tribal areas — Pakhtun nationalists, maliks, federal and religious party leaders, civil society representatives and youth activists. I was present, covering the event as a journalist, closely observing the discussions — tense, impassioned, yet filled with cautious optimism.
The dialogue was part of a broader momentum that began after the federal government, led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), established a Sartaj Aziz-led committee in 2015. Tasked with exploring political, legal and economic integration options for Fata, the committee worked against the backdrop of ongoing military operations, particularly Operation Zarb-i-Azb.
The relative stability that followed the military offensive created space for reform-oriented dialogue. Pressure mounted both domestically and internationally. Western diplomats viewed administrative reforms in Fata as critical to long-term counterterrorism efforts and regional stability.
Consensus on the need for reform was evident at the meeting, yet the visions for that reform diverged sharply. Pakhtun nationalist parties, particularly the Awami National Party, strongly supported a full merger with KP, arguing that tribal communities were already deeply linked to KP’s urban centres for education, healthcare and employment.
Opposing them were tribal politicians advocating for a separate Fata province. “Why should we tie ourselves to KP, which has struggled with its own governance challenges for decades?” said one tribal leader. Many of these figures had long operated outside party structures, securing influence through tribal networks and financial means.
A third group favoured establishing a semi-autonomous Fata Council, modelled after Gilgit-Baltistan’s governance system. They believed a locally elected council could preserve tribal identity while initiating incremental reform.
Yet, a fourth segment resisted any form of structural change. Comprising political agents, select bureaucrats and traditional maliks, this group benefitted from the status quo and saw in its continuity the preservation of their power and privilege.
Following extensive consultations with stakeholders, the Sartaj Aziz-led committee submitted its report in August 2016, recommending the full integration of Fata with KP. The proposal aimed to dismantle the colonial-era FCR and bring Fata under Pakistan’s constitutional and administrative framework.

MERGER WITH KP
The culmination of this reform initiative came on May 24, 2018, when the 25th Constitutional Amendment Bill was introduced in the National Assembly. It received overwhelming parliamentary support, though two political parties — the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — opposed the bill.
The following day, the Senate endorsed the bill and, shortly thereafter, the KP Provincial Assembly approved it as well. On May 31, 2018, then-President Mamnoon Hussain signed the amendment bill into law, formally merging Fata with KP and ending its distinct legal status rooted in British colonial rule.
In the aftermath of the merger, significant administrative changes were implemented. The traditional role of PAs was abolished, with these officials re-designated as deputy commissioners (DCs), and their subordinates as assistant commissioners — aligning the administrative hierarchy with the rest of the country. Moreover, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Peshawar High Court was extended to the region. District and sessions courts began to be established, gradually integrating the judicial framework.
To support this transition, the federal government announced a phased integration strategy. A five-year plan was introduced to mainstream the tribal districts, anchored by a Rs 1 trillion, 10-year development package. The National Economic Council approved this in principle, and provincial governments, though initially reluctant, agreed to contribute according to their National Finance Commission (NFC) shares.
The merger marked a historic milestone, offering the long-marginalised population of Fata access to political representation, constitutional rights, and a pathway to socio-economic development within the national mainstream.
UNFULFILLED PROMISES
Despite the historic merger, many of the commitments made to the people of the former Fata remain unfulfilled. 
In late March 2025, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a letter to President Asif Ali Zardari, urging the immediate convening of the long overdue 10th NFC meeting. He cited constitutional obligations and fiscal disparities that emerged following the merger, stressing the need for an equitable redistribution of national resources.
 
 

This demand reflects a broader discontent over the slow and uneven implementation of the federal government’s post-merger promises. Although the 2018 reform package included a five-year mainstreaming plan and a 10-year development program worth Rs one trillion, actual disbursements and outcomes have lagged. For many residents, the merger’s promise of full political, legal and economic inclusion remains elusive.
This month, Muzammil Aslam, adviser on finance to the KP chief minister, said that KP was facing a Rs 42 billion shortfall in federal divisible pool receipts during February to May of the current fiscal year. Discussing the NMDs, he noted that, although Rs 69 billion was allocated under the Accelerated Implementation Programme and Annual Development Programme, only Rs 22.5 billion had been released. Despite this, KP spent Rs 31 billion on development projects in the region.
Aslam criticised disparities in federal allocations, pointing out that, while Azad Jammu and Kashmir received a 50 percent budget increase and Gilgit-Baltistan 36 percent, the NMDs were allocated only Rs66 billion — far below the Rs 104 billion in actual expenditures. He also noted that, although police, judiciary and administrative services have been extended to the NMDs, the area remains understaffed. He called for ending the grant-in-aid system and including NMDs in the NFC Award.
Mohsin Dawar, a former MNA from North Waziristan, attributes the slow progress of the ex-Fata merger to a lack of prioritisation by the authorities and blamed both federal and provincial governments. 
“The central government has failed to release the promised share for the NMDs under the NFC Award for the KP province,” he says. “Meanwhile, the provincial government has not fully utilised the funds it received for the development of NMDs.” Dawar adds that residents widely demand a separate, transparently managed account for development funds, to ensure allocations are used exclusively for the uplift of the NMDs.
LONG ROAD TO INTEGRATION
“We inherited a region with no modern offices, no trained staff, and no systems,” recalled a KP official who once served as DC in an NMD. “Building governance from scratch while managing expectations has been overwhelming.”
Seven years after the FATA merger, progress remains painfully slow. Despite formal integration, the region continues to suffer from inadequate infrastructure, substandard public services and a fragile governance system.
The transition from the colonial-era FCR to Pakistan’s formal legal system promised justice and equality. Yet, due to insufficient judicial infrastructure and a lack of trained legal professionals, thousands of cases remain unresolved. “People don’t trust the new system,” says Malik Khanzeb Khan, a tribal elder from Khyber. “It’s slow, costly and distant.”
District courts have been established in select areas, but access to justice remains limited. Security concerns often hinder the functioning of courts, while the traditional jirga system continues to serve as the preferred dispute resolution mechanism, due to its familiarity and swiftness.
More than half the population lives below the poverty line. Health and education services remain underdeveloped, and roads linking these areas to the rest of the province are either damaged or incomplete.
Administrative reforms have also faltered. While political agents were formally rebranded as deputy commissioners, many residents claim their bureaucratic behavior remains unchanged. “They operate from outside and are barely accessible,” a local from Khyber laments. 
For many in the tribal belt, the promise of integration has yet to materialise into tangible change. “The merger was supposed to bring progress,” said one teacher in Kurram, “but our lives remain stuck in the past.”
RESURGENCE OF MILITANCY
In mid-April, amid growing unrest, a group of Mehsud tribesmen held a protest in South Waziristan against curfews and fears of renewed military operations. “We’ve already endured decades of war,” one speaker said. “Now we fear another operation is looming.”
Following the success of military operations such as Zarb-i-Azb, relative calm had returned. However, recent years have seen a resurgence in militancy, which now threatens both tribal and neighbouring settled districts of KP. Analysts attribute this escalation in part to the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. Militant groups such as the TTP and the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction have found renewed momentum and safe havens across the border. 
In Bajaur, the so-called Islamic State’s local affiliates pose a growing threat, while in Kurram, Shia neighbourhoods remain cut off from the rest of the country since November due to sectarian violence linked to unresolved land disputes, highlighting the fragile security landscape in the region. Compounding the issue is the fragile writ of the state and limited access to basic governance and services in these regions.
 
 

Militant attacks on security personnel, including soldiers and police officers, have increased. The integration of traditional paramilitary forces — Levies and Khasadars — into a formal police structure faces critical hurdles, particularly in terms of training and operational capacity.
These challenges have left the force ill-equipped to counter modern security threats. “In this environment,” the KP official admitted, “development in the NMDs has effectively stalled.”
DEMANDS FOR A REVERSAL
Frustration with slow reforms and deteriorating security has led to growing calls for reversing the merger. Some tribal elders and Islamist parties have demanded the restoration of the previous administrative system, a position echoed by the TTP during its negotiations with the government in 2021.
“Residents never demanded police, courts, or bureaucratic systems,” says Bismillah Afridi, a tribal elder leading the reversal campaign. “They only wanted reforms within the existing framework, by removing oppressive colonial laws.” 
However, experts warn that any reversal could jeopardise national security. “Reversing the merger would recreate ungoverned spaces,” says Naveed Ahmed Shinwari, author of Political and Social Change in Pakistan’s Tribal Areas. “These spaces have historically served as sanctuaries for militants, such as the TTP, and could seriously undermine counterterrorism efforts.”
Seven years after the merger, the NMDs represent a paradox of promise and paralysis. The constitutional shift was historic, but implementation has been marred by administrative delays, underfunded development and a lack of political will. The recent rise in militancy has only deepened public disillusionment.
Law enforcement remains underprepared, and promised development funds have either been delayed or mismanaged. For many residents, the transformative potential of the merger has yet to be realised. The state’s writ remains fragile in several areas, and public frustration is mounting. The future of the merger — and the stability of the region — hinges on the state’s ability to deliver on its promises. Without substantial, inclusive reforms and sustained development efforts, the risk of renewed unrest remains dangerously high.
As one university student from Kurram regretfully says, “We were promised a new dawn, but it still feels like the same long night.”

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
Earlier this week, two new cases of polio were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, taking the tally for the current year to 10.
“The Pakistan Polio Programme today launched its third National Immunisation Days (NIDs) campaign of the year at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad,” a statement from the Centre read.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.
“To mark the launch, Farooq administered oral polio vaccine and Vitamin A drops to children under five, reinforcing the government’s unwavering commitment to eradicating the crippling disease from every corner of the country,” the NEOC continued.
Scheduled to begin on May 26, the weeklong campaign aims to vaccinate over 45 million children under five, the statement noted, adding, “making [the drive] a critical intervention in Pakistan’s final push to interrupt poliovirus transmission and achieve eradication by the end of 2025”.
“Polio eradication is not just a health goal — it is a national imperative and a matter of immense pride for our country,” the statement quoted Farooq as saying.
“This third campaign of 2025 marks a decisive milestone in our 2-4-6 roadmap. These back-to-back rounds from September 2024 to May 2025 represent our most strategic opportunity to close immunity gaps and halt virus circulation before the high transmission season begins,” she added.
Farooq acknowledged that the persistent challenges in key reservoirs such as Karachi, South Khyber Pakhtunkwa, and Quetta Block, but noted encouraging progress in reaching previously underserved populations.
She also extended heartfelt appreciation to the 400,000 frontline workers powering the campaign — including 225,000 women vaccinators — and recognised the critical role of civil and military law enforcement in ensuring safe access to children.
“Despite major gains, wild poliovirus continues to pose a threat. Pakistan has confirmed 10 cases so far this year. Environmental surveillance has detected the virus in 272 sewage samples from 127 testing sites, across 68 districts, signalling continued circulation,” it added.
Speaking at the event, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil expressed confidence in the programme’s direction. As he concluded his tenure in Pakistan, Fadil commended the national leadership and Farooq for their tireless dedication to polio eradication.
“Pakistan is closer than ever to making history. With continued political will, community engagement, and coordinated action by all partners, I believe this country can soon achieve a polio-free future,” he said.
“The public is strongly encouraged to cooperate with vaccination teams and report any missed children via the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline 1166 or the WhatsApp,” the statement concluded.
Polio is a paralysing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children with high immunity against this terrible disease.
Pakistan has pledged to eradicate polio by the end of this year, Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal said earlier in the week during a meeting with the President of Global Development at the Gates Foundation Dr Chris Elias.
Attributing the recent progress to successful immunisation campaigns and better community outreach, Kamal reaffirmed his commitment, noting a significant decrease in parental vaccine refusal.
“The fight against polio has required a tremendous sacrifice from all stakeholders, including law enforcement personnel who have rendered invaluable services,” Kamal had said. “This mission will continue until we reach complete eradication [of the poliovirus].”</p><small>2025-05-25 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25134931d8b2573.jpg?r=135003' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238/govt-allocates-2000mw-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-data-centres' target='_blank'><strong>Govt allocates 2,000MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres</strong></a><br><p>In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.
The government recently decided to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
The federal government appointed entrepreneur Bilal Bin Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.
A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC — a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance — as part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.
“Pakistan is uniquely positioned — both geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,” the statement says.
It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.
“Pakistan’s underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.
“Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,” the statement added.
PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative, and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a global crypto and AI powerhouse.
Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.
Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet — marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.
By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.
Pakistan’s strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.
The statement further said the country’s digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world’s largest submarine internet cable. The Africa-2 Cable Project, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.
This milestone enhances Pakistan’s internet bandwidth, latency, and resilience through redundant fiber routes — key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.
With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.
These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.
The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities — leveraging Pakistan’s immense wind (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources — as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.
These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.
“Pakistan’s combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicenter of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.
“With the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.”</p><small>2025-05-25 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/251127456f21b8f.jpg?r=112826' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913141/punjab-govt-plans-law-to-rein-in-goondas' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt plans law to rein in goondas</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government has plans to enact a law to control criminal and anti-social persons commonly known as “goondas”, who make life difficult for the people, in the province.
The new law, The Punjab Control of Goondas and Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2025, will serve as a modern, effective legal tool to tackle organised and habitual crime, protect public safety, and deter anti-social behaviour. The Act, after enactment, will repeal The Punjab Control of Goondas Ordinance, 1959.
The Punjab home department has drafted the new law that provides a comprehensive legal framework for identifying, monitoring and restraining individuals commonly known as “goondas” who pose a threat to public order. The act provides the legal definition of goonda as “a person habitually involved in disorderly conduct, criminal activity, or anti-social behaviour that endangers peace or creates public nuisance”.
The district intelligence committees (DICs) have been empowered to declare an individual a ‘goonda’ based on credible reports from police officers, assistant commissioners, intelligence agencies, or written complaints. There has to be a comprehensive grounds for declaration of `goonda’ which includes involvement in drug trafficking, gambling, extortion, cyber crimes, harassment, organised criminal activity, use of forged documents, display of weapons, running brothel house, impersonation of public officials and other listed offences.

Act provides for empowering dist intelligence committees to declare a person ‘goonda’ and impose penalties; all offences to be non-bailable

Upon declaration, the DIC may impose various restrictions on goondas including, requiring a bond for good behaviour in future, placing the individual on no-fly list, blocking of CNIC and passport, confiscation of digital devices and data, freezing of bank accounts. It also includes observing the community service orders and restriction from visiting sensitive public places.
The Act allows for technical surveillance, including digital monitoring and biometric data collection, to ensure compliance and detect further criminal conduct. The act also provides an appeal mechanism to the aggrieved individuals, who can submit representations to the divisional, provincial, and appellate committees. A dedicated Tribunal, led by a retired district and sessions judge, will hear final appeals.
The proposed Act also gives strict penalties for violating the orders of DIC. The punishment includes imprisonment from three to five years and a fine of up to Rs1.5 million. Furthermore, the repeat offenders will face harsher penalties, including up to seven years’ imprisonment and fine up to Rs2m. All offences under the new Act are declared cognisable and non-bailable, ensuring swift police action and legal proceedings. The government will designate magistrates with Section 30 powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure to try offences under this Act. The proposed Act will be presented before the provincial cabinet for approval.

Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said civil defence crews retrieved “the bodies of nine child martyrs, some of them charred, from the home of Dr Hamdi al-Najjar and his wife, Dr Alaa al-Najjar, all of whom were their children”.
He added that Hamdi al-Najjar and another son, Adam, were also seriously wounded in the strike on Friday. A medical source at Nasser Hospital, where Alaa al-Najjar works, gave Adam’s age as 10 years old.
Footage of the aftermath released by the civil defence agency showed rescuers recovering badly burned remains from the damaged home. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military said it had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure” near its troops.
“The Khan Yunis area is a dangerous warzone,” it added. “The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.” The army had issued an evacuation warning for Khan Yunis on Monday. The children’s funeral took place at Nasser Hospital, a footage showed.
Muneer Alboursh, director general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said on X that the strike happened shortly after Hamdi Al-Najjar drove his wife to work. “Just minutes after returning home, a missile struck their house,” he said, adding the father was “in intensive care”.
“This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain,” he said. “In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted — Israel’s aggression goes further, wiping out entire families.”

• Journalist bodies condemn killing, demand justice
QUETTA: A journalist, Abdul Latif Baloch, who worked for a Quetta-based newspaper as a correspondent, was gunned down by unknown assailants in the Mashkey area of Awaran district on Saturday, police said.
The gunmen barged into the journalist’s house in the wee hours of Saturday morning and tried to take him away. When he offered resistance, the intruders opened fire, killing him on the spot.
The killers fled the scene and could not be arrested till late into the night.
Police have launched an investigation into the incident.
According to police officials, Mr Baloch was also working in the Levies force department.
They said that a few years ago, the body of Mr Baloch’s kidnapped son was found in Mashkey.
Journalist organisations strongly condemned the killing of Mr Baloch, who was working for Daily Intikhab.
 
 

While the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed its deepest shock and outrage over the brutal killing, the Balochistan Union of Journalists (BUJ) termed the incident part of a broader conspiracy to silence independent voices in Balochistan.
PFUJ acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said this senseless act of violence is a stark reminder of the risks journalists face while performing their duties.
“We demand that the authorities take immediate and concrete actions to investigate this crime, identify the perpetrators, and bring them to justice,” they demanded in a statement.
The PFUJ also called for enhanced security measures to protect journalists and ensure their safety while reporting.
It condemned the threats Mr Baloch received prior to his murder. Such acts of intimidation create a climate of fear, undermining press freedom and democracy, it added.
“We stand in solidarity with Abdul Latif Baloch’s family, colleagues, and the Baluchistan journalist community, and pledge to continue advocating for journalists’ rights and safety,” they urged
The PFUJ leadership called upon the government to take concrete steps to address the deteriorating security situation for journalists and media workers across Pakistan.
In a separate statement, BUJ President Khalil Ahmed and General Secretary Abdul Ghani Kakar described Mr Baloch as a dedicated and honest journalist, adding that his targeted killing raises serious concerns about press freedom in Balochistan. The union demanded a high-level inquiry into the murder.
“Journalists in a sensitive region like Balochistan already face grave threats, and such attacks highlight the government’s failure to ensure their safety,” the statement said. “If immediate action is not taken, this dangerous trend could escalate further.”
The BUJ urged the Balochistan government to swiftly arrest the perpetrators and ensure that justice is served.

The event was organised by Arooj Azhar Kiyani, the Chief Executive Officer of the Kingsgate Equine and the first female captain of a tent-pegging team in the country, in collaboration with the Punjab government.
A large number of people, including families, gathered to watch the cultural sport, while over 70 tent-pegging teams participated in the event.
Talking to Dawn during the event, Ms Kiyani said she felt proud to be the first female tent-pegger in Pakistan, adding that it was not easy for her to make her debut in a male-dominated sport.
Speaking of the challenges faced by women in becoming horse riders, especially tent-peggers, the KingsGate CEO said that there was a scarcity of good trainers in the field who could coach young girls to pursue their passion.
“Luckily, I found a good coach who helped me through this journey of becoming a professional tent-pegger,” she said, adding that she regularly participates in championships throughout the country.
She said that separate arrangements were made for families to attend the championship and that positive feedback was received from young women and girls.
 
 

Ms Kiyani said that holding the event at the women’s college campus was aimed at encouraging women to be bold enough to cross barriers in sports and professions that are generally, and mistakenly, considered a domain of masculine superiority.
She said that the participation of women in horse riding and in the wars of Islamic history was well documented, and she was inspired by Islamic history.
She added that horse riding and tent-pegging were not limited to men, and she felt proud to be the first female player in the sport, as it is a game of valour and passion.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Punjab Chief Minister, retired General Azhar Kiyani, who also attended the championship, said that it was the Punjab government’s priority to promote cultural sports in the province, and such events were being regularly held in almost all cities.
He said that the event was also aimed at celebrating the recent defining victory of Pakistan against India, adding that the whole nation stood shoulder to shoulder with the brave soldiers of Pakistan.
The event was also attended by Deputy Commissioner Jhelum, Syed Meesam Abbas, and District Police Officer (DPO) Tariq Aziz Sindhu, while the prize distribution was postponed due to a thunderstorm on Saturday afternoon.

It was explained by PIIA chairperson Dr Masuma Hasan there was a need to hear different voices, especially the voices of the youth, regarding the recent conflict. Therefore, they decided to call on their research assistants to talk about the different themes of the conflict, as identified by them, for the audience to then take it from there.
Taking the audience through the events of the past month or so, she also reminded how India, out of the blue, with no credible evidence, held Pakistan responsible for April 22’s Pahalgam attack, which was an intelligence failure on the part of India.
“Then India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 and Pakistan suspended the Simla Agreement of 1972,” she said.
“Then on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. While defending the country very well, Pakistan retaliated on May 10, which was followed by a ceasefire after US president Donald Trump’s intervention,” she added.
 
 

Research assistant Mohammad Usman presented a paper on ‘Water Assets and Resources’. He said that if India were to stop the water flow to Pakistan, it would risk flooding its own upper regions. “But if they stopped our water during the dry seasons, it could be a concern for us because the flow of water is lower and storage matters the most. It can affect our farmers, which could result in lower yields,” he said.
“But if India blocked our water, it would require significant infrastructure, which will take years to build and would also require billions of dollars,” he said.

In war with India, Pakistan reasserts itself through controlled display of sophisticated force, say experts

“As for the weaponisation of water, or the water bomb, a concept when the upper riparian state blocks the flow of water and then suddenly releases a significant amount of water without notifying the lower riparian state, you have a big flood. Here in the case of Pakistan and India, Pakistan is the lower riparian state and India the upper riparian state. But in the case of China and India, China is the upper riparian state and India the lower riparian state, especially in Brahmaputra. China can also block India’s water,” he pointed out.
 
 

Research assistant Syeda Maliha Sehar read a paper on the theme of ‘Political and Military Interests’. “We saw a maturity of new capabilities developed through the Pakistan-China military partnership,” she said.
“By deploying Chinese-origin systems designed to destruct Indian surveillance and communications, Pakistan directly challenged the technological dominance of both Indian and Western-aligned platforms. Pakistan’s response served to dismantle long-standing perceptions of asymmetry, re-framing Pakistan, not as a reactive or inferior actor, but as one capable of leading with precision, restraint and strategic innovation. In doing so, Pakistan reasserted itself in the region’s power dynamics not through escalation but through controlled exhibition of a sophisticated force,” Maliha added.
Another young researcher Safa Rehmat spoke about ‘Cyber Warfare and Digital Espionage’. “Cyber warfare in this conflict involves hacking, data breaches and misinformation campaigns. Both the Indian Research and Analysis Wing [RAW] and the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI], as well as the people of both countries, have developed sophisticated cyber capabilities,” she said.
Speaking about the ‘War of Narratives’, Research Assistant Syed Shahryar Shah said that perceptions came to be just as important as the conflict. “The actual conflict lasted a few days but we are carrying on with the narratives,” he said. “What matters now is not what happened but what people believe happened,” he added.
 
 

Another Research Assistant, Asif Ali, spoke of ‘The Kashmir Flashpoint’. “The Indian authorities have already begun a crackdown in Kashmir. Following the Pahalgam incident around 2,800 Kashmiris have either been questioned or detained by the Indian authorities and this is something that is likely to continue,” he pointed out.
Another paper was presented on ‘Media, Misinformation and Public Opinion’ where Safa Rehmat, again, spoke of the things reported wrongly in the media on both sides such as India attacking the Karachi port while showing old pictures of Philadelphia and also reporting that Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff had been captured. Pakistan also chipped in by reporting the capture of Indian female air force pilot Shivani Singh and the raising of white flags of truce from the Indian side.
Saad Asad Brohi spoke of ‘Regional and Global Responses’.
 
 

The discussion, which followed included a comment about it being easy to blame someone else for one’s own internal problems, which is what India did after the Pahalgam attack.
Someone also pointed out that war was not one-dimensional. There are also dimensions such as economy, diplomacy, politics, etc, to think about. It was also mentioned that the armed forces of Pakistan certainly deserve accolades, but there was also a need for good governance in this country.
One person in the audience then got up to thank Indian PM Narendra Modi for providing an opportunity for unity in Pakistan.

After opting to bat first in the decider, Stars posted 135-5 thanks to opener Sana Urooj’s brisk 37-ball 44 before they bundled the Conquerers out for 93 with two balls to spare with Anosha Nasir taking 3-14.
Sana and Anosha were jointly awarded the player-of-the-final.
 


Sana set the tone for her side, striking seven fours and being involved in key partnerships: 33 for the first wicket with with Huraina Sajjad (23) and 47 for the third with Kaynat Hafeez (21).
Kaynat provided the anchor, striking just one six in her 35-ball knock with their partnership being broken when Nashra Sandhu (2-21) cleaned up Sana.
Sidra Amin and Sidra Nawaz provided the late flourish, the skipper striking four four fours in her 13-ball 18 while the latter faced 11 deliveries for 15.
The Conquerers lost half their side with 80 on the board in the chase and their last five batters couldn’t offer any resistance as Anosha and Waheeda Akhtar (2-17) ripped through their line-up.
Dua Majid (29), Najiha Alvi (21) and Syeda Aroob Shah (14) were the only batters to enter double figures — the last two sharing a 30-run stand for the fifth wicket.
Sidra Amin, with 346 runs in 10 matches, and Sidra Nawaz, with 15 dismissals and 150 runs, were named the best batter and wicket-keeper respectively for the tournament.
Anosha was jointly-awarded the best bowler with Challengers’ Rameen Shamim, who picked up a tournament-leading 16 wickets.

The Effects of Taxes and Transfers on Inequality and Poverty in Pakis­tan says the GST has the largest ne­­g­ative impact on the poverty headco­unt; the Benazir Income Support Programme has the largest positive impact on inequality reduction.
Estimations of the marginal contributions of individual fiscal instruments — or the additional impact that individual fiscal instruments have on poverty or inequality when all other fiscal instruments are included — demonstrate that GST has the largest marginal contribution to the national poverty increase.
GST is allocated roughly in proportion to consumption expenditure and, therefore, is neither strongly regressive nor strongly progressive. The BISP cash transfer meanwhile de­­­monstrates the largest marginal contribution to inequality reduction. The second-largest impact on inequ­ality comes from pre-primary and pri­­ma­­ry education expenditures, it says.

Vulnerable households get smaller benefits than taxes paid

The study suggests that, while moving forward, Pakistan should improve its domestic revenue mobilisation and public expenditure efficiency to generate greater fiscal spa­ce.  The additional fiscal space shou­­ld be prioritized to expand social expenditure and targeted transfers and to improve fiscal equity.
 
 

Fiscal sustainability could go together with fiscal equity if additional revenues collected from GST harmonisation are used to compensate poor and vulnerable households through well-targeted cash transfers. Expenditure reforms to improve the accessibility and quality of public health and education services in Pakistan could have long-term impacts in terms of poverty and inequality reduction, the study says.
The report says fiscal policy in Pakistan emphasized revenue collection from more frequently-impoverishing indirect taxes as well as regressive and inefficient subsidy expenditures to provide benefits while de-prioritizing progressive direct taxation which can shield poor and vulnerable households from further impoverishment, direct, targeted transfers to poor and vulnerable households, and the investments in social infrastructure which help poor and middle-income households participate productively in social, civic, and economic life.
According to the report, richer households capture a larger share of the subsidy and in-kind benefits available and pay more of total revenues collected from direct and indirect taxes. In Pakistan in fiscal year 2019, the two richest deciles capture 34pc of total subsidy expenditure, 29pc of in-kind education benefits, and 27pc of in-kind health benefits, and pay 40pc of total revenues from indirect taxes.
Most poor and vulnerable households are net payers into the fiscal system meaning that benefits received are smaller in magnitude than taxes paid. Only individuals from the poorest ten per cent of the population can expect to be net recipients — or can expect to receive more in benefits than they will pay in taxes — with a net cash gain estimated 1.2pc of pre-fiscal income. All other individuals can expect to be net payers in cash terms, with cash losses ranging from -1.8 per cent in decile 2 to -5.5pc in decile 10 (the richest decile).
Over the past two decades, Pakistan has struggled with low and volatile economic growth.

In it, she expressed anger towards US President Donald Trump for not coming to India’s aid during its recent war against Pakistan. The post was accompanied by a photo of a battle-clad Ranaut, fiercely riding a white horse into some mythical battle. 
In the post, she called Trump an “alpha male”, but then asked whether Trump was “jealous” of the Indian PM Narendra Modi because Modi was the “father of all alpha males” [“our PM is sab alpha males ka baap“]. She then grudgingly deleted the post because, according to her, her party Bharatiya Janata Party’s  (BJP) national president requested her to do so. 
Ranaut’s original post had in it something that can be quite telling for those wanting to understand the political and cultural fallout of Hindu nationalism in India. Ranaut admires ‘alpha males’ and perceives Modi as the ultimate male of this kind. But her outburst wasn’t just the product of a sophomoric fan-girl. It was actually rooted in what began to be shaped — in the 1920s — as Hindu nationalism and/or ‘Hindutva’. Hindutva seeks to establish Hinduism as the dominant/hegemonic system of belief and culture in India. 
Ranaut has been a fervent supporter of Modi’s ruling BJP, which is also India’s largest Hindu nationalist outfit. It is especially popular among India’s growing middle classes that benefitted greatly from the ‘opening up’ of the Indian economy from the late 1980s onwards. 

Indian social media posts babbling about alpha males, and the larger confusion in the country’s polity, are the result of a crumbling of the sense of security that was seeded by the BJP and Modi’s ‘masculinised nationalism’

The BJP was formed in 1980. A large part of it emerged from a now defunct Hindu nationalist party, the Akhil Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Like Jana Sangh in the past, BJP too has roots in militant Hindu nationalist groups, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS has been around since 1925. It was formed to politically and culturally manifest the ideas of one of Hindu nationalism’s pioneering ideologists, Vinayak D. Savarkar.
 
 

From the late 1980s, BJP began to enjoy increasing popularity in India. A lot of this popularity was mustered by the party’s willingness to act in an iconoclastic manner. It openly challenged the supposedly pacifist/‘Gandhian’ ethos of India’s politics and society, established by the country’s founding party, the Indian National Congress (INC). BJP also confronted Indian secularism, which it accused of being tilted in favour of India’s non-Hindu groups, especially Muslims. BJP also moved to popularise and bring into the mainstream a particular take on Hindu mythology. 
The INC had interpreted Hindu mythology as symbolic of Hinduism’s tolerant, pluralistic and even secular nature. But INC did not treat this mythology as substantiated history. BJP does. It understands this mythology in a literalist manner. BJP’s aggressive push in this regard managed to find traction among India’s upper and middle classes when they had begun to fully enjoy the fruits of economic liberalisation and deregulation. 
During the INC’s multiple stints in power from the 1950s till the mid-1980s, Indian ‘gurus’ preaching spiritual calm and warning about the psychic ills brought on by materialism were a dime a dozen in India and in the ‘spiritually bankrupt’ West. In the early 1970s, Uxi Mufti, son of the Pakistani intellectual Mumtaz Mufti, wrote that India was exporting ‘Indian spiritualism’ to the West and that Pakistan, to counter this, should export Sufism there.
Uxi viewed the Indian export as a ploy by India to portray itself as a spiritually rich and peaceful country compared to its more militaristic neighbour, Pakistan. 
But the economic and political rise of the Indian middle classes saw the decline of the INC’s portrayals of India and Hinduism. According to the Indian political scientist Sabyasachi Chaudhury, India’s post-1980s’ neo-liberal economic policies won the endorsement of the country’s new middle class and dominant upper castes. This became the primary ingredient of the formula for establishing a “muscular Indian nation state.” This then saw Indian democracy taking an illiberal turn. 
 


Gradually, the once sidelined musings of early Hindu nationalists began being mainstreamed. In a 2019 essay, the political scientist Jyotirmaya Sharma wrote that “loss of manliness” was a major theme in early Hindu nationalist discourse. The discourse lamented that Hindus had become feeble and soft, incapable of either retaliating or defending themselves. Hence, they suffered humiliation and perpetual subjugation, first at the hands of Muslim invaders and then by the British. Therefore, Hindu nationalist ideologues took upon themselves the responsibility of ‘making men’ out of the Hindus.
Demolishing ancient mosques, insulting Mahatma Gandhi (by calling him a eunuch), beating up Muslims and lower caste Indians, recreating on film and TV mythical stories of war in an imaginary ancient India, wishing the complete annihilation of “terrorist Pakistan”, attacking Christian missionaries, lynching beef-eaters etc — all these can be seen today in India as manifestations of a ‘Hindu society’ apparently being masculinised by the “baap of all alpha males.” 
But what’s the role of the Hindu women in all this? In her book Make Me A Man, the professor of gender studies Sikata Banerjee writes, “Women enter this masculine environment through roles such as heroic mother, chaste wife and celibate warrior.” 
According to the American political theorist Cynthia Enloe, nationalist ideologies tend to stem from masculinised memory, masculinised humiliation and masculinised hope. Indeed, but — as we have seen — Indian nationalism began as a secular and a rather feminised understanding of Hinduism and India. However, from the 1990s onwards, the once sidelined masculinised variant pushed out the earlier variant because economic prosperity among the middle classes shaped a mindset that was a combination of confidence and insecurity. The insecurity leads to the feeling that endorsed masculinised nationalism is a better protector of one’s economic gains. 
A prime minister boasting of having a 56-inch chest (as Modi once claimed) may be an effective way to make middle class India feel secure. But that same prime minister taking the country to an actual war is something entirely different — especially when he loses the war. 
Today, the commotion on Indian media, the confusion in the country’s polity and in X posts babbling about alpha males, are the result of the crumbling of that sense of security, seeded by masculinised nationalism. 
Remarkably, this nationalism started to come apart immediately after the military and diplomatic losses India suffered in its latest war against Pakistan. The 56-inch chest shrank, throwing middle-class India into an existentialist and identity crisis.

• Officials spar over India’s targeting of civilian areas
UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has warned the United Nations that India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) represents a dangerous escalation that violates international law and threatens the survival of more than 240 million people.
Speaking at a UN meeting on protecting water in armed conflict on Friday evening, Pakistan urged the world community to act before such actions triggered a humanitarian catastrophe or destabilised the region.
“This is a grave violation of international law, including human rights law, the treaty law and customary international law,” said Ambassador Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Arria Formula meeting convened by Slovenia.
“We strongly condemn India’s unlawful announcement to hold the Treaty in abeyance and call upon India to strictly abide by its legal obligations and refrain from stopping, diverting or restricting rivers that are a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan. We will never accept any such moves,” Ambassador Jadoon said.
 






He also drew attention to Indian leaders’ alarming statements, noting that “troubling pronouncements by the Indian leadership to ‘starve the people of Pakistan’ depict a highly dangerous and perverse thinking.
Pakistan used the UN forum to appeal for international consensus against the weaponisation of water.
Ambassador Jadoon urged the Security Council to monitor such developments closely and take pre-emptive action where necessary:
“The Council must play a role by identifying situations where violations of international law, including IHL (International Humanitarian Law) principles, could jeopardise peace and security or lead to catastrophic humanitarian crisis.”
 






Pakistan’s statement highlighted three key points, legal prohibitions, obligations of warring parties and weaponisation of water. International law, including human rights law and IHL, prohibits attacks on water resources and related infrastructure. Den­ying access to water violates established norms and UN Security Council resolutions. Similarly, all parties in a conflict are bound by the IHL and must avoid actions that result in severe humanitarian consequences. Besides, using water as a tool of coercion or warfare is unacceptable and destabilising.
“It is regrettable that one country, exhibiting malevolent designs, has chosen to weaponise water in addition to using it as a bargain chip,” the diplomat said.
Pakistan’s statement comes amid growing concern in Islamabad over India’s recent efforts to bypass treaty mechanisms and undermine the role of international mediators, particularly the World Bank, which had brokered the Treaty 1960. Officials in Pakistan view these actions as part of a broader pattern aimed at eroding cooperative frameworks and applying pressure on Islamabad through non-military means.
Ambassador Jadoon reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for global efforts to ensure the protection of water resources during conflicts and emphasised the need for a “resolute, principled and united stand” against any attempts to politicise or militarise water.
Terror charge rejected
At a separate meeting, delegates from Delhi and Islamabad engaged in a sharp verbal duel at the UN, after Pakistani Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad denounced the Indian military for targeting civilian areas during the recent clash.
The exchange took place at the Security Council during its debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict on Friday.
Indian Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish reacted to his Pakistani counterpart’s tough statement, and while repeating Delhi’s usual allegations said that Pakistan had no justification to talk about civilians when it is using terrorism as a policy.
Pakistani delegate Saima Saleem hit back, accusing the Indian envoy of relying on “disinformation, deflection and denial” as she said India was itself involved in acts of terrorism.
“No amount of obfuscation can hide the facts. India brazenly kills and maims civilians in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, carries out blatant aggression against Pakistan by targeting civilians and sponsors terrorism and assassinations in my country and across the globe,” Ms Saleem, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, told the 15-member Council.
India, she said, had even stooped to a new low of impeding the flow of rivers that serve as a lifeline for the 240 million people of Pakistan.
She pointed out that Pakistan, together with the international community, had condemned the Pahalgam incident.
“If India had nothing to hide, it should have agreed to credible, impartial and independent investigations into the incident,” the delegate said. “On the contrary,” she added, “India continues to subject people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir to state-sponsored terrorism to suppress their legitimate freedom struggle.”
Blatant aggression
Earlier this month, she recalled, India committed blatant aggression against Pakistan, launching unprovoked attacks on innocent civilians, killing 40 people including seven women and 15 children and injuring 121 others, including 10 women and 27 children.
“India certainly has no credibility to lecture others on the protection of civilians,” Ms Saleem told delegates.
Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts and sacrifices, she pointed out, were well-known and acknowledged globally and Islamabad remains steadfast in its commitment to combat this menace.
On the other hand, she said, India continues to actively fund and support terror proxies that include Fitna Al Khawarij —the term used by the government for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Balochistan Liberation Army and its Majeed Brigade group — to kill innocent civilians in Pakistan.
She drew the delegates’ attention to the recent savage attack on a school bus in Khuzdar that took the lives of innocent school-going children and left dozens injured.
“If India is genuinely committed to peace and security and good neighbourliness, it should end its state-sponsored terrorism, cease its oppression of Kashmiris, comply with its obligations under international law, UN Charter and bilateral treaties, and engage in meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Ms Saleem added.

• Widespread outages reported from parts of country
• Crops, power lines damaged in KP; 113 feeders trip across province
ISLA­M­ABAD / LAHORE /PES­H­­­­­A­WAR: At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains battered several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.
Heavy rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and hail also struck Islamabad, leading to water accumulation in several low-lying areas and trees falling at multiple spots.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, strong winds and hailstorms caused extensive damage to crops and power lines but no fatalities were reported. Over 113 power feeders tripped across the province, with areas like Peshawar, Mardan, Khyber, Swabi, Swat and Abbottabad worst affected.
Meanwhile, a private airline from Karachi to Lahore narrowly avoided a disaster when it was caught in severe turbulence while landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport.
 


According to the data provided by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Punjab and Rescue 1122, three people died each in Lahore and Jhelum, two each in Sialkot and Muzaffargarh and one person each in Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Attock, Multan, Rajanpur, Hafi­zabad, Mianwali, Jhang and Layyah as the walls and roofs of the houses collapsed and trees fell on them.
About two dozen incidents of the fall of solar panels and billboards were also reported.
A PDMA tally issued at 10pm on Saturday put fatalities at 13 and injuries at 92. Separate incidents reported by Rescue 1122 and other sources added more deaths, pushing the toll higher.
The authority had earlier urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert, according to a . report.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across Punjab to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of the province, the authority said in a statement.
 
 

Motorway Police closed several motorways, including sections of M2, M3 and the Lahore-Sialkot route, due to safety concerns. Severe weather and low visibility were reported on parts of the M4 and M5, while thunderstorms disrupted travel across highways linking Lahore to Multan and beyond.
Power infrastructure was also hit hard, with Multan’s power utility Mepco confirming faults across south Punjab’s grid, leading to temporary blackouts in Multan, Khanewal, Vehari and Sahiwal.
The Water and Sanitation Agency in Lahore reported full mobilisation of machinery and pumps to clear underpasses.
Deaths, injuries
According to the PDMA report, most deaths in Punjab occurred due to the collapse of dilapidated houses and being in unsafe locations.
In Sheikhupura, the roof of a factory collapsed due to strong wind, killing a worker from Sadiqabad and seriously injuring five others, the state-run Pakistan Television reported.
Several mud and dilapidated houses were also damaged due to the storm. There were also incidents of falling trees and damage to solar panels in Lahore.
District Officer Rescue 1122 Sibghatullah told Dawn that a labourer died after a wall of an under-construction house in Sood Gangal on Kallar Syedan Road collapsed due to the strong winds. The deceased was identified as Imtiaz Yaqoob, 52.
Scores of people were also injured in Taxila, Lahore High Court Road, Adiala Road, Peshawar Road, Chakri Road, Kotha Kalan, Rawat, Gujar Khan and Chakri near the motorway, he said.
In another incident, a man died after the wall of his house in Fauji Colony, Pirwadhai, collapsed. Naseebullah, 60, was seriously injured in the incident and was shifted to the hospital but could not survive.
In Attock, a child was killed and six others, including a woman and her daughter, were injured.
According to Rescue 1122, the Grade 2 student, identified as Mohammad Hassan Shahbaz, was killed when the wall of his house collapsed in the Mithial village, within the limits of Jand Police Station.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed announced that medical assistance would be provided to the injured people, the PDMA said.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast more rain and thunderstorms across Punjab and KP on Sunday, including in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar and Mardan.
Damage in KP
Strong winds and hailstorms also caused extensive damage to crops and power lines in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but no deaths were reported.
The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) said that more than 113 feeders across the province tripped due to the windstorm. The power utility said that the 19 feeders tripped each in Peshawar and Mardan, 13 in Khyber, 30 in Swabi, 13 in Swat, 15 in Abbottabad and four in Mansehra.
The Peshawar cantonment experienced power outages spanning several hours after the windstorm. Sources told Dawn that the cantonment power supply was underground and Pesco staff had to seek permission from military authorities to start rehabilitation work.
Other severely affected areas included Mingora, Amankot, Rahimabad and Qambar, where residents faced immense difficulty commuting and accessing essential services. Citizens called upon the authorities to expedite drainage and relief efforts to prevent further damage.
In Mingora, Swat, flash floods from overflowing drains inundated homes and disrupted daily life, forcing students to sit exams in complete darkness due to outages.
According to the Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature in the Swat valley dropped to 20 degrees Celsius due to the rain and hailstorm.
Rain and hailstorms in the Ambar and Pandiali tehsils of Mohmand district damaged crops, causing losses to the farmers.
According to initial reports, several slum houses were damaged and trees were uprooted in remote localities; however, no loss of life was immediately reported, official sources confirmed.
Moreover, a heavy windstorm followed by light rain disrupted proceedings on Saturday, the second day of the ongoing Tablighi Ijtema in the Baffa area.
The congregation, which began on Friday, has attracted hundreds of thousands of participants from across Hazara, Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country. The organisers expect an even larger turnout on Sunday, the final day when special prayers will be offered.
Meanwhile, a windstorm followed by light rain also affected life in other parts of the Hazara division.
Flight faces turbulence
Meanwhile, a private airline flight FL-842 from Karachi to Lahore narrowly avoided a disaster when it was caught in severe turbulence while landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport. The pilot aborted landing and safely returned to Karachi following air traffic control instructions, Geo News reported.
Passengers, shaken by repeated jolts, refused to re-board after landing in Karachi. Airport sources said 57 passengers cancelled their travel plans, delaying the flight’s re-departure.
At least two other flights to Lahore were diverted to Karachi due to poor visibility, while departures were delayed until weather conditions stabilised.
As the storm subsided, operations at Lahore airport resumed, with flights PK-305 and PA-405 eventually departing for Karachi.

Published in Dawn, May 25th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-25 05:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2509593565d1f4e.jpg?r=100141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913166/packaged-juice-makers-seek-tax-cuts' target='_blank'><strong>Packaged juice makers seek tax cuts</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The formal packaged juice industry has urged the government to take immediate action in the upcoming federal budget, requesting a significant cut in the Federal Excise Duty (FED).
The juice industry is calling for a substantial reduction in the Federal Excise Duty (FED), which was introduced in 2023 at a rate of 20 per cent, compounded by an existing 18pc General Sales Tax (GST). According to a spokesperson for the Fruit Juice Council, this combined burden is severely impacting the documented sector and leading to serious economic repercussions.
The sector, which was expecting sales exceeding Rs72 billion in FY23,  witnessed a 45pc plunge to Rs42bn. This has stalled industry growth and resulted in a considerable shortfall in the government’s revenue projections for the current fiscal year.
 
 

The exorbitant tax burden, effectively pushing the tax component on a pack of juice to around 42pc of its price, has fundamentally impacted consumer affordability.
This has inadvertently fuelled an alarming surge in the undocumented sector, which offers cheaper, low-quality, and potentially unsafe alternatives that evade all tax obligations, it says.
The industry claims that the repercussions extend beyond the industry’s bottom line. The drastic reduction in demand from the formal sector has severely impacted the rural economy, particularly fruit farmers. At its peak, the industry procured over 100,000 tonnes of fruit annually from local growers.

One of the major factors responsible for this state of affairs is religious bigotry, which continues to persist across the country. Uncertainty and scepticism are two major expressions of growing fear, and ordinary folk who have already lost trust in the state’s delivery system are now losing belief in each other.
The state has managed sectarian-related violence in the country. Still, the sectarian divide is not only persisting but also expanding in its ugliest form, where mobs and individuals alike take the law into their own hands and are ready to kill anyone who does not belong to their faith and breach their privacy whenever they want.
 
 

In this regard, two points warrant further exploration. The first pertains to the strength of violent religiously inspired groups and how effectively they use legal tools; the second is about how the majority itself becomes insecure.
Organised violent groups have undergone a transformation and changed their tactics. There is a visible pattern in most cases. The leadership of these groups encourage people to take the law into their own hands and then surface after a violent incident in which religious minorities have been targeted, taking up the matter and engaging with the local administration and the legal community.
Their engagement with the police and local administration is confined to providing impunity to the culprits who are not charged with the heinous crimes they have committed. The local administration and police cooperate with them for two reasons: first, to maintain law and order in their respective jurisdictions, and second, because of their own belief in the causes behind religious bigotry.
The leadership of these groups suddenly activates their social media teams to highlight the incident to gain public support and give an impression to the state institutions that the situation can worsen if any action against the culprits is taken. The central leadership also exploits its contacts within the state institutions and political parties to protect the culprits.

The circle of religious bigotry is tightening and beginning to suffocate the majority itself.

Legal instruments have become more critical, and these groups have set up cells within to ensure legal protection. It is interesting that the legal community justifies incidents of religious bigotry by the radical groups, which claim that their members have taken the initiative to implement the law. There are several legal clauses introduced during Zia’s regime and even during the last 10 years of various governments in which the rituals of religious minorities can be criminalised, apart from their targeting by religious bigots.
 
 

Curiously, during their final weeks in office, the PDM government, comprising both the PML-N and PPP, set a global record by passing 48 legislative bills in a single day in August 2023. However, the treasury benches supported critical amendments by far-right religious parties. The Senate approved amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, to enhance punishments for those disrespecting the Ahle Bayt or Sahaba-i-Karaam. These amendments were passed without discussion, raising concerns about the expansive nature of religious-related legislation.
A Jamaat-i-Islami parliamentarian from Chitral had presented the bill, but just after its approval, one of his own close aides in Chitral was booked under the amended law. While the victim had not been charged because of the pressure from religious parties and a written apology, when state institutions and political parties introduce and support such legislation it strengthens extremist religious groups, and they use such laws to threaten religious and sectarian minorities.
The second point is that it is not only religious and sectarian minorities who are victimised; the majority itself has become apprehensive and is even conscious about the use of religious terminology in their daily lives, except among close groups. One example is quoted here, ie, the amendments introduced in the CrPC were used against a close aide of the lawmaker who took credit for introducing the law.
Does the blasphemy entrapment group fall in the same domain? The high court has advised the Pakistan government to establish a commission to investigate alleged collusion between the FIA and Islamist clerics in the entrapment of innocent people in false blasphemy charges.
 
 

This situation is affecting the mental health of people, especially in the services sector, where people are becoming more religious in their practices but are scared to discuss religious issues. Regardless of whether or not the move towards ritualism is something they genuinely believe in, what is astonishing is that a bigoted mindset is reflected in their reactions to incidents of religious violence.
The circle of religious bigotry is tightening and beginning to suffocate the majority itself. At the same time, they are discouraging the ordinary person from applying common sense or becoming a positive and active member of society. Perhaps this is the desired outcome that state institutions aim at: a population that remains obedient and does not question their actions.
One doesn’t have to point out that religious bigots have the support of the system and, in many instances, the support of state institutions. It is clear that state institutions do not trust civil society, as the two have divergent views on democracy, constitutional rights, statecraft, and even the foundational principles of the state.
 
 

While it is also evident that both state institutions and radical religious groups can collide with each other, the worldview of the former frequently matches that of the latter, as both are on a trajectory that diverges from the path taken by civil rights movements.
It is hardly surprising then that a religious group, which the state once declared to be a national security threat under Section 11B(1) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, was right in front, supporting the state narrative on many occasions.

Additional District & Sessions Judge (AD&SJ) Yalmaz Ghani conducted the hearing on the suit, while PM Shehbaz and his counsel Mustafa Ramday joined via a video link.
At the outset of the hearing, the prime minister congratulated all attendees on winning the battle against India.
In response, the judge also said, “Congratulations to you as well.”
Advocate Muhammad Hussain Chotia, the counsel for the PTI founder, said this was indeed a matter of joy and it was a victory for the whole nation.
During cross-examination, the defendant’s counsel asked the plaintiff whether the alleged defamatory statement had been made in writing.
The prime minister said the allegations had been repeatedly made on television.
The lawyer then asked PM Shehbaz whether he himself ever made such accusations in politics.
However, the prime minister claimed that he had never made any allegation without evidence.
The lawyer asked the  plaintiff what could be the motive behind the PTI founder’s speeches and statements.
At this, PM Shehbaz said this question should be asked from the defendant.
The judge also objected to the question posed by the defendant’s lawyer, terming it irrelevant.
Asked about the outcome of the Panama Papers case, PM Shehbaz said it was not against him and he was not aware of the ruling.
Responding to a follow-up question, the prime minister reiterated that he was not a party to the Panama Papers case and that this fact was part of the record.
The PM stated that he had been subjected to a serious and dishonest accusation by the defendant.
The cross-examination was in progress when the judge adjourned further hearing till June 2.
In his defamation suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations on him.
He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.
Imran Khan had filed his reply to the suit with a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends told him that someone known to him and also the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama Papers case.
The former prime minister said he disclosed the incident for the consumption of the public at large, and an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation.
The reply maintained that Mr Khan did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.

Downdetector, which mon­itors internet outages in real time, showed a spike in users’ complaints after 5pm. The tally pea­ked with 372 complaints at 5:36pm, with more than 600 complaints in total reported by late evening.
Users said they were unable to log in to their accounts and send tweets.
However, the number of complaints reduced by 8pm, indicating the restoration of services.
The Pakistan Telec­ommunications Authority (PTA) noted that social media platform X was facing a mass global outage, including in Pakistan, but stated that the country’s internet services “remain fully functional”.
“PTA’s investigation into the matter has confirmed that there are no technical issues at Pakistan’s internet gateways.”
“All other internet services across the country remain fully functional,” PTA said.
X was blocked in Pakistan on Feb 17, 2024, after allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections by a former bureaucrat. However, the platform was discreetly restored on May 7 after India fired missiles into Pakistan, resulting in a days-long conflict.
Prolonged disruption
The global internet observer NetBlocks has also confirmed the disruptions were global but not related to any country-level internet filtering.
Earlier today, X said that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
 






“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
The disruption came two days after a previous global outage, which affected the services of X for several hours on Thursday.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources.
The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.

He further said that the treaty still exists despite New Delhi holding it in abeyance “unilaterally and illegally”.
“The words ‘holding in abeyance’ used by India doesn’t exist anywhere in the law. Therefore, the Indus Water Treaty exist as it is, as these words cannot abolish it,” Mr Wattoo said while speaking at a seminar on Saturday.
“Holding the treaty in abeyance is absolutely illegal immoral. It is a violation of all international agreements,” the minister added.

Ex-Indus water commissioner warns China and other upstream countries may block flow of water to India

Talking about the background of the issue, the federal minister said the correspondence between the two countries were underway since 2024.
India wrote a letter to Pakistan, seeking some modification in the treaty under the Article 12 (3) of the treaty. Under the treaty, the minor issues related to water can be discussed and resolved on the level of commissioner of Indus waters representing Pakistan and India under Articles 8 to 11. But if the issues are more important, these can be discussed and resolved by both the parties, Pakistan and India.
“In its April 8 letter, they [India] sought us to tell the place where parties can sit and discuss the issue [related to modification]. In the letter, they also asked us to respond till May 8. But on April 24, India unilaterally suspended it,” he revealed, adding that holding treaty in abeyance doesn’t have any legal cover.
“The treaty cannot be held in abeyance or suspended unilaterally by anyone. It cannot be changed, modified, amended or cancelled by anyone. The treaty still exists.”
Mr Wattoo said Pakistan also wrote in response to India’s letter, stating to sit and discuss.
“We told them for holding negotiations on this, saying to reach results if we reach mutual understandings. But the aggression India did by taking action unilaterally is equal to act of war. The water is our lifeline and on this issue, we can neither compromise nor show any flexibility,” the minister warned.
“Currently, Pakistan is receiving normal flow of water from Indian side,” he said.
Talking about the canals issue in the country, Mr Wattoo said he wrote to all provinces to come forward and devise an action plan in this regard. “We have told the provinces to constitute a committee of independent experts and take a final decision mutually. In this way, the misunderstandings on the part of provinces would also be no more,” he maintained.
Former Indus water commissioner Asif Baig said that India had transboundary agreements on water with China, Nepal, Bangladesh and other neighbours. “Because China is sitting on upstream level from where water flows down to Indian located at downstream position. Similarly, in Pakistan case, India is on upstream location which is being bragged by Indian government. If India dubbing its upstream status as authority to stop water follow to Pakistan transgressing treaty, then what will happen if China and other upstream country block flow of water to India,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, former Indus Water commissioner,   Sheraz Memon said that even if India tried to block water flow toward Pakistan, it would be an exercise in futility due to the country’s insufficient capacity to water maneuverability.
“IWT survived in Pak-India two wars and barrage of terrorism allegations,” he said and suggested that sagacity demanded that treaty should go unaffected in all worst scenarios.
Former Punjab irrigation minister Mohsin Laghari categorically ruled out any one-sided suspension of IWT. He said if India was given liberty to do so, none of international treaties would stand exist and will lose their holistic merits.
“If India remains hell-bent on [stopping the flow of water coming to Pakistan], it will cost billions of dollars to build the infrastructure on rivers,” he added.

• Next review likely in second half of 2025
• Mission thanks federal, provincial authorities for constructive engagement
ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistani authorities have reached a preliminary agreement on a comprehensive financial framework, paving the way for continued negotiations on the budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Officials in the finance ministry indicate that discussions are set to advance in the coming days, with the goal of finalising crucial fiscal policies, including the revenue collection target for FY26, development outlay, defence expenditure, and the highly debated tariff rationalisation plan for the industry.
The areas where agreements remain pending include tax concessions for the salaried class, an increase in defence budget and policies related to real estate. The discussions will also focus on reducing expenditures, as well as continuing reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises.
 
 

According to an IMF announcement, the Fund mission, led by Nathan Porter, has concluded its staff visit to Islamabad. The staff visit focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation and the budget strategy for FY26.
The IMF delegation arrived in Islamabad on May 19 to review Pakistan’s recent economic developments, assess progress under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), and initiate discussions on the next federal budget.
“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY26 budget proposals and broader economic policy and reform agenda, supported by the 2024 EFF and the 2025 RSF,” Mr Nathan said.
The next mission, associated with the upcoming EFF and RSF reviews, is expected in the second half of 2025.
Finance ministry officials reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product in FY26.
It was stated that during the mission visit, discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and on prioritising expenditures.
 
 

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is facing significant shortfalls in the current fiscal year.
“We will discuss a realistic revenue target for the FBR while keeping in view real GDP growth and inflation,” tax officials said, adding that next year’s target will be based on actual revenue potential rather than setting an unrealistic goal.
“We will continue discussions towards agreeing on the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days,” Mr Nathan said.
He added that the discussions also covered ongoing energy sector reforms aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector, along with other structural reforms to foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.
Mr Nathan also said that Pakistani authorities emphasised their commitment to ensuring sound macroeconomic policymaking and building financial buffers. In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to anchor inflation within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5-7pc.
At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, preserving a fully functioning forex market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are considered critical to strengthening resilience against external shocks.
The mission thanked the federal and provincial authorities for their hospitality, constructive discussions and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies. The announcement said the IMF team will remain engaged and continue its close dialogue with the authorities.

The launch took place during the National Consu­ltative Workshop on the Power Sector Indig­eni­sation Roadmap, organised by the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) — formerly known as the National Tran­smission and Despatch Company (NTDC) — in collaboration with the LUMS Energy Institute.
Speaking via video link, Energy Minister Awais Leghari said the government was finalising a plan to supply 7,000-megawatt electricity to Pakistan’s export industry at the most competitive tariff in the region. “We are working on providing electricity at a marginal cost to boost exports,” the minister said. He added that power sector indigenisation was vital to shifting the country from an import-dependent to an export-led economy.
The event brought together experts from the power sector, manufacturing industry, regulatory bodies, policymakers and academia to chart a cohesive national strategy for accelerating the localisation of Pakistan’s electrical power equipment manufacturing ecosystem.
Mr Leghari said the NGC was the first national entity to implement an approved Indigenisation Policy, and its strategic procurement model was already delivering tangible results.
He urged the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), power distribution companies (Discos), K-Electric and state-owned and private power generation plants to adopt indigenisation as a strategic imperative — not as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), but as a core procurement principle aligned with the National Electricity Plan 2023-27.
 
 

The minister said the government was striving for an export-oriented economy instead of imports, and power sector indigenisation was the need of the hour. The power sector reforms were going on, the Independent System and Market Operator had been fully functional, and the Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company would also be made functional soon, he said.
The Power Equipment Manufacturing Dashboard — developed by the Lums Energy Institute with input from key stakeholders — was jointly inaugurated by NGC board Chairman Dr Fiaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Pakistan Engineering Council chairman Engr Waseem Nazir, NGC Managing Director Engr Muhammad Waseem Younas, K-Electric CEO Syed Monis Abdullah Alvi, and others.
Commenting on the dashboard, the federal minister said its launch would help indigenise the power sector.
On the occasion, Dr Fiaz stated that the NGC’s indigenisation strategy — anchored in policy reform and targeted educational orders — has already saved over $10 million in foreign exchange through import substitution.
Dr Fiaz, also a senior adviser at the Lums Energy Institute, reaffirmed that Lums would continue supporting policy design, digital innovation and institutional transformation in the energy sector.
He said that under the 10-year Integrated Generation Capacity Expansion Plan and the Transmission System Expansion Plan, investment of $8 billion would be needed in the transmission sector. “We want this equipment and material to be manufactured in Pakistan, which will save valuable foreign exchange,” he said.
Mr Younas outlined the tangible progress under the Indigenisation Policy.
He said that since 2022, the NGC had placed over Rs2bn in local orders, including Rs781m in educational orders aimed at building industrial capacity.
Additionally, NGC’s revision of its Type Test Policy in 2023 to align with international benchmarks has opened the door for local manufacturers to compete globally.
The workshop concluded with consensus on actionable steps to align procurement practices with national localisation goals, foster technology partnerships, and create a clear roadmap for import substitution.

As diplomats met in New York to prepare for an international conference in June, aimed at advancing global efforts towards achieving a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, Pakistan called for addressing the root cause: Israel’s prolonged occupation.
“Only by ending the occupation can we secure a just and lasting peace,” Amb­assador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the preparatory session that brought together UN member states to finalise arrangements for eight roundtables.
“This conference is both timely and essential,” he said, pointing out that Palestinian people’s continued suffering, the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the systematic erosion of the two-state solution through illegal settlements and unilateral measures by the occupying power demand a resolute international response.
 



Amb Iftikhar spells out steps at preparatory session for June conference to preserve Palestinian statehood viability

The conference will take place at the UN headquarters in New York from June 17 to 20. It stems from a resolution approved by the UN General Assembly in December 2024 and will be co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France.
In his remarks, he said in the lead-up to the June conference, it was imperative to restore and fully implement a ceasefire in Gaza, lift the blockade, ensure unimpeded humanitarian access, including through UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and protect civilians and aid workers.
“Any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians, annex territory, or impose militarised aid mechanisms must be firmly rejected,” he said.
Mechanism, transit corridor
To preserve the viability of Palestinian statehood, he said that, among other steps, the conference “must establish a mechanism to monitor and promote enforcement of relevant UNSC resolutions, including those which term settlements illegal and efforts made to secure Palestine’s admission as a full UN member state; and, operationalise the Gaza Reconstruction Plan endorsed by the OIC and Arab Group. Projects such as a Gaza-West Bank transit corridor, seaport reconstruction, and industrial zones are vital for territorial contiguity and Palestinian unity.”
 






He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian Question, rooted in international law and relevant UN resolutions, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds as the capital of Palestine.
“This conference must serve a turning point, and deliver tangible outcomes,” he told delegates. “Pakistan stands ready to support this conference and contribute to a credible political horizon, for a two-state solution — one that upholds Palestinian rights, ends occupation and delivers durable peace through a viable, sovereign Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” he added.
Earlier, UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang urged countries to seize the crucial opportunity to finally make progress.
 
 

“The horrors we have witnessed in Gaza for over 19 months should spur us to urgent action to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The devastating cycles of death, destruction, and displacement cannot be allowed to continue,” he said.
“This conflict cannot be resolved through permanent war, nor through endless occupation or annexation. It will only end when Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own sovereign, independent states, in peace, security and dignity.”

According to the Indian publication, the cancellation closely follows India’s recent move to withdraw the transhipment facility previously extended to Bangladesh to export its cargo to third countries — a development that analysts interpret as signalling strain in bilateral relations.
In a regulatory disclosure submitted to the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd and BSE Ltd under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Require­ments) Regulations, 2015, GRSE confirmed that the government of Bangladesh had cancelled the order, originally placed in July 2024.
The cancellation adds to a series of geopolitical developments since the change in political leadership in Bangladesh following the fall of prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government in August 2024. Observers note that ties between the two neighbours have become increasingly tense in recent months.
In a statement, GRSE also announced that it had emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of Next Generation Corvettes (NGC) for the Indian Navy.

Earlier this month, two other Pakistani mountaineers achieved feats of their own, with renowned Pakistani climber Sajid Ali Sadpara summiting the world’s seventh highest peak, Dhaulagiri (8,167 m), without oxygen or porter support on May 11 and renowned Pakistani climber Sirbaz Khan successfully summiting Mt Kangchenjunga (8,586m), the third highest peak in the world, without supplemental oxygen on May 18.
Munawar’s official Facebook account confirmed the feat, writing that he “raised the green flag at the summit of [the] highest peak in the world”.
“This is the first time that a Pakistani has summited Mt Everest from the north side,” the post added. “Saad has safely descended back to Camp 3 for the night. Requesting prayers for safe descent back to the base camp during the next days.”
According to climbers, the route to summit Everest’s northern face starts in Tibet, a different route from most mountaineers who ascend from the Nepalese side.
Additionally, according to mountaineering website Explorersweb, Chinese authorities only started issuing permits to summit the northern face last January.
Summiting Everest from the north bypasses the Khumbu Icefall, a dangerous section on the South Side, making it safer in that aspect.
Mingma G, owner of the Imagine Nepal expedition team of which Munawar was a part, told Dawn.com that Saad Munawar and eight other foreign climbers successfully climbed Everest from the north side on Saturday morning.
“Saad recently began climbing high-altitude mountains and has already conquered Aconcagua, Elbrus, Kilimanjaro, and Lobuche Peak in Nepal,” he added.
Karrar Haidri, Secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, also congratulated Munawar in a statement.
“We are immensely proud to share that Saad Bin Munawar has made history as the first and only Pakistani to summit Mount Everest (8,848.86 meters) via the challenging North Side route — a feat that places him among the world’s elite mountaineers,” the statement read.
The club’s statement added that Munawar is a “renowned adventurer, mountaineer, and author [and] has long been a source of inspiration in Pakistan’s adventure community”.
“Before this Everest ascent, he was the first Pakistani to summit Mt Aconcagua, the highest peak outside Asia,” the statement added. “His leadership in expeditions and mountaineering literature continues to motivate a new generation of climbers.”
In their statement, Imagine Nepal also congratulated the other climbers, including three women, for reaching the summit from the north side.
“Dr Simone Molter from Germany conquered her first 8000m peak, fulfilling her dream after years of preparation and determination,” Imagine Nepal wrote.
“Angela Yeung from South Africa stood on the world’s highest peak for a greater cause — “raising awareness and funds for survivors of gender-based violence through her Impilo Collection Foundation,” it added.
“Chhiri Aangjum Sherpa from Nepal, completed her 4th continental summit, inspiring women everywhere with her strength, unity, and vision,” the statement continued. “These women are more than climbers — they are leaders, activists, and role models proving that no peak is too high when driven by purpose.”
The other climbers included Justin Moore Walker from the United States, Dawa Gyalje Sherpa, Ang Mingma Sherpa, Sonam Tashi Sherpa, Ngima Dorjee Sherpa, Lakpa Tenzing Sherpa, Dawa Kami Sherpa and Thupten Topchen Sherpa.</p><small>2025-05-24 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2421464373a86a6.jpg?r=214927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913088/trump-rips-into-diversity-and-inclusion-policies-in-rally-style-speech' target='_blank'><strong>Trump rips into diversity and inclusion policies in rally-style speech</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump ripped into diversity and inclusion policies in the United States, knocked Nato and took credit for building up the military on Saturday in a campaign-style commencement speech at the prestigious West Point Military Academy in New York.
Trump, wearing a suit and his signature red “Make America Great Again” cap, mixed advice to “work hard” with a list of his top grievances about cultural and political issues while speaking to a stadium filled with cadets, family members and a largely supportive crowd.
“The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to transform foreign cultures,” Trump said. “The military’s job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime, in any place.”
Since coming into office for the second time in January, Trump has rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the military and throughout the government as part of a larger effort to rescind policies enacted by his predecessor, Joe Biden.
“We’ve liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” Trump told the 1,002 cadets graduating from the academy. “There will be no more critical race theory or transgender for everybody forced onto our brave men and women in uniform, or on anybody else for that matter in this country.”
 


Trump has been a strong supporter of the military even as he has put his own stamp on it, as he has on other branches of government. In February, he fired the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of military leadership.
It was the second time Trump addressed graduates of the academy on the Hudson River following his appearance in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when cadets sat further apart and wore masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
West Point aims to educate the next generation of army leaders for a military that is meant to be apolitical and is sworn to defend the US Constitution.
In a speech full of partisan rhetoric on Saturday, Trump took credit for rebuilding the Army and referenced his tariff-fueled trade war while repeating his longstanding criticism of Nato allies for not spending more on defence.
“We’ve been ripped off by every nation in the world on trade. We’ve been ripped off at the Nato level,” Trump said. “We’ve been ripped off like no country has ever been ripped off, but they don’t rip us off anymore.”
The president will preside over the army’s celebration of its 250th anniversary on June 14 with a parade on one of Washington’s main thoroughfares. The anniversary coincides with Trump’s own birthday.
This week, Trump spoke about a signature piece of his military vision, announcing he had selected a design for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defence shield and named a Space Force general to head the programme aimed at blocking threats from China and Russia. Trump said on Saturday that the shield would protect West Point.
Experts have said the Golden Dome could provoke other states to launch similar systems or develop more advanced weapons to evade the missile shield, escalating an arms race in space.</p><small>2025-05-24 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24141259b47c243.png?r=142019' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913040/pakistani-users-able-to-access-x-after-brief-disruption-amid-global-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani users able to access X after brief disruption amid global outage</strong></a><br><p>Services on social media platform X were restored on Saturday evening as users in Pakistan were able to access the site.
According to real-time monitor Downdetector, fewer problem reports were submitted on Saturday evening, with a low of 40 complaints reported by 8:36pm.

Earlier, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) noted that social media platform X was facing a mass global outage, including in Pakistan, but stated that the country’s internet services “remain fully functional”.
According to a statement, the telecom body said that this disruption follows a similar one reported on Thursday, which was resolved by the platform itself.
“PTA’s investigation into the matter has confirmed that there are no technical issues at Pakistan’s internet gateways,” the statement read. “All other internet services across the country remain fully functional.”
The PTA added that global internet observatory NetBlocks also confirmed that the outages are international and “not related to any country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
Users in Pakistan previously reported mass disruption on the social media platform, with real-time monitor Downdetector showing a peak of 372 outages at 5:36pm.
Over 600 complaints in total were reported on Saturday.

Earlier today, X said that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
“Our team is working 24/7 to resolve this. Thanks for your patience — updates soon,” it said at 5am PKT.
 






In the early hours of Friday, the platform had said: “X is aware some of our users are experiencing performance issues on the platform today. We are experiencing a data centre outage and the team is actively working to remediate the issue.”
 






With X stating a “data centre outage” as a reason for the service disruption, users speculated that a fire at the platform’s data centre in the US state of Oregon’s Hillsboro city was the cause of the issues.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources. The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.
Downdetector, which tracks outages, did not show problems reported by users at 1pm. However, outages had spiked to 76 at around 8:30pm last night.

While updates by X did not mention issues with messaging services, many users reported not being able to access their direct messages (DMs), with an error reading: “Cannot retrieve messages at this time. Please try again later.”
Some users also reported being logged out of their accounts, with an error stating “something went wrong”.
 






X had remained blocked in Pakistan since Feb 17, 2024 — when allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections gained momentum — but was restored on May 7 amid the recent conflict with India.
Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, bought the platform (formerly Twitter) for $44 billion in late 2022. He rebranded it to X in July 2023, with the domain fully migrating to X.com in May 2024.
In March this year, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired X in a deal that valued the social media network at $33 billion.
Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, is also a close ally of US President Donald Trump and heads the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><small>2025-05-24 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/242023207dc21ef.jpg?r=202418' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913074/anti-polio-campaign-to-vaccinate-over-10m-children-in-sindh-starts-on-may-26' target='_blank'><strong>Anti-polio campaign to vaccinate over 10m children in Sindh starts on May 26</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Saturday announced that it is launching a five-day polio vaccination campaign in the province from May 26 to inoculate over 10 million children in the province.
Earlier this week, two new cases of polio were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, taking the tally for the current year to 10.
According to a press release, the campaign aims to immunise more than 10.6m children under the age of five across all 30 districts of Sindh.
“The campaign is taking place from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and involves the efforts of over 80,000 trained polio workers going door-to-door with support from 25,539 law enforcement personnel to ensure that no child is missed,” the statement said. “Children between the ages of 6 and 59 months will also receive Vitamin A supplements to help boost their immunity.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

According to the press release, this new campaign follows two previous drives in February and April. Earlier this week, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah raised the issue of rising polio cases and expressed the need for accountability and collective action.
“With continued virus circulation in some environmental samples and four polio cases reported in Sindh so far this year, this latest round of vaccinations reinforces the province’s resolve to interrupt transmission and protect children from the lifelong consequences of this preventable disease,” the press release read.
“Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere,” it added, quoting a spokesperson from the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Sindh. “This campaign reflects our commitment to reach every child, even in the hardest-to-reach communities, and to ensure that Pakistan moves closer to eradication.”
According to the EOC, polio teams will be active in 1,292 union councils, supported by district administrations and healthcare partners, delivering polio drops and engaging families at the doorstep.
“EOC Sindh appeals to parents, teachers, religious leaders, community elders, and the media to join hands in this vital national effort,” the press release added. “To report missed children or ask questions about the vaccine, citizens can call the 1166 helpline or WhatsApp 0346-777-6546.”
Pakistan, one of the only two polio-endemic countries in the world, reported 74 cases in 2024.
Earlier today, the KP government set a target of vaccinating approximately 7.3 million children under the age of five during a five-day anti-polio campaign, which also begins on Monday.
Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah inaugurated the campaign during a ceremony at Services Hospital, according to a press release.
Additional Secretary Health and Emergency Operations Centre coordinator Shafiullah Khan, representatives from Unicef and the World Health Organisation, and other officials were in attendance.</p><small>2025-05-24 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2416355477de065.jpg?r=172235' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913055/ahsan-iqbal-confirms-pakistan-will-increase-defence-budget-as-security-situation-calls-for-it' target='_blank'><strong>Ahsan Iqbal confirms Pakistan will increase defence budget as security situation calls for it</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday said that Pakistan will raise its defence budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26 keeping in view the recent escalation with India and New Delhi suspending a key river water-sharing treaty with Islamabad.
Earlier this month, the minister had announced that the federal budget would be presented on June 2, however, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said yesterday that the budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.
Meeting a delegation at the Institution of Engineers Pakistan (IEP) in Lahore, led by IEP Secretary General Engr Ameer Zameer, the planning minister told reporters that the budget had not been delayed due to any pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but because of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s upcoming visit to friendly nations and the Eidul Azha holidays.
“We had very good negotiations with the IMF,” Iqbal said. “As you’ve seen, they acknowledged our government’s efforts. The main reason behind the delay is the PM’s five-day visit to friendly countries … and Eid after that.
“We decided to present the budget after Eid so that we can easily convene a meeting of parliament afterwards,” he added.
Iqbal said that the government wants to minimise the burden on the general public, but noted that defence spending would increase to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty.
“It is our national duty to provide the armed forces with whatever they need in this budget to bolster their capacity and defend our country in the future,” the minister said. “It has been proven that we have a dangerous neighbour (India) who attacked us in the night, but we gave them a befitting response.”
He added that the country must “remain ready to respond if they attack again”.
Speaking about Pakistani water security, Iqbal said that the country will fast-track water projects, including the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams.
“We are prioritising them so that Pakistani water is secure,” he said.
“The PM has sent over a thousand agricultural engineers to China for training, who will complete their training this year and bring about an agricultural Green Revolution 2.0,” he explained. “We aim to develop our own seeds and modernise our dairy and livestock sectors.”
Iqbal added that within the budget, funding has been allocated for an internship for engineers. “Thousands of young engineers across the country will be able to receive on-the-job training so that they receive better job opportunities in the market.”
However, he stated that Pakistan would only have a development budget of Rs1 trillion to do all of this.
“Our ministers required Rs3tr to complete our ongoing projects. But, because of this shortfall, we are putting a cap on low-priority projects and will try to complete our high-priority projects as quickly as possible.
Political unity
When asked about political relations with the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Iqbal expressed that there needs to be unity among all political actors.
Criticising the PTI, he said, “When we passed the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we tried to take all parties on board and reach a consensus. But when the PTI took this to their founder, he vetoed it.
“Similarly, when the nation is standing behind Field Marshal Asim Munir’s leadership, look at the statements the PTI founder is giving about him,” Iqbal added. “At a time when we need national solidarity, he is only thinking about retaliation.”</p><small>2025-05-24 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241435293fedb2e.jpg?r=173711' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913044/govt-to-cancel-passports-of-deported-pakistanis-register-cases-against-them' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to cancel passports of deported Pakistanis, register cases against them</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that the passports of the Pakistanis, who were returning to the country after being deported, will be cancelled and also face the registration of an first information report (FIR) against them.
Saudi Arabia deported a total of 5,033 Pakistani beggars whereas another 369 individuals have been apprehended for begging in five other countries in the last 16 months.
Last month, the interior minister had said that the government would block the passports of Pakistanis deported, and tighten the process of issuing new travel documents.
Around 106 Pakistanis were also deported from European countries arrived in Islamabad last month.
According to state-run PTV News, an important meeting, led by the interior minister, was held in Islamabad where it was decided that deportees who were coming back will have their passports cancelled and an FIR will also be registered against them.
The names of the deportees will also be put on the passport control list for five years, PTV News added.
A committee was also formed under the chairmanship of the interior secretary to further tighten and improve passport laws.
Naqvi was quoted as saying that the deportees were causing embarrassment to Pakistan at an international level, adding that no concessions would be made to them in the future.</p><small>2025-05-24 10:01</small></div><hr>
