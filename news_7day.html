<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10111545d25ea6d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929946/2-killed-in-accident-as-mob-torches-7-dumper-trucks-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>2 killed in accident as mob torches 7 dumper trucks in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Two siblings were killed and their father injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall early Sunday, sparking mob violence and protests that disrupted traffic on key city routes, officials said.
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that around 3:15am, a dumper truck hit a motorcycle carrying a family, killing Mahnoor, 22, and her 14-year-old brother Ahmed Raza, and injuring their 48-year-old father, Shakir.
Following the incident, transporters staged a protest by blocking Rashid Minhas Road and the Superhighway near Sohrab Goth, causing traffic jams.
Both inbound and outbound roads on Rashid Minhas Road from Sohrab Goth towards Gulshan-i-Iqbal were closed, while traffic on Al-Asif Square towards the city and towards Hyderabad was also halted in both directions.
“A mob gathered and set fire to a total of seven dumpers on both sides of the road within the limits of Yusuf Plaza and Federal B Area police stations,” the SSP told Dawn.com.
“The police reached the spot to apprehend the driver and took the dumper in custody.”
The police cordoned off the area, set up diversions, and called fire tenders to put off the fire, Siddiqi said.
“Furthermore, police have arrested 14 suspects on charges of torching the dumpers, and more arrests are being made with the help of videos and technical evidence.”
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com the siblings were brought dead to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while their father was injured. Quoting relatives, she said the deceased girl was to get married soon.
Dr Summaiya said police brought in two drivers with critical injuries after they were beaten by the mob. She said the alleged errant driver was critically injured but stable, while a driver of another burnt dumper was also in critical condition with head injuries.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan confirmed that seven dumpers were torched near Lucky One Mall in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, adding that the fire tenders controlled the fire. “The heavy vehicles were badly damaged in arson acts,” he said.
Later, a statement from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon’s office stated that negotiations between the transporters and the provincial government were successful, with the former agreeing to end their demonstration.
A delegation of transporters led by Haji Yousaf and Jam Alam met Memon at the Karachi Commissioner House.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin and the city’s police chief, Javed Alam Odho, were also present on the occasion.
The statement added that Memon expressed condolences for those killed in the accident and condemned the “violent acts” that took place afterwards.
 






“The Sindh government will prioritise resolving their (the transporters’) legitimate issues,” Memon was quoted as saying.
“Violence and vandalism are not the solution to these problems. We will work with all parties to solve the problems of the transport sector and ensure that these incidents do not happen again.”
Memon added that those who committed acts of vandalism and “took the law into their own hands” will be charged under anti-terrorism laws.
“Dumper owners will ensure that their trucks are fitted with cameras and trackers, while they will have insurance and truck drivers’ licences,” Memon was quoted as saying. “A committee will be formed to assess the losses incurred by transporters.”
Earlier this month, a high-speed trailer truck crashed in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA), injuring two people.
In July, a 59-year-old milk supplier was killed when a dumper ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10171239f90f084.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929988/pti-will-approach-lawyers-over-rumoured-27th-amendment-asad-qaiser' target='_blank'><strong>PTI will approach lawyers over ‘rumoured’ 27th Amendment: Asad Qaiser</strong></a><br><p>PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser on Sunday addressed rumours of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, stating that the party would approach the legal fraternity regarding the potential legislation.
After passing the 26th Constitutional Amendment last year, the government had been planning to table another amendment, colloquially known as the 27th Amendment, aimed at reforming local governments and “addressing issues skipped in previous legislation”.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, the PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker stated that there is “new drama” surrounding the legislation.
“In this case, we will approach the lawyers’ community regarding this legislation,” Qaiser said. “We will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.”
Referring to a “schedule of activities” for this month, Qaiser said that the PTI will also arrange an engagement with foreign diplomats and embassies, as well as a seminar.
The PTI leader also assailed the manner in which the country is being governed, branding it “illegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic”.
“The country is practically under martial law and decisions are being made based on personal preferences,” Qaiser stated. “The country cannot be run under this hybrid system we have right now.
“We have decided that we will use all available forums — parliament, the courts, the public — to take our struggle against injustice and oppression forward.”
 






Qaiser claimed that courts made decisions not based on merit, but due to institutional pressure.
“We believe that the cases of political prisoners, including [PTI founder] Imran Khan, should be judged on merit, not due to pressure from the authorities,” he emphasised. “If the trials are decided on merit and there is live coverage in the media, the nation will see what a drama this is.”
Qaiser continued: “Then there’s also a show in the assembly. The way it’s being controlled and the way its system is being run, as well as the way parliamentarians are being humiliated in front of Adiala Jail, is concerning. I have conducted some research into this matter and will bring it up before the National Assembly.
“According to our own rules, it is written that any MNA can inspect prisons. Is it just written down or can it actually be enforced?” he asked.
Details about the proposed constitutional amendment were divulged by sources following a meeting bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairperson Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari in Lahore, atten­ded by key leaders from both parties on October 27 last year.
In contradicting statements, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had declared that the government was not considering any such legislation. At the same time, then-adviser to the PM on Law and Justice Barr­ister Aqeel Malik had hinted that the government could not only table “an amendment” in parliament, but would also be able to pass it.
In June this year, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.
In a post on X in July, PTI founder Imran wrote that rather than bringing in the amendment “through a sham parliament, it would be better to openly declare a monarchy, because what exists today is outright dictatorship, forcibly imposed on the country”.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101704336925d73.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929987/sindh-govt-to-extend-e-bike-scheme-to-minority-workers' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt to extend e-bike scheme to minority workers</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Workers Welfare Board (WWB) on Sunday decided to extend its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.
The move coincides with the National Minorities Day, which is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion.
According to a statement, Sindh Labour Secretary Rafique Qureshi underscored the symbolic significance of this step, noting that “the white stripe in Pakistan’s flag represented minorities and their equal rights”.
Religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of mob attacks, forced conversions and blasphemy cases, as noted by the European Union’s Sebastien Lorion.
Just last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das acknowledged that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.
 
 

According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been approved by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.
An EU-funded project for strengthening minority rights is being implemented in Punjab and Sindh by the Parliamentarians Commission for Human Rights in partnership with the Centre for Social Justice.
In July, a group of non-Muslim senators wrote to Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani, calling for the formation of a minority caucus in the House to represent their rights.
Last year, the founding chairman of the Pakistan Minorities Movement Peter Charles Sahotra had said minority communities face insecurity and discrimination in Pakistan and called upon the government to ensure their rights as provided in the Constitution.
Health insurance ramped up, solar-powered homes
The WWB also announced various other steps for the welfare of workers.
“The Workers’ Accidental Health Insurance Scheme will now provide annual health coverage worth Rs0.7 million, along with access to treatment in 270 hospitals nationwide,” it said.
The WWB also announced a major housing shift, replacing workers’ flats with fully solar-powered homes. Schools under the board will be solarised as well, with students receiving two sets of uniforms each year.
In line with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah’s directives, the death grant will be increased to Rs1m, while the marriage grant will be raised from Rs0.3m to Rs0.5m, the Sindh labour secretary said.
“The board is digitising all its operations to ensure fair and transparent service delivery to workers,” Qureshi noted.
The WWB, following its formal approval, will invest Rs3 billion in the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and approved Shariah-compliant Sukuk bonds to further strengthen the institution’s financial standing and expand facilities for workers.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1017242965f2968.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929989/mastung-blast-derails-6-bogies-as-jaffar-express-targeted-2nd-time-in-a-week' target='_blank'><strong>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</strong></a><br><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said on Sunday.
With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told Dawn.com: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”
The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station.
“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.
 
 

A relief train of the Pakistan Railways will bring back passengers of the affected train to Quetta by evening, and all tickets will be refunded, according to Kashif.
“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.
In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.
The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.
Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.
 
 

In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, damaging a bogie of the Bolan Mail.
A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a technical fault was the cause.
In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to derail in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident.
In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.
Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/6897bdf4f202a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929825/raksha-bandhan-a-sisterly-act-honouring-someone-special' target='_blank'><strong>Raksha Bandhan: A sisterly act honouring someone special</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Seven-month-old Mayur Sunil experienced his first Raksha Bandhan festival when his older sister Nomisha and cousin Jaya Ramesh tied the sacred thread around his little wrist with the flowing waters of Chinna Creek as witness at the Shri Lakshmi Narayan temple here on Saturday.
It was a memorable moment for the children’s mother and aunts, who were beaming with a glint of joy in their eyes. Earlier, Mayur’s older cousin Nikhil Ramesh, who held the baby while his sisters tied the red rakhi on his wrist, also got his rakhi from his younger sister Jaya.
Meanwhile, Faqira Vikash got a rakhi from Radhika Parmar. They were not real brother and sister but Radhika said that she saw Vikash as her protector and wanted to honour him by making him her brother.
Raksha Bandhan, the bond of love and protection between sisters and brothers, is celebrated annually on purnima, a full moon, in the Hindu month of Shravana, which is also commonly known as Sawan in North India. It is the fifth month of the Hindu lunar calendar.

Hindus celebrate the festival of siblings on the full moon of Sawan

There are many myths and legends attributed to Raksha Bandhan, one of which is about Lord Krishna injuring his hand which was quickly bandaged by Daupadi who tore off a strip of cloth from her saree pallu to do the needful and stop the bleeding. She always looked up to him as a brother.
 
 

Later, when she was harassed by some rascals who pulled her saree pallu, Krishna came to her rescue. With his extraordinary powers, the pallu kept unwinding as the men pulled without any end to it.
The rakhis used in this sweet ritual were available in abundance in an extensive variety from right outside the temple. You could buy 12 Pakistani rakhis for a hundred rupees and Indian rakhis, brought here in personal baggage, for double the price.
All the vendors were surprisingly Muslim. But then it was also not surprising to find Muslim women also coming to buy the rakhis for friends whom they look up to as brothers.
“In Pakistan, the festival may carry religious significance for Hindus but for Muslims, it is also a cultural festival. I’m going to tie a rakhi around my friend in college, who is always looking out for me,” said Ayesha Mahmood, a customer buying several threads from a stall.
Asked how many were she going to tie around one person’s wrist, she laughed and shared that many of her female friends had also requested her to get a rakhi or two for them as they also wanted to honour someone special.

A statement by PAA Spokesperson Saifullah Khan said, “According to the Notams issued, due to air activities ahead of Independence Day on August 14, arrival and departure flights will be suspended for only two hours on specific days and times.”
From August 6-9 and August 11-14, the airport will be shut from 11am-1pm PST.
On August 9 and 11, the airport will also be shut from 8-10pm.
“Apart from these brief interruptions, all flights at the airport will continue as usual,” the statement said, advising passengers to contact their airline for the latest information on their schedule.
The government has said that this year’s Independence Day would be celebrated under the banner of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth) — the period of conflict with India in May — to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress and pride.
 
 

While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.
During the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India, flight disruptions left hundreds of passengers stranded at the country’s major airports, including Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports.
The Ministry of Defence informed the National Assembly on Friday that the PAA lost Rs4.1 billion from April 24 to June 30 due to the closure.
PAA also issued a schedule for temporary runway closure at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International airport owing to bird activity. The closure will be in effect daily from 5am to 8am, starting July 1 until September 15.</p><small>2025-08-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101607512ffa03b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929973/over-600-pilgrims-briefly-hospitalised-due-to-chlorine-gas-leak-in-iraqs-karbala' target='_blank'><strong>Over 600 pilgrims briefly hospitalised due to chlorine gas leak in Iraq’s Karbala</strong></a><br><p>More than 600 pilgrims in Iraq were briefly hospitalised with respiratory problems after inhaling chlorine as a result of a leak at a water treatment station, authorities said on Sunday.
The incident took place overnight on the route between the two Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, located in the centre and south of Iraq, respectively.
This year, several million Shia Muslim pilgrims are expected to make their way to Karbala, which houses the shrines of the revered Imam Husain and his brother Abbas.
There, they will mark the Arbaeen — the 40-day period of mourning during which the community commemorate the death of Husain, grandson of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
In a brief statement, Iraq’s health ministry said that “621 cases of asphyxia have been recorded following a chlorine gas leak in Karbala”.
“All have received the necessary care and left the hospital in good health,” it said.
Security forces charged with protecting pilgrims meanwhile said the incident had been caused by “a chlorine leak from a water station on the Karbala-Najaf road”.
Much of Iraq’s infrastructure is in disrepair due to decades of conflict and corruption, with adherence to safety standards often lax.
In July, a massive fire at a shopping mall in the eastern city of Kut killed more than 60 people, many of whom suffocated in the toilets, according to authorities.</p><small>2025-08-10 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10145658ba35b18.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929966/self-amusement-chinese-expert-spurns-indias-claims-on-downing-pakistani-jets' target='_blank'><strong>‘Self-amusement’: Chinese expert spurns India’s claims on downing Pakistani jets</strong></a><br><p>China’s former defence attache in South Asia Cheng Xizhong on Sunday spurned India’s much-delayed claim that it had shot down six Pakistani aircraft during the May conflict, terming it “self-amusement”.
Having faced international coverage of its own craft being downed by Pakistan and scathing criticism from the opposition, India’s Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh — three months after the conflict — claimed yesterday that his country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during those clashes.
While Pakistan had already denied that India downed any of its aircraft, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif swiftly rubbished Singh’s “belated assertions” yesterday.
Commenting on the matter today, Cheng said India’s allegations lacked strong evidence and have been “widely questioned by the international community, being considered groundless”, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Singh’s remarks were “comical, implausible and unconvincing”. “We may call it self-amusement,” he said in a statement.
 
 

Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes during the conflict. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
“The Indian side has not presented any evidence, such as photos of the wreckage of the fighter jets, radar monitoring data, etc, while the Pakistani side had previously presented a large amount of relevant evidence of shooting down the Indian fighter jets,” Cheng noted.
The defence expert believed that everything should be based on sufficient evidence.
He highlighted that now, more than three months have passed since the India-Pakistan clash. New Delhi has never produced any evidence to prove that it had shot down Pakistani fighter jets, Cheng highlighted.
“In contrast, the Pakistan side immediately provided a detailed technical report to international media after the clash ended,” he added.
The Chinese expert also cited “confirmations from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, and foreign intelligence assessments that India suffered heavy losses of multiple aircraft”.
“It is thus evident that no Pakistani fighter jet was hit or destroyed by the Indian side. On the contrary, the Pakistani side shot down six Indian fighter jets and destroyed S-400 air defence positions, among other achievements, which is an indisputable fact,” he added.
Professor Cheng is currently a senior research fellow at the Chinese think tank Charhar Institute and has also served as a former United Nations senior military observer, according to CGTN.
In his claims yesterday, the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief did not mention the type of Pakistan’s fighter jets that he insisted were taken down.
Asif, responding to Singh, stated that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India. He declared that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S-400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
Former envoy to the United States Dr Maleeha Lodhi also termed Singh’s claim “laughable”, quipping that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”
Criticism also echoed from within India. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera cast his doubts, saying: “The question we have after today’s information … when we had such a strong army and we were advancing, then under whose pressure did you stop Operation Sindoor?”
New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “a few planes”, refusing to go into the specifics of it. US President Donald Trump has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.
India’s loss of jets affirmed globally
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The IAF has not commented on those claims.
 
 

Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).
India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, acknowledged in June that the PAF downed Indian fighters, according to The Wire.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle with Pakistan, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the PAF’s J-10 fighters using PL-15 missiles, according to a Reuters report.
In a press briefing two days after the May 7 air combat, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Aura­n­g­zeb Ahmed, the deputy chief of operations of Pakistan Air Force (PAF), shared the locations where five Indian jets were downed — four along the Line of Control and one near Bathinda in northwest India. He also disclosed that one of the Indian jets was downed by Pakistani air defence systems.
According to a Dawn report, which cited PAF officials, India’s three Rafales, one Su-30MKI and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not a single Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
 
 

Describing the engagement as a textbook case of modern aerial warfare, AVM Aurangzeb had said Pakistan had tracked over 70 Indian aircraft — including 14 Rafales — using its Electro­mag­netic Operational Environ­ment and responded with a concentrated and pre-planned defensive counter-air strategy.
“Our side deployed 42 high-tech aircraft,” the PAF officer said. He noted that while India remained on its side of the border and launched air-to-ground we­a­pons, Pakistani defe­nces detected and enga­ged the threats instantly.</p><small>2025-08-10 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101313374b9df21.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929957/china-wants-us-to-relax-ai-chip-export-controls-for-trade-deal-report' target='_blank'><strong>China wants US to relax AI chip-export controls for trade deal: report</strong></a><br><p>China wants the United States to ease export controls on chips critical for artificial intelligence as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Chinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.
The White House, State Department, and China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.
HBM chips, which help perform data-intensive AI tasks quickly, are closely watched by investors due to their use alongside AI graphic processors, particularly Nvidia’s NVDA.O.
The FT said China is concerned because the US HBM controls hamper the ability of Chinese companies such as Huawei to develop their own AI chips.
 
 

Successive US administrations have curbed exports of advanced chips to China, looking to stymie Beijing’s AI and defence development.
While this has impacted US firms’ ability to fully address booming demand from China, one of the world’s largest semiconductor markets, it still remains an important revenue driver for American chipmakers.</p><small>2025-08-10 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101348275812608.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929964/3-terrorists-eliminated-as-cop-killed-in-southeast-iran-media' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists eliminated as cop killed in southeast Iran: media</strong></a><br><p>Extremists killed one policeman in Iran’s restive southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, Iranian media reported on Sunday, adding that three assailants also died.
“A policeman from Saravan was killed while terrorists were trying to enter the police station” in that area of Sistan-Baluchistan, the Tasnim news agency said.
The attackers were members of the militant group Jaish al-Adl ( “Army of Justice” in Arabic) active in Iran’s southeast, the agency said.
“Three terrorists were killed and two were arrested,” Tasnim said.
Sistan-Baluchistan, which shares a long border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been the site of frequent clashes between security forces and insurgents or smugglers, including militants who say they are fighting for greater rights and autonomy.
 
 

On July 26, gunmen stormed a courthouse in the province’s capital Zahedan, killing at least six people, in an attack that was later claimed by Jaish al-Adl.
In one of the deadliest attacks in the province, 10 police officers were killed in October.
At least three policemen were killed in separate attacks by militants and gunmen in Sistan-Baluchistan in September 2024. Five cops were shot dead in April that year as well.</p><small>2025-08-10 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101253098cd0e05.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929955/trump-nominates-state-dept-spokeswoman-bruce-as-us-deputy-representative-to-un' target='_blank'><strong>Trump nominates State Dept spokeswoman Bruce as US deputy representative to UN</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was nominating State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce as the next US deputy representative to the United Nations.
Bruce has been the State Department spokesperson since Trump took office in January.
In a post on social media in which Trump announced her nomination, the president said she did a “fantastic job” as State Department spokesperson. Bruce will need to be confirmed for the role by the US Senate, where Trump’s Republican Party holds a majority.
During press briefings, she has defended the Trump administration’s foreign policy decisions ranging from an immigration crackdown and visa revocations to US responses to the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel’s military onslaught on Gaza, including a widely condemned armed private aid operation in the Palestinian territory.
 
 

Bruce was previously a political contributor and commentator on Fox News for over 20 years.
She has also authored books like Fear Itself: Exposing the Left’s Mind-Killing Agenda, which criticised liberals and left-leaning viewpoints.
In a post after Trump’s announcement, Bruce thanked him and suggested that the role was a “few weeks” away. Neither Trump nor Bruce mentioned an exact timeline in their online posts.
“Now I’m blessed that in the next few weeks my commitment to advancing America First leadership and values continues on the global stage in this new post,” Bruce wrote on X.
 






Trump has picked former White House national security adviser Mike Waltz to be his UN envoy. Waltz’s Senate confirmation for that role, wherein he will be Bruce’s boss, is still due.
Waltz was Trump’s national security adviser until he was ousted on May 1 after he was caught up in a March scandal involving a Signal chat among top Trump national security aides on military strikes in Yemen. Trump then nominated Waltz as his UN ambassador.

Pitted against Colombian world number 21 Miguel Rodriguez in the last-16 stage, Noor managed to come from 2-1 down to force a deciding game but was ultimately overpowered.
“Noor played with heart, but Rodriguez’s experience made the difference  in crucial moments,” said Pakistan coach Fahim Gul, with the team making its debut at the Games. “This is a learning  curve for him and hell come back stronger.”
 






Noor made a fast start, taking the first game 11-2 in just six minutes but Rodriguez grew into the contest, taking the next two games 11-7 and 11-9. Noor hit back in the fourth game, taking it 13-11 before Rodriguez clinched the decisive fifth game 11-6.
He will now have to contend with the special plate event with a quarter-final against Egyptian Mohammad Nasser on Sunday.
Nasir advanced to the quarter-finals of the plate event a day after falling in the first round. He crushed Austrian Daniel Lutz 11-7, 11-4, 11-8 to set up a last-eight match against Romanian Radu Pena.
“Nasir played smart squash today, controlling the match from the start,” Fahim said. “He’s determined to make the most of this opportunity.”
The multi-sport World Games feature non-Olympic sports although Squash is set to make its Olympic debut at Los Angeles 2028.
Elsewhere on Saturday, the three-day tug-of-war competitions kicked off with Britain’s men’s 640kg team clinching gold after a dominant performance against reigning champion Switzerland.
In canoeing, Denmark’s Mads Brandt Pedersen took gold in the men’s K1 short distance event while Sweden’s Melina Andersson took the women’s race.
Also at the Xinglong Lake Hubin Arena, Dragon boat made its debut as an official sport with Indonesia claiming the first gold medal in the open 8-seater 2,000m pursuit race.
Over at the Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium, China captured the women’s group title in acrobatic gymnastics while Alexey Glukhov and Anastasia Glazunova of Moldova won the standard dance event.

• If you feel heaviness while walking or climbing stairs, get an ECG done immediately, cardiologists advise
KARACHI: Senior cardiologists on Saturday shared the shocking findings of a study according to which nearly 50 per cent of heart attack patients in the country are younger than 49 years, and 12 to 15pc of them are under 40 years of age.
The health experts representing the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) were speaking at a symposium held at a local hotel here.
The experts warned that this trend — fueled by diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, and unhealthy lifestyles — is making Pakistan one of the world’s worst-hit countries for early-age heart attacks.
The trial was designed and conducted independently by NICVD’s cardiology team and ran from June 7, 2021, to December 31, 2023. It enrolled 261 post-heart attack patients for testing effects of two anticoagulants for treating a blood clot that can form in the heart after an attack and cause stroke or other complications.
The findings have been published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances.
 
 

According to principal investigator Dr Jehangir Ali Shah, the new drug achieved faster clot resolution in the early phase — 20 per cent at four weeks versus 8.3 per cent (with the old medicine), while both drugs had similar high success rates at 12 weeks.
“This is the largest randomised trial to date in acute left ventricular thrombus, and the results show that the new drug is safe and effective alternative,” he said, adding that 15 per cent of participants were under 40 years.
NICVD Director of Cath Lab Dr Abdul Hakeem called for public health urgency. “Pakistan has the highest rate of young heart attack patients globally. Every third adult has diabetes, 40 per cent have high blood pressure, obesity is common, and smoking rates remain high. Many patients don’t know they’re at risk. After the age of 30, everyone should get a cardiac check-up,” he said.
He added that common misconceptions — such as assuming a heart attack always causes severe chest pain — can delay treatment.
“Nine out of 10 patients have no pain, only heaviness in the chest or acidity-like discomfort. If you feel chest heaviness while walking or climbing stairs, get an ECG done immediately,” he advised.
Dr Hakeem warned that the most dangerous anterior heart attack can damage up to 60 per cent of the heart muscle and often causes a clot that appears four to eight weeks later, increasing stroke risk.
NICVD Executive Director Dr Tahir Saghir said the institute was now moving into further advanced research, including trials on drug-coated balloons that do not require stents — a development that could reduce future artery blockages. “We already have international funding for this work, and the direct beneficiaries will be our patients,” he said.
Senior cardiologist Dr Nadeem Rizvi emphasised the importance of locally conducted clinical research, saying that results based on Pakistan’s environment and healthcare system were more practical and applicable.
Dow Institute of Cardiology Director Dr Tariq Farman said genetic, socioeconomic, and physical differences between Pakistani and western populations required tailored treatment guidelines.
“We need our own data. Sometimes the recommended high doses aren’t suitable for our patients,” he said, adding that early diagnosis and treatment could prevent thousands of strokes in Pakistan’s heart patients every year.

Over that inaugural PSL season, Hasan Ali — now a household name — was the new kid on the block that barely anyone knew. However, that all changed once millions of eyeballs watched him give it his best in those opening encounters of the newly set-up premier T20 tournament.
Fast bowler Hasan Ali’s cricketing career coincides with the journey of the PSL as a league. He made his domestic debut in 2015, but it was the PSL which helped him hone his craft and, at the time of his international debut, he was more than ready for it.
Becoming the fastest to take 50 wickets for the Green Shirts in the ODI format — just a year into his international career — he was already the bowler of the tournament for an ICC event and had helped Pakistan win their first trophy in nearly eight years in the form of the Champions Trophy 2017.

From Hasan Ali in the first season to newcomer Fawad Ali this year, the Pakistan Super League continues to provide a much-needed springboard and safety net for young cricketers. Will it continue to do so going into its second decade?

Hasan credits a lot of those performances to the springboard that the PSL provided for him at the very start of his career.
“PSL was like a turning point for my career. If this league weren’t there, there is a possibility that I might have been limited to domestic cricket and would have made my international debut much later,” he tells Eos.
Throughout the years, as the fast bowler’s career went through ups and downs with injuries, PSL was a platform he used to return to the national fold.
This past 10th season, he made a comeback after an injury and went on to become the overall leading wicket-taker of the league.
FROM HASAN TO FAWAD
If Hasan was the fast bowler who made the most of the opportunity as an emerging player in the inaugural season of the PSL, Karachi’s Fawad Ali is the pacer who made waves in the recently concluded 10th season.
Hailing from the serene valleys of Swat, the right-arm pacer grew up playing tape ball cricket, like most young children do in the country. Like many blue-collar workers from that region do, he also went to Saudi Arabia and played cricket during his stay there.
Speaking about his journey to the PSL, Fawad relates how his mentors helped him bring him into the foray at the Kings. “Annu Bhai [Anwar Ali] has been pivotal to my journey, even guiding me on my diet plans and the latest fashion trends for haircuts!” Fawad says.
Those hard yards on the part of Fawad and his coaches culminated with him bowling the fastest ball of this season, clocked in at a brisk 150kph.
 

Fawad Ali celebrates with Hassan Ali and teammates after taking a wicket during the PSL X in Lahore in April. — Karachi Kings

He also got to meet the cricketer he idolised growing up, Australian pacer Shaun Tait. “When I got to know that he would be coaching Karachi, I was really excited to get to learn first-hand from him. Now I’m on such friendly terms with him, that I pick his brains all the time for bowling tips.”
Fawad’s journey also brings to the fore one of the most important aspects of the PSL — the financial freedom that the league provides in a country where athletes struggle to make a living, having to rely on the benevolence of donors and sponsors in order to pursue their careers.
Being the eldest in his household, Fawad hopes to build a house for his family, adding, “I would feel really proud if I could provide some relief to my father and brother by contributing towards my household.”
The league is also a springboard for greater cricketing endeavours. “PSL has given me an opportunity to experience the pressures that are associated with international cricket,” says Fawad, “and I hope that I will be able to fulfil my dream of playing for Pakistan.”
THE FRANCHISE CONUNDRUM
The PSL turned 10 this year, and this year could bring about monumental changes in the league going into the second decade of its existence.
PSL X was nothing less than the extravaganza it was expected to be — although interrupted by a four-day conflict between Pakistan and India, before the season completed with its usual furore. However, in terms of significance, the year is essentially just starting to take shape.

When the PCB sold the franchises for a whopping $93 million back in 2015, the ownership was not in perpetuity but for a 10-year term. These contracts are up for renewal this year and, while it is entirely possible that the teams might not end up changing ownership, according to franchise officials, the renewal is dependent on the following conditions:
If the present market value is less than what the franchises are paying currently, there is an automatic 25 per cent increase in the annual fee of these franchises in order to renew their contracts. However, if the new value is more than the existing amount the franchises are paying, the new amount would be the difference in aggregate plus the already determined 25pc bump.
Karachi Kings Team Director Haider Azhar has been involved in the league in various capacities since its inception. He was with Multan Sultans in various capacities as well, winning the championship with Multan in 2021.
Speaking to Eos on the changes expected for this year, Haider says, “This year is a crucial year for the PSL and has to be handled by the board with the sensitivity it deserves.”
Haider explains that current terms create a conundrum. If a franchise is successful in creating a strong brand with a good market value, come the time of renewal, this actually requires franchises to pay more to continue with ownership of their team.
“The overall model of the league needs to be looked at, as it penalises you for developing the brand,” he says.
Speaking on the inclusion of new teams, Haider says: “I’m not at all against new teams coming in. But even in that, you’ll have to see what models are there, because when ownership changes hands multiple times, it damages your product as well as confidence.”
UNDERSTANDING PSL’S RAISON D’ETRE
An example of the type of innovation that the board could turn to, to help expand the league further was the extra fund in this year’s edition that helped with the inclusion of marquee players like David Warner.
As discussions continue between the stakeholders, what must not be lost sight of is how PSL continues to provide a springboard for young cricketers and the opportunity for a stable income in the sport to its participants.
From Hasan Ali in the first season to newcomer Fawad Ali this year, the league continues to be an oasis for cricketers in a country where social mobility is a pipe dream for most and athletes in other sports suffer due to an absolute dearth of monetary support systems.
In light of international developments too, PSL acts like a haven for Pakistani cricketers. As more and more leagues have increased participation from Indian Premier League franchise owners, the number of Pakistani players getting picked for these leagues has shrunk.
As the PSL steps into the second decade of its existence, one thing is for certain — all the decision-makers have to ponder over what route the league will take going forward. There are plenty of external and internal challenges going forward.

The United Nations and its partners will roll out the dedicated hub for climate investments, creating a pathway for debt-distressed nations to foster sustainable development.
“An early engagement by Pakistan will allow the co­­u­ntry to be among the first to get access to this mechanism for converting debt into investment in climate resilience, education or healthcare,” UN Assistant Secretary-Gen­eral for Economic Development Navid Hanif told Dawn.
Mr Hanif, who just completed a visit to Pakistan, said the recent Fourth International Conference on Financing for Develo­pment in Seville, Spain, opened a window for the country to mobilise new public and private capital if it takes a proactive and coordinated approach.

Urges early engagement, advises country to enhance capacity and prepare projects to benefit first

UN Member States adopted the “Seville Commitment” at the conference, a global roadmap for mobilising funds for sustainable development.
The conference also launched 130 high impact initiatives through the Sevilla Platform for Action. “From joining multilateral borrower platforms to pitching investment-ready projects, from preparing for climate debt swap to organising donors around national priorities – the tools are on the table,” Mr Hanif said.
As a country dealing with both debt stress and climate vulnerability, Pakis­tan stands to benefit from a new “Seville Debtors’ Forum,” a multilateral platform for borrower countries to share expertise on debt management.
“The participation will give Pakistan a collective voi­ce in discussions on debt sustainability, financing terms, and conditionalities — matters that directly affect its fiscal outlook and development options,” he maintained.
He suggested Pakistan establish a country-led platform to convene development partners aro­und national priorities like energy transition, digital transfor­ma­tion or human capital development.
Climate change poses a major threat to Pakistan’s economic progress, as evidenced by the devastating floods of 2022. He urged a comprehensive strategy centred on resilience, adaptation and disaster risk reduction.
 
 

He recommended that Pakistan upgrade infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, reinforcing dams, levees, and drainage systems while climate-proofing roads, bridges and housing.
“Every dollar spent on resilient infrastructure can greatly reduce future economic losses,” he said, adding that rebuilding infrastructure to higher standards after disasters is essential.
To protect the country’s vital agriculture sector, Mr Hanif said investing in climate-smart practices is critical.
This includes developing flood-resistant crop varieties, improving farm drainage, and expanding crop insurance.
Stressing the need for global support under the principle of climate justice, the UN official said Pakistan must actively pursue funds from mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund, adaptation funds and the newly agreed loss-and-damage fund.

While the rate cut is seen as a step towards easing the cost of doing business, many in the sector argue that it remains uncompetitive compared to regional rates and does little to address the core challenges hindering economic growth.
Industry leaders point to the high cost of production and the rising influx of smuggled goods from countries such as Iran, China, and Bangladesh, which continue to undermine the competitiveness of Pakistani products in both domestic and international markets.
“The market is flooded with smuggled goods — everything from high-quality shoes and garments to food products. New shopping centres popping up around Karachi are full of these imports, and shop owners openly advertise their smuggled stock,” said one frustrated currency dealer. He attributed the failure of anti-smuggling efforts to the foreign exchange used to fund the illegal imports, making it difficult for authorities to crack down effectively.

Despite a sharp rate cut, industry remains sceptical about unresolved policy issues as barriers to economic growth

State Bank data reflects a concerning trend: private sector borrowing remains sluggish, with banks receiving more debt repayments than new loans. This lack of borrowing underscores the reluctance of businesses to invest in a climate where the cost of doing business remains prohibitively high.
“How can we borrow from banks when the cost of doing business here is still far higher than in neighbouring countries?” questioned Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Electricity and gas prices are exorbitant, taxes are stifling trade and industry, and policymakers are focused on extracting more revenue while the economy stagnates.”
Mr Bilwani expressed doubt that Pakistan could achieve even 3.5pc economic growth this year, predicting a further decline in exports due to high production costs and the lack of an active Export Financing Scheme. He also criticised the 19pc tariff imposed by the United States on Pakistani goods, which, he believes, will push Pakistan further out of the international market. “Our regional competitors — except India, which faces a 50pc tariff — are in a better position to compete,” he added.
The industrial sector also expressed disappointment over the government’s failure to provide gas to captive power plants, a move that could have alleviated some of the high energy costs for manufacturers.
Instead, a 2pc levy has been imposed. Pakistan continues to rely heavily on expensive imported Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) for electricity generation, while local gas resources remain untapped. The Energy Authority has reported declining electricity consumption, a sign that industry has yet to experience any significant recovery.
“The falling consumption is a clear indication that the industrial sector is not improving. The prospects for growth in FY26 look increasingly bleak,” said another industrialist. He further highlighted the growing shift towards solar energy, particularly among residential users who are turning to alternative sources to mitigate the burden of costly electricity and frequent overbilling.
Former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail recently noted that solar power production in Pakistan has reached 23,000MW, with the sector expanding rapidly as more people opt for cheaper and more reliable energy sources.
Despite the drop in interest rates, some exporters remain disillusioned. Amir Aziz, an exporter of finished textile products, noted that while the 11% rate is half of what it was last year, it has failed to stimulate business activity. “The trade and industry are bogged down by issues like the expanded powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to arrest businessmen, excessive taxation, overbilling, and political uncertainty.

They said that the Iranian government will extend all facilities and incentives for starting joint ventures with Iranian entrepreneurs and investors.
They extended the offer during a meeting with business leaders and representatives of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Small Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries and the Pak-Iran Chamber of Commerce in Quetta on Saturday.
The Iranian officials emphasised that achieving the $10 billion bilateral trade target between Pakistan and Iran depends on cooperation. They also congratulated Balochistan’s business community on the resumption of Quetta-Zahedan flight services via Mashhad.
The Iranian envoy and members of the delegation expressed satisfaction over recent agreements signed between Pakistani and Iranian officials in Islamabad, including plans to expand bilateral trade to $10bn.
They noted that while official agreements are encouraging, their implementation will not be possible without the cooperation of chambers of commerce and the business community. They stressed that Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan may have different geographies but share common economic interests and trade barriers must be removed collectively.
The delegation agreed to the proposal for forming a transport issue resolution committee and encouraged private-sector initiatives to further enhance bilateral trade.
Earlier, Quetta Chamber President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and Vice President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar highlighted the chamber’s long-standing efforts to promote and strengthen brotherly trade ties with neighbouring countries.
They stressed the need to resolve transport issues and reduce tariffs on imports from each other to boost bilateral trade. They also proposed forming a joint committee — comprising chamber representatives, NLC officials and transport ministry authorities from both countries — to address cross-border goods transport problems. According to them, resolving these issues would create dignified employment opportunities and improve living standards for people in both nations.

The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.
Today’s press release by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “In Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.
 






“COAS lauded General Kurilla’s exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.
In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.
The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.
The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.
“During an interactive session with the Pakistani diaspora, COAS urged them to remain confident in Pakistan’s bright future and to actively contribute to attracting investments.
“The diaspora reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Pakistan’s progress and development.”</p><small>2025-08-10 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101011166600308.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929867/nab-recovers-rs547bn-in-first-half-of-2025' target='_blank'><strong>NAB recovers Rs547bn in first half of 2025</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) recovered movable and immovable properties, as well as money, worth Rs547.31 billion during the first half (January to June) of the current year from corrupt elements.
NAB made recoveries amounting to Rs456.3bn during the second quarter of 2025, marking a substantial increase of Rs365.29bn compared to Rs91.01bn recovered in the first quarter.
Of the total recoveries, movable and immovable properties worth Rs532.33bn have been disbursed and handed over to different ministries and departments of federal and provincial governments, as well as to financial institutions.
In addition, 12,611 victims in various cases of public cheating have also been compensated. Over the past two years, the anti-graft body has recovered Rs5.854 trillion, which is 700 per cent more than Rs839.08bn recovered previously since the bureau’s inception. Preliminary estimates indicate that state land worth approximately Rs5tr is under illegal possession and will be reclaimed.

Two-year recovery crosses Rs5.8tr

Key recoveries and achievements in the second quarter of 2025 include: NAB Rawalpindi recovered 51 kanal of land worth Rs29bn located in Sector E-11 of Islamabad and handed over to the Capital Development Authority (CDA). In another case of cheating the public at large (B4U), NAB secured Rs3bn, which will be disbursed to 17,214 victims.
 
 

In another case (Banker’s City), 640 kanal and 11 marla land of significant value has been transferred to NAB, with proceeds to be distributed among the affected individuals. NAB Sukkur recovered a piece of land worth Rs25.079bn belonging to the National Highway Authority.
The bureau also recovered 127 kanal and 15 marla of land valued at Rs895.160m, belonging to the Education and Literacy Department of the Sindh government. From its impressive recovery portfolio, Rs384.27bn worth of forest land was recovered in the quarter ending June 2025, contributing to a total forest land recovery value of Rs1.487tr.
NAB Lahore disbursed Rs3.2bn, recovered in the Eden case, to 11,880 victims of the housing society.
In the Pak Arab case, eight properties valued at Rs3.9bn were surrendered by the accused and are in the process of being transferred to NAB. Proceeds from these assets will be disbursed to 2,500 affected individuals.
A plea bargain amounting to Rs2.181bn is underway with owners of Elite Town Housing Society, with recovered funds intended for disbursement among 1,789 victims.

The office noted that the appellant had not surrendered herself before the law, therefore, her appeals against the sentences were not maintainable.
However, the office fixed the hearing of the appeals as “objection case” before a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum for Aug 11.

Zartaj Gul, Senator Ejaz move LHC against ATC convictions

Now, the bench will decide the office objection on the appeals.
The office also fixed the hearing of Senator Ejaz’s appeal before the same division bench without putting any objection. The senator is already in jail facing trials in multiple cases of May 9 attacks.
Ms Gul filed the appeals through Advocate Mian Muhammad Hussain.
The appeals contend that
Ms Gul was not nominated in the FIRs and her name was only added in the supplementary statements. They said she was neither present at the scene nor was her presence proved by the prosecution.
The appeals further stated that key prosecution witnesses denied any meeting involving Ms Gul. The pleas asked the LHC to set aside the sentences and acquit the appellant.
A Faisalabad ATC had on July 31 awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment each under Section 109 (punishment for abetment when the act abetted is committed) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the PPC.
A Lahore ATC had awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others including Dr Yasmin Rashid, former governor Omar Sarfraz Chee­­ma and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid in a case of violence near Sherpao Bridge.
The appeal by Senator Ejaz stated that the trial court handed down the sentence beyond facts and in violation of the law. It said the appellant was not even present at the alleged occurrence.
Bail dismissed
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill dismissed the pre-arrest bail of Mr Ayub as he failed to appear before the court.
His lawyer filed an application seeking a one-time exemption from personal appearance, pointing out that a Faisalabad ATC sentenced the petitioner in a May 9 case. He argued that without getting protective bail, the petitioner could not appear in Lahore and approached the Peshawar High Court for the relief.
However, Judge Gill dismissed the exemption request, noting that since Mr Ayub had already been convicted, he must surrender before the court.
The judge observed that a convicted person is not entitled to protective or transit bail and cannot file an appeal before surrendering.
Omar Ayub filed bail petitions in the Jinnah House attack, Askari Tower attack, and Shadman police station arson cases.

The deaths were reported in Sialkot and Jhelum, with the former receiving 78 millimetres of rain — the highest in the province.
According to the Pakistan Meteorologi-cal Department (PMD), Sialkot  City received 78mm of rain, Lahore 43.4mm, Gujranwala 36.8mm, Chakwal  23mm, Attock 13.6mm, Mangla 12.2mm, Gujrat 10.6mm, Narowal 5.0mm,  Rawalakot 4.0mm, Islamabad Airport 3.9mm, and Mandi Bahauddin 0.5mm.
The Met Department said mainly hot and humid weather was expected in most parts of Punjab, but rain-wind/thundershower was expected at isolated places in northeastern Punjab, Potohar, Islamabad, upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and adjoining hilly areas on Sunday.
According to provincial figures issued on Aug 8, 164 people have died and 82 have sustained injuries during the ongoing monsoon season that has also killed 121 head of cattle. About 216 houses were also destroyed across the province.

Sialkot receives 78mm rainfall, the highest in the province

In Lahore, the rain started at 1:30pm and continued till 4:30pm. According to the Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa), 86mm rain was reported at Pani Wala Talab, 85mm at Farrukhabad, 83mm at Lakshmi Chowk, 81mm at Nishtar Town, 60mm at Gulberg, 57mm at Chowk Nakhuda, 45mm at Iqbal Town, 44mm at Johar Town, 43mm at Samanabad and less than 30mm at Gulshan-i-Ravi, Qurtaba Chowk, Jail Road, and Tajpura.
Due to rain, water accumulated in Model Town, Kot Lakhpat, Peco Road, Township, Green Town, Factory Area, Muslim Town, Garden Town and adjacent localities. The water was also accumulated in Nishtar Park Sports Complex, which caused the cancellation of ‘Independence Family Fun Race’, which was planned in the evening. The rain also caused electricity problems in the city as more than 120 feeders in different areas had tripped.
Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a warning about low-level flooding in rivers in the province. According to the latest update, Tarbela Dam is currently 96 per cent full with its water level standing at 1546.00 feet, while Mangla Dam is 63pc full at 1205.25 feet.
On the Indus River, low-level flooding has been reported at Chashma Barrage, while flows at other key barrages — including Tarbela, Kalabagh, Taunsa, Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri remain normal. Similarly, the Jhelum, Sutlej, and Kabul Rivers are flowing at expected levels without any immediate threat.
The Chenab River and its adjoining streams are also stable, with no unusual rise in water levels. However, the Ravi River is experiencing low-level flooding in the Basantar Nullah, though the main river’s flow remains normal.
Meanwhile, the hill torrents in Koh-i-Suleman and Dera Ghazi Khan Division are currently dry, posing no flood risk. With the monsoon season in full swing, the director general of the Punjab PDMA advised citizens to exercise extreme caution, especially near water bodies.
Section 144 has been imposed along rivers, canals, and streams to prevent accidents, and people have been strictly warned against swimming or bathing in these areas. Authorities have assured the public that all necessary measures are in place to handle any emergency, but residents in low-lying areas should stay alert for further updates.

Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangiri told reporters that charges against some of the 20 suspects were dropped and they had been released, though he did not provide a specific number.
“The judiciary will show no leniency toward spies and agents of the Zionist regime, and with firm rulings, will make an example of them all,” Mr Jahangiri was quoted as saying by Iranian media.
He said full details wo­­u­ld be made public once the investigations were complete.
The announcement comes just days after Iran executed a nuclear scientist convicted of spying for Israel.
On Wednesday, state media reported that Rouzbeh Vadi was executed for passing on information about another nuclear scientist who was killed during Israeli air strikes on Iran in June.
 
 

Executions of Iranians convicted of spying for Israel have significantly increased this year, with at least eight death sentences carried out in recent months.
The arrests follow a recent, intense conflict between the two nations.
In June, Israel carried out 12 days of air strikes on Iran.
Tehran responded with barrages of missiles and drones on Israel.

• British police arrest 365 people for backing pro-Palestine group
GAZA STRIP: Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 37 people were killed by Israeli fire on Saturday, including 30 civilians who were waiting to collect aid.
Civil defence spokesman Mah­mud Bassal told AFP that 12 people were killed and nearly 200 wounded when Israeli forces opened fire on them as they gathered near a border crossing in northern Gaza that has been used for aid deliveries.
Six more people were killed and 30 wounded after Israeli troops targeted civilians assembling near an aid point in central Gaza, he said.
Strikes in central Gaza also resulted in multiple casualties, according to Bassal, while a drone attack near the southern city of Khan Yunis killed at least three people and wounded several others.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence and the Israeli military.
Thousands of Palestinians congregate daily near food distribution points in Gaza, including four managed by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
Since launching in late May, its operations have been marred by almost-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on those waiting to collect aid.
 
 

Israeli restrictions on the entry of supplies into Gaza since the start of the war nearly two years ago have led to shortages of food and essential supplies, including medicine and fuel, which hospitals require to power their generators.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces mounting pressure to secure a ceasefire to bring the territory’s more than two million people back from the brink of famine and free the prisoners held by Hamas.
But early Friday, the Israeli security cabinet approved plans to launch major operations to seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of outrage across the globe.
Despite the backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Netanyahu has remained defiant over the decision.
Hamas has slammed the plan to expand the fighting as a “new war crime”.
UK police arrest protesters
Meanwhile, police in London arrested at least 365 people Saturday for supporting Palestine Action, at the latest and largest protest backing the group since the government banned it last month under anti-terror laws.
The Metropolitan Police said it made the hundreds of arrests, thought to be one of the highest ever at a single protest in the UK capital, for “supporting a proscribed organisation”.
 
 

It also arrested seven for other offences including assaults on officers, though none were seriously injured, it added.
A group called Defend Our Juries, which organised Saturday’s protests and previous demonstrations agai­nst the ban, said “unprecedented numbers” had risked “arrest and possible imprisonment” to “defend this country’s ancient liberties”.
“We will keep going. Our numbers are already growing for the next wave of action in September,” it added.
Attendees began massing near parliament at lunchtime bearing signs saying “oppose genocide, support Palestine Action” and other slogans, and waving Palestinian flags.
As police moved in on the demonstrators, they applauded those being arrested and shouted “shame on you” at officers.
“Let them arrest us all,” said Richard Bull, 42, a wheelchair-user in attendance.
The London force noted some of those there were onlookers or not visibly supporting the group.
NGOs opposed
The Met police also detailed how the hundreds arrested were taken to temporary “prisoner processing” points, where their details were confirmed and they were either instantly bailed or taken into custody elsewhere.
Amnesty International UK Chief Executive Sacha Deshmukh wrote to Met Police chief Mark Rowley this week urging restraint be exercised when policing people holding placards expressing support for Palestine Action.
A UK court challenge against the decision to proscribe Palestine Action will be heard later this year.

Initially, the anti-terror operation had been postponed after both sides agreed to a ceasefire until the conflict was completely resolved  thro­ugh talks.
The failure of the peace talks has also plunged the local population into fear and a state of uncertainty. Accor­ding to reports, a number of families from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil left their homes for peaceful areas in the district on Saturday. The reports added that more families from the said areas were expected to leave their homes today.
“The collapse of negotiations between members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga and militant leaders, aimed at convincing them to leave the region peacefully, has left no option but to resume Operation Sarbakaf to neutralise militants in the region, who pose a significant threat to peace and people’s lives,” the sources added.

Jirga leader says dialogue with militants for their return hit snag due to ‘some issues’

On Friday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, head of the 50-strong Bajaur jirga, told reporters that the talks with militants “concluded without desired results owing to the development of a serious deadlock over some key issues necessary to resolve the conflict peacefully”. He was talking to reporters after separate meetings with militants’ leaders and high-ups held on Friday evening.
 
 

“We (members of the Bajaur Amn Jirga) have tried our best with great sincerity and commitment to make the talks with militant leaders a success by convincing them to return peacefully to Afghanistan…but unfort­­unately, we couldn’t succeed in our mission due to the development of a serious deadlock on some main issues,” Mr Rashid said while sharing the details of the seventh round of talks. He did not elaborate on the issues that stalled the dialogue.
According to the jirga leader, there would be no further negotiations with militant leaders on the issue until the deadlock was resolved. Accompanied by all jirga members, including PTI’s local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman and former local MNA Gul Zafar Khan, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid appealed to both sides, the security forces and militants, to show tolerance and refrain from fighting, as it was causing suffering among the local people.
However, he told reporters that both sides had assured the jirga that civilians and their properties would be spared in the event of any fighting in the region. He said the jirga would remain functional and work with local residents to devise an action plan in case the residents and their properties were affected in any potential conflict between the security forces and terrorists. Mr Rashid said the jirga members would resume their activities in the larger interest of Bajaur and its people after a meeting with the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa chief minister in Peshawar on Saturday. There had been no statement about the meeting by the time this report went to press.

A three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, will take up the matter on Tuesday.
The apex court had previously adjourned the proceedings due to unavailability of Salman Safdar, senior counsel for the ex-premier.
In his appeals, the incarcerated PTI leader claimed that the LHC on June 24 denied post-arrest bail to him in eight cases related to May 9 violence, including attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty Chowk, PML-N offices in Model Town, Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near the Lahore corps commander’s residence and violence at Sherpao Bridge. The appellant said he moved the LHC after an anti-terrorism court had denied bail to him in the eight cases on Nov 27, 2024.

CJP-led bench put off previous proceedings due to unavailability of ex-PM’s lawyer

He said he was accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9, whereas, at the time of the alleged offence, he was in the custody of National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Therefore, his involvement in the May 9 violence was “impossible”, the appeal arg­ued, while reminding that the Supreme Court had already held that the case of an abettor who was not present at the scene of occurrence stands on a lower legal footing than that of a principal accused.
According to the set of appeals, the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his ouster as prime minister in 2022. The SC was informed that the cases were yet another attempt by the state and the police to “implicate” him in a criminal matter, based solely on “vague and unsupported allegations of abetment” as the prosecution had no “convincing” evidence connecting Mr Khan to the alleged offence.
After Mr Khan’s “unlawful and invalid” arrest from the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, 2023, multiple FIRs were registered in Lahore and Islamabad, it contended, adding none of the complaints contained any specific allegations or details regarding the purported conspiracy.
At a later stage in these cases, the prosecution introduced supplementary statements by police officials in an apparent attempt to “falsely implicate” Mr Khan, it added. If, as per the prosecution’s claim, the police allegedly knew about the conspiracy to orchestrate violence as early as May 7, why did they not take any action to prevent the attacks, the appeal questioned. This was “highly illogical” and further exposed the “malafide and politically motivated nature of the proceedings”, it claimed.
The appeal alleged Mr Khan had been “maliciously implicated” in these cases as part of a “calculated and politically motivated design to prolong his incarceration”, harass him and tarnish his public image.
Mr Khan’s arrest was “never genuinely required” in cases pertaining to May 9 violence, it pleaded, adding that police took no action to arrest Mr Khan for over five months even after his bail applications were dismissed by an anti-terrorism court in Lahore. Despite knowing Mr Khan’s whereabouts — Adiala jail where he was confined — the police “made no meaningful attempt to effect his arrest”, it argued.
“This lack of urgency or interest on part of the investigating agency strongly supports the inference that the arrest was not necessitated by the merits of the case, but rather was a tool of oppression, thereby further justifying the grant of post-arrest bail,” the appeal said.
According to the appeal, the LHC decision to deny bail to Mr Khan was based on “engineered and fabricated evidence” comprising stale, discredited, and delayed statements of police officials recorded long after the occurrence, without any plausible explanation for the inordinate delay.
It argued that the LHC while rejecting the bail plea also failed to appreciate that the prosecution has been consistently shifting its stance like a pendulum, by introducing materially improved versions of the case narrative.
 
 

Each new version was introduced only after the preceding one failed to withstand before the courts of law, thereby rendering the prosecution’s case doubtful and entitling the petitioner to the benefit of further inquiry, the appeal pleaded. These material contradictions and afterthoughts clearly made out a case falling within the ambit of Section 497(2) of the criminal procedure code, warranting the grant of bail, the SC was requested.

ISLAMABAD: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has invited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the Future Inve­stment Initiative Conf­erence to be hosted by Riyadh in October.
According to PM Office, Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky on Saturday called on Prime Minister Shehbaz and handed over a signed invitation letter from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud to participate in the 9th Future Investment Initi­a­tives Forum to be held from Oct 27 to 30.
While accepting the gracious invitation exten­ded to him, the prime minister conveyed his warm greetings and respectful regards for the custodian of the two holy mosques on King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, as well as to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Recent regional developments were also discussed during the warm and cordial meeting.
Earlier, the PM said Pakistan welcomed the historic peace agreement signed between Azer­bai­jan and Armenia at the White House un­der the auspices of US President Trump.
“This landmark development marks the dawn of a new era of peace, stability, and cooperation in the South Caucasus, a region that has endured decades of conflict and human sufferings. We congratulate President Ilham Aliyev and the people of Azerbaijan on this historic agreement that reflects wisdom, foresight and sagacity in charting a course for a peaceful future for their region,” the PM posted on X account.
 






He said Pakistan had always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan, and stood with them at this proud moment of their history.
“We also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration. It is our hope that this spirit of dialogue will serve as an example for other regions facing protracted conflicts,” he said.
Separately, the prime minister in a meeting with the National Party head said progress and prosperity of Balochistan and its people was among the top priorities of the federal government.
During an interaction with NP President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, who called on him, the PM said the government was committed to the provision of opportunities for education and livelihoods to the youth. Dr Baloch thanked the premier for the efforts towards progress and prosperity of the province.  Adviser to the PM Dr Touqeer Shah was also present on the occasion.

• Three soldiers, woman martyred in spate of attacks in Lakki Marwat
QUETTA / LAKKI MARWAT: Security forces have thwarted yet another terrorist infiltration attempt in the Sambaza area of Balochistan’s Zhob district, eliminating 14 terrorists, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the latest action brings the total number of terrorists killed in the last two days to 47, following successful operations by security forces in Sambaza. This adds to the earlier neutralisation of 33 militants.
“Following the successful engagements by the security forces in the general area Sam­baza, Zhob district, on Aug 7-8 night, during which 33 Khwarij were sent to hell; on the night of Aug 8-9, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in the surrounding areas of Sambaza along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the ISPR said.
“During the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian sponsored Khwarij were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Wea­p­ons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed Khwarij,” the ISPR said in a statement.
“The number of Khwarij killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,” it said, adding that the security forces “remain committed to securing the nation’s frontiers and thwarting attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday praised the security forces for eliminating 47 militants during the last two days.
 
 

The president observed that it was the biggest success of the security forces, the President’s Secretariat said in a statement, according to APP.
He reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism, stressing that the nation stands united behind the security forces in their fight against militancy.
PM Shehbaz also praised the forces’ timely actions, which successfully foiled the militants’ infiltration attempt. “The entire nation is standing with the security forces in the fight against terrorism,” he said, reaffirming his commitment to the eradication of terrorism in all its forms from Pakistan, the PM Office said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces, commending their professionalism and swift actions.
“The nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,” he said in a post on X.
 






In May, the government officially designated all terrorist organisations operating in Balo­chistan as “Fitna al-Hindustan”, aiming to highlight India’s alleged role in fomenting instability and violence in the region.
Lakki Marwat attacks
In a series of militant attacks across Lakki Marwat district, three soldiers and a woman were martyred, while three others, including two soldiers, sustained injuries, police and rescue officials said on Saturday.
The first incident took place on Friday evening in the Tatta Bash­ikhel area, where Merajuddin, a clerk in the Frontier Corps (FC) Balochistan, who had been on leave for the past week, was attacked.
“The FC official and his cousin Fareedullah were sitting outside their home when two armed suspects wearing masks suddenly app­eared from the eastern side,” a police official said, quoting an FIR.
The attackers opened fire as Meraj and Fareed attempted to flee towards the house. Meraj’s wife, Nusrat Bibi, rushed out upon hearing the gunshots and attempted to shield her husband, but was also gunned down by the assailants.
Both Meraj and Nusrat were gravely wounded, and the FC personnel succumbed to his injuries on the spot, while his wife died en route to a hospital in Bannu.
Following the attack, a large police contingent was dispatched to the rural area to search for the assailants.
In another attack on Saturday, a soldier of the Frontier Corps, Sepoy Jehangir Khan, was martyred in the Mir Hazar Khanzadkhel area.
According to officials, Jehangir and his cousin Asmatullah were grazing cattle when two armed motorcyclists wearing masks opened fire on them. Jehangir was killed on the spot and his cousin was injured. The body and the injured were later transferred to the District Headquarters Hospital at Tajazai.
In yet another attack, a former soldier of the Pakistan Army, Habibullah Khan, 55, was shot dead by a group of seven militants near a rainwater course in the Ghazikhel area. The attackers, who fled towards the Karmukhel Mountain, also took away an AK-47 assault rifle from the martyred soldier.
In a separate incident, two soldiers were injured when their vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device (IED) near Abdulkhel on Saturday.
 
 

Officials said that the roadside bomb, planted by “terrorists from the Fitna al-Khawarij group”, exploded as the soldiers were on patrol. The injured soldiers, Mohammad Salim and Mohammad Malook, were immediately shifted to the Government City Hospital. Rescue 1122 dispatched medical teams and ambulances to the scene.
Authorities later cordoned off the area and launched a combing operation in an effort to capture the attackers.
Bannu’s Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the Tatta Bashikhel area to offer his condolences to the family of the martyred FC official Merajuddin. He expressed his sorrow for the loss and assured the family that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.
“The martyred security personnel are the pride of the nation and the supreme sacrifices offered by them will not go in vain,” he said.
Mr Sajjad also expressed his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the family of martyred policeman Rukh Niaz Khan in the Kalan Tughalkhel area of Bannu.
Constable Khan had embraced martyrdom in a fierce gun battle with terrorists in the Fatehkhel area of Bannu last week.

The comments are the first such statement by the Indian side three months after its worst military conflict in decades with its neighbour. During the conflict, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7, later stating that figure as six. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
Speaking at an event in the southern city of Bengaluru, Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh claimed: “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed, and one large aircraft,” adding that the large aircraft, which could be a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300 kilometres.
He alleged that most of the Pakistani aircraft were downed by India’s Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. He cited electronic tracking data as confirmation of the strikes.
 






Singh did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed, but claimed that airstrikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two air bases in Sindh and Punjab. “This is actually the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill,” he insisted.
Responding to the claims in a post on X, the defence minister said: “The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed.
“It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians. For three months, no such claims were voiced — while Pakistan, in the immediate aftermath, presented detailed technical briefings to the international media, and independent observers recorded widespread acknowledgment of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians to foreign intelligence assessments.”
Asif said that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
 






He added that the losses on the Line of Control for Indian armed forces were “disproportionately heavier” as well.
“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure. Wars are not won by falsehoods but by moral authority, national resolve and professional competence.
“Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment,” he warned.
The defence minister iterated that every violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would invite “swift, surefire and proportionate response, and responsibility for any ensuing escalation will rest entirely with strategically blind leaders who gamble with South Asia’s peace for fleeting political gains”.
Former envoy Dr Maleeha Lodhi said the Indian air chief’s claim was “laughable”, noting that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”
 






Meanwhile, Indian Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said when questioned about the matter: “The question we have after today’s information … when we had such a strong army and we were advancing then under whose pressure did you stop Operation Sindoor?”
 






American South Asia expert Michael Kugelman opined that “regardless of whether true or not, the timing of these claims, with US-India ties in crisis, is easy to understand.”
 






Pakistan, with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) primarily operating Chinese-made jets and US F-16s, has previously denied that India downed any aircraft during the May 7-10 fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “a few planes”. United States President Donald Trump has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.
 
 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has faced scathing criticism from opposition parties for its lack of “political will to fight” during the May clashes and “failures” to prevent the Pahalgam attack.
The May conflict was sparked by New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, which were without evidence and strongly refuted by Pakistan, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. After the May 7 combat and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.
Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:21</small></div><hr>
