• Aid seekers among 19 more killed over 24 hours
JERUSALEM: More than 600 retired Israeli security officials have urged US President Donald Trump to pressure their own government to end the war in Gaza.
“It is our professional judgement that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,” the former officials wrote in an open letter shared with the media on Monday, calling on Trump to “steer” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decisions.
“At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,” said Ami Ayalon, former director of the Shin Bet security service.
The war, nearing its 23rd month, “is leading the State of Israel to lose its security and identity,” Ayalon warned in a video released to accompany the letter.
The letter was signed by three former Mossad heads: Tamir Pardo, Efraim Halevy and Danny Yatom.
Other signatories include five former heads of Shin Bet — Ayalon as well as Nadav Argaman, Yoram Cohen, Yaakov Peri and Carmi Gilon — and three former military chiefs of staff, including former prime minister Ehud Barak, former defence minister Moshe Yaalon and Dan Halutz.
The letter argued that the Israeli military “has long accomplished the two objectives that could be achieved by force: dismantling Hamas’s military formations and governance.”
It added that the third, and most important, could only be achieved through a deal: bringing all the Israeli prisoners home.
In the letter, the former officials tell Trump that he has credibility with the majority of Israelis and can put pressure on Netanyahu to end the war and return the prisoners.
In recent weeks Israel has come under increasing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire that could free Israeli prisoners and allow UN agencies to distribute humanitarian aid.
But some in Israel, including ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition government, are instead pushing for Israeli forces to push on and for Gaza to be occupied in whole or in part.
Israel’s war goals
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu promised on Monday to update Israel’s Gaza war plan, a day before a UN Security Council meeting on the fate of prisoners still held in the Palestinian territory.
Addressing a cabinet meeting nearly 22 months into the war, the Israeli leader told ministers that later in the week he would instruct the military on how “to achieve the three war objectives we have set”.
Israel — backed by the United States and Panama — is preparing to convene a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday to highlight the fate of the prisoners.
At the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel’s three war goals remain “the defeat of the enemy”, the release of prisoners and the “promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel”.
The UN session was called after Palestinian groups published last week three videos showing prisoners Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David appearing weak and emaciated.
Netanyahu said he had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide food and medical treatment to the Israeli prisoners.
Hamas has said it was willing to allow access to the prisoners in exchange for opening aid corridors into all of Gaza.
‘We are starving’
Israel’s assault in Gaza has killed at least 60,933 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry, which are deemed reliable by the UN.
 
 

Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire on Monday killed at least 19 Palestinians, including nine who were waiting to collect food aid from a site in central Gaza.
In Gaza City, Umm Osama Imad was mourning a relative she said was killed while trying to reach an aid distribution point.
“We are starving… He went to bring flour for his family,” she said. “The flour is stained with blood. We don’t want the flour anymore. Enough!”
Further south, in Deir el-Balah, Abdullah Abu Musa told AFP his daughter and her family were killed in an Israeli strike.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) says in its report, ‘Afghanistan Returnees Overview’ that around 1.4 million Afghan PoR cardholders currently remain in Pakistan.
 
 

As of July 26, an estimated 1,668,000 Afghans have returned to Afghanistan in 2025, including 1,280,000 from Iran and 389,000 from Pakistan. Between July 1 and 26 alone, approximately 539,000 individuals returned from Iran, accounting for almost one-third of the overall number of people that have returned from Iran so far this year.
During the reporting period (July 20-26), daily arrivals from Iran averaged around 11,000. In contrast, returnees from Pakistan during the same period averaged 1,100 per day.

PoR cardholders cannot stay any longer as document expired on June 30

From January–February 2025, the government issued a directive, requiring Afghan nationals in Pakistan to relocate from Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and Rawalpindi, or else face deportation. Further announcements followed on the implementation of the second phase of the “IFRP”, targeting ACC holders in addition to undocumented Afghans to return to Afghanistan.
These decisions have resulted in an uptick in arrests, detentions and deportations of Afghan nationals, particularly in April 2025. At present, the PoR card validity is yet to be extended, following its expiry on 30 June 2025.

• Dr Anita Zaidi says vaccine will initially be given to 9 to 11-year-olds, later offered to older girls
• Govt and private sector must work together, as even the richest cannot go it alone, says Bill Gates
KARACHI: Cervical cancer vaccines will be rolled out in Pakistan from September, a top official from the Gates Foundation told Dawn on Monday.
Pakistan has a population of 73.8 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer, as per a factsheet by the HPV Information Centre.
Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age. But with a single dose of HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine, females would be immune for life.
According to Dr Anita Zaidi, president of the foundation’s Gender Equality Division, the vaccine will be given to nine to 11-year-old girls, as part of initial outreach campaigns, and can eventually be offered to older girls.
Since screening for cervical cancer is limited in Pakistan, prevention is the best tool in this case, she said.
 
 

This initiative is separate from the Gates Foundation’s $2.5 billion global commitment through 2030 to transform women’s health across every stage of life.
Announced on Monday, the pledge will support 40 innovations in five critical, chronically underfunded areas — particularly those affecting women in low- and middle-income countries.
 
 

“Investing in women’s health has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, said at the launch event.
“Yet women’s health continues to be ignored, underfunded, and sidelined. Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health. That must change. But we can’t do it alone,” he said.
Research shows that for every $1 invested in women’s health, it generates $3 in economic growth. Closing the gender health gap could boost the global economy by $1 trillion per year by 2040.
Despite clear economic returns and the biological fact that women are necessary for the survival of our species, research and development spending on female health is severely limited.
According to a 2001 analysis by McKinsey & Co, only one per cent of research and innovation is carried out into female-specific conditions, beyond cancer.
‘Can’t do it alone’
Examples for innovations that could particularly impact women in low-income countries are six-month injectable contraceptives that can be taken discreetly, particularly important in countries like Pakistan, where even slogans for body autonomy are reviled.
The Gates Foundation has worked in Pakistan for years, collaborating with institutions like Aga Khan University and the Lahore University of Management Sciences to support locally grounded innovations — from gut health to AI applications in women’s care.
But as the tech billionaire points out, even the richest in the world can’t do it alone. The government and private sector have to work together to co-invest in women’s health innovations – a tall order in a country where mothers can justify so-called ‘honour killings’ of their daughters.
When life is being denied, it is easy to think of nutrition as a rather trivial matter.
“When I was practising in Pakistan, I would see malnourished children with various health issues,” recalled Dr Zaidi, who has previously worked at Aga Khan University.
“I would advise mothers to breastfeed properly, but their own health was so compromised, they had little to give.”
Without addressing the mother’s health, we cannot address children’s health, she said. The neglect doled out to women has led Pakistan’s newborn mortality rate to be among the highest in the world, with one out of 25 babies dying in the first month of life.
Though many aspects of women’s health need to be addressed, Dr Zaidi says that if there is only one area that could be focused on, it would be health during pregnancy.
The gut health of pregnant women is vitally important because it is deeply connected to malnutrition.
A lack of food, appropriate calories, and vitamins, combined with a living environment that exposes individuals to numerous infections, leads to an inflamed gut and poor health. When women in poor health get pregnant, they deliver unhealthy babies, and the cycle continues, creating a transgenerational issue.
Pakistan will not prosper without recognising that women’s development has to be central to the country’s development, Dr Zaidi says. Ultimately, however, through civil society, policy making and implementation, it is up to Pakistanis to change the reality that women face.

“We spoke with commanders about the frontline situation, the defence of Vovchansk, and the dynamics of the battles,” Zelensky wrote on X after visiting a frontline area in the northeastern Kharkiv region.
“Our warriors in this sector are reporting the participation of mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries in the war. We will respond.”
 






While there was no official reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, the government has previously rebuffed allegations that the country was providing arms to Ukraine.
Media reports from 2023, including a BBC investigation, had claimed that Pakistan entered into a $364 million arms sales agreement with two private US companies, which were allegedly sent to Ukraine.
However, these were rebutted — on separate occasions — by the Foreign Office, former caretaker PM Anwaarul Haq Kakar and the Russian ambassador to Pakistan, Albert P. Khorev.
President Zelensky has previously accused Moscow of recruiting Chinese fighters for its war effort against Ukraine, charges Beijing has denied. North Korea has also been accused of deploying thousands of its own troops in Russia’s Kursk region.

• Ministry fast-tracks approval amid suspension of land travel to Iran, affecting pilgrims
• Ferry service to link Iran and GCC countries with Karachi and Gwadar ports
ISLAMABAD: While a large number of pilgrims en route to Iraq have been stranded due to a sudden ban on land travel to Iran, the government has approved the first ferry service licence.
Applications by ferry operators have been pending since 2017 -18. Taking a fast-track route, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Monday approved the first ferry service licence to an international ferry operator.
The UK-based company — ‘Sea Keeper’— will operate ferry routes connecting Pakistan with Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
The government is under serious pressure from around one million pilgrims who attend Arbaeen (Chehlum of Imam Hussain) in Karbala, as land travel to Iran has been stopped without any notice recently.
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has led the move by fast-track approval to ferry service operators who had filed applications in 2017 and 2018.
 
 

The minister emphasised that ferry service will not only provide the pilgrims going to Iraq and Iran a safe and secure travel but it also provides an opportunity for boosting regional connectivity as well as economic activity via sea routes.
“Initial operations will commence from the ports of Karachi and Gwadar using modern ferry vessels equipped with essential amenities to ensure safe, affordable travel. Expansion of routes and port calls is planned based on demand and bilateral agreements”, the minister said in a statement.
This ferry service launch forms part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to develop its blue economy, improve trade logistics, and promote maritime tourism, reflecting a renewed commitment to sustainable regional sea transport infrastructure, the minister stated.
Sources in the Ministry of Maritime Affairs confirmed that more ferry services licences are expected to be issued in near future as the licence committee was scrutinising the cases.
The Licensing Committee comprises officials from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, and representatives from the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) and port and shipping authorities.
The PNSC will be the regulator of ferry companies ensuring the technical aspect of ships and their services.
Meanwhile, a senior official of Karachi Port Trust told Dawn that the ferry terminal has already been established at the Karachi port.
Once the relevant formalities are notified, the terminal will be handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for immigration and passport duties.
Other relevant departments, including Customs and security agencies, will also deploy staff at the ferry terminals in both Karachi and Gwadar.

• Power division says electricity duty cannot be abolished without provincial consent
• Industrial consumers complain of 14pc tariff hike, rising system losses, eroding competitiveness
ISLAMABAD: Confirming widespread overbilling and subsequent punitive action against relevant electricity officials in Lahore following a probe ordered by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Power Division on Monday said the federal government cannot abolish electricity duty — as announced by the power minister — without the consent of the provincial governments.
Testifying at a public hearing held by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Additional Secretary for Power Mehfooz Bhatti reported that an inquiry ordered by the prime minister into overbilling complaints against Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had been completed and action had also been taken against those responsible.
Mr Bhatti said the inquiry report had been submitted to the prime minister and, hence, he would refrain from discussing the matter until its recommendations were processed through relevant channels and formally presented before the regulator.
This statement led various consumers to raise concerns about similar overbilling practices in other power companies and demanded through probes.
The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers for three billing months — August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.
Nepra member from Sindh, Rafique A. Shaikh, reminded Mr Bhatti that overbilling investigations by a team of the regulator some two years had found massive discrepancies but was confronted by the power division at the time. However, a subsequent inquiry ordered by power division itself found even greater instances of overbilling. Responding to a question, Mr Shaikh noted that Nepra had arranged refund of the overbilled amounts to the consumers.
He also reported that Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari had earlier last month announced that he had written to the provincial governments about the centre’s intentions to remove electricity duty from July 1, 2025 and requested provinces to make alternative arrangements.
He added two provinces have responded so far to the proposal while two others were yet to get back with their feedback but “we cannot discontinue electricity duty” unless all provinces agree.
The regulator was informed that about 128,000 applications for new connections were pending beyond permissible deadlines with various distribution companies, potentially delaying the absorption of around 1,070MW of generation capacity.
Additionally, about 4,000 net-metering applications are also pending beyond regulatory timelines with Faisalabad Electric alone accounting for 2,000 of these. Likewise, more than 70,000 faulty meters had not been rectified, which meant these consumers were being billed based on estimated consumption.
The Power Division further reported that 700–800MW of captive power plants have returned to the national grid due to an increase in gas tariffs following a special levy under the IMF programme. As a result, circular debt has dropped from Rs2.39tr to Rs1.6tr within a year, owing to improved economic indicators, exchange rate stability, reduced interest rates, and efficiency gains by Discos. Overall electricity consumption increased by 1.6 per cent last year, while industrial demand rose by 6.3pc.
Industrial consumers from Karachi and Lahore pointed out that average power rate had increased by 14pc with effect from July 1, a figure also confirmed by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
 
 

They stated that a 19pc tariff imposed by the Trump administration on Pakistani products had already burdened the sector, and rising electricity costs further undermined competitiveness against countries like India. They demanded the removal of cross-subsidy costs on industrial consumers — claimed at Rs137bn by industry representatives and Rs73bn by the Power Division.
Despite claims of increased efficiency, industrial users highlighted that system losses have risen to 18.3pc in FY2025, compared to 17.55pc in FY2024 and 16.5pc in FY2023.
The Power Division clarified that the proposed lower quarterly adjustment is due to Rs18bn in savings from reduced capacity payments to the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (which is currently non-operational), Rs17bn in contract revisions with power plants, and other factors such as declining interest rates and currency stabilisation.
The petition estimated total savings of Rs53.7bn on capacity charges across 10 public-sector Discos. However, increases in operations and maintenance expenses, as well as service and market operation fees, reduced the net savings to Rs53.39bn.
Capacity charges of all Discos had come down during April-June period of current year except for Quetta Electric whose capacity charges went up by Rs3.057bn. Although K-Electric has no contribution in lower quarterly tariff adjustments, its consumers would also benefit the overall quarterly tariff reductions under the government policy of uniform tariff throughout the country.
The highest savings were reported for Faisalabad Electric at Rs15.026bn, followed by Lahore Electric at Rs12.636bn, and Multan Electric at Rs8.48bn. Other notable reductions include Hyderabad Electric at Rs6.63bn, Gujranwala Electric at Rs6.11bn, and Peshawar Electric at Rs3.3bn.
Additional savings include Rs2.88bn for Tribal Electric, Rs1.04bn for Islamabad Electric, and Rs653m for Sukkur Electric.
Under the tariff framework, fuel cost variations are passed on to consumers monthly through an automatic mechanism.
Meanwhile, quarterly tariff adjustments — accounting for changes in power purchase prices, capacity charges, operation and maintenance costs, and transmission/distribution losses — are incorporated into the base tariff by the federal government.

• Announces Rs4bn for reconstruction, distributes cheques among flood victims; says those living along waterways needed to be relocated
• Ghizer residents cut off, at risk of food shortage as link road submerged
• Met Dept warns of flash floods, landslides in GB and KP ahead of new rain spell
GILGIT: As flash floods in the mountainous northern parts of the country leave a trail of destruction in their wake, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Mon­day directed the National Disaster Mana­g­ement Authority (NDMA) and the climate change ministry to set up an “early warning and monitoring centre in Gilgit-Baltistan within the next few months”.
These directives came as the premier visited GB along with cabinet members to take stock of the damage caused by floods over the past few weeks, which claimed several lives and destroyed homes and farmland across the region.
About the early warning system, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted the PM as saying that for the past seven years, the subject “remained confined to papers only” and over the past year and a half, “no progress had been made”.
 
 

He asked stakeholders to complete the project within two months, ruling out the possibility of any extension.
In a meeting held to assess the damage, the premier asked the climate change ministry to adopt a “proactive approach” as he underscored the importance of generating funds to develop climate-resilient infrastructure.
He said an early warning system should be installed for tourist destinations, adding that residents should be moved away from natural watercourses.
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Mr Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan. The PM, however, did not specify the quantum of these funds.
He said the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, wher­eas the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work.
PM Shehbaz said a survey of the damage to highways and other infrastructure should be conducted and communication links of all areas should be restored on a priority basis. The premier also directed the water resources minister for an improved water system in the region. He also announced Rs4 billion for the restoration of infrastructure in GB.
Later, addressing a cheque-distribution ceremony for the flood victims, PM Shehbaz recalled, “A huge cloudburst occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.” He said being one of the most vulnerable countries, Pakistan needed to be prepared against climate disasters.
Furthermore, the premier announced a Daanish school and a 100MW solar power project for the region. He said the solar project’s approval would be sought from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.
During his one-day trip, the premier also held separate meetings with the GB chief minister and the governor to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.
Separately, Climate Minister Musadik Malik told journalists that the early warning systems had either been stolen or deliberately damaged. He said the unplanned construction in the region added to the recent disasters, saying people had built hotels and other infrastructure in the pathway of streams.
Ghizer residents stranded
Meanwhile, the residents of Ghizer remained marooned for a fifth straight day after a flood cut off the Gilgit-Shandur road access, even as the mountainous region braces for more disasters in light of a warning issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department.
According to the local administration, a flooded stream in Khotom village blocked the Ghizer River, due to which the river overflowed and submerged a 500-metre stretch of the road, cutting off access for thousands of residents in Phander, Khalti, Teero, and other areas up to Shandur Top.
Five stranded residents from Khotom village were, however, rescued via boat, while a search for missing tourists in the Babusar area had also been concluded.
 
 

Rescue 1122 officials reported that five members of a family from Khotom village were rescued and moved to safety via boat on Monday, while food supplies were delivered to other stranded families. The rescue team stated that restoring the submerged road was extremely difficult due to the rocky terrain at the blocked section.
The Gilgit-Shandur road also serves as a link between Gilgit-Baltistan and the Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Local resident Yaqoob Tai told Dawn that the road blockage occurred in a mountainous area, making the repair work particularly complicated.
Residents are unable to reach Chitral because the alternative route is under construction and much longer. Locals are facing shortages of essential items and medicine amid fears that if the situation continues, a severe food shortage may occur.
On the other hand, the Ghizer district administration has contacted the Chitral administration, requesting a no-objection certificate to transport essential food and fuel supplies from Chitral to Phander Valley via Shandur Road.
Separately, the search operation for 12 tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Babusar area was concluded on Monday without any success. GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq stated that the 14-day-long search operation on the Babusar Highway had ended. While all vehicles were recovered from the debris, the missing tourists could not be traced.
On July 21, at least four tourists died, and 14 went missing after floods swept through the Babusar area in Diamer. During the operation, seven bodies were recovered.
Glof alert
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department issued an alert for increased risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs), flash floods, and landslides in the glaciated regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A wet spell is expected this week, with scattered rain and thunderstorms, including isolated heavy rainfall. The PMD advised relevant authorities to remain vigilant and take precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incidents.

• Pakistan Railways generated Rs13.9bn from leasing, licensing of land in 3 years
ISLAMABAD: As much as 3,999 acres of land, belonging to the Pakistan Railways (PR), is currently under “illegal occupation” of various “government and defence departments”.
This information was placed before the National Assembly by Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi on Monday, through written replies to two separate, but similar questions posed by MNAs.
“The PR owns a total of 168,858 acres of land across its network in Pakistan, out of which 13,115 acres (7.7 per cent) is under illegal occupation,” said the minister.
In the past five years, PR has managed to retrieve over 2,550 acres of land from illegal occupants. However, the replies have no mention about the retrieval of land from the government and defence departments.
The minister was responding to separate questions asked by PPP’s Shazia Marri and Sher Afzal Marwat of the opposition PTI.
 
 

The minister had been asked to provide the “names of individuals, entities, or organisations currently occupying railways land illegally, with specific locations and extent of each encroachment”.
Besides this, the minister had also been asked to provide a “province-wise bre­ak-up of the encro­ached land as well as the area of the illegally occupied land retrieved by the PR during the last five years”.
The response categorised the occupying individuals or departments into different categories, including “agricultural, commercial, residential, and government/defence departments”.
It says that the largest area of 4,773 acres is under illegal occupation of the individuals or departments related to agriculture, followed by 3,999 acres by the “government/defence departments”.
Moreover, the reply shows that a total of 3,266 acres are under residential use and 712 acres of illegal land is in commercial use.
The government/defence departments have been illegally occupying 2,539 acres in Punjab, 764 acres in Sindh, 349 acres in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 347 acres in Balochistan.
Similarly, the province-wise data of the total land under illegal occupation shows that 5,717 acres are under illegal occupation in Punjab, followed by Sindh (5,590 acres), Balochistan (1,033 acres) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (775 acres).
According to Mr Abbasi, the PR has been successful in retrieving 1,078 acres from the possession of illegal occupants in Punjab and 837 acres in Sindh during the last five years. Moreover, it has retrieved 419 acres in Balochistan and 218 acres in KP.
 
 

The reply, however, shows that when the PR has been successful in getting back some of its encroached land from the possession of individuals and organisations using it for residential, agricultural or commercial use, it has not retrieved even a single acre from the “government/defence departments” in the past five years.
The PR has retrieved 1,594 acres of land which was under agricultural use, 713 acres under commercial use and 268 acres under residential use.
The minister said the PR administration had undertaken several measures over the last three years to retrieve its illegally-occupied land.
“Unauthorised possession of railway land by government departments are being regularised through leases under Railway land policy,” said the minister, adding that commercial encroachments are being reviewed under “Remedial Policy” through lease agreements involving upfront premiums and arrears.
He said any illegal occupation or encroachment was dealt with legal action as per rules and regulations and regular anti-encroachment operations were being carried out to prevent fresh encroachments.
From 2020 to June 2025, he said, a total of 5,182 encroachment cases were reported, with a challan rate of 99.58pc and a conviction rate of 96.71pc.
Out of 5,611 accused, 99.6pc belonged to the general public, with nearly all arrested and only 20 still at large.
He said the PR had launched a comprehensive anti-encroachment campaign in collaboration with provincial government authorities.
The minister claimed that no new encroachment on the PR land had been recorded in the past five years.
Mr Abbasi said the PR had generated a total revenue of Rs13.9 billion from the leasing and licensing of railway land over the last three financial years.

• Asad Qaiser says this isn’t ‘final call’; protest to continue till govt’s ouster
• Ali Zafar says door to dialogue closed, but ‘decisions can change’
• Azma hopes people will reject ‘politics of chaos’
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Amid claims of a crackdown by the government, the PTI will launch its movement for the release of party founder Imran Khan and other prisoners today, which, it said, will continue till the ouster of the incumbent government.
According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 is the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a ‘final call’.
“Provincial chapters of the PTI have been directed to arrange rallies, public awareness events, and other activities. The protest will continue till the fake government is removed,” he said, adding that it was the right of the masses that their true representatives sit in parliament. The Aug 5 protest marks the second anniversary of party chief Imran Khan’s imprisonment in a corruption case.
“We have decided to involve all segments of the society…in the protest as we have been raising our voice for their rights,” the PTI leader claimed.
According to Mr Qaiser, raids against workers and members of parliament have started, while a number of workers have been arre­sted. He said details were being collected to know the actual number of arrests. The PTI leader claimed raids had started in Punjab and Kashmir and Section 144 was being imposed in different districts.
Meanwhile, PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir, in a press conference alongside Senator Ali Zafar, claimed that the police made some 200 raids and picked up party workers, who were released after allegedly submitting affidavits.
“The PTI will stage a major show of strength in Lahore and outside Adiala Jail (in Rawalpindi), besides organising massive rallies across the province, which will continue afterwards at full throttle,” he said. “Party workers and supporters from different districts have also reached Lahore,” he added.
During the presser, Senator Zafar made an ambiguous statement about talks, saying that though the “door for dialogue” had been closed by Imran Khan but in politics, “decisions do change”.
 
 

He said Mr Khan had given a message that he would be ready to stay in jail for 10 years for the people of Pakistan and the rule of law and not succumb to any kind of pressure, including “fake cases” and delay in the hearing of his cases.
Saying that he believed in dialogue, Senator Zafar said Mr Khan had once allowed the party to go into dialogue with two conditions, which were not accepted by the government, and the talks fell through.
Senator Zafar said the government was relying on four major cases against Imran Khan —Toshakhana-I, the cipher case, the Iddat case and the Al-Qadir Trust corruption case —but all cases crumbled one by one as they reached the high court. “The convictions handed down by the jail trial courts were suspended by the high court in a matter of minutes, except for the last Al-Qadir Trust case, which is not being allowed to be heard for the sake of delay,” he claimed.
Claiming that Mr Khan was resolute that he would get out of jail through the courts, Senator Zafar said the former prime minister was facing the “worst kind” of human rights violations. He said the government and powers that be wanted to break Mr Khan while exerting pressure on him and his wife.
“The government will fail in its efforts to keep Imran Khan out of politics,” he asserted.
Answering a question about boycotting by-elections, Senator Zafar said holding by-elections was illegal until the disqualification was upheld by the Supreme Court. He said the PTI would approach courts against the by-elections. It may be noted that several PTI leaders were disqualified following their conviction in the May 9 cases.
‘Politics of chaos’
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said people would reject the Aug 5 protest call.
“The politics of chaos will be rejected and defeated by the people. The PTI is no longer a political party but it has become a fascist group determined to damage the state institutions and disrupt national unity,” Ms Bokhari said during a presser in Lahore on Monday. The minister claimed that the person who raised slogans of ’Haqiqi Azadi (real freedom) was the same individual whose $18 million advertisement was published in the United States.
“This man once begged for freedom from America, and now his sons are repeating the same narrative,” said the minister. It may be noted that the PTI had said Imran Khan’s sons would also arrive in Pakistan to join the movement.  The minister said on August 5, when the nation would be expressing solidarity with Kashmiris, the PTI’s protest call was “highly regrettable”.

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.
Imran has decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the protest and ordered PTI members to immediately shun all their differences. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja previously said the party has no plans to gather workers at a specific place for the Aug 5 agitation, and instead it will protest at different locations across the country.
An order issued yesterday by Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hassan Waqar Cheema said it was brought to his attention by the District Intelligence Committee (DIC) that there was an “imminent threat” within the limits of Rawalpindi district — particularly surrounding sensitive installations, prominent roads and other critical infrastructures — that may pose a serious risk to human life, public property, and the overall peace and order of the district.
“The DIC has reported specific intelligence suggesting that certain groups and elements are actively mobilising with intentions to disturb the law and order situation through large gatherings, protests, and disruptive assemblies,” the order read.
“The forum further indicates that these elements may target soft locations and mobilise individuals with the potential to engage in violent actions near key installations and other sensitive sites, thereby endangering the public peace and tranquillity,” it added.
It continued that it was essential to ensure the security of the people and installations and buildings against any potential threat or untoward activity, in the larger interest of public safety, security, peace and tranquillity to avoid any untoward incident.
DC Cheema said that he was prohibiting the following activities within the district from Aug 4-10 under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger) of the Code of Criminal Procedure:

Assemblies, gatherings, sits-in, rallies, processions, demonstrations, protests and such other activities with a gathering of five or more people
Carrying weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence
Displaying arms and objectionable and hateful speeches
Attempting to remove any restriction imposed by a police officer to regulate the assembly of people or the movement of traffic
Pillion riding.
Using loudspeakers

Separately, the Adiala Jail superintendent requested the Rawalpindi city police officer to beef up security.
“It is awfully brought into your notice that PTI political worker, family members, especially sister of PTI leader are used to protest against the Jail administration and other state institutions, particularly outside the Jail. It has come to our attention through electronic/social media that PTI leadership is planning to stage a protest outside this jail tomorrow on Tuesday, which could potentially lead to an untoward incident,” the request read.
“Given the sensitivity of the situation, it is imperative to strengthen the outer security of the jail to maintain law and order. Proactive measures must be taken to identify and apprehend any miscreants involved in organising this protest,” it added.
“Furthermore, strict action should be enforced to prevent such gatherings near the jail premises to avoid any disruption or security risks. Additional police guard deployment, barricades, and surveillance may be necessary to deter unlawful assemblies and ensure the safety of the facility. Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated. Therefore, it has become a dire need of the hour to beef up the security (from all sides) of the jail to evade an unpleasant situation in future.”
It urged that, in light of the above, additional personnel be deployed at the jail and its surrounding areas urgently to strengthen the facility’s outer security under the supervision of police officers so that any unpleasant incident could be avoided.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ said the federal government had received a request two days ago, but no one had followed up on it despite attempts by the Islamabad administration to contact the sender.
He said there were opposing narratives and viewpoints coming from within the PTI about the nature of the protest, adding that the party should not blame the government for its own “internal division and weakness”. Chaudhry said the government was “clear” that any protest was the PTI’s right.
The state minister questioned why the administration was not directly contacted and the party did not give legal cover to its protest.
The PTI had approached the Lahore High Court last week, seeking permission to hold a public rally at Minar-i-Pakistan on Aug 5.
It has also submitted a request to the Islamabad administration for holding a workers’ convention at F-9 Park tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the capital police have begun preparations. Officers had told Dawn.com that in the first phase, the Anti-Riot Unit of the police started exercises, physical training and refresher anti-riot courses at the Police Lines Headquarters.
Over a thousand personnel of the unit are undergoing refresher courses. The courses include physical training and exercises to make them fit and respond to the protesters with full energy.
Besides, they are also doing refresher courses on the usage and handling of anti-riot kits. They are getting training regarding the usage of shields to protect themselves and the force from stones and other objects that may be pelted at them.
Furthermore, they are also being trained on how to intercept mobs at certain points, cordon them off and disperse them. They are also learning how to deal with troublemakers and protesters taking law and order into their hands.
On the other hand, police have also started collecting details of local PTI leaders and activists besides keeping an eye on their activities. The intelligence units of the police have mounted surveillance over the leaders and hardcore members of the PTI.
Surveillance at all hotels, motels, inns and guest houses along with cthe apital’s suburbs and outskirts has also been increased to monitor the PTI workers’ activities and get information about their stay and gatherings. The police intelligence units were also asked to prepare fresh lists of local PTI leaders.</p><small>2025-08-04 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0423430430744a4.jpg?r=234548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928717/two-shot-dead-three-injured-in-karachis-gulistan-i-johar-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two shot dead, three injured in Karachi’s Gulistan-i-Johar: police</strong></a><br><p>Two men were gunned down and three others were wounded in a suspected targeted attack in Gulistan-i-Johar on Monday evening, according to police.
Gulshan Superintendent of Police (SP) Ahmed Iqbal Memon told Dawn.com that five persons were shot and injured by unidentified gunmen at Pehlwan Goth, near the Sindh-Balochistan Housing Society.
“The injured were taken to a nearby private hospital, where two of them were pronounced dead,” Memon said, adding that the exact motive was being ascertained.
Meanwhile, a statement from Sharqi police station read that the victims were sitting at a battery shop at the time of the incident.
“Initial information suggests that two motorcyclists came to the shop and opened fire,” the statement read. “There are reports about the presence of a car at the scene but these are being confirmed.”
The statement added that forensic evidence has been collected from the crime scene, including bullet casings.
East Senior Superintendent of Police Dr Farrukh Raza said in a statement that police were receiving “different information” about the possible motives of the incident from the area.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for a religio-political party, Syed Ali Ahmed Zaidi, told Dawn.com that the shooting was a targeted killing, as one of the victims was the son of a prayer leader in the locality.
“One of the deceased … is the son of Maulana Rajab Ali Bangash, who is the prayer leader of a mosque in the area,” Zaidi said. “All of the victims were Ahle Tashi, who originally hailed from Gilgit-Baltistan,” he added.
One of the party’s leaders, Allama Sadiq Jafri, condemned the incident in a statement, saying, “We demand the immediate arrest of the suspects involved in this incident. The increase in target killings puts a question mark on law enforcement agencies.”
He added: “The network of sectarian extremists is becoming active again.”
Earlier this week, a senior lawyer was shot dead while his son was hurt in a suspected targeted attack in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the firing took place after a funeral prayer at a mosque in DHA Phase 6.
“As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG said. “Both father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.”</p><small>2025-08-04 18:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04224607e225cac.jpg?r=224846' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928714/us-could-require-up-to-15000-bonds-for-some-tourist-visas-under-pilot-programme' target='_blank'><strong>US could require up to $15,000 bonds for some tourist visas under pilot programme</strong></a><br><p>The United States could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme launching in two weeks, a government notice said on Monday, an effort that aims to crack down on visitors who overstay their visas.
The programme gives US consular officers the discretion to impose bonds on visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays, according to a Federal Register notice.
Bonds could also be applied to people coming from countries where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient, the notice said.
US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a focus of his presidency, boosting resources to secure the border and arresting people in the country illegally.
He issued a travel ban in June that fully or partially blocks citizens of 19 nations from entering the US on national security grounds. Trump’s immigration policies have led some visitors to skip travel to the US.
Transatlantic airfares dropped to rates last seen before the Covid-19 pandemic in May and travel from Canada and Mexico to the US fell by 20 per cent year-over-year.
Effective from August 20, the new visa programme will last for approximately a year, the government notice said. Consular officers will have three options for visa applicants subjected to the bonds: $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000, but will generally be expected to require at least $10,000, it said.
A similar pilot programme was launched in November 2020 during the last months of Trump’s first term in office, but it was not fully implemented due to the drop in global travel associated with the pandemic, the notice said.
The State Department was unable to estimate the number of visa applicants who could be affected by the change. Many of the countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban also have high rates of visa overstays, including Chad, Eritrea, Haiti, Myanmar and Yemen.
Numerous countries in Africa, including Burundi, Djibouti and Togo, also had
high overstay rates, according to US Customs and Border Protection data from fiscal year 2023.</p><small>2025-08-04 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04204159fdaa0b3.jpg?r=204206' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928704/trump-warns-he-will-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns he will ‘substantially’ raise tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil.
Trump last week said he would impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.
In a post on Truth Social today, Trump assailed New Delhi for buying Russian oil and then selling it.
“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,” Trump wrote. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine.
“Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,” the US president wrote.
 


Responding to the threat, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union “targeted” New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
“India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,” the statement read. “The US at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy market stability.”
The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.
“Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement added.
“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”
 






India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p><small>2025-08-04 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0421122200ceae2.jpg?r=212323' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928707/fm-dar-rubio-hold-second-phone-call-since-us-visit-amid-improving-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar, Rubio hold second phone call since US visit amid improving bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday held his second phone call with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio since visiting Washington and an improvement in bilateral ties.
There has been a surge in relations between the US and Pakistan, with both nations inking a trade deal last week in which Washington lowered tariffs on Islamabad to 19 per cent, while tapping the latter’s oil reserves. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation in the arrest of an Islamic State-Khorasan operative to claiming credit for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president’s day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’.
In a post on X today, the Foreign Office (FO) stated that the two top diplomats had their most recent interaction over the phone.
“The two leaders discussed a range of bilateral matters and exchanged views on current regional and international issues,” the FO stated. “Both sides agreed to remain in contact and continue cooperation on areas of mutual interest.”
 






FM Dar had met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.
The meeting — the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years — was considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US. Secretary Rubio had recognised Pakistan’s “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a “constructive actor” in efforts to ensure regional stability.
The two had subsequently talked again on July 28 after their “productive meeting” and discussed key bilateral matters, including tariffs, as well as regional & global issues of mutual interest.

The incident comes a few days after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.
According to Battagram police Public Relations Officer Ghulam Nabi, “The uncle of the victim allegedly gunned down his niece in the name of honour.”
A first information report (FIR) dated Aug 4, seen by Dawn.com, said that the incident occurred during the early hours of Monday.
In the FIR, the suspect confessed that he had been a guest at his brother’s house for two days. “My brother went outside at night and told me to take care of the house,” the FIR quoted him as saying.
He further said that he heard the sound of the gate of the house opening at around 2am, prompting him to wake up.
“Using a flashlight, I saw that my niece was at the gate and going out with three people.”
Upon seeing his niece leaving the house, he fired at the victim and the cartridge ran out, the FIR read.
The suspect said that the victim’s mother gave him a pistol, adding, “After chasing them, I deliberately fired at Zahida Bibi out of honour.”
The firing killed the girl and injured one boy, while the other two people fled the scene, the FIR said.
The police arrested the suspect and recovered the weapons used in the crime.
The case was registered at the Battagram city police station under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempt to murder) and 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 15 AA-KPK.
Last week, a couple was shot dead by the woman’s family over ‘honour’ in Balochistan’s Mastung district.
On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-08-04 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0421300484f5764.jpg?r=213008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928708/mardan-police-arrest-four-in-teenage-girl-viral-video-case' target='_blank'><strong>Mardan police arrest four in teenage girl viral video case</strong></a><br><p>Police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan on Monday arrested four individuals in a case involving a viral video wherein suspects were involved in the harassment of a teenage girl.
The action was taken on KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s instructions after the incident was highlighted by journalists.
“A video of a young girl had gone viral on TikTok in which the girl was being harassed by men while she was dancing at a private event,” Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan said.
He added that the Mardan police took prompt action and arrested four people.
“The men physically harassed the victim, who was used to be sent to private parties by her relatives.”
The police spokesperson said that after the video went viral on TikTok, journalists including Asad Ali Toor brought up the issue with the KP chief minister, who then ordered the Mardan District Police Officer (DPO) Zahoor Babar Afridi to take action.
“The girl’s grandmother and close relatives are among the arrested individuals, who used to send the teenage girl to private dance events for the sake of money.”
Khan said that a first information report has been lodged at the City police station and further invetigation into the case is underway.
Separately, DPO Afridi asked citizens in a statement to keep watch on their children and protect them from getting involved in such immoral activities.
“Public should report incidents like exploitation of children and abuse to the police” the statement quoted him as saying.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
Last month, the Punjab Police said they arrested a man suspected of molesting a minor girl in Multan district after a video of the incident went viral online.
Also, last month, police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Punjab’s Kasur district went viral online.</p><small>2025-08-04 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04175926ea1a3da.jpg?r=204620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928694/moving-beyond-limits-how-one-student-from-kp-defied-disability-to-top-matric-exams' target='_blank'><strong>Moving beyond limits: How one student from KP defied disability to top Matric exams</strong></a><br><p>Muhammad Sudais Khan, a 17-year-old student from rural Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has emerged as a remarkable symbol of perseverance, proving that physical limitations cannot suppress determination and talent.
Born as a disabled person, who had both his hands and one foot rendered non-functional, Sudais faced an uphill journey on the road to getting an education.
This year, not only did he sit for his Matriculation examinations under the Peshawar Board, but he also shocked the community by scoring an impressive 890 marks, all accomplished with just one toe.
Despite all the hardship, Sudais answered each question using the only working toe on his left foot, without ever letting his physical constraints define his potential.
His achievement, unprecedented and inspiring, has turned him into a symbol of resilience and a role model for people of all abilities across KP and beyond.
“I was not expecting this much appreciation from the people,” Sudais told Dawn.com.
He said that his public school was very supportive of him, saying that “my friends and school fellows never let me feel my disability”.
A biology teacher at his school, Abdullah Jan, called him an example for the world, saying, “His success is a motivation for students.”
Sudais had to face various challenges to mark his name in this spot. Being a disabled person is full of hardships, including mobility issues. “More than the disability, the transportation was a bigger challenge for me,” he said.
He added that his school was about seven to eight kilometres away from his home, adding, “I had very limited resources to fulfil my transportation needs.”
Sudais’s parents were happy and surprised at the same time about his success. His father, Muhammad Nawaz Khan, who drives a Qingqi rickshaw, told Dawn.com that walking from home to school was a barrier for Sudais.
“Every morning, I had to take him in a Qingqi for 7-8km to his school,” he said, adding that Sudais’ education was the goal. He continued, “We will work hard for his education.”
Sudais quoted his mother as saying: “I am the happiest mother today.” He further shared his mother’s remarks, stating: “Besides all of your barriers, I had a feeling that you (Sudais) will get success where everyone will get to know you.”

Sudais’ achievements have become talk of the town, with government officials offering rewards for his hard work after his exemplary success.
Peshawar Division Commissioner Riaz Mehsood invited Sudais and his family, awarding him with cash and certificates. “With one hand and a foot disability, this is a big success,” Mehsood said. “We will further help Sudais in his educational struggle,” he added.
MPA Laik Muhammad Khan also acknowledged the hard work and motivation of the young student and announced a Rs50,000 cash prize for him. “More children will learn from his example,” he said.
As Charsadda celebrates one of its brightest stars, Sudais’s story reminds us all that courage can break any barrier when paired with opportunity.</p><small>2025-08-04 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04195018d59173a.jpg?r=195159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928701/pakistan-approves-first-ever-ferry-licence-for-routes-to-iran-gcc-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan approves first-ever ferry licence for routes to Iran, GCC countries</strong></a><br><p>The maritime affairs ministry on Monday approved its first-ever ferry service licence to an international ferry operator, authorising the company to operate routes connecting Pakistan with Iran and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Last month, the ministry announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with GCC countries.
The approval followed a high-level meeting of the licensing committee, comprising officials from maritime affairs, defence, foreign affairs, and interior ministries, along with representatives from the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation as well as port and shipping authorities.
According to a statement issued by the ministry, Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry hailed the move as a historic step aligned with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision and Pakistan’s National Maritime Policy.
“This licence creates the opportunity for boosting regional connectivity, religious tourism, and economic activity via sea routes,” he emphasised.
The new ferry service is expected to serve hundreds of thousands annually, particularly pilgrims travelling to Iran and Iraq, alongside workers and tourists bound for GCC states.
“The ferry service will alleviate pressure on land routes and reduce travel costs compared to air transport for the Pakistani diaspora and religious travellers,” he noted.
“Initial operations will commence from the ports of Karachi and Gwadar using modern ferry vessels equipped with essential amenities to ensure safe, affordable travel. Expansion of routes and port calls is planned based on demand and bilateral agreements,” he added.
“This ferry service launch forms part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to develop its blue economy, improve trade logistics, and promote maritime tourism, reflecting a renewed commitment to sustainable regional sea transport infrastructure.”
Last week, amid a deadlock in negotiations over the government’s decision to ban land travel to Iran for pilgrims during Arbaeen — the chehlum of Imam Husain — the Maritime Mini­stry was deliberating to launch a ferry service to facilitate travel of zaireen (pilgrims) to Iran and Iraq.
Last month, five private companies proposed routes for the newly announced ferry service from Gwadar to the Gulf region, according to the maritime ministry.</p><small>2025-08-04 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041837437bbf2a0.png?r=183829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928666/pm-shehbaz-announces-rs4bn-for-mapping-damage-reconstruction-of-gb-after-floods' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces Rs4bn for mapping damage, reconstruction of GB after floods</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced Rs4 billion for mapping damage to infrastructure in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and reconstruction efforts following recent floods in the region.
The prime minister was on a one-day visit to GB to review monsoon damages and distribute relief funds to flood-affected people. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
A statement posted on the X account of state broadcaster PTV News said PM Shehbaz emphasised the need for timely preparation to deal with natural disasters and announced a Rs4bn fund for infrastructure restoration and the activation of a 100-megawatt solar project soon. The PM also laid the foundation stone for a Daanish School.
 






Addressing a cheque distribution ceremony for flood affectees, he recalled, “A huge cloudburst occurred here, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.”
Noting the loss of lives and the damage caused to people’s property, the premier prayed for those who died and for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“I have come here specifically to express my sympathies and to assure you that I will keep coming here till you get resettled in your homes,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan was in the “red zone” of 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the prime minister underscored that both federal and GB governments had to work around the clock to combat climate change.
 


He ordered the early completion and functioning of the advanced weather warning system in GB and noted that Pakistan required preparedness to ward off damage and losses from climate change and weather-related disasters.
The prime minister said that he was visiting GB, along with cabinet members, to express sympathy with the affected families and assured them that they would be rehabilitated, adding that the federal government departments and the relevant departments in GB would work closely for this purpose.
PM Shehbaz said he had directed the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority to conduct mapping of the damages and submit a report in this regard, adding that he would visit the area in August.
Earlier, the prime minister distributed cheques containing compensation amounts among the family members of those who lost their loved ones in the recent rains and floods.
Chief Minister Gilgit Baltistan Haji Gulbar Khan, in his remarks, highlighted the damages, rescue and relief activities in the region after recent floods.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions Engineer Amir Muqam lauded the prime minister for his commitment and dedication to the public welfare projects.
He said, contrary to the past, GB’s budget had now been increased to Rs186 billion annually.
Premier orders weather alert system for tourist spots
Earlier today, PM Shehbaz chaired a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains. He termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”.
He emphasised that an advanced weather alert system must be established for tourist destinations based on seasonal forecasts, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
 
 

The prime minister said local populations should be resettled away from natural water passageways to help prevent emergencies in the future.
He also ordered the NDMA and the climate change ministry to jointly establish a forecasting and monitoring centre for GB in the coming months.
A comprehensive system must be developed for immediate rescue and assistance in emergency situations, the premier stressed. He instructed the NDMA to ensure close cooperation with provincial governments and relevant institutions to enhance rescue and relief efforts.
“All rehabilitation measures for those affected by the recent monsoon must be completed promptly,” PM Shehbaz asserted, issuing directives for a survey of damage to roads and infrastructure, and the restoration of communication links in all affected areas on a priority basis.
The Ministry of Climate Change informed the meeting about progress on the ongoing installation of an early warning system for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), with the premier ordering its completion in two months.
Regarding the July 21 heavy rains in GB’s Thak-Babusar, Thor, Kundus, and Ishkoman areas, the meeting was informed that over 600 people were rescued, while damaged roads were repaired and reopened to restore connectivity, APP reported.
 
 

Five tent villages were established for rescue operations, and 10 helicopters, along with two C-130 aircraft, were deployed to transport stranded tourists and individuals to safe locations.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz instructed Water Minister Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo to remain in GB to complete consultations and planning for a better water management system.
PM highlights ‘key role’ of the climate change ministry
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter.
He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.
Emphasising that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.
He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.
“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the top 10 countries that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” PM Shehbaz noted.
 






Recalling the devastating 2022 floods, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”
In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred losses worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.
PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.
The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of Daanish Schools he had promised. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.
He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.
“I will try to ensure this project’s completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.”
Premier meets with GB CM, governor
During his day trip, PM Shehbaz held separate meetings with the GB governor and chief minister to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.
Governor Shah briefed the prime minister on the flood situation and damages caused by the recent rains, as well as on the progress of development projects underway in Gilgit, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.
The governor also updated the premier on the region’s overall law and order situation. Recently, GB’s Tangir district witnessed two honour killing incidents within a week, taking the lives of four people.
In his meeting, CM Gulbar informed PM Shehbaz about the rescue and relief activities in the wake of the monsoon rains, Radio Pakistan reported.
Gulbar, an estranged member of the PTI who was backed by the PML-N and PPP during his election as chief minister, appreciated the premier’s decision to establish Daanish schools in GB.
They also discussed the law and order situation in GB and progress on development projects.
 






Federal govt cooperation akin to oxygen: GB govt
Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.
 






The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.
“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” PTV said.
In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister. GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods.”
As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters.
 
 

“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.
Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were rescued today, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.
Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts.
On Friday, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members went missing after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.
Glof alert issued for GB, KP ahead of likely rains
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued an alert for an increased risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The alert noted that a wet spell was likely to affect both regions in the current week as “scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls”, were expected.
 






As per the PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country from today till Thursday.
 






At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04184401477fa06.jpg?r=192927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928697/coas-aims-to-build-a-more-sustainable-multi-faceted-relationship-with-america-report' target='_blank'><strong>COAS aims to build a more sustainable, multi-faceted relationship with America: report</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is aiming to build a sustainable and multi-faceted relationship with the United States, British magazine The Economist reported on Sunday.
Relations between Washington and Islamabad have grown deeper since US President Donald Trump took office. On July 31, both nations struck a trade deal lowering US tariffs on Pakistan to 19 per cent, while also establishing an agreement to explore Pakistani oil reserves.
In June, the COAS made a five-day official visit to the US, where he met with Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. During the trip, Field Marshal Munir stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.
 
 

The COAS’ visit followed a four-day military confrontation with India in May, after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
“There he was, enjoying a private lunch with Donald Trump in the White House on June 18, just over a month after Pakistan’s brief conflict with India,” The Economist wrote about the June luncheon.
“Then, at the end of July, came further snubs for India: branding it a ‘dead economy’, Mr Trump imposed tariffs of 25pc while hailing a new trade deal with Pakistan.”
The Economist wrote that the field marshal’s fortunes “reflect a shift in American policy that affects India, China and the Middle East”.
Speaking to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, The Economist quoted him as saying that Field Marshal Munir is “well versed” with The West, despite not having trained in the US or the UK.
“To India’s dismay, America and Pakistan are now rebuilding ties with a focus on trade, counter-terrorism and consultation on Middle Eastern policy.
America may even sell arms again to Pakistan,” the magazine noted.
Additionally, The Economist recognised that Pakistan recently earned Washington’s praise for killing and capturing leaders of a local offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group.
In June, United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.
“He (Munir) has sparked interest from Trump associates in Pakistan’s crypto and mining sectors … and he has positioned Pakistan as a potential means to advance America’s interests with Iran and its efforts to get more Muslim countries to establish diplomatic ties with Israel,” the magazine wrote.
America, in turn, toned down its criticism of Pakistan’s programme to
build longer-range ballistic missiles, which officials from former president Joe Biden’s administration considered a threat to the US, The Economist wrote.
“It has resumed some aid programmes [and] it is also considering selling weaponry, including armoured vehicles and night-vision goggles, to help Pakistan combat local insurgents.
“American officials are examining Pakistan’s evidence to support its
claims that India backs those insurgencies, although they are unconvinced, so
far.”
In January, prior to Trump’s inauguration as president, the US said Pakistan played a pivotal role in US counterterrorism efforts over the years, but it “has never been a formal ally bound by treaty obligations”, according to former White House official John Kirby.
Meanwhile, Pam Bondi, who is currently serving as the US attorney general, emphasised during her confirmation hearing that global cooperation would be essential to counter the growing threat posed by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups like Islamic State-Khorasan Province.</p><small>2025-08-04 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04190101e1cb154.jpg?r=190251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928698/russia-urges-caution-in-nuclear-rhetoric-after-trump-comments' target='_blank'><strong>Russia urges caution in nuclear ‘rhetoric’ after Trump comments</strong></a><br><p>Russia urged caution on Monday after United States President Donald Trump said he would deploy two nuclear submarines following an online row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.
Trump said he had ordered the deployment in response to what he alleged were highly provocative comments by Medvedev, saying the submarines would be positioned in “appropriate regions”.
Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.
“Russia is very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation. And we believe that everyone should be very, very cautious with nuclear rhetoric,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including from AFP, on Monday.
The row between Medvedev and Trump erupted against the backdrop of the US leader’s ultimatum for Russia to end its military offensive in Ukraine or face fresh economic sanctions, including on its remaining trading partners.
Medvedev — one of Russia’s most prominent anti-Western hawks — accused Trump of “playing the ultimatum game” and said that Trump “should remember” that Russia was a formidable force.
“Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,” he said.
 






Medvedev, who has not posted on social media since the spat, is currently the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. He served one term as president from 2008 to 2012, effectively acting as a placeholder for Putin, who was able to circumvent constitutional term limits and de facto remain in power.
The chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday backed Trump’s actions.
“The concept of peace through strength works,” Andriy Yermak wrote on social media.
“The moment American nuclear submarines appeared, one Russian drunk — who had just been threatening nuclear war on X — suddenly went silent.”

He won the Tekken 7 competition at EVO Japan 2023 in April 2023 and gained his 5th EVO title in July 2024.
EVO 2025 was held at the Las Vegas Convention Centre from Aug 1-3.
Siddique repeated history to win his 6th EVO title against fellow Pakistani and a former member of the team founded by Ash himself, Atif Butt.
EVO posted the winning moment on X with Ash using Nina Williams and Butt using Anna Williams, characters from the Tekken fighting game franchise who are sisters, terming it “greatness on another level”.
 






“I’m feeling so blessed,” EVO quoted Ash as saying after his win and becoming a six-time title holder, adding that he remains “grateful in victory”.
 






“Our player Arslan achieves the Evo World Championship for the sixth time in his career. The right path to achieving the World Cup, God willing,” said his e-sports club, Saudi Arabia’s Twisted Minds, further calling Ash by his moniker as the greatest of all time (GOAT) in the competitive Tekken scene.
“Six-time EVO champion. Undisputed GOAT of Tekken.”
 






Ash himself said in a post on Instagram: “Six EVO titles. What started as a kid grinding in gaming arcades became something I never imagined. Thank you to everyone who believed in me. This is for Pakistan.”

Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.
After deadly floods swept across GB’s Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of seven people had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region’s death toll stands at 10.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, “The funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.”
He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. “All vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,” he said.
“[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,” he added.
Last week, the GB government had intensified the search operations on Babusar Highway.
Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.
5 family members rescued after 4 days in Ghizer
Separately, five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer district have been rescued and taken to a safe place, Ghizer’s Rescue 1122 said today.

According to Ghizer Rescue 1122’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.
“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told Dawn.com.
“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”
According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.
On Thursday, cloudburst-induced floods in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The next day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had resulted in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-04 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04113959388fab5.png?r=114024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928646/pakistan-clinch-series-win-2-1-after-defeating-west-indies-by-13-runs' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan clinch series win 2-1 after defeating West Indies by 13 runs</strong></a><br><p>Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub combined for a 138 opening partnership and Pakistan defeated the West Indies by 13 runs on Sunday to capture their T20 International Series.

When injured England last man Chris Woakes came in to bat with his left arm strapped up owing to an injured shoulder, England still needed 17 more runs for victory.
Gus Atkinson hit a six off Siraj before England got the target down to single figures.
But Siraj set the seal on a superb series by bowling Atkinson (17) as he knocked over the batsman’s off stump to spark delirious scenes among the India team and their supporters in south London.
India were without Jasprit Bumrah at the Oval after deciding to stand by a decision to only play the world’s top-ranked Test bowler in three games of this five-match series.
Siraj, who featured throughout, ended the series with 23 wickets at 32.43.
Smith and Overton had struggled to get the ball off the square on their Surrey home ground on Sunday.
And with play starting Monday beneath grey skies, conditions favoured India’s quicks.
Overton pulled the first ball of the day, from Prasidh Krishna, for four – a shot greeted by huge cheers from England fans in an impressively large Oval crowd — and under-edged the second for another boundary
Siraj took up the attack from the Pavilion End and promptly twice beat Smith on the outside edge.
And with the third ball of his over Siraj had Smith caught behind, without the batsman adding to his score, to leave England 347-7.
The next delivery saw new batsman Atkinson edge the lion-hearted Siraj just short of the slip cordon.
But it was his Surrey county colleague Overton who fell next, lbw for nine to a Siraj ball angling into his pads. Overton reviewed but Kumar Dharmasena’s decision was upheld on umpire’s call.
Tailender Josh Tongue was then given out lbw to Krishna but the batsman’s review saw the decision overturned.
England had been cruising to victory while Harry Brook (111) and Joe Root (105) were sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 195 on Sunday.
However, Brook’s exit sparked a mini-collapse, with England losing three wickets for 36 runs and Root also among those dismissed.</p><small>2025-08-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04172320de84d57.png?r=172353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691/pakistan-issues-another-tender-to-buy-01m-tonnes-of-sugar-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues another tender to buy 0.1m tonnes of sugar, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, European traders said on Monday.
The quantity is double the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is August 11.
The announcement is believed to indicate that Pakistan will make no purchase in its previous tender for 100,000 tonnes of sugar on July 31, traders said.
On July 8, Pakistan’s government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
 
 

Traders said three companies had participated in the July 31 tender, with the lowest price offer assessed at $539.00 a tonne cost and freight included (c&f).
Pakistan reportedly received no offers in a previous tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar on July 22, with traders saying the requirement to load shipments from August 1-15 was too short notice for realistic offers.
The new tender seeks small/fine and medium grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel, packed in bags transported either in ocean shipping containers or breakbulk.
Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1-15 for 50,000 tonnes and September 10-25 for 50,000 tonnes. For 50,000 tonnes of sugar in ocean shipping containers, shipment can also be made between September 1 and 20.
Shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20.
Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.
 
 

During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.
Despite the export surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.
Last week, the government decided to enforce strict monitoring of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04123958291465c.jpg?r=132737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928670/police-arrest-3-for-allegedly-gang-raping-woman-in-abbottabad' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 3 for allegedly gang-raping woman in Abbottabad</strong></a><br><p>Police on Monday arrested three suspects who allegedly gang-raped a woman last week in the Bakot area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district, springing into action after the incident sparked social media outrage.
Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the suspects had allegedly gang-raped a woman from Rawalpindi on Wednesday.
“District Police Officer (DPO) Umar Tufail took action and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects after the incident was highlighted on social media, including Facebook and TikTok,” Spokesperson Afzal said.
He added that the Bakot station house officer (SHO), Arshad Khan, was sent to the village, where he had also found the local community angered over the incident.
 
 

On the SHO’s complaint, a first information report (FIR) was lodged at the Bakot police station yesterday under sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 375A (rape) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, police arrested the suspect who owned the house where the woman was allegedly raped by him and his friends.
The FIR added that one of the suspects brought the woman to his friend’s house in his car from Rawalpindi, where he and his friends raped her, one after the other. In his statement, the homeowner confessed to committing the crime while also identifying his two accomplices.
The police stated in the FIR that the accomplices were also arrested, while a search for the victim continued and the investigation was underway.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In July, a newlywed 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari, who was admitted to a hospital in critical condition after an alleged marital rape and “brutal sexual violence” at the hands of her husband, succumbed to her injuries. Her spouse was arrested by the police.
Earlier that month, Karachi police arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p><small>2025-08-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041314300568515.jpg?r=131556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928668/shameless-actions-pakistan-condemns-israeli-ministers-storming-al-aqsa-mosque' target='_blank'><strong>‘Shameless actions’: Pakistan condemns Israeli ministers storming Al-Aqsa mosque</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, calling Tel Aviv out for its “shameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region”.
Early on Sunday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, shielded by Israeli police, led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B’Av, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.
“This sacrilege against one of Islam’s holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.
 






He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.
The prime minister said that Israel’s “shameless actions” were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.
“Pakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” PM Shehbaz added.
The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.
“The presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‘the Temple Mount is ours,’ are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‑Aqsa Mosque,” the statement said.
It said that Israel’s expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.
“These provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.”
The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‑Aqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
 
 

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 60,839 and injured nearly 149,000 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office.
Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Last month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
On July 29, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the UN and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.
