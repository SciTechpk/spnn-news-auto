<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698a9622f32d7.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972212/change-of-heart' target='_blank'><strong>Change of heart?</strong></a><br><p>SOMETHING is in the air. And I don’t mean the pollution. Perhaps it would be better to use the Urdu saying that there’s something black in the lentils. For those unfamiliar with this expression, it implies a sense of suspicion. Nothing more. And by suggesting this I am not about to highlight anything unpalatable such as Balochistan or the arrest of human rights defenders Imaan Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chattha. Well trained as we Pakistanis are in the art of survival, we know such sensitive topics are best left for foreigners to discuss.
We stick to international affairs or to domestic politics. Indeed, the safest topic these days, as long as one sticks to politicians and their frolics, is our local political scene. As long as one can pretend it is the politicians who are in charge of politics and the country. So, based on the assumption that they are calling the shots, dear reader, I can spy with my little eye something black in the daal or rather the khichri of politics.
Let me explain what I mean.
First came the sudden and abrupt decision to allow the new leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly and the Senate. For months, the nomination of Mehmood Khan Achakzai in the NA and Allama Nasir Abbas in the Senate had been delayed, ostensibly because of some legal issues. It was reported again and again that Omar Ayub had filed a petition against his disqualification and till this issue was settled, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq didn’t want to allow a new leader of the opposition — so concerned was the latter about the rights of the former. The powers in the Senate had similar concerns. However, everyone and their nani in Islamabad were aware the powers that be were not happy with the choices of Imran Khan who had named Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Nasir Abbas because of their fiery views. And the Speaker and Senate chairman, good boys both, were simply sticking to the script.

It is perhaps too early to know what is happening but there is something black in the ‘khichri’.

But then, suddenly, the script changed. The Speaker made Achakzai the opposition leader, and the chairman of the Senate, Yousuf Raza Gilani, also had a similar epiphany, paving the way for Abbas to make it to the position in the Senate. Ask for an explanation, and neither side has much to offer other than the spiel about the legal worries being addressed.

 

But the surprises didn’t end here. Then came the meeting between the chief minister of KP and the prime minister of Pakistan. Once again, it was a bolt out of the blue. Both sides, when asked, claimed the other had asked for the meeting, leaving the confusion in place. But even more interesting were the participants of the meeting. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took his finance adviser Muzamil Aslam with him, claiming his focus was on financial issues between the federal government and KP. But the PM was accompanied by his Man Friday on political affairs, Rana Sanaullah, and not the finance minister or any of the other people linked to economics. How Rana Sanaullah can help with budgetary affairs is something I hope someone will explain.
Since this meeting, the CM has even presided over an apex committee meeting for KP in which military officials also participated. It is worth noting that earlier when the KP Assembly had asked for a briefing, they were told they hadn’t followed the right protocol regarding whom to write the letter to. It seems as if the CM had paid attention in school when letter writing was taught and knew who to address a letter to. For officers turned up for the meeting.
It is quite possible that all these are unconnected events. The NA Speaker and Senate chairman made decisions independently of each other and of politics and neither did they have anything to do with the meeting between the CM and PM. And the CM’s meeting in Islamabad had little to do with the meeting he held on the security situation. But those of us who are brought up on an unhealthy dose of Pakistani politics are always looking for conspiracy theories — and more times than not, the conspiracies turn out to be true.
The suddenness of all this reminds me of the PDM days in opposition when the PPP and PML-N had gone their separate ways and their rallies across the country seemed a thing of the past. Then one day, all the channels carried news of Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari turning up at a lunch hosted by Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz. No one explained how the ice melted and why. But its melting then led the way to the vote of no-confidence in 2022. In hindsight, it is not difficult to guess who made the lunch happen and the ice melt.
There is similar guesswork happening now. It is perhaps too early for people such as myself to know what is happening but there is something black in the khichri. And somewhere in the traces of black are faint images of politicians or others talking to each other. The reasons why they need to do so have been documented frequently and I will not tire anyone (who has managed to read this far) with them. However, it is worth pointing out that while a dialogue is welcome, it is not necessary for it to succeed immediately. For that to happen, one of the two stakeholders in power will have to be of the opinion that they have more to lose by this set-up continuing as it is. Or, it means Imran Khan has had enough of jail and is willing to consider options for release. But if there is a change of heart on either side, those on the outside are not entirely aware of it. But we will know soon enough; for it doesn’t take long for secrets to become public in this land, especially in Islamabad.

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of Jan 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed.

 

On Monday, the investigating officer of the case brought the four prosecution witnesses before Judicial Magistrate (South) Aasim Aslam for recording of their statements under Section 164 of the criminal procedure code.
One of the witnesses, 13-year-old Aryan, son of a shopkeeper, deposed that he saw 11-year-old Huzaifa, son of the flower shop owner, playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly broke out on Jan 17.
He stated he went to the flower shop at around 10pm to meet Huzaifa before leaving the plaza. He said Huzaifa was alone at the shop and was playing with matchsticks when the fire suddenly erupted.
Besides Aryan, three salesmen also recorded their statements before the judicial magistrate.
Waleed stated that on the night of the incident he was inside a shop when he heard someone’s shout that a fire had broken out. He said he stood up and saw that the fire was already raging in the artificial flower shop.
He added that he, along with some other shopkeepers, tried to remove the artificial flowers from the shop but found that they were fixed with screws.
“The fire intensified and the place was filled with smoke,” he said, adding that till then the market committee members had arrived at the spot.
He added that as the fire became uncontrollable, he stepped back and managed to escape from the plaza.
Another salesman, Hamza, 29, said that while he was busy doing the accounts of his shop, he saw a fire erupted in Shop No 193 (artificial flower shop). He said when the blaze did not subside despite attempts to douse it with water, he ran towards an exit to save his life.
Talha, 28, said that he was talking with his colleague when the fire suddenly broke out in the flower shop. He added that he and other shopkeepers tried to extinguish the blaze, but realising its intensity, they decided to save their lives.
A manslaughter case was registered on the complaint of the SHO of the Nabi Bux police station against unknown persons.

PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui said that Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar called party MPAs Wajid Hussain and Sajjad Ali Soomro to inform them of the government’s decision.
“So we hope that our workers will be released by tomorrow [Tuesday] after all government formalities are completed,” she told Dawn.
She claimed around 300 party workers and leaders from different tiers were arrested in raids that began last Sunday and continued ahead of the Feb 8 protest call. “We have already challenged their detention in court.”
Meanwhile, government sources confirmed the PTI’s claim and said that the government had, in principle, decided to release all PTI workers and that the “documentary process” in this regard had already begun.

Opposition party hopes detained activists will be freed today; claims home minister has conveyed the decision to two PTI lawmakers

“So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source.
Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance.
On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating public to block roads, highways and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”.
The party challenged the alleged detentions in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the very next day.
On Friday, the Sindh High Court directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance.
A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhary, also issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh in around 35 identical petitions, fixing Feb 10 for hearing.
Earlier on Monday, the PTI said that even after passing the Feb 8 protest call, its Karachi President Raja Azhar and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan were arrested by law enforcement authorities.
Condemning the move as unconstitutional and politically motivated, the party spokesperson said that both leaders were shifted to the Central Prison and that even their families were unaware of the cases against them and their whereabouts.
“We have been informed that both leaders were moved to the Central Prison on Monday evening. We were not allowed to meet them, nor were their families permitted to do so. This is open barbarity, which we strongly condemn,” she alleged.

Just as Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups found refuge in Afghanistan during the Taliban’s first stint in power, today, the TTP and various other terrorist entities operate with freedom.
While some, such as IS-K, are enemies of the Afghan Taliban, most others, including the TTP, share cordial ties with Kabul’s rulers. President Zardari added that India was “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening … Pakistan”.
In a related context, the federal interior minister had said that the alleged mastermind of Friday’s suicide bombing in Islamabad had been nabbed, and that he was an Afghan national. Moreover, IS has claimed responsibility for the atrocity in the capital. The minister also observed that India had increased funding for terrorists.
The complexity of the threats — both internal and external — require the federal and provincial governments to put aside political differences and focus on the threat of terrorism. However, the federal information minister’s remarks and off-colour joke that the PTI was responsible for the resurgence of terrorism in the country will do little to foster unity at a time when it is direly needed.

 

Just last week, we had seen positive movement in this regard as KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi chaired his first meeting of the province’s Apex Committee. Mr Afridi had stressed the need for the provinces, the centre and the military to work in unison to confront terrorist violence.
Moreover, the interior minister had also praised the KP CTD for their role in the arrest of the Islamabad blast suspects. All political actors must display a similar spirit; this is not the time for snide remarks or debates about who is responsible for allowing terrorists to regroup, through acts of commission or omission.
After all, it is a lengthy debate and would entail all factors over the past several decades that allowed terrorism to take root in Pakistan. For now, all sides must focus on the one-point agenda of defeating terrorism.
It is also a matter of great concern that the terrorist attack on the Islamabad imambargah last week has been linked to IS. The group is not on good terms with the Afghan Taliban, but operates in the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan. That it was able to organise an attack apparently in KP, and target the nation’s most secure city, should raise red flags.
More intelligence-based operations are needed to thwart any future attacks by this bloodthirsty outfit. The state already has its hands full dealing with the TTP’s terrorist attacks; it cannot afford to give any quarter to IS.

ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Monday expressed concern over delays in the execution of road infrastructure projects across the country and urged the formulation of a mechanism to avoid the simultaneous execution of multiple projects.
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Communications, headed by Pervaiz Rashid, suggested that initiating and completing projects one at a time would help prevent cost escalation and ensure timely completion.
It further recommended consultation with the Planning Commission in devising such a mechanism.
The committee chairman directed that clear responsibility be fixed for project delays and that escalation costs be borne by those responsible.
The committee reviewed the budgetary allocations and releases for the current financial year and examined the proposed budget for the next financial year. It was informed that a major portion of the National Highway Authority (NHA) budget consists of PSDP-funded projects.
Senator Jam Saifullah Khan emphasised that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway should be treated as a priority project and directed that progress updates be presented at every committee meeting.
The Senate body also discussed issues related to the dilapidated condition of roads raised during Senate proceedings, received a briefing on ongoing NHA projects, and reviewed the implementation status of the approved Escalation Price Adjustment Formula.
The committee also discussed issues concerning the deteriorating condition of motorways and the Lowari Tunnel. Serious concerns were raised regarding safety, ventilation and quality standards, particularly in view of the strategic importance of the tunnel.
The committee was also briefed on the progress of the Chakdara-Chitral and Gilgit-Shandur road projects.
The Senate body received a briefing on the implementation of the PM-approved Escalation Price Adjustment Formula for ongoing projects. The committee noted that delays in the implementation of the formula could further increase contractors’ claims and termed such delays contrary to the prime minister’s directives.
The chairman directed the NHA chief to address the matter promptly and sub­­mit quarterly progress reports to the committee.
Corruption at KPT
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Maritime Affairs on Monday observed that annual corruption worth $40 million has been reported through various sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT), mainly linked with container clearance.
Chairman of the committee, Senator Faisal Vawda, stressed the need to vacate encroached land.
“We have received information that 239 containers are delayed at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), mainly due to customs delays, and it is estimated that corruption worth approximately $40m annually is linked to container clearance,” he said. He added that informants have alleged that Rs112,000 in bribes is taken per container.
The committee directed the KICT to clear the backlog and eliminate corruption.
Senator Vawda also raised concerns regarding the Fisheries Harbour Authority, stating that transparency is lacking and significant land mismanagement has taken place at Korangi Fisheries.
Senator Rubina Qaim Khani pointed out that the KPT faces dwell time issues in container clearance.
Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar told the committee that it is not possible to eliminate all systemic issues at once, but the ministry is adopting a step-by-step approach.

Arabia, Somalia ink defence agreement</strong></a><br><p>MOGADISHU: Somalia and Saudi Arabia signed a defence agreement, as the Horn of Africa becomes an arena for proxy wars between Gulf monarchies, with Abu Dhabi at loggerheads with Riyadh.
The region, strategically located between the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal on one of the world’s busiest trade routes, has increasingly attracted the interest of the Gulf states.
The agreement comes a month and a half after Israel recognised Somaliland, a self-proclaimed republic that seceded from Somalia in 1991 but which Mogadishu still considers to be under its control.
Somali Defence Minister Ahmed Moallim Fiqi and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Khalid Bin Salman, signed a “military cooperation agreement” on Monday, according to a message on X from the Somali defence ministry.







“This agreement further strengthens defence and military cooperation between the two nations, while covering various areas of mutual interest for both countries,” it said.
In a separate post on X, Prince Khalid Bin Salman said he had “signed and witnessed the signing” of “several” agreements on the sidelines of a military exhibition in Riyadh. He did not provide further details.







Meanwhile, in Somaliland, the Emirati giant DP World has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the deep-water port of Berbera, which it uses with little regard for the government in Mogadishu. This port includes an airport strictly controlled by Abu Dhabi, according to several witnesses and local sources. Saudi Arabia, once a staunch ally of Abu Dhabi, is now a vocal critic of the UAE, particularly on the Sudanese and Yemeni issues.

ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday strongly condemned the recent suicide attack in Tarlai, demanding a thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation to bring the perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism to justice.
Through a unanimously adopted resolution moved by PPP Senator Syed Wa­­qar Mehdi, the House urged the strengthening of intelligence coordination and security arrangements, especially in the federal capital and at sensitive locations.
The resolution condemned the suicide attack on civilians, stating it violates Islamic values, humanity, and Constitution. It expressed deep condolences to the victims’ families and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured.
The House paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies, emergency responders, and medical personnel for their prompt professional response. It also suspended its routine to discuss the tragedy, affirming national unity amidst a blackout on TV and the Senate’s YouTube stream.
However, the debate turned heated as opposition criticised Lahore’s Basant celebrations following major terror attacks in Balochistan and Islamabad.
With incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan facing accusations re­­garding the resettlement of the Taliban in Pakistan, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called for a joint session of parliament. He demanded that the former military and spying age­ncy chiefs be summoned to explain who brought the Taliban back to the country.
Senator Abbas regretted the dances performed as part of Basant celebrations in Lahore while dozens of families mou­rned. “This cold-heartedness would only benefit the terrorists,” Abbas remarked.
He claimed timely hospital transfers could have saved lives. He argued that a collective funeral attended by the prime minister would have sent a necessary message of national unity.
PTI’s parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the Tarlai tragedy had brought tears to the eyes of every citizen, reminding the House that the time for politics and excuses had already passed.
“This is the time for a decisive action,” he asserted, adding that Pakistan comes first.
Barrister Zafar emphasised that unity needs public trust, which the government undermines by opposing Imran Khan. He urged dismantling terrorist net­­works completely, not just isolated arrests.
“If Daesh or any other terrorist organisation is operating within the country, it must be dealt with immediately and decisively,” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman criticised federal ministers’ absence during the debate and praised the armed forces’ sacrifices, while condemning the opposition for setting conditions during a national crisis.
“What our army has done against terrorists, no other army in the world has done,” she said. Ms Rehman criticised Imran Khan for alleged sympathies with the Taliban, noting there was a reason many referred to him as “Taliban Khan”.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took strong exception to criticism directed at the armed forces.
“All of us politicians and parties have made mistakes. Our security agencies are fighting a war against terrorism. We have to stand firmly with our institutions,” the law minister said.
However, JUI-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman argued the nation could not be satisfied by simply blaming a neighbouring country. “We trained the youth under an institution and today we are calling them wrong,” he regretted. He contended that a policy distinction persisted where those who commit terrorism on institutional orders are considered “good Taliban”, while those who do not are labelled “bad Taliban”.
Framing of cultural event
Rejecting criticism of the cultural festival, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid framed the event as an act of defiance. “The terrorists want to make us mourn all the time but we will give a message to the terrorists, we will celebrate and destroy you,” he said.
However, the session ended in pandemonium when PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali chided the PTI over the May 9 incidents, leading to intense verbal clashes.
Lawmakers from both sides blamed one another for the ongoing menace of terrorism.

The head of state’s tightly secured, four-day visit was aimed at consoling Australia’s Jewish community in the wake of the December shooting at Sydney’s Bondi Beach that killed 15 people at a Hanukkah festival.
But he was met with protests in Australia’s two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne on Monday evening, with the Sydney rally turning violent as police hit protesters and members of the media with pepper spray.
The visit has attracted the ire of a large number of Australians, who accuse Herzog of being complicit in civilian deaths in Gaza.

Israeli president’s visit to Sydney sparks massive protests in two major cities

Pro-Palestine groups have organised protests in cities and towns across the country on Monday evening.
In Sydney, thousands gathered in a square in the city’s central business district, listening to speeches and shouting pro-Palestine slogans.
“The Bondi massacre was terrible but from our Australian leadership there’s been no acknowledgment of the Palestinian people and the Gazans,” said Jackson Elliott, a 30-year-old protester from Sydney.
“Herzog has dodged all the questions about the occupation and says this visit is about Australia and Israeli relations but he is complicit.”
There was a heavy police presence with a helicopter circling overhead and officers patrolling on horseback.
Pepper spray, arrests
Police repeatedly used tear gas and pepper spray to push back thousands of protesters who were trying to breach the line and march ahead. Several protesters were arrested as police claimed they clashed with the law enforcers.
Palestine Action Group
spokesman Josh Lees said on Instagram the police had repeatedly charged us with horses and pepper spray.
Thousands of people also gathered in the centre of Melbourne demanding an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.
New police powers
The New South Wales state government invoked new powers giving police greater powers to control demonstrations prior to the rally.
An attempt by protesters to overturn those powers in the state’s Supreme Court failed just before the rally began, local media reported.
Not far from the protests, Herzog took part in an event on Monday evening titled “An Evening of Light and Solidarity” for the victims of the December 14 killings.
Earlier, the Israeli president paid homage to the victims under rain and grey skies as he laid a wreath outside the beachside Bondi Pavilion.
The UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry found last year that Herzog was liable for prosecution for inciting genocide after he said all Palestinians — an entire nation — were responsible for the Hamas attack on Israel.

But a demand from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar for him to quit, and the departure of a second senior aide in as many days ,did little to stop the questions over his judgement and ability to govern.
Earlier on Monday, the British leader sought to raise spirits and encourage unity when he addressed staff at his Downing Street office, and he later received messages of support from his top ministers and some potential leadership rivals.
Tim Allan, 10 Downing Street’s communications chief, said he was resigning to make way for a new team to support the PM, a day after Starmer’s closest aide Morgan McSweeney stepped down over Mandelson’s ties to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Police probe whether Andrew passed secret info to Epstein; Kensington Palace says ‘deeply concerned’ by revelations

But Sarwar, speaking in Scotland where Labour has seen its support slump since the 2024 election, said it was with a heavy heart that he had to call for a change of leader in London.
“The distraction needs to end and the leadership in Downing Street has to change,” he told a press conference.
In response, a Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer had “a clear five-year mandate from the British people to deliver change, and that is what he will do”.
Did Andrew share secrets?
Amid the troubles facing the Labour government, Thames Valley Police are said to be assessing a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, over the alleged sharing of confidential material by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with Jeffrey Epstein, BBC News reported.
According to emails recently released by the US government, a sender thought to be the former prince passed on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
According to material seen by the BBC, the emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.
After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.
William in S. Arabia
Meanwhile, Prince William began his first official visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, aimed at deepening economic cooperation but already overshadowed by his disgraced uncle Andrew’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.
Ahead of his arrival in Riyadh, Kensington Palace broke years of silence over Andrew’s links to Epstein by saying William and his wife Catherine were “deeply concerned by the continuing revelations”.
The short statement, which did not directly reference the ex-prince, came as the monarchy faces renewed pressure over allegations stemming from the tarnished royal’s ties to Epstein.

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.
The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who returned in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.
The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.
Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.
“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.
“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.
Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.
‘Justice’
Hasina was overthrown on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.
The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.
“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.
“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.
“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”
‘Long live the revolution’
Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.
“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.
“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.
“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”

ISLAMABAD: In a rapid move, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
The contractual changes were introduced through a predetermined set of regulations that had been published as draft for public opinion but were notified without any change after a public hearing. The notification effectively terminates the existing net-metering regime and replaces it with net-billing for all.
As a result, earlier public pronouncements by officials and ministers that the terms of contracts with existing prosumers would remain unchanged until completion of their seven-year terms have proven incorrect. Under the new regulations, the existing registered prosumers will be shifted immediately to net-billing instead of net-metering, and their export units will be credited for one month only instead of the current three months. All other existing terms will remain unchanged until expiry of their seven-year contracts.
New prosumers will be granted only five-year contracts, and their export units will be accepted at Rs11 per unit compared to Rs26 under the existing contracts. Consumers’ import units from distribution companies (Discos) will now be billed separately at Rs37-55 per unit, depending on the relevant slab, excluding taxes, surcharges and duties.
Surplus generation exported to Discos will be calculated separately — at Rs26 per unit for existing and around Rs10 per unit for future prosumers. The net difference will be billed to consumers, unlike the existing system of unit-for-unit exchange in import and export.

 

Nepra held a marathon public hearing on Friday evening but restricted dozens of relevant consumers, independent think tanks and business representatives from suggesting alternative solutions. By the afternoon of the first working day, the regulator notified the same draft without changing a single clause, indicating a predetermined conclusion.
Earlier, the Power Division had proposed similar changes multiple times but withdrew after public criticism over unilateral changes to consumer-financed contracts under a properly announced renewable policy in 2015.
Both the government side and the regulator have blamed prosumers with higher-than-approved solar capacity and non-metered solar homeowners for grid challenges and higher capacity charges. However, the new regulations appear silent on both counts.
The Power Division claimed on-grid (metered) solar capacity had reached 7,000MW and off-grid exceeded 13,000MW. The power minister said millions of consumers had installed hybrid systems without meters to remain in subsidised categories, pushing capacity beyond 19,000MW outside metering. The new rules target only metered solar consumers.
Under the regulations, at the end of each billing cycle following the interconnection of a distributed generation facility, Discos will raise bills after accounting for electricity generated and consumed by the prosumer “under a net-billing arrangement”. Units supplied by Discos to prosumers will be billed at the applicable tariff (Rs37-55 per unit excluding taxes), while units supplied by prosumers to Discos will be billed at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
Net-billing means electricity generated by a prosumer’s distributed facility is purchased by Disco, and a bill is raised on consumption at Rs37-55 per unit after credit for electricity supplied by the prosumer at NAEPP. “In case the billed amount of the units supplied by prosumers exceeds the billed amount of units supplied by Disco, the net billed amount shall be credited against the prosumer’s next billing cycle or shall be paid by the licensee to the prosumer quarterly,” Nepra stated. Discos, however, have not made such payments in the past.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will not be allowed to install solar systems for net-metering beyond their original sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Existing prosumers’ contracts will remain valid until expiry of their current seven-year term, after which they may request a five-year extension, subject to Discos’ willingness. The new regulations apply to systems ranging from one kilowatt to one megawatt (1kW to 1MW) under Nepra’s direct regulatory and licensing domain.
At present, consumers below 25kW are licensed directly by Discos.
The solar regulation changes have been notified despite Nepra itself repeatedly blaming power companies for unaffordable and inefficient supplies.
“Compounded by heavy taxes, levies and surcharges, particularly the Debt Servicing Surcharge, these factors collectively inflate electricity costs for consumers. The result is a shifting of consumers towards decentralised or off-grid solutions, further weakening demand for grid-based electricity,” Nepra said recently.
The regulator stated that the new prosumer regulations provide clearer procedures, stricter technical requirements and a shift in billing methodology, aiming to better integrate small-scale generation into the national grid while safeguarding system stability.
Another restriction is a capacity cap at the transformer level. Discos are barred from entertaining new applications if the cumulative distributed generation capacity connected to a particular distribution transformer reaches 80pc of its rated capacity, to avoid overloading and technical instability in local distribution networks.

“The operating environment continues to recover, but only gradually, supported by the country’s slowly improving economic and fiscal outlook, and strengthening external position”, the New York-based one of the top three global rating agencies said. “However, banks’ financial performance will be stable over the next 12-18 months as they continue to face asset quality and profitability challenges,” it added.
The bank sector outlook aligns with that of the Government of Pakistan (Caa1 stable), given banks’ substantial holdings of government securities, which account for around half of total banking assets.
“Pakistan’s long-term debt sustainability remains uncertain, because of its still weak fiscal position, high liquidity and external vulnerability risk”, the agency said and estimated real GDP growth of around 3.5pc for 2026, up from 3.1pc in 2025, supported by ongoing reforms that are improving confidence and gradually strengthening economic activity.

Moody’s flags high exposure to govt securities as a key risk

The improving economic outlook and lower inflation have contributed to easing monetary policy rates. Lower borrowing costs will boost credit demand and keep problem loan ratios broadly unchanged. At the same time, margins will remain steady after a decline following rate cuts, but higher business volumes, non-interest income and stable costs will support profits and safeguard capital buffers.
It was observed that last year’s floods could weigh on agricultural output, but activity in the industrial and services sectors should remain robust. The improving economic outlook and lower inflation have contributed to easing monetary policy rates. “We expect inflation to rise to around 7.5pc in 2026, in part due to base effects”, it said.
Moody’s highlighted banks’ high exposure to government securities as a key risk. Exposure to government securities amounts to around half of banks’ total assets and around 9.4 times their equity, which links their credit strength to that of the Caa1-rated sovereign.
It noted that sector-wide nonperforming loan ratios spiked at the beginning of 2025 following the removal of the advances-to-deposits ratio (ADR) tax, prompting banks to reduce their loan books. Although loans accounted for only 23pc of banks’ total assets as of September 2025, there could be double-digit credit growth in 2026, supported by improving macroeconomic conditions. Borrower delinquencies will persist nonetheless, particularly in more vulnerable sectors such as agriculture and energy, but lower borrowing costs and higher credit demand will maintain broadly stable problem loan ratios.
Although financing growth will rise in 2026 on the back of lower rates, Pakistani banks will continue to increase their holdings of government securities, which do not carry any risk-weighting, further supporting capital metrics. “We expect banks to maintain high dividend payout ratios, but retained earnings — despite slight margin compression — will be sufficient to fund balance sheet growth and maintain capital ratios”, it said, adding that problem loans were fully covered by loan loss reserves, providing additional capital protection.
Lending volumes and non-interest income will offset margin squeeze, Moody’s said and expected Pakistani banks to deliver an average return on assets of around 1.1pc in 2026. Banks will exhibit modest margin compression as the pace of rate cuts slows, while funding costs remain broadly stable, following the removal of the regulatory minimum deposit rate (MDR) previously applied to corporate and institutional deposits.
However, higher business activity and lending volumes, coupled with non-interest income, will balance tighter margins and preserve banks’ operating revenue. A potential deterioration in the loan book would push loan-loss provisioning costs up from low levels, while lower inflation will reduce the strain on operating costs. Elevated taxes will continue to weigh on bottom-line profitability. Funding and liquidity will remain sound.
Pakistani banks are predominantly deposit-funded, with customer deposits accounting for 63pc of total assets as of September 2025, supported by financial inclusion initiatives, strong remittance inflows from non-residents as well as digitalisation efforts. However, competition for low-cost deposits has increased within the system, which has resulted in a rise in banks’ funding costs and migration to savings and time deposits. Positively, banks exhibit limited reliance on market funding, with net loans representing 35.6pc of customer deposits and less-stable funds accounting for 30.6pc of tangible banking assets as of September 2025.

The two — 24-year-old Sadia and her 10-month-old daughter Rida — had fallen into the sewer at the site of the under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhati Gate on January 28. While the woman’s body was found late at night, the same day, the child’s body was recovered the next day. Subsequently, three officials of the contractor working on the project were arrested along with two others.
Magistrate Shafqat Abbas conducted Monday’s proceedings after police presented the suspects before the court on the expiry of their physical remand.
The suspects included Project Manager Asghar Sandhu, contractor company’s chief executive officer Salman Yasin, Site In-charge Hunzala, Ahmed Nawaz, and Daniyal.
Sajid Hussain, the father of the deceased woman, and her husband, Murtaza, the complainant, also appeared before the court.
Both informed the court that they did not wish to pursue further legal action against the suspects and had no objection to their acquittal or discharge from the case.
In light of the complainant’s statement, the magistrate approved the post-arrest bail applications of the suspects and directed them to furnish surety bonds of Rs50,000 each.
It is worth mentioning that at the previous hearing, the defence counsel told the court that the company’s owner had voluntarily surrendered to the police and presented a cheque of Rs10 million for the aggrieved family.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09184932b79ce1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972072/former-ihc-judge-tariq-mehmood-jahangiri-challenges-removal-in-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Former IHC judge Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri challenges removal in FCC</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri moved the Federal Constitutional Court on Monday against his removal.
He was removed as an IHC judge in December last year by President Asif Ali Zardari in compliance with an order by the high court, which declared that his elevation was “without lawful authority”.
A division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan had announced the verdict on a plea challenging the validity of Jahangiri’s law degree and, by extension, his appointment as a high court judge.
On Monday, Jahangiri filed a plea in the FCC through his lawyer, Salahuddin Ahmed. The federation of Pakistan, the president of Pakistan, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, the parliamentary committee (defunct) for the appointment of judges to superior courts, the Higher Education Commission, the University of Karachi (KU) and lawyer Mian Dawood were named as respondents. Dawood had approached the courts over Jahangiri’s appointment.
The petition, seen by Dawn, contended that an “orchestrated campaign” against Jahangiri had culminated in the removal of a constitutionally appointed high court judge. But, it continued, the development was not a “personal tragedy” for Jahangiri.
“He is satisfied with the public service he has rendered and his adherence to the dictates of his conscience and his constitutional oath,” the plea said, adding that the development, however, was “a mortal blow to the independence of the judiciary as enshrined in the very preamble and Articles 2-A, 37 and 175 of the Constitution”.
If not remedied, it “shall surely serve as a grim lesson for serving and future judges”, the plea stated.
The plea further stated that the IHC order that led to Jahangiri’s removal “proceeds on certain assumptions as opposed to appreciating the record that was before the court to determine whether” he met the constitutional qualifications to become a judge.
“The impugned order incorrectly assumes that the petitioner was ‘not holding a valid LLB degree, which is a prerequisite for enrollment as an advocate’,” plea said.
It further quoted the IHC order as stating that when Jahangiri “could not be considered as an advocate, then consequently he was not eligible for elevation as a judge of a high court in terms of the requirements of Article 175-A of the Constitution“.
But, the plea contended, the requirements for the appointment of a high court judge were described in Article 193 of the Constitution and not Article 175-A.
And the said requirements did not list the LLB degree as one of the requirements, it added.
Moreover, from the date of the issuance of the IHC order till the passing of Jahangiri’s plea in the FCC, there had been no declaration by any competent authority or court of law that declared his degree invalid, the petition further stated.
It said KU, which awarded Jahangiri his law degree, had taken the position before the IHC that the degree was declared invalid for the first time in 2024.
“Consequently, the assumption in the impugned order that the petitioner did not possess a valid degree at the time of his elevation is completely contrary to the record that was placed before the court. At no stage, any party before the court asserted that Jahangiri’s degree was invalid in the year 2020 when he was considered for elevation.”
The plea further contended that IHC order relied on the university’s declaration that the degree was invalid. But the declaration, the plea argued, had no legal effect as it had been suspended by the Sindh High Court.
And not just that, the order “also proceeds to give the declaration a retrospective effect”.
The petition further argued that the IHC division bench did not have the “jurisdiction to make any declarations regarding the validity of Jahangiri’s degree. Consequently, it proceeded to make assumptions regarding the validity of his degree.”
Moreover, the bench also made assumptions regarding Jahangiri’s licence as an advocate, the plea said.
“It asserts that Jahangiri ‘could not have been considered as an advocate’.”
But, it was a matter of record that the relevant bar council was present before the IHC and repeatedly asserted that the petitioner was their licencee and no complaint had ever been received regarding the his licence.
“The representatives of the bar council urged the court to summon the record of the bar council … The bench, instead of relying on the record of the bar council, deemed it appropriate to assume that Jahangiri could not have been considered as an advocate.”
The plea argued that the order, “being solely based on assumptions and conjectures is unconstitutional, devoid of any constitutional basis and coherence, and beyond the quo warranto jurisdiction of the high court”.
It further said: “Indeed, in the present case, it is not even disputed that Jahangiri fulfilled the constitutional qualifications prescribed by Article 193 for appointment as a judge (namely, that he has been an advocate of the high courts for more than 10 years and is over the age of 45). Rather, it is alleged (which allegations are factually disputed) that the petitioner was wrongly awarded an LLB degree (and hence was wrongly enrolled as an advocate of the high courts). Clearly, such factual disputes lie beyond the limited purview of quo warranto proceedings and require a full-fledged trial.
“Moreover, even KU proceedings through which the LLB degree of Jahangiri was withdrawn/ cancelled presently stand suspended.”
The plea also recalled that the IHC had not heard Jahangiri on the maintainability of the petition challenging his degree and had over-ruled office objections raised on it, declaring it maintainable without issuing a pre-admission notice to the former IHC judge.
“It is, of course, well-settled that the overruling of office objections does not preclude the court from examining the issue of maintainability subsequently nor does it prohibit a litigant from raising the question of maintainability (especially when he has not been heard in this regard). On this ground alone, the IHC order is liable to be set aside.”
The petition also contended the proceedings before the division bench were “vitiated by bias”, adding that the IHC order was “legally and constitutionally unsustainable as Jahangiri had been denied due process and a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution”.
“In particular, he was deprived of a fair trial and impartial tribunal; an opportunity to be heard on legal maintainability; and a reasonable opportunity to file a reply” to Dawood’s plea and address the merits of that case, the plea stated.
It also contended that the IHC lacked the jurisdiction to determine the validity of KU’s proceedings regarding Jahangiri.
“It was only the SHC that could do so and it had, already, suspended KU’s declaration cancelling/ withdrawing Jahangiri’s degree and LLB results as well as prior proceeding,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09213643a1077dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972085/khawaja-asif-stresses-need-for-national-identity-as-na-passes-resolution-condemning-islamabad-suicide-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif stresses need for national identity as NA passes resolution condemning Islamabad suicide attack</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday stressed the need for a national identity as the National Assembly passed a resolution condemning the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad.
Speaking on the floor of the house, Asif said, “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees.”
Talking about terrorism, he said, “The spike in terrorism in the country; I am sad to say that we are not even united in the condemnation of terrorism.”
He said that in order to protect political interests, some refrained from attending the funerals of martyrs.
“At least on national issues — all of us sitting here, regardless of which party they belong to … this is one thing on which there needs to be consensus on and that is Pakistan and its integrity as well as respect for those sacrificing their lives,” he said.
In his remarks, the minister said that two dictators in the past had joined the war in Afghanistan to please a superpower. He said terrorism was a blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past.

 

The minister said religious hatred was being fanned in Pakistan under an international conspiracy. He said the last four presidents of the United States were responsible for the killings of millions of Muslims.
“But we always try to get support from the world powers,” he added.
He said India was sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, adding that it was the need of the hour that all Pakistanis be united to foil India’s plan.
He said that the Afghan government in the past had agreed with Pakistan’s stance but now were reluctant to give any guarantee for controlling terrorism.
“Now, India is using Afghan terrorists against us. India is fighting a proxy war in Pakistan,” he added.
He said there were differences among our religious sects which could be sorted out in Parliament instead of in mosques and imambargahs.
“Let us make this parliament functional in a real manner,” he added.
“History gives us an opportunity for course correction but we have to be loyal to the Constitution. All issues can be resolved here. All problems can be addressed if our politics becomes subservient to the state. Our loyalties to the motherland should not be conditional,” he said.
Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai, in his speech, said that a three-day debate should be held on terrorism. He said all stakeholders should sit together to find solutions to the problems plaguing the country.
He also offered unconditional support to the government for strengthening Parliament.
“If today we decide that Parliament will be the hub of power and all decisions will be taken here, all our problems will be resolved,” he added.
He also urged the government to ask the United Nations secretary general to hold an international conference on Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the NA also passed a resolution condemning the suicide bombing at the imambargah.
The resolution — tabled by PML-N lawmaker Hameed Hussain — called the attack “a direct attack on the Constitution of Pakistan, religious freedom, national security and interfaith harmony”.
“This house demands that the suicide bombers, facilitators, planners and patrons involved in this incident be exposed and brought to justice,” it said.
It further demanded indiscriminate action be taken against banned organisations and their networks, social media propaganda and public activities.







“Effective and permanent arrangements should be made for the security of places of worship, especially mosques and imambargahs,” the resolution added.
“Immediate and adequate financial assistance should be provided to the families of martyrs, while the injured should be provided with the best medical facilities,” it further demanded.
The resolution further called for an effective counterterrorism strategy at the national level, which should be practically implemented by authorities.
“This house reiterates its resolve that terrorism, sectarianism and hate-based violence will not be tolerated in Pakistan, and will ensure the protection of lives and property of the citizens at all costs,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0919162606f69a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.
At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.







Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.
“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.
Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.
“Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi sahib; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.
In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.
“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.
Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.
Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.
“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.
“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.
The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.
“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.
When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was sold for Rs1.85bn.
To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.
“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.
Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.
Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their website, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.
The Multan franchise, started in 2017, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, winning the league in 2021.
Last November, the franchise was left ownerless after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would take over the franchise for the upcoming tournament.
Bids were invited on January 14 and their technical evaluation was completed by February 3.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/092320265cdc3e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup match against India, govt announces</strong></a><br><p>The government announced on Monday that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.
The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC arrived in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.
In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.







“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.
It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.
“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.
“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.
“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.
“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.
Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game on hai (the game is on)!”
“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.







Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.







“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.
Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to play match
Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.
“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.







The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.
“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not cancelling the tour of Pakistan,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.
Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run PTV on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.
He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.
“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.







Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.
“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.
No penalty on Bangladesh for opting out of World Cup: ICC
Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.
In a statement, the ICC said that it had concluded an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.
“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.







The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.
Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.
It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.
The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.
“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.
The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.
Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.
“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.
It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.
“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read
ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.
“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.
He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.
Earlier this month, the government had given the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1000015537caa75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972093/iran-says-it-could-dilute-enriched-uranium-if-all-sanctions-are-lifted' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says it could dilute enriched uranium if all sanctions are lifted</strong></a><br><p>Iran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted, its atomic chief said on Monday, one of the most direct indications so far of its position at talks with Washington.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks through Omani mediators in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after US President Donald Trump positioned a naval flotilla in the region, raising fears of new military action.
The talks follow a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in Iran last month.
Trump joined an Israeli bombing campaign last year and hit Iranian nuclear sites. He also threatened last month to intervene militarily during the protests, but ultimately held off.
Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile — estimated last year by the UN nuclear agency at more than 440 kilogrammes — of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90pc that is considered weapons grade.
The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said on Monday: “The possibility of diluting 60pc enriched uranium … depends on whether, in return, all sanctions are lifted or not”.
Eslami, whose remarks were reported by Iran’s ISNA news agency, said, however, that another proposal, sending Iran’s highly enriched uranium abroad to another country, had not been discussed at the talks with US officials.
Khamenei adviser to visit Oman
Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and secretary of its national security council, will visit Oman on Tuesday following the US-Iranian talks there, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
“During this trip, (Larijani) will meet with high-ranking officials of the Sultanate of Oman and discuss the latest regional and international developments and bilateral cooperation at various levels,” Tasnim said.
The date and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be announced.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that a new round of talks would be “an appropriate opportunity for a fair and balanced resolution of this case,” and that a desired outcome could be reached if the US avoids maximalist positions and respects its commitments.
Iran would continue to demand the lifting of sanctions and insist on its nuclear rights, including enrichment, he said.
Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process breaking down mainly due to disputes over uranium enrichment inside Iran.
Since Trump struck Iran’s facilities, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity. It has always said its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
The United States wants to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out.
In a televised statement aired on Monday, Khamenei called on Iranians to participate in the coming anniversary of the 1979 revolution.
“The presence of the people in the march and their expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will cause the enemy to stop coveting Iran,” Khamenei said.</p><small>2026-02-09 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09212947e3ae7fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972077/death-toll-from-suicide-attack-on-imambargah-in-islamabad-reaches-38-hospital-data-shows' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from suicide attack on imambargah in Islamabad reaches 38, hospital data shows</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Data from hospitals showed that the death toll of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad reached 38 on Monday.
Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that 33 people were killed in the attack while more than 150 were injured. However, hospital records show that the toll has increased.
On the day of the incident, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil said that 28 dead bodies were brought to the hospital. On the other hand, Polyclinic said that four dead bodies were brought to the hospital, which added up to 32 deaths, as reported by the media.
A day later, on Saturday, the Pims Spokesperson confirmed that a patient had died. The same day, it was also learnt that some of the injured were shifted to the HBS Institute of Healthcare and Allied Health Sciences, out of which three had died.
The hospital’s representative, Dr Riaz Janjua, told Dawn that three deaths were reported at his hospital. He informed that as many as 67 injured were brought to the medical facility.
Therefore, with the addition of three deaths at the private hospital, the death toll reached 36.
On Monday, two more deaths were confirmed; one of the injured died at Polyclinic while another, who was shifted from Pims to a private hospital, also breathed his last, taking the toll to 38.
Moreover, a document from Polyclinic shows that five deaths involving the incident have been recorded so far, with the first four being on Friday and the latest on Monday. The document also showed that seven patients were in critical condition and one was on the ventilator.
According to the Pims spokesperson, 40 of those injured were still being treated at the hospital. Out of these, seven were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She said that 29 deaths had been recorded at the hospital so far.
Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah was the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration.

 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that four facilitators behind the incident, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2026-02-09 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09204222f8f70ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972080/t20-world-cup-all-the-pressure-on-pakistan-says-usa-leg-spinner-mohammad-mohsin' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: ‘All the pressure’ on Pakistan, says USA leg-spinner Mohammad Mohsin</strong></a><br><p>USA leg-spinner Mohammad Mohsin said on Monday that “the pressure will be on Pakistan” when the teams lock horns in the T20 World Cup again, two years after the Americans inflicted a shock defeat on the former champions.
But Pakistan quick bowler Salman Mirza insisted the stunning super over defeat in Dallas in the 2024 T20 World Cup would be firmly “in the past” when the two clash in Colombo on Tuesday.
The USA team gave tournament favourites India a big scare in their opening match in Mumbai, reducing them to 77-6 at one point, with Mohsin taking a wicket on his T20 World Cup debut, before losing by 29 runs.
They are confident they can repeat their stunning upset of two years ago in the Group A encounter.
“The pressure of losing the last game will be on Pakistan,” said Mohsin.
Born and brought up playing cricket in Pakistan, Mohsin migrated to the US five years ago and warned that the USA was a better team now than two years ago.
“I have played with most of the players in this Pakistan team, so I have given my input to the team and we are a more skilled and confident team.”
Mirza was confident the last defeat would not prey on the Pakistan players’ minds.
“Winning and losing are part of the game; it happens in cricket,” Mirza said. “The defeat against the USA is now past and behind us.”
Pakistan, the 2009 champions, were close to suffering another shock in their opening match against the Netherlands on Saturday.
Pakistan were staring at defeat with 29 runs needed in the last two overs but all-rounder Faheem Ashraf’s big hitting bailed them out.
Pakistan cannot afford any slip-ups if they are to qualify for the super eight stage as one of the top two teams in Group A after saying they would not play India on February 15.
Defeat to the USA two years ago saw them fail to get out of the group.
Mirza admitted the smaller teams were dangerous opponents.
“Until now, all the matches are close and no team is small or big in this format,” said Mirza, who took 3-24 against the Netherlands.

Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles who had already been cast out of the royal inner circle over his close relationship with Epstein, has faced fresh scrutiny since the recent publication of millions of new documents relating to the late convicted US sex offender.
While Charles and his wife Camilla said in October that their thoughts and sympathies were with the victims and survivors of abuse, Monday’s comment by the Prince and Princess of Wales is the most pointed message so far delivered by the royal family on the Epstein scandal.
“I can confirm the prince and princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations,” a spokesperson for William and Kate told reporters ahead of the prince’s arrival in Riyadh for a high-profile trip. “Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”
Mountbatten-Windsor, 65, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has faced years of scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein, and in 2022 settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre which accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. Giuffre died by suicide in April.
He has always denied any wrongdoing and not responded to requests for comment since the latest release of Epstein files, but his relationship with Epstein has cost him his role in the royal family, titles and home.
He was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 and in October Charles removed his title of prince. Last week, he was forced to move out of his royal mansion.
In the latest batch of files released in the US, emails suggest he shared official British trade documents with Epstein in 2010, after Epstein’s conviction for child sex crimes, leaking information from his then-official role as a government envoy.
The documents appear to show that Andrew forwarded Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places that he had been sent in relation to an official trip.
Trade envoys are usually barred from sharing sensitive or commercial documents under strict confidentiality rules.
Police say ‘assessing’ accusation of misconduct
British police said officers were “assessing” accusations of misconduct in public office against Andrew after emails emerged showing the ex-UK trade envoy may have passed potentially confidential reports to Epstein.
“We can confirm receipt of this report and are assessing the information in line with our established procedures,” a spokesperson for Thames Valley Police, west of London, said in a statement.
Anti-monarchy activist Graham Smith, who heads the pressure group Republic, said earlier on Monday he had filed the police report after the emails were among US government files on the late US sex offender Epstein released last month.
Thames Valley Police said last week they were reviewing a new allegation against Andrew involving a woman being taken to an address in Windsor in light of the latest Epstein files.
Over the last 10 days, revelations from the Epstein files have engulfed British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in what is widely viewed as the biggest crisis of his premiership.
Starmer appointed an acquaintance of Epstein, Peter Mandelson, as ambassador to the United States.
Like Andrew, it appears that Mandelson also shared sensitive government files from 2009 and 2010 with Epstein and police are investigating claims of misconduct in public office.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09183501f273bd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972071/india-says-it-will-maintain-multiple-sources-of-energy-supply' target='_blank'><strong>India says it will maintain multiple sources of energy supply</strong></a><br><p>India plans to maintain multiple sources of energy supply and diversify them when needed as New Delhi looks to ensure consumers receive “adequate energy at the right price through reliable and secure supplies”, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Monday.
Misri was responding to a question at a media briefing seeking clarity on India’s position on the purchase of Russian oil after US President Donald Trump said last week that New Delhi had “committed to stop directly or indirectly” importing it.
“India’s priority is to safeguard the interests of its consumers through an energy policy driven by adequate availability, fair pricing, and reliability of supply,” Misri said.
He added that India was neither dependent on any single source for crude oil nor did it “intend to be”, importing from a “mix of sources” depending on “objective market conditions”, adding that “national interests” guide both the government and Indian energy companies.
Last week, Trump signed an executive order lifting the punitive 25% tariff on all imports from India over its purchase of Russian oil.
The Kremlin earlier said it saw nothing new in India’s announcement that it would diversify its energy sourcing.

At the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on Friday, Thomas DiNanno, the US under secretary of state for arms control, accused China of conducting the tests, including one on 22 June, 2020, and of preparing for more tests with massive yields.
“The US allegations are completely groundless and are outright lies. China firmly opposes the US attempt to fabricate excuses for its own restarting of nuclear tests,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement to AFP on Monday.
It also urged the US to “immediately stop its irresponsible actions”.
US President Donald Trump said in October that Washington would start testing nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Moscow and Beijing, but without elaborating or explaining what kind of nuclear testing he wanted to resume.

 

DiNanno’s comments came as he was presenting a new US plan calling for three-way talks with Russia and China to set new limits on nuclear weapons, after the expiration of New START — the last treaty between top nuclear powers Washington and Moscow, which expired last Thursday.
China has already rejected joining disarmament negotiations “at this stage”.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0917242785c7a54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972067/omar-ayub-ali-amin-gandapur-declared-absconders-in-haqeeqi-azadi-march-case' target='_blank'><strong>Omar Ayub, Ali Amin Gandapur declared absconders in ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’ case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A judicial magistrate on Monday declared two PTI leaders — former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur and ex-National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub — absconders in two case pertaining to the party’s 2022 ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’.
The march is one of several protests that the party has carried out following the ouster of PTI founder Imran Khan as the prime minister through a no-confidence vote in 2022.
Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti heard the two cases related to the protest, registered at Islamabad’s Bara Kahu police station, declaring Ayub and Gandapur absconders and issuing their perpetual arrest warrants over their persistent absence from hearings.
Judge Chishti observed that the two had failed to appear before the court despite the issuance of summons multiple times. They also did not furnish any plausible justification for their absence, the judge noted.
They were summoned several times, but they continued to evade the proceedings, the judge remarked.
Making these observations, he declared both PTI leaders absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants for them so that they are presented before the court.
Over Gandapur and Ayub’s persistent absence from the proceedings, the court had formalised their status as proclaimed offenders at a previous hearing.
Meanwhile, the court had acquitted several others accused in the case, including PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Zartaj Gul, in the two cases on the basis of insufficient evidence to establish their involvement in the allegations levelled by the police.
According to the prosecution, the two cases were registered in connection with alleged violations of law and order during the ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’, with police claiming that the accused had incited people to commit unlawful activities and obstructed officials from performing their duties. The defence, however, had consistently maintained that the cases were politically motivated.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09171847b2b288f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972066/punjab-cm-lauds-authorities-on-organising-safe-basant' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM lauds authorities on organising ‘safe Basant’</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Monday praised authorities for organising a “safe Basant” festival over the weekend in Lahore.
In televised remarks, she expressed gratitude to various authorities for their arrangements and work during the three-day festival to make sure it was a success.
“I wish to praise all 15 departments of the Punjab government for arranging a safe Basant with a whole-of-government approach,” she said. She made special mention of Punjab Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem, Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Kamyana, Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations Faisal Kamran and their teams.
CM Maryam also expressed happiness that citizens followed standard operating procedures and installed “safety rods” on their bikes, aimed at preventing motorcyclists from suffering injuries caused by kite strings.
“It was a positive change for lots of people, where people saw that citizens in Lahore were abiding by the law and following safety protocols,” she added.
“It gave me hope that we can achieve our potential as a disciplined and law-abiding nation,” she said.
CM Maryam also stated that there was not a single death caused by injuries from kite strings during the festival.
“For the first time, not a single death from kite string injuries, such as throats being slit, was recorded during the festival,” she noted.
“There were some incidents; there were two electrocutions, where children climbed power pylons to retrieve kites. But it was the first Basant; it used to be called ‘Bloody Basant’ because so many people’s throats were slit with kite strings.”
CM Maryam also lauded the efforts of Lahore Commissioner Maryam Khan, as well as deputy and assistant commissioners, for real-time monitoring of violations throughout the festival.
“I would also like to thank the Punjab Information and Technology Board for using technology to make Basant easier for us to manage,” CM Maryam said.
She also thanked the traffic police for successfully managing heavy traffic inflows and the Punjab Horticulture Authority for their “beautiful arrangements”.
She also thanked the Lahore Electric Supply Company for ensuring teams were on standby to prevent accidents involving people recovering kites caught in power lines.
“After so many years, it brings me happiness to see positive headlines and a positive image of Punjab,” CM Maryam said.
“The world learned that Punjab has a storied history, culture and heritage,” she said.
She expressed happiness that Gen Z could leave behind their screens and gadgets, and experience the festival in an open atmosphere with their families.
“They have connected to their culture and history,” she stated. “The day is not far away when they will fully take pride in their history and culture and the confidence that comes with it.”
The chief minister added that people from all over Pakistan came to Lahore to participate in the festivities.
“Punjab is healing, Pakistan is healing”, she said. “People put aside their differences, their sorrow and their problems and celebrated as one nation.”
A day earlier, CM Maryam had lauded the people of Lahore for abiding by the standard operating procedures set by the provincial government.
However, on Saturday, it had emerged that the Punjab home department’s control room had received at least 118 Basant-related accident cases, including six casualties, during the first two days of the festival. The six casualties included four incidents of falling from rooftops and one each when young boys tried to climb an electric pole and a tree to catch kites.
Meanwhile, a young journalist also reportedly died after falling from the rooftop of his house in Sanda area on Sunday night.</p><small>2026-02-09 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0917115549a87c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972056/pakistan-to-invest-1bn-in-artificial-intelligence-by-2030-announces-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to invest $1bn in artificial intelligence by 2030, announces PM</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced the government’s plan to invest $1 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030.
The Indus AI Week 2026 is being held from February 9 to 15 (Sunday). The event’s website describes it as “Pakistan’s official national platform for artificial intelligence — where policy, innovation, talent and investment converge”.
“The government of Pakistan is committed to investing $1 billion in AI by 2030, which will go a long way in building an AI ecosystem in our country,” the premier said while addressing the event’s inauguration ceremony in Islamabad.



Announcing further steps the country aims to take to keep up with modern technologies, PM Shehbaz said an AI curriculum would be introduced “not only in all federally-controlled or -run schools but all schools” of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
He emphasised that the plan would be implemented in remote parts of Balochistan as well to “pair our youth for leadership and digital economy”.
The prime minister further said the government would provide 1,000 fully-funded PHD scholarships in AI to students across the country by 2030, which is aimed at building Pakistan’s “world-class research centre fully capacitated”.

 

“Last but not least, we will launch a nationwide programme to train 1 million non-IT professionals in AI skills, enabling them to enhance productivity and improving livelihoods,” he added.
“Pakistan is absolutely ready to accept the challenge and walk with our global partners, absolutely with great commitment and dedication,” PM Shehbaz affirmed.
He elaborated that agriculture and mines and minerals would be among the areas of focus, adding that the government aimed to empower the youth, which he said comprises 60 per cent of the country’s total population.
“We have to empower them with modern knowledge and modern techniques, and IT startups and IT technicians are already very concerned and feeling the heat and the challenge,” he noted, assuring them the government would bring programmes to “transform them from IT technicians to AI experts”.

 

He added this would unlock unprecedented gains in agricultural yield, quality and efficiency, as well as in industrial growth and women’s empowerment.
The government approved the National AI Policy in July 2025 to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services and open up new employment and innovation avenues.
However, the policy’s implementation has stalled more than six months after its approval due to a government decision to amend the composition of the AI Council and a lack of response from provincial governments.
The only pillar of the National AI Policy currently being implemented is creating “Awareness and Readiness”. Officials claim the Indus AI week is the first step in this regard.
‘Nothing short of a game-changer’
At the outset of his address, the premier noted that the Indus AI Week is “going to not only change the technological landscape of Pakistan, but this will be nothing short of a game-changer”.
“In collaboration with our most friendly and brotherly countries, we will start running on this shared pathway with great commitment and enthusiasm,” he added.







PM Shehbaz stressed that the government of his brother and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was “striving our best to be in line with modern requirements and meet modern challenges”.
He recalled that as the chief minister of Punjab back then, the government undertook various initiatives which were “very, very relevant and important to the promotion of education, health, revenues and encouraging our youth”.
The premier highlighted that the Punjab government initiated a laptop distribution scheme in 2010 in the province’s schools and colleges. He further mentioned that the government rolled out e-libraries and e-stamp papers, with the latter aimed at generating “additional revenue which was being siphoned off through collusion”.

 

PM Shehbaz also pointed out the computerisation of land records in Punjab carried out with “great partnership with World Bank, which eased out corrupt revenue officers”.
“They were carrying bags in their offices. They were tinkering with the record, and money was exchanged in hands. All of this was brought to a grinding halt through complete digitisation,” he asserted.
The prime minister highlighted that the country’s first Safe City project — which uses surveillance cameras to reduce crime — and the first IT university were established in Lahore.
“Here we are today, learning our lessons from the past and today Pakistan is absolutely ready on its toes to join the world in the field of AI interventions,” he affirmed.
PM Shehbaz also mentioned the digitalisation process of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), saying it was “almost transformed” at this point.
He said: “It’s doing a great job. We have controlled smuggling in Pakistan through various, most modern initiatives, bringing in scanners and other digital instruments which have been installed at various ports of Pakistan.
“We are recovering lost sums of money [and] tax evaded through collusion through these platforms.”
“Our commitment is solid, unwavering. We will never look back, we will keep on moving forward, marching forward till a point will soon come one day when Pakistan will find its destiny among the comity of nations.”
Addressing the event, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said Indus AI Week aimed to strengthen coordination between universities, governments and international companies, state-run APP reported.
She noted that the Pakistan Digital Authority was preparing a nationwide digital master plan to guide future transformation.
In his remarks, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal highlighted that the world had entered a moment where intelligence itself had become a factor of production, with nations competing on ideas, talent, data and technology rather than commodities.
He described AI as a bigger “disruptor” than electricity or the internet.
The minister stated that Pakistan’s engagement with technology began over two decades ago with early IT policies, the creation of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), and large-scale investment in advanced human capital.</p><small>2026-02-09 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0916190580344ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972062/8-muslim-nations-including-pakistan-warn-against-expansionist-israeli-policies-in-occupied-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>8 Muslim nations, including Pakistan, warn against ‘expansionist Israeli policies’ in occupied West Bank</strong></a><br><p>Eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, in a joint statement on Monday, warned against the “continued expansionist Israeli policies” in the occupied West Bank.
In the statement, the foreign minister of Pakistan — along with those of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Qatar — “condemned in the strongest terms the illegal Israeli decisions and measures aimed at imposing unlawful Israeli sovereignty, entrenching settlement activity, and enforcing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank, thereby accelerating attempts at its illegal annexation and the displacement of the Palestinian people”.







The statement comes a day after Israel’s security cabinet approved a series of steps that would make it easier for settlers in the occupied West Bank to buy land while granting Israeli authorities more enforcement powers over Palestinians, according to Israeli media.
Citing statements by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz, Israeli news sites Ynet and Haaretz said the measures included scrapping decades-old regulations that prevent Jewish private citizens buying land in the West Bank.
The statement issued on Monday by the eight Muslim countries reaffirmed that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory”.
“The ministers warned against the continued expansionist Israeli policies and illegal measures pursued by the Israeli government in the occupied West Bank, which fuel violence and conflict in the region,” the statement said.
The ministers expressed “absolute rejection” of Israel’s actions, which they maintained “constitute a blatant violation of international law, undermine the two-state solution, and represent an assault on the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to realise their independent and sovereign state”.
“Such actions also undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region,” the statement added.
The ministers also held that “these illegal measures in the occupied West Bank are null and void and constitute a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 2334, which condemns all Israeli measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character, and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967”.
In that regard, the ministers recalled the “2024 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which found that Israel’s policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territory and its continued presence is illegal, affirmed the necessity of ending the Israeli occupation, and the nullity of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.”
The ministers, in their statement, called on the international community to “fulfil its legal and moral responsibilities and to compel Israel to halt its dangerous escalation in the occupied West Bank and the inciting statements of its officials.”
“They stressed that the fulfilment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and statehood,” the ministers said.
They further underscored the need for the statehood to be “based on the two-state solution in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative,” which the minister said “remains the only path to achieving just and comprehensive peace that ensures security and stability in the region”.
It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
In a statement issued earlier this month, the eight nations had condemned the repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza by Israel, asserting that these actions risked undermining efforts for restoring stability at a time when regional and international partners were working collectively to advance the second phase of Trump’s plan.</p><small>2026-02-09 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09153211da62f8b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972060/ihcs-justice-minhas-questions-what-constitutes-fake-news-in-peca-amendments' target='_blank'><strong>IHC’s Justice Minhas questions what constitutes ‘fake news’ in Peca amendments</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday questioned the mechanism for determining what constitutes “fake news” in the amended Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The IHC judge made the remarks while hearing petitions filed by journalists’ bodies and senior journalists challenging the controversial amendments to Peca, which they argue curtail freedom of expression and vest excessive powers in the executive.
The petitions have been filed by senior journalist Hamid Mir, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association (IHCJA), and others.
During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner read out the added provisions of the amended law and contended that powers traditionally exercised by the judiciary had been transferred to the executive through the amendments.
The counsel argued that matters relating to the determination of false or fake information should be adjudicated by an independent judicial tribunal constituted in consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan, rather than by executive authorities.
Referring to Section 2C of the amended law, which deals with a ban on fake and false information on social media, Justice Minhas raised a series of critical questions.
“Who will decide whether the information is fake or false?” the judge asked, seeking clarification on the procedure and standards laid down in the law. “Explain how fake news will be determined. How will proceedings regarding fake news begin?” he further inquired.
In response, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that the amended law introduced a new mechanism for filing complaints, under which not only the aggrieved party but also a third party could initiate proceedings.
“This provision opens the door for proxies to file complaints, which will inevitably lead to misuse of the law,” the counsel argued. He added that it was essential to assess the actual harm caused by the alleged fake information, as not every incorrect statement amounted to disinformation.
“Fake information can also be the result of an error that does not cause harm to anyone,” he said.
During the proceedings, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists (RIUJ) President Asif Bashir Chaudhry also addressed the court.
He informed the bench that PFUJ had approached the court against Peca on February 6 last year, but the case had remained pending without any stay order.

 

He claimed that during this period, more than two dozen journalists had been sentenced to life imprisonment. He also referred to a case registered against a journalist who had reported the use of substandard materials in road construction, which later led to the road’s early demolition.
In response to the petition, Justice Minhas observed that the matter involved legislation enacted by parliament and reiterated that such a law could not be suspended through a restraining order at the interim stage.
“This is legislation. It cannot be suspended through an interim order,” the judge remarked, adding that the court would decide the matter after hearing detailed arguments from all sides.
The court subsequently adjourned the hearing until March 6.

 

Peca, since its introduction in 2016, has been widely criticised as a “black law” created mainly to punish dissent. Last year, new provisions in the law introduced harsher penalties for what the government considers “fake news”, the expansion of state oversight of digital platforms, and the creation of new regulatory bodies to monitor social media.
At the time of its passage, Amnesty International had warned that the proposed changes to the country’s cybercrime laws could “further tighten the government’s grip over Pakistan’s heavily controlled digital landscape” if enacted into law.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern that amendments “would curb fundamental rights.”
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting showed its concern over registration of cases against journalists under Peca and called for urgent action to address growing concerns of media persons regarding FIRs and arrests of journalists.</p><small>2026-02-09 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/091531559be72ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972054/around-a-million-children-missed-during-years-first-nationwide-polio-campaign-53000-refusals-reported' target='_blank'><strong>Around a million children missed during year’s first nationwide polio campaign; 53,000 refusals reported</strong></a><br><p>Around a million children were missed and 53,000 refusals were reported during the year’s first nationwide polio campaign.
The largest share of refusals, i.e. 58 per cent, was reported from Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. The campaign concluded on February 5 in most cities, while the campaign ran till February 8 in Sindh.
During the campaign, polio drops were administered to more than 44.3 million children, marking a significant milestone in Pakistan’s continued efforts to eradicate polio.
While the data shows that the polio programme achieved overall household coverage of 98pc, with 2pc children missed, the number of missed children is still huge and worrisome given Pakistan’s population.
Overall, 0.95m children were reported as missed during the campaign. A large proportion of these (0.67m) were missed because children were not available at home at the time of vaccination.
During the campaign, 2.5 million guest children were vaccinated, likely covering a substantial share of children recorded as not being available at home.
“233,000 children were reported as leftovers due to security constraints, community boycotts, and snow-bound areas,” an official of the programme said, wishing not to be quoted.
“Of the total leftovers, 184,000 were from KP, including 113,000 from south KP. In AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, around 50,000 children remained unreachable due to snow-bound areas and non-conduct of campaigns.”
“In Balochistan, the polio eradication campaign was postponed in Mastung, Gwadar, Chagai, and Awaran due to security reasons. 0.14pc of the total targeted children were reported as refusals, with 31,000 refusals from Karachi, forming the largest share,” the official added.
“The National Emergency Operation Center (EOC) extends its sincere appreciation to all relevant stakeholders for their cooperation, commitment, and active participation in ensuring the successful implementation of the campaign,” said a statement issued by the EOC.

 

The statement said that in Punjab, more than 22.9m children were vaccinated. In Sindh, over 10.5m children, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, more than 7.13 million and in Balochistan, over 2.36m children were vaccinated.
In Islamabad, more than 455,000, in Gilgit-Baltistan, approximately 261,000, and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, over 673,000 children were administered the drops.
The EOC further noted that the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 was conducted simultaneously in Pakistan and Afghanistan, reflecting strengthened cross-border coordination to interrupt poliovirus transmission and protect children in both countries.
“The Government of Pakistan reaffirmed its strong commitment to achieve a polio-free Pakistan through sustained immunisation efforts, community engagement, and regional collaboration,” the statement added.
Pakistan Polio Programme Head Anwarul Haq, while speaking to Dawn, said the positive development was that Pakistan reported fewer cases — 31 in 2025 compared with 74 in 2024.
“Moreover, in terms of poliovirus, Punjab is negative, Peshawar is negative, and Balochistan is also negative. We just need to focus more on some critical areas, namely Sindh and south KP,” he said.
Prime Minister’s Focal Person on Polio, Ayesha Raza Farooq, told Dawn that the post-campaign independent assessment was underway.
“It will take a week before results are compiled and the programme will share them with all the stakeholders,” she said.</p><small>2026-02-09 10:40</small></div><hr>
