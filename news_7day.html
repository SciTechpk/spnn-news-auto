Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed told Dawn.com, “Two policemen were martyred and one was injured in the attack.
“Terrorists launched the attack using hand grenades late at night, causing some damage to the checkpost,” he said, adding that the assailants were not able to cause significant destruction due to the prompt action of the police.
Some attackers fled after the attack, he said, adding that a search operation was underway.
Meanwhile, Regional Police Officer (RPO), Sajjad Khan, said in a statement that “several terrorists were killed and injured as the police retaliated against the attack.”
The attack occurred at the New Sabzi Mandi police checkpoint, in which advanced weaponry was used, he detailed.
“The timely response by the police prevented a potentially major loss,” it added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Earlier this month, a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.
Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu regional police officer, told Dawn.com that Police Constable Khanzeb was on his way to duty on a motorcycle when he was intercepted and targeted by unidentified assailants near the Asghar fuel station in the limits of Mandan police station.
In another incident, suspected terrorists attacked Utla police station in Swabi, injuring three police officers. The local people and police officials said that after the terrorists opened fire injuring three personnel, the police force also retaliated with full force.</p><small>2025-05-21 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21214722d37a0b5.jpg?r=214801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912383/efforts-continue-to-control-massive-wildfire-in-lower-dirs-adenzai-mountains' target='_blank'><strong>Efforts continue to control massive wildfire in Lower Dir’s Adenzai mountains</strong></a><br><p>A massive wildfire that erupted in the mountains of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Adenzai continued to spread on Wednesday, even as efforts were ongoing to put out the raging flames, which damaged precious forests in the last three days.
Pakistan has grappled with an unprecedented surge in forest fires in recent years. Provinces, including KP and Balochistan, have seen huge wildfires in the past three years.  Adenzai is a mountainous forest zone located in the Lower Dir district where a wildfire broke out in May last year as well and continued to burn for four to five days.
Shabir Ahmad Jan, divisional forest officer for Lower Dir, told Dawn.com that he, along with his team, civil defence volunteers and Rescue 1122 teams, was present and making efforts to extinguish the forest fire.
He told Dawn.com, “The team was using bushes and brooms to beat down the flames, creating a crossfire line by digging up the earth at a distance from the wildfire and throwing soil to smother the flames.”
Jan said the fire was likely set in the bushes and rapidly spread due to drought and scorching heat.
“The fire erupted in a 2.5-kilometre radius in three different places, Osakai, Asband and Kotigram. It is under control in Asband and efforts in the rest of two places continue,” he said.
Jan said that strong winds hampered the fire-dousing efforts. However, teams from Lower Dir, Upper Dir, Lower Swat, Upper Swat, Patrol Squad Malakand West and Dir Wildlife Divisions were called and collectively working to extinguish the flame.
He said announcements were also made in local mosques for help and about safety precautions, such as avoiding setting fire to bushes.
Bilal Ahmad Faizi, KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson, told Dawn.com that its district emergency officer and almost all department heads were present at the site of the fire and monitoring the extinguishing operation.
He said Rescue 1122 and forest department personnel had formed a crossfire line in the form of a starvation process, which can eliminate the risk of the fire spreading further.
Faizai said the fire was spread over the mountain range and despite strong winds, blazing flames and intense heat, Rescue 1122 personnel were busy extinguishing it.</p><small>2025-05-21 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21203202a075205.jpg?r=203342' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912411/us-army-to-change-transgender-soldiers-records-to-birth-sex' target='_blank'><strong>US Army to change transgender soldiers’ records to birth sex</strong></a><br><p>The US Army will alter the records of transgender soldiers to show only their sex at birth, according to internal guidance seen by Reuters that details a series of steps it will take as it pushes them out of the service.
“Commanders will take immediate measures to update personnel records and administrative systems to reflect biological sex for all individuals,” the 14-page memo stated.
The Army considered a person’s sex to be “unchanging during a person’s life,” it said, echoing a February 26 Pentagon memo.
The Army document illustrates how President Donald Trump’s administration intends to treat thousands of transgender troops after the Supreme Court’s ruling this month cleared the way for the Pentagon to implement a ban on their service.
Reuters first reported on May 8 the Pentagon’s plans to start kicking out transgender troops who do not elect to leave on their own by June 6 On May 12, it detailed plans to halt gender-affirming healthcare for transgender troops.
The Army could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Army’s latest memo detailed other steps beyond the records change to reflect the soldier’s sex at birth, alterations it said would be carried out by the Army’s Human Resources Command.
The Army document said that pronoun use when referring to individuals “must reflect their biological sex.” “In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as “sir” or “ma’am “),” the document stated.
It also stated that access to “intimate spaces” will be determined by an individual’s biological sex.
“Commanders will ensure all such shared intimate spaces will be clearly designated for either male, female, or family use,” the document stated.
There are 4,240 US active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates.
The directives coming out are vindictive and aggressive. At the same time, they are being issued in a chaotic way that undoubtedly is harming military readiness,“ said Jennifer Levi, a senior director at the pro-LGBTQ legal group GLAD Law.
Trump signed an executive order in January, after returning to the presidency, that reversed a policy implemented under his predecessor Joe Biden that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly.
A Gallup poll published in February found that 58 per cent of Americans favoured allowing openly transgender individuals to serve in the military, but the support had declined from 71pc in 2019.

“In yet another cowardly and ghastly attack planned and orchestrated by terrorist state of India and executed by its proxies in Balochistan, innocent school-going children’s bus was targeted today in Khuzdar,” a statement by the ISPR reads.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif subsequently reached Quetta later in the day for security briefings and the law and order situation in the province after the talk.
The ISPR said that as per the initial reports, “three innocent children and two adults have embraced martyrdom and multiple children have sustained injuries.”
It further said that “after having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
 
 

The statement said that “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians.”
It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.
“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.
“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.
Pakistan Armed Forces, with the support of the brave Pakistani nation, stand “united to uproot Indian sponsored terrorism from Pakistan in all its manifestations”, the ISPR said.
APP added that PM Shehbaz arrived in Quetta to review the law and order situation in the wake of the incident, accompanied by the defence, interior and information ministers.
The premier will preside over different meetings and briefings during his stay in the city, with a high-level security meeting focusing on the law and order situation in Balochistan also expected.
 






It earlier reported that he and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir would undertake an emergency visit to Quetta and be given a briefing on the attack “carried out by terrorists under the patronage of India”.
The Prime Minister’s Office said the two would also enquire after the health of those injured in the attack.
“The ceremony scheduled to be held this evening at Aiwan-i-Sadr in honour of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has been postponed at his own request due to the tragic attack in Khuzdar,” it added.
 






Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.
On Monday, the ISPR said 12 terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Earlier today, Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti had told Dawn.com that the blast occurred when the school bus was near the Khuzdar Zero Point.
The bodies and the injured were taken to the Khuzdar CMH, from where the seriously injured would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi, the DC said.
Police, the Frontier Corps (FC) and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel have reached the site of the incident to collect evidence for an investigation.
While a probe was underway, the DC said preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.
Condemnations
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Khuzdar school bus, describing it as a cowardly act.
“The attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,” he said in a statement.
Expressing deep sorrow over the death of the children, PM Shehbaz said that the terrorists have “crossed all limits of barbarity”, vowing to bring them to their end.
“The sympathies of the entire nation, including mine, are with the families of these innocent children, who were victims of the brutality of terrorists.”
He directed the security forces to bring the perpetrators to justice, and showed support for the armed forces’ resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari termed the attack a “heinous and inhumane crime.” He vowed to expose this “Indian-backed terrorism” at an international level.
“These terrorists do not want to see Balochistan developed,” he said in a statement.
 






“While our prayers go out for the departed souls and their families, the planners & orchestrators of this heinous terrorist attack shall be brought to justice,” said Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
 






Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”, as well as a “cowardly and inhumane act”.
In a statement, Rind echoed the ISPR’s stance, saying that India was “creating instability in Balochistan to hide its failures”. He called India’s “state-sponsored terrorism” a threat to world peace.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi strongly condemned the “explosion inside the bus near Khuzdar Zero Point”.
In a statement, he expressed deep sorrow and grief over the death of four children, and extended his condolences to their families.
“The beasts who target innocent children do not deserve any leniency. The enemy demonstrated barbarity by attacking innocent children,” Naqvi asserted.
“The attack on the school bus is a heinous conspiracy of the enemy to create instability in the country. With the unity of the nation, we will foil every conspiracy,” the interior minister vowed.
Naqvi also prayed for the speedy recovery of the wounded.
 






Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan also denounced the attack, saying that “terrorism against innocent children was the height of cowardice”.
 






Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti vowed that they will not only expose every terrorist operating in the province,  but also “eradicate them completely”.
“Following the success of Operation [Bunyanum Marsoos] and India’s disgraceful defeat, they have now resorted to cowardly and shameful tactics,” he wrote on X.
 






Later, while talking to the media, Bugti said they had solid information that Ajit Doval, the Indian national security adviser, was planning something in Balochistan but did not expect him to target children.
He said four children were slain while there were 42 injured in the attack.
“We had intelligence regarding this but to target innocent children, this is [India’s] cowardice.”

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) strongly condemned the “heinous” attack.
“The deliberate targeting of schoolchildren — innocent noncombatants in every sense — is a red line that must never be crossed. This act violates the most basic tenets of humanity and international humanitarian law,” the organisation said in a statement posted on X.
It said the “continued failure of the federal and provincial governments to prevent such attacks highlights serious and persistent lapses in providing security to common citizens”.
It added that the state had an “obligation to uphold law and order by strengthening civilian institutions and the rule of law — not through indiscriminate kinetic responses.”
The HRCP called for the “immediate identification and prosecution of the perpetrators and their enablers through lawful means”.
It also stressed the “urgent need for a meaningful political dialogue to address the deep-rooted problems of representation, governance and resource distribution in Balochistan”.

The agreement represents a deepening of bilateral ties, including closer defence cooperation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed the strategic partnership document on January 17.
The Russian legislative branch approved the pact in April. While the agreement does not include a mutual defence clause, it says both countries will work together against common military threats, develop their military-technical cooperation, and take part in joint exercises.
Since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, Iran and Russia have deepened military ties, with Western countries accusing Iran of providing missiles and drones for Russian attacks on Ukraine. Tehran denies providing weapons for Russian use in Ukraine.
The strategic pact also includes several clauses aimed at boosting economic partnership, notably by strengthening direct interbank cooperation and promoting their national financial products.
A free trade deal between Iran and the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union went into effect last week, cutting down tariffs to boost trade between the two economies, which are both under heavy Western sanctions.</p><small>2025-05-21 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2117510205ca62e.png?r=175506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912402/indian-top-court-bails-muslim-academic-arrested-for-peace-posts-following-conflict-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indian top court bails Muslim academic arrested for peace posts following conflict with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India’s top court granted bail on Wednesday to a professor arrested for commentating online about the military conflict with Pakistan but did not stop the investigation against him.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, a political science professor at the private, liberal-arts Ashoka University, was arrested on Sunday over a Facebook post criticising those “mindlessly advocating” for war.
He also wrote that the “optics” of two women army officers who had held press briefings “must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy”.
Mahmudabad since said his comments had been “misunderstood” and that he had exercised his “fundamental right to freedom of thought and speech”.
He is charged under multiple sections of India’s criminal code, including endangering the country’s sovereignty and using words or gestures with the intention of insulting the modesty of a woman.
While granting Mahmudabad bail, India’s Supreme Court said he should have avoided the “use of complicated words” which could “hurt individuals” and instead used “simpler words to convey his sentiments”.
The court also directed the formation of a special police team to probe his comments.
Mahmudabad was restricted from commenting on the India-Pakistan conflict or on the social media post that led to his arrest.
India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire last week after four days of intense exchanges of artillery, drones, and missiles.
The latest escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals came after 26 people were killed on April 22 in Indian-Occupied Kashmir. India, without investigation, blamed Pakistan for “backing the terrorists”, an allegation that Islamabad vehemently denied.
Amnesty International called his arrest “shameful” and accused authorities of “consistently misusing the law to target anyone who has a critical view”.
Mahmudabad’s post on May 8 referred to two women soldiers — including Muslim officer Sofiya Qureshi — who conducted army press briefings before the ceasefire and were praised for presenting the image of a united and progressive India.
He said he was “happy” that Hindu nationalist commentators were supporting the women, but that they could “equally loudly demand” the protection of “victims of the BJP’s hate-mongering” — referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Soon after, the government women’s rights commission in Haryana state summoned Mahmudabad over his comments.</p><small>2025-05-21 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/211641091ca2e60.png?r=164238' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912394/brutal-unconscionable-evil-condemnations-pour-in-over-khuzdar-blast-targeting-students' target='_blank'><strong>‘Brutal, unconscionable, evil’: Condemnations pour in over Khuzdar blast targeting students</strong></a><br><p>At least five people, including three children, were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying students in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district on Wednesday morning. A number of children also sustained injuries.
According to local authorities, the bodies and the injured were moved to the Khuzdar Combined Military Hospital, from where those in critical condition would be referred to medical facilities in Quetta and Karachi. Preliminary findings indicated that the attack was a suicide blast.
In a statement, the military, while calling the incident “cowardly and ghastly”, said that it was planned and orchestrated by India, and executed by its proxies in Balochistan. “After having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the Inter Services Public Relations said.
The attack drew widespread condemnation from all segments of society.
In a post on X, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned the attack. “The deliberate targeting of schoolchildren — innocent noncombatants in every sense — is a red line that must never be crossed,” it said, adding that the act violated the most basic tenets of humanity and international humanitarian law.
“The continued failure of the federal and provincial governments to prevent such attacks highlights serious and persistent lapses in providing security to common citizens.

It further called for the immediate identification and prosecution of the perpetrators and their enablers through lawful means. “We also stress the urgent need for a meaningful political dialogue to address the deep-rooted problems of representation, governance and resource distribution in Balochistan,” the HRCP added.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the attack “a despicable and inhuman act, beneath all moral and human values”.
“This cowardice against our children is an attack on the soul of Pakistan. Innocent lives, full of dreams, extinguished in an instant. We share in the grief of the bereaved families,” he wrote on X, vowing that Pakistan would bring all those responsible to light and justice.
 






The National Commission on the Rights of Children also condemned the attack. “Targeting innocent children seeking knowledge is an absolutely unacceptable, inhumane, and barbaric act.”
It called on the government, particularly the provincial authorities, to carry out an immediate, transparent, and thorough investigation into the incident, along with introducing swift protection measures for school children, especially in vulnerable districts.
 






Unicef also released a statement, extending condolences to the families, adding that it stood in solidarity with all those affected.
 






On the other hand, the US Embassy in Islamabad said it stood with Pakistan in condemning the “brutal” and “unconscionable” attack.
“The murder of innocent children is beyond comprehension. We grieve with the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts are with those recovering. No child should ever fear going to school. We stand with those in Pakistan working to end this violence,” it said.
 






The Chinese embassy said it was saddened to hear about the attack. “China firmly opposes all forms of terrorism. We strongly condemn this terrorist attack, extend our deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families, and wish the injured an early recovery,” it added.
 






Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also condemned the attack and extended his condolences.
 






Former senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that today’s terrorist attack was “plain evil and cowardly”, adding that whoever was behind it deserved no mercy.
 






Journalist and former Dawn editor Abbas Nasir also took to X and said: “What kind of ideology or cause targets innocent children. A special place in hell must await the murderers.”
 






Meanwhile, PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal said he was saddened and outraged by the horrific attack. “This act of violence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,” he wrote on X, adding that the government would ensure all those responsible were brought to justice.
 






Separately, PPP leader Sherry Rehman extended heartfelt condolences to the grieving families. “We need to know who was behind this horrible carnage … The perpetrators of this terrorist attack need to be immediately investigated, exposed, and brought to swift justice,” she said.
 






Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also stated that targeting children was a despicable and cowardly act of terrorism. “No amount of condemnation can ever be enough.”
 






Unfortunately, in Pakistan, this is not the first time students have become victims of terrorism. Here’s a timeline of some of the major attacks.

“Initial findings have established that this heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored Fitna Al Khwarij,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement, using the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement comes after locals staged a protest in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on Monday against the killing of four children and a woman, allegedly by a drone strike. A day earlier, police said talks with local elders on the matter were underway.
“Following a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan’s security forces,” the ISPR statement said.
“These claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces’ steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.”
It said that a “comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated” in response to the accusations.
“It is evident that these elements — acting at the behest of their Indian masters —  continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.”
It further said that security forces reaffirmed “their commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.”
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
On Monday, the ISPR said 12 terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Earlier this month, seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by the “Indian proxy” terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army in Kacchi district.
Armed operations and air strikes have become routine in the North Waziristan district amid claims of residents that civilians are targeted in the attacks.
About several such incidents, the local population and human rights organisations have argued that these operations lack transparency and are outside the bounds of due legal process.
In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.
An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district killed one person and injured three others in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.</p><small>2025-05-21 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21163909fa508e2.jpg?r=164856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912399/under-attack-by-trump-south-africas-ramaphosa-responds-with-trade-deal-offer' target='_blank'><strong>Under attack by Trump, South Africa’s Ramaphosa responds with trade deal offer</strong></a><br><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa heads to the White House on Wednesday on a delicate mission to persuade US President Donald Trump to make deals with his country rather than scold and punish it as he has done since the start of his second term.
Attacking South Africa’s land reform law aimed at redressing the injustices of apartheid and its genocide court case against Israel, Trump has cancelled aid to the country, expelled its ambassador and offered refuge to white minority Afrikaners based on racial discrimination claims Pretoria says are unfounded.
“Whether we like it or not, we are joined at the hip and we need to be talking to them,” Ramaphosa said on South African state television before flying to Washington to meet Trump.
The stakes are high for South Africa. The United States is its second-biggest trading partner after China, and the aid cut has already resulted in a drop in testing for HIV patients.
Ramaphosa will offer Trump a broad trade deal, said a spokesperson for the trade ministry, declining to give details.
For his part, Trump is likely to demand that US companies are exempted from “racial requirements”, a White House official said.
South Africa has laws to compel businesses to hire and promote Black South Africans, including a requirement for large companies in some sectors, such as mining and telecommunications, to have a 30% equity stake held by disadvantaged groups.
Policies aim to restore racial justice
Ramaphosa is unlikely to agree to weaken such rules, which are core to his government’s aspiration to restore racial justice after centuries of colonialism and apartheid.
“There’s political problems here that lie at the heart of the breakdown in the relationship,” said Joshua Meservey, senior fellow at conservative US think tank the Hudson Institute, cautioning that deal-making may not be enough to overcome them.
Nevertheless, Ramaphosa plans to discuss opportunities for Tesla and Starlink, companies owned by Trump’s ally Elon Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa and has accused Ramaphosa of pursuing anti-white policies, which he rejects.
Discussions could include favourable tariffs for Tesla’s imports into South Africa in return for building electric vehicle charging stations, and licensing for Starlink, Ramaphosa’s spokesperson said.
Golf connections
Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen, who is travelling with Ramaphosa, said he would work to secure South African farmers’ duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and to expand access.
AGOA is at risk from Trump’s tariff regime, which is currently suspended but would hit South Africa with a 30% duty if enacted.
“I believe that with enough drive and determination we can expand access and improve relations and this means greater opportunities for South African farmers and farmworkers,” Steenhuisen told Reuters by text message from Washington.
Trump has accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers and of fuelling disproportionate violence against white landowners with “hateful rhetoric and government actions”.
Pretoria says these claims are inaccurate and “fail to recognise South Africa’s profound and painful history of colonialism and apartheid”.
Crime statistics show no evidence that white people are disproportionately targeted. A land reform law allows judicial challenges to any expropriation orders, which can only be issued in the public interest. No expropriation has taken place.
White people, who make up about 7% of South Africa’s population, are still richer than the Black majority by every economic measure and still own three-quarters of the country’s freehold farmland.
Ramaphosa is an experienced negotiator, having headed the African National Congress’s team during the 1990s talks that led to apartheid’s peaceful end. He also built a successful investment vehicle before becoming president in 2018, and may be helped in his wooing of Trump by rich and powerful allies.
South African media reported that billionaire luxury goods tycoon Johann Rupert, the richest person in South Africa, and golfer Ernie Els have helped to bring about the meeting between Trump and Ramaphosa. Both have played golf with Trump.
Rupert, founder of the Richemont group which owns brands such as Cartier and Chloe, was quoted by News24 as saying he was very concerned about the potential loss of AGOA and its impact on jobs in his homeland.</p><small>2025-05-21 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2116252838339a0.jpg?r=172044' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912397/ukraine-pitches-tougher-russia-sanctions-plan-to-eu-as-us-wavers' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine pitches tougher Russia sanctions plan to EU as US wavers</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine will ask the European Union next week to consider big new steps to isolate Moscow, including seizing Russian assets and bringing in sanctions for some buyers of Russian oil, as United States President Donald Trump has backed off from tightening sanctions.
A previously unreported Ukrainian white paper to be presented to the EU calls for the 27-member bloc to take a more aggressive and independent position on sanctions as uncertainty hangs over Washington’s future role.
Among 40 pages of recommendations were calls to adopt legislation that would speed up the EU’s seizure of assets from sanctioned individuals and send them to Ukraine. Those under sanctions could then seek compensation from Russia.
The EU should consider a range of steps to make its sanctions apply more forcefully beyond its own territory, including targeting foreign companies that use its technology to help Russia, and “the introduction of secondary sanctions on purchasers of Russian oil”.
Such secondary sanctions, which could hit big buyers such as India and China, would be a major step that Europe has so far been reluctant to take. Trump had publicly discussed this before taking the decision not to act for now.
The white paper also calls for the EU to consider using more majority-rule decision-making over sanctions, to prevent individual member states from blocking measures that otherwise require unanimity.
After speaking to Putin on Monday, Trump opted not to impose fresh sanctions on Russia, dashing hopes of European leaders and Kyiv who had been lobbying him for weeks to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.
Trump spoke to Ukrainian and European leaders after his call with Putin and told them he didn’t want to impose sanctions now and to give time for talks to take place, a person familiar with the conversation told Reuters.
The EU and Britain imposed additional sanctions against Russia on Tuesday anyway, saying they still hope Washington would join them. But Europeans are openly discussing ways they can maintain pressure on Moscow if Washington is no longer prepared to participate.
‘Catalyse the EU’
Publicly, Ukraine has tried to avoid any hint of criticism of Washington since President Volodymyr Zelenskiy received a dressing down from Trump in the White House in February.
The sanctions white paper emphasises the “unprecedented” sanctions imposed by the EU so far and talks up their potential to do more. It also includes a stark assessment of the Trump administration’s commitment to coordination efforts so far.
“Today, in practice, Washington has ceased participation in nearly all intergovernmental platforms focused on sanctions and export control,” it said.
Washington had slowed work in the monitoring group for enforcing price caps on Russian oil, dissolved a federal task force focused on prosecuting sanctions violations and reassigned a significant number of sanctions experts to other sectors, it added.
It noted that two potentially major US sanctions packages had been drawn up — one by the government and another by pro-Trump Senator Lindsey Graham — but that it was “uncertain” whether Trump would sign off on either of them.
Uncertainty over the US stance had slowed the pace of economic countermeasures and multilateral coordination, but “should not prompt the European Union to ease sanctions pressure”, it said.
“On the contrary, it should catalyse the EU to assume a leading role in this domain.”
‘Huge Strike’
Ukraine is worried that Washington peeling away from the Western consensus on sanctions could also cause vacillation in the EU, which traditionally requires consensus for major decisions.
“American withdrawal from the sanctions regime [would] be a huge strike on the unity of the EU. Huge,” a senior Ukrainian government official told Reuters.
The EU cannot fully replace the heft of the US in applying economic pressure on Russia. Much of the impact of US sanctions comes from the dominance of the dollar in global trade, which the euro cannot match.
Still, US sanctions relief for Russia would not spur a significant return of foreign investors and investment if Europe held firm, said Craig Kennedy, a Russian energy expert at the Davis Centre, Harvard.</p><small>2025-05-21 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21110203051f156.jpg?r=113951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912365/dar-meets-chinese-afghan-fms-as-they-agree-to-thwart-terrorism-in-region' target='_blank'><strong>Dar meets Chinese, Afghan FMs as they agree to thwart terrorism in region</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and agreed to extend the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.
On Monday, Deputy PM Dar arrived in China’s capital of Beijing on a three-day official visit at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Yi amid regional tensions. The trilateral forum was established in 2017, with earlier meetings held in Beijing and the Afghan capital.
China said on Tuesday that it supports Pakistan in defending “national sovereignty and territorial integrity”, after a ceasefire ended four days of fighting with India over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
“Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar Member of the Communist Party of China Political Bureau & Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China Wang Yi, and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi, held an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing today,” the statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
 






“They agreed to deepen Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and extend the CPEC to Afghanistan,” the FO added.
The three foreign ministers reaffirmed trilateral cooperation as a vital platform to promote regional security and economic connectivity, the statement continued.
“It was agreed that the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Meeting will be held in Kabul at an early, mutually convenient date,” according to the FO.
The foreign ministers discussed enhancing diplomatic engagement, strengthening communications, and taking practical steps to boost trade, infrastructure, and development as key drivers of shared prosperity.
The ministers underscored their shared commitment to countering terrorism and fostering stability and development in the region.
Dar posted a photo of himself with his counterparts, saying they stood together for regional peace, stability and development.
 






Dar reaffirmed that the strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China continued to strengthen, reaching new heights of mutual trust and collaboration.
Concluding his three-day official visit to China, Dar described the visit as highly productive and marked by significant diplomatic progress.
Talking to state media outlet APP, the deputy PM noted that the visit coincided with the 74th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China — a relationship that has evolved into an ironclad friendship over the decades.
He also held a separate meeting with FM Muttaqi in which the two welcomed the positive momentum in bilateral ties, including enhanced diplomatic engagement, trade and transit facilitation.
“They agreed to work together to advance mutual interests, including in the domains of trade, transit, connectivity and security,” the FO said.
 






Earlier in the month, the Afghan government under the Taliban called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.
The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.
On May 15, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar held a telephone conversation with the Acting Afghan FM Muttaqi, marking India’s first minister-level outreach to the Taliban administration in Afghanistan, the Hindu reported.
Air chief lauds China’s role in Pakistan’s defence capabilities
Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu has commended China’s role in assisting Pakistan’s defence modernisation and technological advancement, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
During a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who called on him in Islamabad, the air chief expressed his profound gratitude to China for its continued support and unwavering friendship.
He emphasised that the bond between both countries has only strengthened over the decades and will continue to deepen through future cooperation and partnership.
They held comprehensive and in-depth discussions on a range of matters, including corporate-level engagements, defence cooperation and the evolving geostrategic environment in the region.
The dignitaries underscored the importance of cohesive and collaborative approaches in responding to emerging challenges, emphasising the necessity of maintaining peak operational readiness and swift coordination amidst the prevailing regional security dynamics.
They reaffirmed their pledge to institutionalise regular high-level exchanges through expanded joint operational exercises and exploration of multilateral frameworks that bolster collective response mechanisms to emerging threats.
In his remarks, the Chinese ambassador lauded the unmatched operational excellence demonstrated by PAF personnel during the recent standoff on the eastern front, terming it a reflection of PAF’s high standards and unwavering commitment to national defence.
The envoy acknowledged PAF’s operational effectiveness and strategic acumen in employing indigenous solutions and advanced systems to safeguard national interests and deter potential threats under the current leadership.
Reaffirming China’s enduring support, the ambassador assured full technical assistance to the PAF to bolster its aerial defence capabilities.
He also lauded Pakistan’s commitment to self-reliance and emphasised that PAF’s investment in indigenous processes had begun to yield promising results. He stressed that continued focus on homegrown technological development would further elevate the country’s defence capabilities.</p><small>2025-05-21 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21160618409f6d9.jpg?r=162806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912390/pcb-drops-shaheen-azam-and-rizwan-for-bangladesh-t20s' target='_blank'><strong>PCB drops Shaheen, Azam and Rizwan for Bangladesh T20s</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) dropped Shaheen Shah Afridi, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan on Wednesday as it named a new-look squad for three home Twenty20 internationals against Bangladesh.
Former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson will take charge for the first time after being appointed last week, replacing Aaqib Javed.
Salman Ali Agha will captain Pakistan as they look towards next year’s T20 World Cup, to be hosted by India and Sri Lanka.
Fast bowler Shaheen had played in Pakistan’s last T20 series in New Zealand in March, but batsmen Babar and Rizwan were omitted for the second consecutive T20 series after being criticised for slow scoring.
“The squad has been selected based on players’ performances in the ongoing Pakistan Super League, which concludes on May 25,” the PCB said in a statement.
 






Shaheen has taken 12 wickets for Lahore Qalandars in 10 PSL matches at an economy rate of 8.20. Opener Sahibzada Farhan earned a recall after topping the PSL batting charts with 394 runs.
Batsmen Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman return after missing the New Zealand tour with injuries. Fast bowler Hasan Ali is back after being sidelined with multiple injuries since May last year.
Pakistan squad: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Wasim, Mohammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub
The PCB also announced the revised schedule for the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh that was impacted by the recent conflict with India.
The series will take place at Lahore’s iconic Gaddafi Stadium from May 28 to June 1.
The action-packed series will kick off with the first T20I on May 28, followed by the second fixture on May 30. The third and final T20I is set to take place on June 1.
 






Bangladesh are scheduled to arrive in Lahore on 25 May, with training sessions planned for 26 and 27 May to ensure optimal preparation ahead of the series. All three matches will begin at 8pm local time.</p><small>2025-05-21 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21135358ed0998a.jpg?r=135438' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912376/consequences-of-nuclear-war-wont-be-limited-to-india-and-pakistan-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Consequences of nuclear war won’t be limited to India and Pakistan: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday cautioned that a nuclear war between India and Pakistan will have devastating consequences for the entire region and beyond.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda“ in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.
Bilawal has been entrusted to lead the delegation, comprising Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Sabzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
The former foreign minister was speaking to the media after receiving an initial briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before he leads the high-level diplomatic delegation to world capitals to brief foreign leaders on India’s aggression and efforts to destabilise regional peace.
 






Bilawal said they received an initial briefing at the Foreign Office on the ceasefire, Kashmir, terrorism and the “attack” on the Indus Waters Treaty.
He said these briefings will be held for the next few days, and then as per the prime minister’s directive, they will visit different countries to present Pakistan’s stance that is based on peace.
He said Pakistan desired peace in the region that can be achieved by addressing the flashpoints, whether it was the Kashmir dispute or terrorism.
“Pakistan is one of the biggest victims of terrorism,” he noted.
Bilawal cautioned that the “new normal” which India is seeking is not in its favour either.
“We have seen how after a terrorist attack, both countries can come close to a nuclear war,” he added.
 


Bilawal said there was a need to hold dialogue and find solutions to the issue of terrorism. He said the people of both countries sought peace, which was not possible until the three main issues — Kashmir, terrorism, and water — were resolved.
He expressed grave concerns about India’s weaponisation of water and highlighted the need for Pakistan to inform the world about it.
He said that they will inform foreign governments and people that a conflict between two nuclear countries will have severe consequences beyond the region.
He also appreciated the efforts of the prime minister during the conflict, saying Pakistan demonstrated a ‘reasonable and rational role’ after India’s baseless accusations.
“Pakistan was not the aggressor, we defended ourselves,” adding the world is welcoming our stance as we stood with the truth, while India built a narrative on lies and falsehoods.
Bilawal, in a recent post on X, announced that he was appointed by the prime minister to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-21 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21143908d23ccfa.jpg?r=152553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912385/jumbo-task-400-pills-a-day-for-elephants-with-tb-at-karachis-safari-park' target='_blank'><strong>Jumbo task: 400 pills a day for elephants with TB at Karachi’s Safari Park</strong></a><br><p>A team of doctors and vets has developed a novel treatment for the pair of elephants at Karachi’s Safari Park suffering from tuberculosis that involves feeding them at least 400 pills a day.
The jumbo effort by staff involves administering the tablets — the same as those used to treat TB in humans — hidden inside food ranging from apples and bananas to sweets.
The amount of medication is adjusted to account for the weight of the 4,000-kilogramme elephants.
But it has taken Madhubala and Malika several weeks to settle into the treatment after spitting out the first few doses they tasted of the bitter medicine, and crankily charging their keepers.
“Giving treatment for TB to elephants is always challenging. Each day we use different methods,” said Buddhika Bandara, a veterinary surgeon from Sri Lanka who flew in to oversee the treatment.

“The animals showed some stress in the beginning, but gradually they adapted to the procedure,” said Bandara, who has helped more than a dozen elephants recover from the illness in Sri Lanka.
Mahout Ali Baloch wakes early daily to stew rice and lentils, mixed with plenty of sugar cane molasses, and rolls the concoction into dozens of balls pierced with the tablets.
“I know the pills are bitter,” the 22-year-old said, watching the elephants splashing under a hose to keep cool.

From humans to elephants
Four African elephants — captured very young in the wild in Tanzania — arrived in Karachi in 2009.
Noor Jehan died in 2023 at the age of 17, and another, Sonia, followed at the end of 2024. An autopsy showed she had contracted tuberculosis, which is endemic in Pakistan.
Tests carried out on Madhubala and Malika also came back positive, and the city council, which owns the park, assembled a team to care for the pachyderms.

Bandara said it is not uncommon for elephants to contract the contagious illness from humans, but that Sonia — and now Madhubala and Malika — had shown no symptoms.
“It was surprising for me that elephants have TB,” said Naseem Salahuddin, head of the Infectious Disease Department at the Indus Hospital and Health Network, who was enrolled to monitor staff.
“This is an interesting case for me and my students — everyone wants to know about the procedure and its progress,” she told AFP.
The team of four mahouts wear face masks and scrubs when feeding the elephants to avoid contracting a disease that infects more than 500,000 humans a year.
Safari Park has long been criticised for the mistreatment of captive animals, including an elephant evacuated after a campaign by American singer Cher, but is hopeful its last two elephants will overcome the illness with a year-long treatment plan.</p><small>2025-05-21 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/21123058dd2e97a.gif?r=123850' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912288/hbl-psl-2025-in-form-quetta-gladiators-face-islamabad-united-in-top-shelf-qualifier' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025: In-form Quetta Gladiators face Islamabad United in top-shelf qualifier</strong></a><br><p> 

LAHORE: Players of Lahore Qalandars attend a training session on Tuesday.—M.Arif/White Star

LAHORE: High-flying Quetta Gladiators face defending champions Islamabad United in the first qualifier of the HBL Pakistan Super League X here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
Though United have won three PSL titles — in 2016, 2018 and 2024 — ever since the league was launched in 2016 while Gladiators have clinched the title only once (2019), the latter have shown great form and consistency in the ongoing edition to top the table with 15 points (seven wins, two losses, one no result) in the league stage of the six-team competition.
 


Moreover, Gladiators’ victories in both their league-stage games against United signify the Saud Shakeel-led squad’s profile ahead of the top-shelf clash.
Gladiators had to fight hard against United to win the first match in Lahore, they won their second duel in Rawalpindi by a massive 109 runs after amassing a record-equalling 263. So impressive was Gladiators’ recent form that they won six of their last seven league-stage matches while one against Lahore Qalandars was washed out at the Gaddafi Stadium.
For second-placed United (12 points; six wins, four losses), they must forget the past when they enter the field today.
In contrast, United started off in this edition like a true champion team winning the their first five games. Then they nosedived lose four matches on the trot, before returning to the winning ways in Rawalpindi where they crushed Karachi Kings by 79 runs.
Talking to media on Tuesday, Saud said that his team would try to maintain their form in the playoffs.
“We entered the playoffs stage after playing good cricket and we will try our best to maintain that momentum in this final stage of the league,” Saud said while talking to media after his team held a practice session at the LCCA Ground.
“Though there is always room for improvement, the priority in the playoffs stage is to make minimum mistakes as there are very few chances to bear the losses of mistakes.”
He said Khawaja Nafay and Hasan Nawaz got opportunities and they made the most of them. “With the return of Rilee Rossouw, out batting line-up has been boosted further.”
Saud further said that the playing XI would be decided after watching the pitch on Wednesday.
The Shadab Khan-captained United did practice on Tuesday, perhaps preferring to rest after playing their last league-stage match in Rawalpindi on Monday.
Mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed — with 15 wickets in the ongoing edition — is a potent weapon possessed by Gladiators who are reinforced by pacers Faheem Ashraf (14), Khurram Shahzad (12) and Mohammad Amir (10).
Players including Hasan Nawaz (317 runs), Rossouw (234), Saud (221) and Finn Allen form a strong batting line-up.
On the other hand, United’s bowling attack looks a bit more dependable in the presence of fast bowlers Jason Holder (15 wickets), Naseem Shah (nine wickets), Salman Irshad (five wickets), Ben Dwarshius (four), and spinners like Shadab (13) and Imad Wasim (12).
United formidable batting line-up includes the league’s top-scorer Sahibzada Farhan (394), Alex Hales, who replaced Colin Munro made a blistering 88 against Karachi Kings in the last match, Rassie van der Dussen, Shadab, Imad and Azam Khan.
Speaking to media after the last league match on Monday, Salman said that he was enjoying his time at United.
“This is my seventh PSL I guess. I have played a lot of games in this league. The team combination and environment of Islamabad United are nice. Moreover, there was no pressure from the captain or the coach as all our players got breaks [during the league stage] and got equal opportunities,” the pacer told reporters. “Therefore, I as a player enjoy the games.”
Answering a question on the impact of foreign players on United’s performance, Sal­man said that the return of the overseas professionals was certainly benefitting his team.
“[Alex] Hales played a fine knock in the only match he played so far [in this edition] plus Van Der Dussen is there. Our foreign players are very good and valuable for the team,” he said.
“[Moreover] we have the [team] combination which we wanted to form before the playoffs.”
Teams (from):
QUETTA GLADIATORS: Saud Shakeel (captain), Finn Allen, Rilee Rossouw, Hasan Nawaz, Khawaja Nafay, Faheem Ashraf, Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Mohammad Amir, Usman Tariq, Danish Aziz, Abrar Ahmed.

Starlink Services, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is one of the most technologically advanced companies globally among those providing internet via low-Earth orbit satellites. Last month, the Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced that Starlink services are expected to be operational in the country by the end of this year.
The ambassador, accompanied by a delegation, was briefed on the collaboration efforts between Pakistan and SpaceX, particularly how Starlink’s low-Earth orbit satellite infrastructure and SpaceX’s commercial capabilities held “transformative” potential for Pakistan’s digital landscape.
The delegation was received at SpaceX Headquarters by the vice-president of Starlink global business operations and the director of global business development, and provided a guided tour of the space giant’s headquarters.
During the visit, the two parties discussed efforts focused on “expanding broadband access and strengthening national connectivity, particularly in remote and underprivileged areas”, as per the report.
Ambassador Rizwan Saeed reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment towards promoting innovation through strategic international partnerships, hoping that such engagement would result in tangible cooperation in space technology, digital infrastructure, and commercial innovation.
The engagement is part of a series of efforts focused on strengthening ties between the private IT sectors of Pakistan and the US.
Last month, the IT minister announced that a provisional licence has been granted to Starlink to provide satellite-based internet services in the country, and services were expected to be available in the country by the end of this year. She also announced that a Chinese firm — Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology — has also applied for a satellite-based internet licence, adding that, “the government is encouraging competition in the sector.”</p><small>2025-05-21 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/682d106b5004a.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912331/canal-protest-turns-violent-one-dead-over-dozen-hurt-in-sindhs-moro' target='_blank'><strong>Canal protest turns violent; one dead, over dozen hurt in Sindh’s Moro</strong></a><br><p>• Sindh home minister’s house attacked, two trailers torched in Moro
• Lanjar orders action against those disturbing peace
HYDERABAD/NAWABSHAH: A protester was killed and over a dozen others, including a DSP and six other policemen, were injured during clashes in the Moro city of Naushahro Feroz — the home district of Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar — on Tuesday.
Mr Lanjar’s house was also attacked, along with two trailers on Moro bypass road.
Violence erupted when police attempted to disperse a protest reportedly organised by Sindh Saba against the proposed construction of new canals on the River Indus. The protesters had blocked the Moro bypass road to record their protest.
A similar programme was scheduled by Sindh Saba at the press club in Hyderabad, but police authorities did not allow it and cordoned off the main road leading to the club. Police also picked up two activists of the party.
In Moro, the protesters, armed with rods and sticks, raised slogans against corporate farming and the proposed canals. According to local sources, the protest site was about one kilometre from the residence of the provincial home minister.
When police tried to disperse the crowd, the protesters refused to move. Police then used force, resorting to baton charge and firing into the air, which injured several protesters and pedestrians.
One of the injured, Zahid Leghari, son of Allah Bachayo Leghari, who had sustained bullet wounds, later died at Nawabshah hospital. The injured were initially taken to Moro’s hospital and then shifted to Peoples Medical University in Benazirabad, the divisional headquarters.
 
 

According to Dr Yar Mohammad Jam­ali, medical superintendent at Peoples Medical University Hos­­pital Nawabshah, Zahid was brought dead at the facility. Others who suffered bullet injuries included Irfan Ali, Shah­meer, Mohsin Ali, Dilbar and Abdul Kha­lique.
Dr Jamali added that three policemen — Tahir Afzal, Abdul Khaliq and Samad Ali — were also brought to the hos­­pital, but did not have gunshot injuries.
Shaheed Benazirabad DIG Pervez Ahmed Chandio, SSP Shaheed Benazir­abad Shabbir Sethar, along with a heavy contingent of police from Nawabshah, Dadu and Matiari, reached Moro to control the law and order situation.
According to police sources, several protesters were later arrested. When contacted, the Naushahro Feroze SSP was unavailable for comment.
Reports from local official and private sources suggested that more than four dozen activists, said to be affiliated with the Sindh Saba Party under the leadership of Ashfaq Malik, had blocked the road to protest against corporate farming and the construction of new canals over the Indus. The situation escalated into a violent clash between the police and protesters, turning the area into a virtual battlefield.
Businesses were shut, and roads were deserted. Protesters set two trailers on fire and also damaged a police van.
After the news of Zahid Leghari’s death spread, the protest intensified. Protesters stormed the residence of Zia Lanjar, ransacked it and set fire to the parking shed and drawing room.  Activists from other nationalist parties also joined the protest.
The protesters chanted slogans against police brutality and held placards demanding accountability. The situation began returning to normal around 7pm.
Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon confirmed that parts of the home minister’s house were attacked. “We are investigating whether it was preplanned or otherwise,” he said.
The Sindh police chief added that initially 50 to 60 people began a sit-in on the road and refused to clear the blockade when asked by police.
“They were armed and literally fought the police, beating them ruthlessly,” he claimed.
PPP Sindh Information Secretary Ajiz Dhamra condemned the incident in a statement, calling it a terrorist act. He said there was no ban on peaceful protest, but attacking the house of a political opponent reflected a conspiracy.
The home minister directed the Nau­shahro Feroz SSP to submit a detailed report of the incident.
He said no one would be allowed to challenge the writ of the state and instructed police to take ac­­tion against those disturbing the peace.

He called the former prime minister’s incarceration “unjustified” as the cases against him were “bogus and politically motivated”.
Speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday after meeting Mr Khan, along with party leaders Salman Akram Raja and Ali Zafar, Mr Gohar said the jailed PTI leader had shut the door on talks with the government but not with the military establishment.
He said Pakistan managed to triumph over India in recent clashes due to national unity.

“Now that we are at peace with global powers, there is hope of peace internally,” he said, referring to the local political situation.
He hoped that Mr Khan would be released soon. “We pray it happens this week,” he said, without elaborating how the jailed ex-PM could be released with appeals against his conviction pending in court.
‘No exceptions for Imran’
Meanwhile, the federal government has dismissed reports of talks with PTI for Mr Khan’s release. He said no individual could be granted special treatment and the only way to seek relief is through courts.
 
 

“If exceptions are made for one, we must equally address the plight of 90,000 others languishing in prisons awaiting justice,” PML-N leader Irfan Siddiqui said during a discussion on a private TV channel.
Mr Siddiqui added that the nation’s stability didn’t hinge on any single individual’s incarceration. “Our institutions remain functional, and the economy is on a recovery trajectory despite inherited challenges,” he claimed.
“There are no direct or backchannel talks going on with the PTI chief, and the reports are completely baseless,” he said.
He said the PTI “must abandon any illusion of external help, either from the IMF or foreign powers”. He accused the previous PTI government of political victimisation and misusing state institutions to fabricate charges against opponents.
On the report of a possible attempt by PTI to present a no-confidence motion against the prime minister or National Assembly speaker, Mr Sid­diqui said if the opposition party can secure the required numbers, “we will face it with grace and composure”.
PTI condemns India
Meanwhile, PTI has condemned India’s hawkish attitude and aggressive posture against Pakistan. In a statement, PTI leader Sheikh Waqas Akram said New Delhi seemed “hell-bent on weaponising water” flowing into Pakistan.
The “bloodthirsty” Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, not only categorically stated that water and blood cannot flow together but  also reportedly expedited the planning and execution of reservoir projects on Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers. He said the plan to double the Ranbir Canal’s length on the Chenab was a blatant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. He urged the government to adopt a proactive strategic response to counter India’s violations of the treaty.

• Field Marshal terms honour ‘tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan’
• ACM Sidhu becomes first air chief to be given second extension
• Ex-generals foresee new role of vice chief of army staff for four-star general
ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday promoted Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India in the conflict that started earlier this month following the Pahalgam inci­dent in India-occu­pied Kashmir.
“The Government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (Nishan-e-Imtiaz, Military) to the rank of Field Marshal in recognition of his superior strategy and courageous lead­ership… (and) infli­cted a decisive defeat upon the enemy,” a statement read.
The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Pakistan had a serving field marshal in 1959, when Ayub Khan, the-then military ruler, awarded himself the five-star title.
Shortly after the announcement, PM Sheh­baz posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying: “Under his command, our valiant armed forces staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with unity, courage and the highest standards of military professionalism.”
 






Field Marshal Munir, who has been serving as the army chief since November 2022, accepted the elevation, saying, as per a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), that it was not a personal honour but a tribute to the entire armed forces and the people of Pakistan.
Second extension for air chief
The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu.
His current extension, granted last year, expires in March. He becomes the first PAF chief to receive two extensions, a move that underscores the central role he played in the successful execution of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos from May 7 to 10. “The government has also unanimously decided to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu upon the completion of his current term,” a statement by the PM’s Office said.
Implications for military hierarchy
Field Marshal Munir’s promotion has set off widespread speculation about its implications for Pakistan’s higher defence organisation (HDO), comprising the joint chiefs of staff committee (JCSC), headed by its chairman, and the three service chiefs (army, navy, air force).
While the five-star title is largely ceremonial, questions have also been raised about its impact on the civil-military balance, the operational command chain, and the defence leadership’s future.
 
 

In a symbolic gesture, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza issued a congratulatory message, which analysts viewed as signalling that he would continue in his current role, despite now being technically junior to a five-star service chief.
Among retired military officials and analysts, opinions are divided. Retired Lt Gen Naeem Khalid Lodhi, a former defence secretary and caretaker national security adviser, anticipated the creation of a long-proposed chief of defence staff (CDS) role, a concept first floated during Nawaz Sharif’s previous tenure. Under this structure, COAS Munir could serve both as COAS and CDS, further consolidating his authority, he believed.
Conversely, retired Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, also a former defence secretary, downplayed the prospects of any structural change. “The field marshal rank is ceremonial,” he said, adding that the COAS remained the most powerful operational position within the military hierarchy. “CDS is a coordinating role, not a command authority,” Mr Yasin noted, suggesting the existing setup would remain intact.
Both, however, foresee the creation of a position of the vice chief of army staff for a four-star general.
Legal and constitutional ambiguities
The promotion has also revived debates over the legal foundations of the field marshal rank in Pakistan, with some experts noting the silence of the Constitution and the Pakistan Army Act on such an appointment.
Article 243 grants the president the authority to appoint service chiefs on the advice of the prime minister, but it does not mention five-star ranks. The 2024 amendment to the Army Act extended the COAS’s tenure to five years and removed retirement age limits for four-star generals.
A Ministry of Defence notification, however, said that the promotion had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998. The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”
Military law expert retired colonel Inamur Raheem, when contacted for verification of the secretive rules, confirmed the wording of Rule 199A.
A strategic signal
While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted that “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”
Columnist and political analyst Abbas Nasir, while commenting on the political angle of the promotion, said, “As far as its domestic impact is concerned, by jumping the gun without evidence after the Pahalgam terror attack, the Modi government gifted Pakistan a considerable amount of unity as the country rallied behind the armed forces, setting aside internal political differences, disappointments.”
“Let’s see if national reconciliation is possible as a result of this Godsend or whether the country will revert to square one,” he worried.
Mr Nasir, while commenting on the move, said, “One only hopes that the world governments and media, which appeared to hyphenate Pakistan and India after years of lining up behind India and ap­p­eared to buy Islam­abad’s view largely, do not consider this a non-serious, or worse still belligerent, move.”
Global context
Pakistan’s only precedent for this move is Ayub Khan, whose 1959 elevation to the field marshal rank occurred amid his presidency and did not restructure the armed forces. Likewise, COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.
The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.

A high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday was briefed on the digital monitoring system, which will be installed at major highways across the country.
An official announcement said FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial briefed the meeting on the project. He said the system freight vehicles will be fitted with e-tags and digital devices for the monitoring of goods.
The system will enable the digitisation of the economy and significantly increase tax revenue. It will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, it will be launched in one city and later implemented across the country.

Production in tobacco, steel, cement industries being monitored

The meeting was informed that a system is being introduced for digital and automated monitoring of imports and exports at ports and airports.
This system will be linked to local and international databases and tax evasion and smuggling will be prevented by using artificial intelligence.
The meeting was also informed that FBR officials and other institutions have been deployed to monitor the production of tobacco, beverages, steel and cement, similar to the monitoring system implemented in the sugar industry. The meeting was briefed about the monitoring of sales tax in cement, hatcheries, poultry feed, tobacco and beverages.
The PM directed the officials to accelerate the implementation of tax reform measures. He said taxpaying individuals and businesses will be facilitated, but no concession will be given to tax evaders, who will face strict legal action.
The FBR has missed its collection target by nearly Rs831 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, mainly due to a decline in import volume and lower-than-expected inflation, which hit sales tax collections. The tax body collected Rs9.3 trillion in July-April FY25 against the budgetary target of Rs10.13tr.

Over three million Afghans have returned from neighbouring countries, around one-third from Pakistan, since September 2023, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
These Afghans were either deported or left out of fear of arrest after the Pakistan government announced a plan to repatriate all illegal foreigners.
In 2025 alone, 780,000 Afghans are estimated to have returned, including 351,600 who were deported, according to the information released by UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday.

UN body says support to returning refugees drastically reduced

They return to a homeland that is “clearly unprepared to receive them”, with a UNDP report saying that three-quarters of the population in Afghanistan was barely surviving, with half the population in need of humanitarian assistance.
Many of the returning Afghans are preparing to leave the country again for Iran, Turkiye and Europe, the UN body added.
Arafat Jamal, the UNHCR representative in Afghanistan, said the organisation requires $216m to fund its response in Afghanistan this year, but has so far received just 25 per cent of that amount.
The “deeply troubling financial situation” was crippling the UNHCR ability to help the Afghans.
With funding reductions, the UNHCR has been forced to offer only the most basic humanitarian assistance. “It can help someone survive, but not effectively rebuild.”
The budget cuts are also inhibiting the UNHCR’s initiative to support those who help Afghan women and girls at risk.
 
 

The funds provided by the UNHCR “helped these courageous actors to protect and safeguard valuable female-oriented projects”. Cutting the assistance for these initiatives would mean “abandoning these people who stand against draconian conditions”.
Global support
The UNHCR said the international community has invested heavily in Afghanistan over the decades and called for continued support for stability and economic growth.
“We call upon neighbouring countries to pursue solutions, treat Afghans with dignity, and work regionally to foster safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable returns.”
The UN body urged the international community to “not abandon its investments, to stay the course, and to provide political and financial support” for dispersed Afghans to “return and build their futures”.
The UNHCR said that it has been a “dependable partner and supporter of the Afghan people” for around 40 years.
“We have supported the governments that have hosted them and we are with them now as many make the journey back.”

ISLAMABAD: Dr Shezra Mansab Ali Khan Kharal, the minister of state for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, on Tuesday announced the country’s first climate-focused budget for the fiscal year 2025–26 under which 30 per cent of all public development projects would undergo a Climate Public Investment Management Assessment (CPIMA).
“It is a significant shift towards integrating climate considerations into national economic planning,” the minister said.
The announcement was made during the Pre-Budget Dialogue 2025, titled “Rethinking Economic Policy for a Just Energy Transition,” organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in collaboration with the Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED). The event brought together key policymakers, economists, parliamentarians, and energy experts to discuss aligning fiscal strategies with climate resilience and sustainability goals.
Dr Kharal highlighted the multifaceted challenges Pakistan faces, including increased vulnerability to climatic risks affecting agriculture, India’s suspension of the Indus Water Treaty exacerbating water scarcity, and the constraints imposed by the IMF’s austerity programme limiting development expenditures. She noted that the energy sector’s inefficiencies and circular debt continue to strain the national budget, necessitating a transition to sustainable energy solutions.
Malik Amin Aslam, former special assistant to the prime minister on climate change, highlighted that Pakistan cannot circumvent the impacts of climate change, which could force the country to spend 9pc of its GDP on resilience efforts. He advocated for the implementation of carbon taxes to ensure that revenues collected are invested in climate resilience initiatives.
MNA Arshad Abdullah Vohra of MQM-P emphasised that climate change and energy transition are two distinct subjects. He highlighted that energy and power are federal subjects, while climate change has become a provincial responsibility following the 18th Constitutional Amendment. Addre­ssing urban resilience, he revealed that four million people in Karachi live in non-resilient housing, including 1 million registered slum dwellers.
Sanaullah Baloch, former senator and current member of the Balochistan Assembly, delivered a presentation on “Balochistan, Energy Justice, and Economic Development”. He argued that the ongoing insurgency and conflict in Balochistan are rooted in the unjust distribution of its resources.
He recalled that Pakistan was among only five countries in the world that discovered natural gas in 1955, and Balochistan’s gas contributed to $200 billion in value. He asserted that the industrial revolution across Pakistan was driven by Balochistan’s gas, likening energy to the bloodstream of a nation. He lamented the lack of energy access in Balochistan, which hampers development, with only 20pc grid access compared to Punjab’s 95pc, Sindh’s 85pc, and KP’s 80pc.
Barrister Danyal Chaudhary, Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting described nursing crops under a scorching sun, students in Balochistan studying by candlelight, and mothers in Punjab praying for affordable electricity as vivid examples of how energy issues translate into dignity and survival.
Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, the executive director of SDPI, emphasised the economic imperatives driving the energy transition. He pointed out that rising fuel prices and the liberalisation of the second-hand automobile market could accelerate the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, thereby promoting energy efficiency and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
Shahid Hafeez Kardar, former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, stressed the need for economic policies that prioritise long-term sustainability over short-term stabilisation. He advocated for shifting from reactive subsidies to proactive investments.
Khalid Mansoor, senior fellow at the Pakistan Regional Economic Forum and former special assistant to the prime minister on CPEC affairs, highlighted the transformational phase of CPEC, focusing on energy transition, smart agriculture, value-added textiles, and digital transformation.
Dr. Sajid Amin Javed, deputy executive director of SDPI, pointed out that Pakistan’s economic policy has been primarily focused on stabilisation, often neglecting sustainability goals. He advocated for the imposition of carbon taxation and petroleum levies to achieve revenue targets while promoting green energy transition as a solution to macroeconomic problems.
Shah Jahan Mirza, managing director of the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), noted that Pakistan has already achieved 47pc clean energy generation in its current energy mix, calling for encouraging local development of solar energy panels and equipment.
Dr Khaqqan Najeeb, senior economist, emphasised that energy issues in Pakistan are rooted in governance and management challenges rather than just energy costs or inefficiencies. He called for a unified and authoritative energy regulator.
Afia Malik, an economist, cautioned that petroleum levies directly impact the poor, suggesting that carbon taxes on emitting energy sources would transfer the burden to final consumers, including the middle class. Shiraz Shah, head of resilience, environment, and climate change at UNDP, underscored that energy transition is a governance issue requiring a multi-sectoral approach.

• Economy size swells to $411bn, agriculture grows just 0.56pc and LSM contracts 1.5pc
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income increased in dollar terms at a modest pace in 2024-25, reflecting a sustained recovery in the country’s overall output compared to the previous year, the government said on Tuesday.
It was announced on Tuesday that the country’s economy is expected to grow by 2.68 per cent in the current fiscal year, a revision from earlier projections of 3.6pc, suggesting that Pakistan will fall short of its GDP target.
The leading global financial institutions’ estimates also show that Pakistan’s economy is expected to grow between 2.6 and 2.8pc in FY25, a slower-than-expected recovery with challenges in agriculture, industrial output, and external financing weighing on economic momentum. The lenders have already revised downward their earlier GDP projections for Pakistan.
The IMF revised the growth forecast to 2.6pc, citing weaker economic performance. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimate a slightly higher growth rate of 2.8pc, reflecting cautious optimism.
The 113th National Accounts Committee (NAC) meeting, chaired by Planning Commission Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra, approved revised GDP growth rates for Q1, Q2, and Q3 of FY25, along with final figures for FY23 and revised estimates for FY24. The provisional GDP growth for FY25 stands at 2.68pc compared to 2.51pc in FY24, a marginal increase.
The size of the economy went up to $410.96 billion in FY25 from $371.66bn in FY24, mainly driven by growth in the services sector, followed by industry and livestock. Higher public and private sector investments, stable exchange rates, moderating inflation, and rising per capita income supported growth.
The per capita income slightly increased to $1,824 in FY25 from $1,680 in FY24. However, it was $1,551 in FY23, $1,766 in FY22 and $1,677 in FY21. This suggests the deterioration of the standard of living and well-being of almost all segments of society with no tangible increase in personal incomes.
It may lead to decreased disposable income, limiting individuals’ ability to afford goods and services, save, or invest.
Agriculture sector
The agriculture sector will post a modest growth of 0.56pc in FY25. This indicates that the agriculture sector faced setbacks, with important crops contracting by 13.49pc in FY25 compared to a healthy increase in important crops last year.
Important crops dipped due to a decline of 8.91pc in wheat production this year. The provincial crop reporting services estimated that wheat production may fall to 28.98 million tonnes from 31.81m tonnes last year. Maize production fell 15.4pc to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes last year, rice production fell 1.38pc to 9.72m tonnes, from 9.86m tonnes, sugarcane by 3.88pc to 84.24m tonnes from 87.64m tonnes and a 30.7pc in cotton production to 7.08m bales from 10.22m bales last year.
Despite a 16.6pc reduction in the production of grams, other crops posted a provisional growth of 4.78pc. The production of potatoes saw an increase of 11.5pc to 9.40m tonnes from 8.43m tonnes, onion by 15.9pc from 2.30 to 2.67m tonnes, mango by 26.7pc from 2.09 to 2.65m tonnes and sesame by 44.7pc from 0.30 to 0.44m tonnes. While cotton ginning and miscellaneous components declined by 19.03pc, livestock, fores­t­­ry and fishing posted provisional growth rates of 4.72pc, 3.03pc and 1.42pc.
Industrial sector
The industry provisionally demonstrated a growth of 4.77pc in 2024-25. Despite a 2.84pc rise in coal production, the mining and quarrying sector experienced a contraction of 3.38pc. This decline is attributed to lower production of natural gas, which fell by 7.05pc, crude oil, down by 14.72pc, and other minerals.
 
 

The Large-Scale Manufacturing, as indicated by the Quantum Index of Manufacturing (QIM) for the first nine months of FY25, experienced a decline of 1.53pc, reflecting a mixed trend in the production across different groups. The electricity, gas and water supply sector witnessed a notable growth of 28.88pc, primarily attributed to the low-base effect from FY24. The construction sector recorded a rise of 6.61pc, which was attributed to heightened expenditures on construction-related activities by both the private sector and the general government.
Services industry
The services sector also grew 2.91pc in 2024-25, bolstered by favourable contributions from all its components. The wholesale and retail trade sector experienced a slight increase of 0.14pc, which was attributed to a deceleration in output growth within the agriculture and manufacturing industries.
The transport and storage sector has seen a rise of 2.20pc, which is attributed to the growth in output across water, air, and road transport. The information and communication sector grew 6.48pc driven by a notable increase of 24pc in the output of computer programming and consultancy activities.

In a late-night determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.
Conversely, the regulator worked out the revenue requirement for Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) at Rs535bn for FY26 and set its prescribed price at Rs1,895 per mmBTU, about Rs117 per unit higher than the current year’s Rs1,778 per unit to cover an estimated revenue shortfall of Rs43bn next year.
The average consumer gas prices currently stand at Rs1,770 per unit, which means the government would have to increase consumer gas rates by Rs125 per unit or about 7pc to Rs1,895 with effect from July 1.
Under the practice in vogue, the government has to adopt higher per unit cost of the gas company for uniform consumer-end tariff i.e. in this case Rs1895 per unit for SNGPL. The difference between the applicable consumer rate and lower determined prescribed price of the other gas company then becomes the gas development surcharge – a source of revenue for provincial governments based on their quantum of gas production.
Ogra stated that SSGCL and SNGPL determinations have been sent to the federal government for category-wise natural gas sale price advice as required under Section 8(3) of the Ogra Ordinance. The government has the right to change the consumer rates recommended by Ogra in a manner that it did not affect the revenue requirements worked out by the regulator.
