Docks police, in a statement, said that the male victim was gunned down while his wife was shot and injured by her father inside a home near Ayesha Masjid in Machar Colony.
The body and the injured woman were shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi, and further investigation is underway, the statement added. However, the woman passed away during treatment, said Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
South-DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the couple had married of their own free will and had a four-month-old daughter. They had been living in a rented house in Machar Colony for the last five months.
During the initial probe, it emerged that the deceased woman had phoned her father three days ago, Raza said. The father was living with her.
The couple was asleep when the suspect gunned down his son-in-law and injured his daughter and then fled the scene.
The police collected four spent bullet casings from the crime scene, the DIG said.
Earlier in December, a woman and her teenage daughter were stabbed to death over “honour” in the Gizri area of Karachi.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-12-24 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/242140518fe7114.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963000/pti-rejects-govts-offer-for-negotiations-cites-directions-from-imran' target='_blank'><strong>PTI rejects govt’s offer for negotiations; cites directions from Imran</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Later that day, Akram appeared on ARY News programme ‘The 11th Hour’, where he was asked if the PTI wants to negotiate with the government. He categorically said that the party was “not interested” in talks.
“I met Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and he said that Imran instructed the party not to engage with the government in any way,“ Akram explained.
“He also ordered that if anyone approaches Achakzai sahib or Allama Raja Nasir sahib for any matter, they have the authority to decide whether or not they want to talk,” he added, referring to Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leaders Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.
Akram further said that the two opposition alliance leaders would decide how to respond to the government’s invitation. He added that, while speaking with the TTAP, he noted that other “friends” within the alliance are in favour of talks.
“Since Imran Khan instructed the PTI against starting talks, under the directions of Salman Akram Raja, we rejected the offer,” he said.







Asked if the party would announce a protest movement, Akram said that, unless a direct order is issued by Imran, Achakzai has the power to call a strike.
“He called for a wheel-jam strike on February 8,” he added. “We have activities to carry out on our own; then we participate as part of an alliance.“
“When the alliance makes a call, we will be ready, but there must be mobilisation or preparedness. So he gave the KP chief minister the responsibility to start the street movement.”
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by TTAP, the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.
After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024, and the release of PTI prisoners.
The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped.
However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the party.</p><small>2025-12-24 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24200445b55f7f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962998/punjab-assembly-passes-kite-flying-regulation-bill' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly passes kite flying regulation bill</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Thursday passed the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, with a majority vote, introducing a comprehensive legal framework to regulate kite flying across the province to protect human life and property.
The bill, which cleared the assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on December 15, proposed a near-total ban on kite-flying, except on specific days and designated locations across the province, with strict penalties to curb fatal accidents and property damage.
The bill will now be sent to the governor for his signature to make it an act of the provincial assembly.
Under the new regulations, the use of metallic wire, nylon string, and chemically or glass-coated kite strings has been completely banned. It prescribes strict punishments for flying, manufacturing, storing, or selling kites without permission.
According to the bill, violating the restrictions on kite flying may result in imprisonment ranging from three to five years, a fine of up to Rs2 million, or both.
Manufacturing or selling kites and prohibited strings carries even harsher penalties, including five to seven years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs5m.
In cases where children are found violating the law, action will be taken under the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018. If fines imposed on minors are not paid, authorities will be empowered to recover the amount from parents or legal guardians as arrears.
The offences under the law have been declared non-bailable and cognizable.
Deputy commissioners have been authorised to grant conditional permission for kite flying on specified days and at designated locations. During permitted kite flying, mandatory safety measures for motorcyclists will be enforced.
It further makes registration compulsory for the manufacturing and sale of approved kites and strings. Selling kites or permitted equipment without registration may result in imprisonment from one to five years, a fine, or both.
Police have also been empowered to make arrests without a warrant in such cases. Officers with the rank of sub-inspector or above have been authorised to conduct searches and seize prohibited material.
The bill added that the provincial government may also grant arrest and search powers to other agencies and a formal mechanism has been introduced for the registration and cancellation of kite flying associations, with deputy commissioners empowered to revoke registrations in case of violations.
It also provides a multi-tier right of appeal at the magistrate, deputy commissioner, and commissioner levels. It includes a provision for rewarding informers with up to Rs5,000 for reporting violations.
The new legislation repeals the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2001 and grants the government full authority to frame rules, regulations, and guidelines for the effective implementation of the law.
As per the rules, which were notified last Sunday, kite manufacturers, traders or sellers of authorised kite flying material must apply to the DC and provide specified documents.
Kite flying associations can also register themselves with the DCs concerned through an online application by the association president or general secretary.
The DCs must verify the contents of applications and documents within 10 days of receiving them. Upon verification, the DC shall decide the application and issue a certificate of registration having a one-year validity.
Specifications for permitted kites were also shared. A ‘patang’ shall not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length, while a ‘gudda’ cannot exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
‘Dor’ (string) must be made of cotton with not more than nine threads and no less than 28 counts. The string must be wound in the shape of a ball, since spools are prohibited.
The Punjab government lifted a ban on the Basant festival after 18 years, with the festival slated to be celebrated in February next year. It was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp kite strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders.</p><small>2025-12-24 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24184832e235916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962993/pcb-receives-12-bids-for-two-new-psl-franchises' target='_blank'><strong>PCB receives 12 bids for two new PSL franchises</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday announced that it has received an “exceptional and encouraging” response to its tender for the sale of two new franchises of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), with 12 parties submitting bids within the stipulated deadline.
This comes after the bidding deadline was extended multiple times — initially from December 15 to December 22, and further to December 24 — amid growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond, following promotional roadshows in London and New York.
The development marks a significant step in the league’s expansion to eight teams from the 2026 season — its first major restructuring since the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018 brought the total to six franchises.
According to the PCB, the bidders hail from five countries — the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan — underscoring the league’s growing global footprint and commercial appeal.
Pakistan-based solar power company Inverex Power Solution, a long-time sponsor of the PSL, also confirmed on Wednesday that it will be bidding for one of the two new franchises.
Reports suggest other interested parties include telecom companies, real estate groups, and consortia involving US-based Pakistani businessmen.
The PCB said the outcome of the initial phase of the bidding process will be announced on December 27. In the next stage, bidders who meet the technical requirements will be invited to take part in an open competition bidding process for the acquisition of the two new teams.
This phase is scheduled to be held on January 8 at the Islamabad Convention Centre.
The PCB reiterated its commitment to conducting the entire process in a transparent and competitive manner, in line with international standards, with the aim of ensuring the sustained expansion and long-term growth of the PSL.
The expansion follows the conclusion of the original 10-year franchise agreements after the 2025 edition, during which five of the existing six teams — Islamabad United, Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators — renewed their rights under revised valuations conducted by Ernst & Young.
The status of Multan Sultans remains unresolved amid ongoing disputes.
The successful bidders for the new teams will select from a shortlist of cities including Hyderabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad and Sialkot.
The 11th edition of the PSL is scheduled to run from March 26 to May 3, 2026, overlapping with the Indian Premier League, in the April-May window aimed at improving overseas player availability.
The tournament will feature a revised format to accommodate the eight teams within a 39-day period, with matches potentially spread across additional venues including Faisalabad.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/241925303d330c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962997/police-constable-martyred-in-crossfire-at-wanas-rustam-bazaar' target='_blank'><strong>Police constable martyred in crossfire at Wana’s Rustam Bazaar</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A police constable was killed on Wednesday during a crossfire between two rival groups at the busy Rustam Bazaar in Wana, officials said.
The incident occurred when an exchange of fire erupted between the two sides during a confrontation, claiming the life of Constable Islamuddin Wazir, who was deployed on law-and-order duty in the local market.
“He sustained critical injuries and succumbed on the spot,“ said police.
“Constable Islamuddin Wazir was performing his official duties to maintain peace and public safety when he was hit by bullets during the crossfire,” said police officials.
Following the incident, panic spread in the marketplace, prompting police to immediately cordon off the area and bring the situation under control.
City Police Station Wana SHO Razaullah Wazir confirmed that two suspects involved in the firing had been arrested and taken to the station, where an FIR has been registered at the CTD South Waziristan police station.
DSP Wana Imranullah stated, “Under the directives of the DPO, raids were underway to arrest other suspects and bring all those responsible to justice.”
The funeral prayers of the martyred constable were offered with full state honours at Police Lines, Wana, attended by senior government and police officials, family members, and a large number of local elders.
After the funeral prayers, the body of Constable Islamuddin Wazir was transported to his native village, Sanga in Tehsil Shakai, where he was laid to rest.
Police in Lower South Waziristan paid tribute to the sacrifice of the martyred constable and reiterated their resolve that “the sacrifices of martyrs would not go in vain.”
“Efforts to protect the lives and property of citizens and maintain peace in the district will continue with full commitment,” they stated.
Meanwhile, local political and social circles expressed deep sorrow over the incident and called for a “strict ban” on the display and use of weapons in Rustam Bazaar and other markets to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A few months ago, the residents had voiced their concerns against the open display of firearms and the free movement of armed men in the Rustam Bazaar area, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.
They accused police and other law enforcement agencies of being mere spectators while influential and armed individuals enjoyed complete impunity. They said this environment had created a growing sense of insecurity and fear among the public.
A shutter-down strike had also been observed in May, with hundreds of people taking to the streets in Wana against the deteriorating law and order situation, rising incidents of abductions for ransom, extortion, and bomb blasts.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24181831a95bcb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962995/in-pictures-the-world-prepares-for-holiday-festivities-on-christmas-eve' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: The world prepares for holiday festivities on Christmas Eve</strong></a><br><p>As Christmas approaches, people around the globe have been preparing for the holiday season by buying decorations and food, praying, and presenting gifts to one another.

Ever since Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to go into space in 1961, Russia has prided itself as a leading power in space exploration, but in recent decades it has fallen behind the United States and, increasingly, China.
Russia’s ambitions suffered a massive blow in August 2023 when its unmanned Luna-25 mission smashed into the surface of the moon while attempting to land, and Elon Musk has revolutionised the launch of space vehicles - once a Russian speciality.
Is that a nuclear reactor on the moon?
Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, said in a statement that it planned to build a lunar power plant by 2036 and signed a contract with the Lavochkin Association aerospace company to do it.
Roscosmos did not say explicitly that the plant would be nuclear but it said the participants included Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom and the Kurchatov Institute, Russia’s leading nuclear research institute.
Roscosmos said the purpose of the plant was to power Russia’s lunar programme, including rovers, an observatory and the infrastructure of the joint Russian-Chinese International Lunar Research Station.
“The project is an important step towards the creation of a permanently functioning scientific lunar station and the transition from one-time missions to a long-term lunar exploration programme,” Roscosmos said.
The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Bakanov, said in June that one of the corporation’s aims was to put a nuclear power plant on the moon and to explore Venus, known as earth’s “sister” planet.
The moon, which is 384,400 km (238,855 miles) from our planet, moderates the earth’s wobble on its axis, which ensures a more stable climate. It also causes tides in the world’s oceans.
US also plans a reactor on the moon
Russia is not the only one with such plans. NASA in August declared its intent to put a nuclear reactor on the moon by the first quarter of fiscal year 2030.
“We’re in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon. And to have a base on the moon, we need energy,” US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said in August, when asked about the plans.
He added that the United States was currently behind in the race to the moon. He said energy was essential to allow life to be sustained on the moon and thence for humans to get to Mars.
International rules ban putting nuclear weapons in space but there are no bans on putting nuclear energy sources into space - as long as they comply with certain rules.
Some space analysts have predicted a lunar gold rush: NASA says there are estimates of a million tonnes of Helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on earth, on the moon.
Rare earth metals - used in smartphones, computers and advanced technologies - are also present on the moon, including scandium, yttrium and the 15 lanthanides, according to research by Boeing.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24180136968d173.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962988/4-children-injured-in-quadcopter-attack-in-kps-kurram' target='_blank'><strong>4 children injured in quadcopter attack in KP’s Kurram</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least four children were injured in the Gondalabad area of Kurram district on Wednesday after a quadcopter attack, said official sources.
For months, militants in the region have used quadcopters to drop explosives on security forces and the current year has seen an increase in such attacks.
In today’s attack, a quadcopter released its explosive payload over a residential area. As a result, three boys and a girl sustained injuries, confirmed official sources.
The injured minors were shifted to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment.
Security sources condemned the attack, calling it “an act of violence against innocent civilians and children”.
“Such incidents reflect a deliberate targeting of non-combatants and have nothing to do with religion or humanitarian values,” they added.
An investigation into the incident is underway, while security in the area has been tightened following the attack.
Last week, two women and two teenagers were injured in a quadcopter attack in the Janikhel area of Bannu district. A week before the Bannu attack, another attack in the same area injured four people, including two children.
Earlier in the month, three boys were killed, and another was injured when a quadcopter crashed in a residential area of Mamand Khel in Bannu.
Also in December, at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground in Lakki Marwat.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2419173588af668.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962990/military-top-brass-says-no-malicious-interest-political-or-otherwise-will-be-tolerated' target='_blank'><strong>Military top brass says no malicious interest, political or otherwise, will be tolerated</strong></a><br><p>The military’s top brass on Wednesday vowed that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity would be tolerated, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
These remarks were made at the 273rd Corps Commanders’ Conference, which was convened at General Headquarters (GHQ) Rawalpindi and chaired by Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The forum categorically rejected the nexus between terrorism, crime, and vested political interests,” the ISPR’s statement read.
“It resolved that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity, security and stability would be tolerated, nor would anyone be allowed to create divisions between the Armed Forces and the people of Pakistan.”
Paying tribute to security personnel martyred in counter-terrorism operations and civilians who “laid down their lives in recent terrorist incidents”, the forum noted that Pakistan’s gradual progress towards stability, greater opportunities and respect was the product of a joint effort by the government, the military and law enforcement agencies (LEAs).

The army high command also conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment, with particular emphasis on evolving threats and operational preparedness.
“The participants reaffirmed that all terrorists under the tutelage of Indian sponsors, along with their facilitators and abettors, would be dealt with decisively and without exception,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the participants also appreciated the Balochistan Special Development Initiatives, which the ISPR said in the statement are “directed towards local empowerment and social engagements to address challenges of terrorism related to governance”.
“The participants noted the need for similar public-centric initiatives elsewhere, also in line with [the] National Action Plan, to ensure enduring peace and stability,” the statement read.
The ISPR further said that the forum reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Kashmiri and Palestinian self-determination, additionally calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, uninterrupted humanitarian access and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.
“In his concluding remarks, the COAS and CDF directed commanders to maintain the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, training, physical fitness, technological innovations and battlefield adaptability,” the statement read.
“He expressed full confidence in Pakistan Army’s capability to effectively counter [the] complete spectrum of threats, ranging from conventional and sub-conventional to hybrid and asymmetric challenges, while steadfastly safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><small>2025-12-24 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2418271362c77d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962989/un-expert-decries-bushra-bibis-detention-urges-communication-with-lawyers-family' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Bushra Bibi’s detention; urges communication with lawyers, family</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations (UN) expert on Wednesday warned that Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan, is being “detained in circumstances that could pose a serious risk to her physical and mental integrity”.
Bushra is serving a seven-year sentence in the £190 million corruption case. She was recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case, which revolved around the purchase of an expensive jewelry set gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during his May 2021 visit.
“The state has an obligation to protect Mrs. Khan’s health and ensure conditions of detention compatible with human dignity,” Alice Jills Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur, said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
Earlier in May, the Adiala prison administration submitted a detailed report to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), stating that Bushra was receiving a range of special facilities at the prison, with accommodation provided to her under the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978, including medical care, private lodging, and access to entertainment and legal resources.
According to the report, Bushra had been afforded amenities aimed at ensuring her “health, comfort, and legal rights”.
Bushra has access to a dedicated woman medical officer who conducts twice-daily health checks. She has also been provided with a private, spacious room equipped with a cot, mattress, furniture, and climate-control measures such as ceiling fans and an air cooler during summer, the report added.
The UN special rapporteur added that the “conditions and locations of detention must take into account the age, sex and health circumstances of detainees”.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Edwards claimed that Bushra was “frequently placed in near-total isolation for more than 22 hours a day, sometimes for periods exceeding ten days, without access to exercise, reading material, legal counsel, family visits, or her personal physicians.”
The UN expert further urged the authorities to ensure that the former first lady could “communicate with her lawyers, receive visits from family members, and have meaningful human contact throughout her detention.”
Earlier this month, the same UN special rapporteur warned that Imran was being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.</p><small>2025-12-24 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24193644cce0dbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962996/post-pregnancy-yoga-tips-every-new-mother-should-know' target='_blank'><strong>Post-pregnancy yoga tips every new mother should know</strong></a><br><p>Motherhood begins with immense joy, but soon, physical and mental exhaustion step in. The body feels unfamiliar, and the mind rides an emotional roller coaster. In the middle of sleepless nights and feeding schedules, self-care quietly fades away. The “baby blues” often step in, leaving many mothers feeling fragile and overwhelmed. Yet, recovery is not a luxury but a necessity. And that’s where post-pregnancy yoga steps in. It serves as a gentle bridge between healing the body and calming the mind.
From hormonal fluctuations to weakened core and pelvic muscles, after childbirth, a woman’s body undergoes dramatic changes. Back pain, fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings are common complaints. In today’s fast-paced world, many mothers feel pressured to “get back in shape” quickly, but healing takes time, and the body deserves patience.
Yoga offers far more than physical exercise, as it is a complete system of self-recovery. Gentle asanas strengthen the pelvic floor, back, and abdominal muscles. Breathing practices calm the mind and uplift mood, while relaxation improves sleep and restores energy.
Many new mothers regain calm and confidence within weeks of consistent practice. Even ten mindful minutes a day can bring grounding amid the beautiful chaos of motherhood.
Every woman’s recovery timeline is different. For those who had a normal delivery, gentle yoga may begin after one month. After a Caesarean birth, yoga is suggested after 4 months, with medical clearance. Begin with breath-work and restorative poses before slowly moving to core-strengthening practices.

Gentle postnatal poses for every mother
Setu Bandhasana (bridge pose)
This gentle backbend strengthens the lower back, glutes, and pelvic floor while opening the chest and shoulders.
How to do it: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet hip-width apart, press through your feet to lift the hips, hold for a few breaths, and then slowly lower down.
Bhujangasana (cobra pose)
The cobra pose tones the spine, opens the chest, and improves posture, often strained by breastfeeding and baby care.
How to do it: Lie face down, place palms beside the chest, inhale to lift the chest off the floor while keeping the elbows slightly bent, hold briefly, and exhale to release.
Phalakasana (plank pose)
Plank pose strengthens the core, shoulders, and arms while improving posture and endurance during postpartum recovery.
How to do it: Begin on hands and knees, extend your legs back into a straight line from head to heels, engage your core, hold for 30–60 seconds, then release. Keep your knees down at the beginning.
Navasana (boat pose)
It’s a beneficial posture for postpartum recovery as it helps engage and strengthen the core muscles. Focus on gentle tightening of the belly rather than pushing too hard. If you have had a Caesarean or are healing from abdominal separation, check with your doctor before trying the full pose.
How to do it: Sit with knees bent and feet flat, lean back slightly, lift your feet off the floor, and balance on your sitting bones. Hold for a few breaths, then relax. Start slowly with bent knees or hand support. Always consult your doctor before attempting the full pose.

Kegel exercise: The invisible strength builder
Kegel exercises are a simple yet powerful way to restore pelvic strength after childbirth. They help improve bladder control, posture, and even enhance overall confidence.
How to do it: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently tighten the muscles you’d use to stop urination mid-way, hold for five seconds, then relax. Repeat about twenty times a day.
A few minutes of this invisible workout can make a remarkable difference — strengthening from within and supporting a mother’s recovery journey with grace.

A consortium headed by the Arif Habib Corporation emerged as the top bidder in a live-televised auction for a 75 per cent stake in PIA on Tuesday, marking a breakthrough for the government’s long-delayed privatisation of the carrier.
The Arif Habib consortium offered Rs135 billion, surpassing a government reserve price of Rs100bn, in a sharp turnaround from last year’s failed sale attempt.
Muhammad Ali, the privatisation adviser to the prime minister, told Reuters in an online interview that the state expects a new owner to be running the airline by April, subject to approvals.
The process now moves to final approvals by the Privatisation Commission board and the cabinet, expected within days, with contract signing likely within two weeks and financial close after a 90-day period to meet regulatory and legal conditions.
Ali said the government would receive about Rs10bn in cash upfront and retain a 25pc stake valued at around Rs45billion.
The deal was structured to inject fresh capital into the airline rather than simply transfer ownership, he said.
“We did not want a situation where the government sells the airline, takes its money and the company still collapses,” Ali said.
The winning consortium also comprises fertiliser maker Fatima, private school network City Schools and real estate firm Lake City Holdings Limited.
Ali said Fauji Fertiliser Company did not bid but could still join the winning consortium as a partner, noting the buyer can add up to two partners including a consortium partner or a foreign airline if they meet the qualifying criteria.
Allowing partners adds financial strength and could bring global aviation expertise, he said.
Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process.
IMF pressure
Ali said safeguards, including retained earnest money and an additional payment on signing, would allow the government to move to the second-highest bidder if the deal fails to close.
On labour, Ali said the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged, adding that the PIA workforce has already shrunk in recent years.
The sale is closely watched by the International Monetary Fund, which has pressed Pakistan to halt losses at state-owned enterprises.
Ali said the privatisation was a key test of Pakistan’s reform credibility with the IMF, adding that failure to offload loss-making state firms risked renewed pressure on public finances.
He said closing the deal would signal momentum on reforms and privatisations, adding that the government was working through a pipeline of future transactions once PIA closes.
‘Haven’t lost our pride’
Separately, Ali also addressed a press briefing in Islamabad, where he said the process for the “strategic sale” of PIA was initiated 20 years ago. An attempt to sell the airline had also been made last year, which unfortunately had not been successful, he recalled.
The latest attempt, which resulted in the airline’s sale, was a result of six months of persistent efforts, hard work, due diligence and cooperation of all stakeholders, he said, adding that the process was completed with the guidance of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He recalled that there was a time, around 50 years ago, when PIA was operating around 50 aircraft. The number should have increased to 100-115 by now, but the airline was presently operating just 18 planes, he added.
“We reached this stage because several mistakes have been committed in the past, over the years,” Ali said, adding that the private sector was best-suited to run such businesses. “It‘s not the government’s job to run businesses.”
He further stated that now private entities would invest in the airline, more planes would be added to its fleet, aircraft would be revamped and service quality would improve.
Ali once again lauded PM Shehbaz for his guidance and support, adding that CDF Munir also played an “important role” and there was “total commitment from his side. He also guided us”.
He also acknowledged the support from Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and other members of the cabinet.
Ali also addressed the criticism on the transaction, adding that it was being said that the government was to receive just Rs10bn from the total bidding amount.
Under the transaction arrangement for PIA’s privatisation, the government is to get 7.5pc of the total bidding amount, which adds up to around Rs10bn, and the rest 92.5pc is to be injected back into the airline.
But, Ali contended that the government was getting a “value of Rs55bn”.
He explained: “The most difficult task in this transaction was to ensure that while selling PIA, we ensure that the new buyer invests money back into the company. So, we had to achieve both objectives.
“So our structuring was such that we get Rs10bn in cash and the value of our equities is Rs45bn. So the government will get a value of Rs55bn in total, and Rs125bn will flow back into PIA.
“In total, the valuation of PIA is Rs180bn.”
During a detailed presentation about the history of PIA, Ali pointed out that from 2015 to 2024, the airline incurred losses of Rs500bn over a period of 10 years.
In this connection, he said the government was being criticised for removing liabilities.
But, “who would buy this (PIA) with all those losses?” Ali questioned..
Defending the airline‘s privatisation and identifying areas where it had been lagging, he remarked, “We haven‘t lost our pride. There is no pride in owning airlines. But, pride is lost when our airline’s [aircraft] don‘t fly. Who knows, after a year or two the airline maybe wouldn’t have been able to [carry out] flights.”
The airline, he asserted, was privatised at the right time.
Referring to Arif Habib Corporation’s statement that they were planning to expand the PIA fleet up to 65 aircraft in four years, he said, “We can see how the thinking is changing.“
He also maintained that the impression that there were no liabilities in PIA was incorrect. “We are transferring RS180bn liabilities to the new buyer,” the PM’s adviser said.
He explained that the government had only removed the long-term debt otherwise, nobody would have invested in buying the airline.
Now, following PIA‘s sale, the government would initially get two-thirds of the total payment from the buyer and later the rest of the amount. Until one-third of the payment was made in the second installment, the buyer’s shares would remain pledged with the government.
“We have also taken standby letters of credit and a demand promissory note. So we have ensured that the government is protected,” he detailed, further stating that some privileges were offered to the buyers that “are necessary to run a business in a profitable manner”.
The buyer was exempted from general sales tax payment, and no other taxes, levies or surchage would be imposed on airline operations, Ali said, adding that companies part of the winning consortium would also establish a special purpose vehicle to avoid double taxation.
Moreover, the successful bidder had access to a large captive market, he said.</p><small>2025-12-24 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2417204959f93ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962983/uae-president-al-nahyan-to-make-first-official-visit-to-pakistan-on-dec-26-fo' target='_blank'><strong>UAE President Al Nahyan to make first official visit to Pakistan on Dec 26: FO</strong></a><br><p>The President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, will arrive in Pakistan for an official visit on December 26 (Friday), according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO) issued on Wednesday.
This will be the second time the Emirati president will visit Pakistan this year, having met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Rahim Yar Khan in January. However, Friday’s trip, according to the FO, will be his first official visit as president.
According to the statement, President Al-Nahyan will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations with PM Shehbaz and the pair will “exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest”.
“The visit will provide an important opportunity to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates,” the FO said.
The FO added that the visit reflects the depth of bilateral relations between both nations and their shared commitment to bolster collaboration in key areas, including trade, investment, energy, development and regional stability.







Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-24 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24143836b4b38fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962977/27-cops-martyred-in-134-terrorist-attacks-in-2025-says-bannu-dig' target='_blank'><strong>27 cops martyred in 134 terrorist attacks in 2025, says Bannu DIG</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan said on Wednesday that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025.
He made the remarks while addressing a press briefing at his office, where he gave a detailed breakdown of the overall law and order situation in the district and operations carried out against terrorist elements.
According to the DIG, Bannu police conducted comprehensive, well-organised and result-oriented operations against militants.
He said the data showed that during 2025, a total of 134 terrorist attacks targeted police stations, police posts, checkpoints, police mobiles and police parties.
In these attacks, 27 police personnel were martyred, while 79 sustained injuries. In retaliatory action by police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured, he said.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists and the elimination of 65 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
He further stated that police and security forces jointly conducted successful operations in the areas of Miryan, Haved, Daud Shah, Mamand Khel and Domel. During these joint operations, one police constable was martyred while 11 police personnel and five civilians were injured, he said.
As a result of these operations, 22 terrorists were killed and four were arrested, and several terrorist hideouts and houses were also demolished.
He also said that terrorists had carried out 20 drone attacks targeting police installations and civilian populations, in which 19 police personnel were injured. Further, nine civilians were martyred and 33 were injured, he said.
However, following the installation of an anti-drone system on July 18, a significant improvement was observed, with over 300 drone attacks thwarted and four drones neutralised.

 

DIG Khan said that despite limited resources, various security measures were implemented to protect police installations, including the installation of barriers, bunkers, double boundary walls, bullet-proof gates and CCTV cameras.
He said that work had also begun on the Safe City Project to further enhance the safety of both police personnel and the general public.
He added that for coordinated action against terrorists, jirgas were held with local elders in different areas, yielding positive results, and peace committees were formed.
With public cooperation, militant attacks on several police stations and checkposts were successfully thwarted, while effective operations were carried out in Kakki, Bharath, Khojri, Bargantu, Sheikh Landak, and other areas, he said.
According to the DIG, in order to align Bannu police with modern requirements, the force had been equipped with drones, anti-drone guns, sniper rifles, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), thermal imaging systems, tactical helmets and bullet-proof vehicles.
He reaffirmed his commitment that Bannu police would continue its struggle to maintain law and order in the district, efforts to eliminate terrorism, and ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public.</p><small>2025-12-24 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24111943dcb0a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962969/asif-says-govt-satisfied-with-pia-sale-sees-it-having-great-symbolic-value' target='_blank'><strong>Asif says govt satisfied with PIA sale, sees it having great ‘symbolic value’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that the government was satisfied with the sale of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), adding that it had great “symbolic value”.
He expressed these views on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ when asked whether the government was satisfied with the process.







“Yes, the government is satisfied. This is the first biggest transaction of our privatisation process. This transaction has a great symbolic value,“ he said, recalling that previously First Women Bank had also been privatised but that transaction was not as big.
A consortium led by the Arif Habib group won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) on Tuesday with a bid of Rs135 billion after a competitive, televised process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
The sale is a central plank of the government’s plan to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout programme.
Speaking about the matter on ‘Geo Pakistan’, Asif said the PIA sale had “symbolic value because of the history of this transaction“.
Four years ago, he said, the country’s entire aviation sector had suffered following a statement by a then-minister from the PTI.
He was apparently referring to former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement in June 2020 during a parliamentary session. Khan had said investigations revealed that more than 262 of the country’s 860 active pilots either held fake licences or had cheated in their exams.
Following the then-minister’s statement, European and UK authorities had ban­ned PIA from their territories, which were the airline’s most profitable routes. A number of foreign airlines had also grounded Pak­istani-origin pilots over concerns about their licences.
The developments followed the crash of a PIA flight from Lahore near Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­national Airport in 2020, killing around 100 people.
Asif said these events had led to PIA going “almost bankrupt”, adding that the government then restructured the company. “The government itself owned a big portion of its liability and only nominal liability remained,“ he said. “Against this backdrop, yesterday’s transaction is a very successful one.”
He also credited the civil aviation department for its considerable contribution in the matter and seeing the transaction through. “We went through a painstaking process,” he said, adding that PIA was now operating flights to Manchester.
The minister further stated that the airline now also had permission to operate flights to Birmingham and London, but it did not have aircraft for those flights. Similarly, he continued, PIA now also had permission to operate flights to New York and around 14-15 destinations in Europe.
The defence minister also appeared to be defending the arrangement under which the government is to receive just 7.5 per cent — around Rs10bn — of the amount from the PIA sale, saying that investing a “bigger portion” back into the airline increased its value.
He said the government still held 25pc of PIA’s shares and 92.5 of the amount from the sale being invested back into the airline was actually an investment into a national asset.
“We did not give a handout to anyone,” he asserted, adding that the country had borne losses for 50-55 years following nationalisation of businesses.
He also blamed the bureaucracy for state-owned enterprises’ losses, adding that politicians likely shared some responsibility for these losses as well.
“We have to construct such transactions [as that of PIA‘s sale] to rid [the national exchequer] of these losses. We don’t have a choice. We are beggars, not the choosers,” Asif said, adding that several other transactions were to be carried out in the future.
In this connection, he also mentioned that two power distribution companies in Sindh and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were facing severe losses.
When the anchorperson pointed out that Asif had held Khan responsible for losses in the aviation sector in recent years and asked whether action would be taken over such matters, Asif said action would be taken.
“There is no other option. These people should be held answerable,” he said.
He said often retired bureaucrats would become part of boards of state-owned enterprises and earn in millions.
“This is an orgy of loot and plunder of the public sector that has been going on in our country for the past 55 years,” he commented. “The existence of a sick public sector is actually supported or pushed by the bureaucracy […] The government is largely responsible for it, and they [bureaucrats] are the major beneficiaries of this loot and plunder.”
Asked about over-staffing in PIA, he said even if a little more had to be paid to the employees than the actual payable amount to “get rid of them”, then it should be paid.
“Because the purpose should be to stop the continuous bleeding.”
Asked about the possibility of talks between the government and opposition, he said issues on which dialogue was to be held should be decided first.</p><small>2025-12-24 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24112922cba1800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962970/finance-minister-says-pakistans-economy-shifting-toward-export-led-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister says Pakistan’s economy shifting toward export-led growth</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that Pakistan had reached a critical turning point, with macroeconomic stability, sustained reforms, and policy continuity restoring confidence and steering the economy toward export-led, long-term growth.
In an interview with USA Today, the minister said this was opening new horizons for domestic and global investors, and positioning the country for sustainable, long-term economic growth.
He said this transition was enabled by macroeconomic stabilisation, easing inflation and improved external balances, with the government driving export-led, productivity-based growth through structural reforms, sustaining reform momentum despite challenges, and actively encouraging global investment in emerging opportunities across agriculture, minerals, technology and climate resilience.

 

He noted that, for the first time in several years, Pakistan had achieved both a primary fiscal surplus and a current account surplus, signalling a decisive shift away from the cycle of recurring deficits.
He said that strong remittance inflows had played a critical role in supporting this turnaround, while inflation had fallen sharply from a peak of 38 per cent to single-digit levels.
He also noted that foreign exchange reserves had risen to over $14.5 billion, providing import cover of approximately two-and-a-half months, while the exchange rate had remained stable, helping to restore investor confidence.
Aurangzeb emphasised that while macroeconomic stabilisation was an essential foundation, sustainable growth remained the central challenge.
He pointed out that the economic growth of 2.7pc in the previous fiscal year, though positive, was insufficient to absorb the needs of a rapidly growing population.
He underlined that Pakistan was consciously moving away from a consumption and debt-driven growth model toward an export-led strategy.
The current budget, he explained, reflected this shift through structural reforms in taxation, energy pricing, and state-owned enterprises, alongside far-reaching tariff reforms aimed at dismantling decades of protectionism and enhancing global competitiveness.
He highlighted that Pakistan was aligning its economic strategy with changing global demand patterns, identifying information technology services, textiles, and agricultural exports as key areas with strong potential.
He said efforts were also underway to simplify the tax regime for exporters and reduce bureaucratic hurdles in order to foster long-term productivity and competitiveness.
Addressing the broader reform agenda, Aurangzeb said that the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, tariff liberalisation, and restructuring of the energy sector were designed to address deep-rooted inefficiencies that had historically strained public finances.
He said that these reforms were part of a long-term vision, echoing the World Bank’s (WB) assessment of Pakistan’s potential “East Asia moment”.
He referred to the ten-year Country Partnership Framework with the WB, the first of its kind, which placed an emphasis on economic reform alongside climate resilience and population management.
The minister stressed that Pakistan’s future hinged on addressing existential challenges beyond fiscal indicators.
Population growth, climate change, child stunting, learning poverty and the exclusion of girls from education were identified as critical issues that must be tackled to safeguard the country’s long-term productive capacity, he said.
Aurangzeb stressed that increasing women’s participation in education and the workforce was both a social imperative and an economic necessity.
On climate resilience, he highlighted Pakistan’s engagement with multilateral partners to strengthen preparedness against frequent floods and droughts.
Acknowledging the risks that remain, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to staying the course of reforms despite geopolitical and domestic challenges. He emphasised that discipline, consistency, and international cooperation remained central to safeguarding recent gains.
Highlighting opportunities for investors, the minister pointed to agriculture, minerals and mining, and the emerging digital economy as priority sectors.
He drew attention to Pakistan’s agricultural potential, the strategic importance of the Tethyan Copper Belt in Balochistan amid rising global demand for critical minerals, and the growing focus on data centres, artificial intelligence, and digital services.
He noted that regulatory frameworks were being updated to support innovation and encourage foreign investment, particularly from the United States, describing technological change as a major game-changer for Pakistan.
In conclusion, Aurangzeb invited global investors and partners to engage with Pakistan through trade, investment, and collaboration.
Emphasising the country’s reform momentum, economic potential, and natural beauty, he reiterated that Pakistan was transitioning from a narrative of crisis management to one of opportunity and transformation, offering promising prospects for those willing to engage with a market on the cusp of sustainable growth.</p><small>2025-12-24 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2411535069d6b48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962971/daytime-movement-of-heavy-vehicles-banned-in-karachi-for-2-months' target='_blank'><strong>Daytime movement of heavy vehicles banned in Karachi for 2 months</strong></a><br><p>The daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles has been banned in Karachi for two months, it emerged on Wednesday.
The development comes as the city has recently witnessed a steep increase in traffic accidents, with many resulting from collisions with heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
A notification issued on Tuesday by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the deputy inspector general of the Karachi Traffic Police had requested the imposition of a ban on the movement of heavy vehicles during the daytime “in order to resolve traffic congestion issues due to the influx of heavy vehicular traffic and to prevent road traffic accidents”.
The notification added that in the interest of protecting human lives and ensuring the smooth flow of traffic, there were sufficient grounds to proceed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to regulate the movement of heavy traffic within the city.
As a result, the Karachi commissioner imposed a complete ban on dumper trucks carrying construction materials in all parts of the city, except between the hours of 10pm and 6am.
He also imposed a ban on the movement of heavy traffic within the city, except between 10pm and 6am. However, this excluded those carrying “essential commodities”, including water, edible oil, liquid nitrogen, meat, skin and medical gases classed as life-saving drugs.
A complete ban was also imposed on the movement of heavy traffic on Jinnah Avenue from Super Highway (M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway) near Saima Pari Classic and Rufi Global City up to Malir Halt, Sharea Faisal.
Three routes were also designated for heavy traffic, excluding dumper trucks carrying construction materials. These included the Super Highway (to New Karachi Industrial area via Slip Road) and the National Highway (to Godown Chowrangi, Younas Chowrangi, Dawood Chowrangi). The third route was the Northern Bypass, through which vehicles can access Gulbai and Mauripur en route to Karachi Port.
An alternate route was also specified from Link Road Kathore to Sassi Toll Plaza.
“The movement of dumpers equipped with approved tracking devices (trackers), whose access data has been integrated with the Karachi Traffic Police monitoring system, is exempted from the restriction timings within the industrial zones of Karachi,” the notification added.
It said the restrictions would remain in place for a period of two months, from Dec 23 to Feb 22, 2026.
This is not the first time a ban has been imposed on the movement of heavy vehicles in Karachi. In February, the provincial government placed a 60-day ban on heavy vehicle traffic in the city exempting certain nighttime hours. In April, this ban was extended for another two months.
On Dec 19, three people were killed in as many traffic accidents in Karachi involving “negligent and careless driving” of heavy vehicles. The previous week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.</p><small>2025-12-24 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24122446dfba616.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962974/india-space-agency-launches-its-heaviest-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>India space agency launches its heaviest satellite</strong></a><br><p>India’s space agency launched its heaviest ever payload on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling the deployment “a significant stride” for the space sector.
The LVM3-M6 rocket launched the US-built AST SpaceMobile communications satellite into low-Earth orbit.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said it was the “heaviest payload to be launched from Indian soil”.
The launch is a boost for India’s ambitious low-cost space programme, with plans for an uncrewed orbital mission and human spaceflight in the coming years.
The satellite, weighing 6,100 kilogrammes (13,448 pounds), was launched on a modified version of a rocket that India plans to use for its future space missions.
India is vying for a larger slice of the booming commercial satellite business as phone, internet and other companies seek expanded and more high-end communications.
Modi said the launch marked “a proud milestone in India’s space journey”.







“It strengthens India’s heavy-lift launch capability and reinforces our growing role in the global commercial launch market,” he said in a statement.
Earlier this year, ISRO launched the CMS-03 communication satellite, which weighs about 4,410 kilogrammes.
For these heavy launches, India has deployed an upgraded version of the rocket it used to send an unmanned craft to the Moon in August 2023.
The world’s most populous nation has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space programme growing considerably, and rivalling the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag.
It has said it plans to launch an uncrewed orbital mission before its first human spaceflight in 2027.
Modi has also announced plans to send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.</p><small>2025-12-24 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24071404678d25d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962954/libyas-top-military-chief-killed-in-plane-crash-in-turkiye' target='_blank'><strong>Libya’s top military chief killed in plane crash in Turkiye</strong></a><br><p>The Libyan army’s chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkiye’s capital Ankara as well as four others that were on the jet as well.
“This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement.
According to the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre, Libya has effectively split into two virtual quasi-states since 2014. The west is ruled by the Government of National Unity (GNU), of which Dbeibah is the prime minister, while the east is run by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar’s Libyan Armed Forces.
Dbeibah said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft.
Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT.







He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district.







He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established.
The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way.
The Tripoli-based GNU said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings.
Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft.
He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated.
Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.</p><small>2025-12-24 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24103222352d419.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962967/gold-tops-4500-silver-and-platinum-hit-records-in-metal-markets-frenzy' target='_blank'><strong>Gold tops $4,500, silver and platinum hit records in metal markets frenzy</strong></a><br><p>Gold surged past the $4,500-an-ounce mark for the first time on Wednesday, while silver and platinum also scaled record highs, as investors piled into precious metals on safe-haven demand and expectations that US interest rates will fall further next year.

“Precious metals have become more of a speculative narrative around the idea that, with de-globalisation, you need an asset that can act as a neutral go-between, without sovereign risk particularly as tensions between the US and China persist,” said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.

 

Thin year-end liquidity exaggerated recent price moves but the broader theme was likely to endure, with gold targeting $5,000 over the next six to twelve months and silver potentially pushing toward $80 as markets respond to key psychological levels, Spivak added.
Gold has surged more than 70pc this year, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by safe-haven demand, expectations of US rate cuts, robust central-bank buying, de-dollarisation trends and ETF inflows, with traders pricing in two rate cuts next year.
Silver has jumped more than 150pc over the same period, outpacing gold on strong investment demand, its inclusion on the US critical minerals list and momentum buying.
Gold and silver have “been hitting the accelerator pedal this week” with fresh record highs, reflecting their appeal as stores of value amid expectations of lower US rates and lingering global debt, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.
Platinum and palladium, primarily used in automotive catalytic converters to reduce emissions, have surged this year on tight mine supply, tariff uncertainty, and a rotation from gold investment demand, with platinum up about 160pc and palladium gaining more than 100pc year to date.
“What we’re seeing in platinum and palladium is largely catch-up,” Spivak said adding that the thin nature of those markets leave them vulnerable to sharp swings, even as they broadly track gold, once liquidity returns.</p><small>2025-12-24 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/240856253aec2e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962849/five-extortion-networks-active-in-karachi-from-abroad-sindh-home-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Five extortion networks active in Karachi from abroad: Sindh home minister</strong></a><br><p>• Lanjar claims efforts underway for extradition of foreign-based gangsters• Says KP govt asked to take action against 11 arms dealers supplying weapons to riverine area gangs
KARACHI: Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said on Tuesday that five major extortion networks operating from abroad were active in Karachi and that efforts were underway to have their ringleaders extradited and arrested.
Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the home minister identified the ringleaders of the five networks as Wasiullah Lakho, Jameel Changa, Bahadur PMT, Gul Sher Jagirani and Azeem.
Accompanied by Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon and Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho, the minister said the Sindh government had approached the federal government for extradition of the ringleaders of the five gangs.
Speaking on the occasion, IGP Memon said that gangster Lakho topped the list of those involved in extortion rackets.
He disclosed that the government had sent a request to Interpol for issuance of ‘red notice’ against Lakho.
He added that necessary documents regarding two other gangsters —Ahmed Ali Magsi and Samad Kathiawari — had been sent to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which already forwarded the relevant letters for issuance of red notices against them.
The IGP clarified that the preparation and verification of documents to meet international legal requirements took some time.
Talking about police action against extortion rackets, the minister said law enforcers had recently conducted several operations against these gangs, arrested 37 members and killed one of them in encounters.
In a veiled reference to a raid on the house of Sunni Tehreek’s chief, he said recently an action was also conducted at an “important residence” in the metropolis and eight suspected extortionists were arrested with weapons.
To a question, the home minister, without naming the head of the religious party, said legal action would be taken against him for providing “shelter to criminals”.
He said these arrests were made within seven days after the Association of Builders and Developers raised concerns over incidents of extortion at a press conference and during a meeting with the chief minister.
He said a WhatsApp group had been created where the builders and traders could directly lodge their complaints to senior police officers.
Surrender or face consequences, dacoits warned
Talking about a recent joint police-Rangers operation in riverine area to recover over one dozen Quetta-bound passengers abducted in Ghotki district, he said that four hardened bandits were killed and ‘military-grade’ weapons were recovered from them.
He said these joint operations by Sindh and Punjab police and the paramilitary force were conducted in “hard-to-access riverine areas”.
The minister declared that they had adopted a policy of “surrender or face the consequences” for riverine bandits.
To a question, the home minister said that at least 11 arms dealers who provided sophisticated weapons to riverine area gangs had been identified and the Sindh government had asked the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take action against them.
He hoped that after action against such dealers, flow of arms to the riverine areas would be reduced, which would lead to further improvement in law and order there.
To a question, the home minister said IGP Memon is going to retire on Dec 30. However, he evaded questions as to whether Sindh and federal governments finalised a name to be appointed as the new police chief.

Justice Raheel Kamran issued the ruling while dismissing a petition filed by a government official seeking to overturn his removal from service for workplace harassment, a penalty imposed by the Punjab Ombudsperson and later upheld after the rejection of his representation by the governor.
The petitioner, Umer Shehzad, a district manager, was accused by his female subordinate, an ad hoc teacher, of persistent harassment.
According to the complaint, Sheh­zad allegedly used his supervisory position to cast indecent glances, send inappropriate WhatsApp messages and demand an illicit relationship in exchange for professional favours.
According to the complaint, Sheh­zad forcibly entered her residence, attempted to rape her and fled only after she called the police service Rescue 15.

Judge dismisses petition filed by govt official seeking to set aside his removal from service

Following an inquiry, the Punjab Ombudsperson found Shehzad guilty of “abuse of authority” and harassment under the 2010 Act and imposed the major penalty of removal from service. The decision was later affirmed by the governor.
Before the LHC, the petitioner argued that the incident took place at a private residence and therefore did not fall within the legal definition of a “workplace”.
However, Justice Kamran rejec­ted this narrow interpretation, holding that under Section 2(n) of the Act, a “workplace” includes any situation linked to official work or activity outside the office.
The judge observed that when a supervisor uses the leverage of emp­loyment — such as threats to terminate an appointment — to exert pressure on a subordinate, the statutory “nexus” is firmly established regardless of the physical location.
“The statutory emphasis, therefore, is not on geography alone, but on the nexus between the conduct complained of and the employment relationship, particularly where sup­ervisory authority is alleged to have been misused,” the judge noted.
Justice Kamran also addressed the petitioner’s objection to the use of unverified WhatsApp messages, noting that the petitioner had indirectly admitted to the communication in his initial defence and failed to challenge their forensics during the inquiry.
Furthermore, the judge clarified that proceedings before the ombudsperson are administrative and disciplinary, not criminal.
The judge noted that the ombudsperson is not bound by the rigid technicalities of the Code of Civil Procedure or the Qanun-i-Shahadat.
The judge also dismissed another argument of the petitioner that a pending criminal case on the same facts barred the ombudsperson’s jurisdiction.
Justice Kamran ruled that the principle of “double jeopardy” does not apply here because criminal trials and disciplinary inquiries engage distinct legal regimes — one for criminal culpability and the other for workplace dignity.
The judge concluded that the guilt of the petitioner reached by the ombudsperson, affirmed by the governor, appears to be not only in consonance with law but also a reasonable and logical inference that could be drawn from the material available on the record.
The judge ruled that the findings recorded by both the forums are neither perverse nor unsupported by the record, nor do they suffer from any jurisdictional defect or legal infirmity so as to warrant interference by the court.

ISLAMABAD: A local court on Tuesday extended the interim bail of PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in the May 9 cases and five other matters, while directing the former prime minister to appear at the next hearing either in person or through video link.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the pre-arrest bail applications. Advocate Shamsa Kayani appeared on behalf of the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi. However, arguments on the bail pleas could not be advanced due to the unavailability of the ex-PM.
Consequently, the court extended the interim bail and adjourned the hearing till Jan 27, directing that the PTI founder’s appearance be ensured on the next date.
Apart from the May 9 cases, other cases, including attempt to murder and submission of alleged fake receipts, have been registered against the former prime minister. A separate case pertaining to the alleged submission of fake receipts related to Toshakhana gifts has also been lodged against Bushra Bibi.
Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Chaudhry Amir Zia also extended Bushra Bibi’s interim bail on her pre-arrest bail application and adjourned the matter till Jan 27. A case was registered against her at the Ramna police station under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act and other relevant provisions.
Meeting denied again
Separately, PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry was once again not allowed to meet Imran Khan to obtain his signature on the power of attorney papers for filing an appeal against his recent conviction in the Toshakhana case.
The PTI condemned what it termed “deliberate obstructions” to the party founder’s right to appeal in the Toshakhana-II case, alleging that prison authorities were preventing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi from meeting their counsel at Adiala jail to sign the power of attorney. In a statement, the party said that making the PTI founder’s counsel wait for hours, closing the legal desk and denying facilitation for execution of the power of attorney amounted to a “planned attempt to obstruct access to justice”.
The PTI maintained that under Rules 178 and 179 of the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, every prisoner has the legal right to meet his/her lawyer, sign legal documents and file an appeal, adding that prison authorities were not empowered to create hurdles in this regard.
The party further alleged that the denial of the right to appeal violated Articles 10-A, 4, 9, and 25 of the Constitution, and demanded immediate and unhindered access of the ex-PM to his counsel to enable him to pursue his legal remedies.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday approved the process for the auction of 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum within two months, followed by the rollout of 5G internet in five to six months, on the recommendation of a US-based consultancy firm.
The decision was made at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which also approved a Rs20bn (more than $7m) bailout package for Pakistan International Airlines Investment Limited (PIA-IL) to discharge $4m tax liability against Roosevelt Hotel, New York, and other domestic loan liabilities.
Speaking at a no-questions-asked recorded statement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khwaja said the new spectrum auction, to be completed by early February, would be ten times larger than the 60MHz auctioned over all past auctions put together because internet congestion was a major constraint to the nation’s digitisation transformation.
The finance minister said recommendations for the spectrum auction were prepared by National Economic Research Associates (NERA), based on experiences in recent spectrum auctions in other countries, including process, pricing mechanism, auction and implementation strategies. He said the success of digitisation, digital inclusion and financial inclusion was linked to faster, cheaper and better processes, and unsold spectrum was directly translating into economic losses.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima said that under the ECC decision, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) would complete all spectrum auctions by the end of January or early February because Pakistan was behind regional competitors due to the unavailability of spectrum capacity.

 

She said Pakistan’s 245m population had access to only 274MHz spectrum compared to 600MHz available to the 175m people of Bangladesh. That was the major reason for internet traffic congestion in Pakistan, she said, adding, “This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight lanes…your internet does not work and you face challenges.”
She said the upcoming auction would not only improve 3G and 4G services but also enable the launch of 5G, and more international operators would enter the country. The operators would be obligated, under the terms of the auction, to roll out all spectrums within four to six months, so that service improvements become visible to the people in five to six months and to be followed by 5G rollout in six months.
Ms Khwaja said the internet was a basic ingredient to the government’s digitisation efforts, for which the Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025 had already been put in place. According to Connect 2030, to be inaugurated by the prime minister soon, the government would ensure that over the next five years, the minimum connectivity available to users should be 100 Mbps.
Under the decision, Pakistan would now be offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands, including 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz and new bands 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600 and 3500MHz band are considered conducive to 5G.
PIA bailout
The ECC also approved about Rs20bn (about $7m) bailout to PIA-IL against $17.5m demanded by the Defence Division to meet tax liabilities of Roosevelt Hotel due on January 1, 2026.
In October, the Ministry of Defence sought around $17.5 million to meet urgent liabilities at the Manhattan property, which could require up to $20m to restart operations pending a joint-venture arrangement through the Privatisation Commission. The hotel’s $200m lease with New York City, under which it housed migrants, was terminated earlier this year.
The ECC had directed PIA-IL and the ministry to hold separate deliberations with the Ministry of Finance to rationalise their demand, which appeared exaggerated to the committee members. These meetings led to the identification of $4m tax payable by the end of the current month to avoid any adverse action in the United States.
In addition, the company was also in default in debt servicing to the National Bank of Pakistan, for which another $3.5m equivalent of rupee cover was approved for settlements and rollovers.

Inflows in November alone amounted to $511m, relatively higher than $471m in October, but almost 46pc lower than $944m in the same month of last year.
Of the total, foreign loan inflows rose 46.22pc to $2.521bn in 5MFY26 compared to $1.724bn last year. Grants, on the other hand, fell by 43pc to $54m from $94m in the same period last year.
These inflows do not include $1.2bn disbursed by the IMF early this month and would be accounted for later.

MoF reports Pakistan receives over $3.03bn, including grants

The target for total foreign inflows for current year has been set at $19.9bn compared to $19.4bn last year.
In July-November of 2023, Pakistan was able to materialise more than $4.3bn mainly because of signing of the 9-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF. As a result, Pakistan received a major injection of $2bn in time deposit from Saudi Arabia. In fact, total inflows in July 2023 had amounted to $5.1bn that also included $1.2bn from the IMF and another $1bn from the UAE.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday said that total foreign inflows in 5MFY26 stood at $3.032bn compared to $2.667bn last year. The EAD said that out of total inflows, $1.157bn was received for project financing compared while non-project inflows amounted to $1.875bn.
This meant about $966m loans were received in five months for budget support. This is despite the fact that annual target for budget support this year was set at $13.5bn compared to $15bn last year. The authorities were also able to materialise $500m against Saudi Oil facility in five months, at a set rate of $100m each month, of the fiscal year against an annual target of $1bn.
Against a full year target of $5bn from multilaterals (excluding IMF), Pakistan got only $1.258bn in five months from multilateral lenders against $1.46bn of same period last year when the annual target was $4.5bn.
Total inflows from bilateral lenders (other than three strategic friendly countries) in five months of the year amounted to $808m against annual target of $1.36bn but was 200pc higher than $269m of same period last year when the full year target was $523m.
Total inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders amounted to $2.066bn in five months of this year against the annual target of $6.4b. Last year, the government had secured $1.73bn from bilateral and multilaterals against annual target of $5.05bn.
Inflows from overseas Pakistanis increased to $966m in five months, up from $735m of same period last year in the shape of Naya Pakistan Certificates. The government has targeted a total of $609m through these certificates during the current year, which has already been surpassed by a wide margin.
The full year $19.9bn target for current fiscal year includes $6.4bn from both multilateral and bilateral lenders including $5.05bn from multilaterals and $1.36bn from bilateral lenders, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn foreign commercial loans, $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn SAFE deposit from China.

Zunaira with Unicef's Deputy Executive Director Kitty van der Heijden at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024

 
Zunaira Qayyum, who will turn 15 in July next year, is currently reading Crime and Punishment, arguably the most well-known work of Russian master Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 
A voracious reader, the ninth-grade student races and, at times, slogs through the daunting tome, balancing it with her studies and extracurricular activities. “I should be able to finish the book in the next few days,” she tells Eos in a phone interview. 
Finishing Dostoyesky’s psychological masterpiece is just a stepping stone for the young woman from Balochistan’s impoverished Hub district. Zunaira aspires to become the secretary-general of the United Nations (UN). “There is yet to be a female secretary-general of the UN and I want to change that,” she says with confidence.
PUTTING IN THE HARD HOURS
Zunaira has already racked up a string of achievements that belie her age. Her research on the impacts of climate change-induced floods on girls’ secondary education in Hub was among the winners of a competition, organised via the collaboration between a host of UN agencies and the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme in 2023. 

Zunaira Qayyum was the youngest delegate at COP 29 in Baku last year and has been appointed as a youth advocate by Unicef. But the teen climate champion from impoverished Balochistan’s Hub district has her sights set on a much bigger goal…

The competition, called Policy Research Challenge, focused on enhancing research capabilities and promoting the active involvement of adolescents and the youth to create lasting impacts for 2030 and beyond.
“My research found that climate change in Balochistan disproportionately affects women and girls, limiting their access to education, health and livelihood opportunities,” she tells Eos. “It highlighted how gender inequality increases vulnerability to climate impacts, while women’s voices remain largely excluded from climate decision-making and local adaptation planning,” she adds.
This success would lead to her selection, through Unicef, as one of the participants of a regional youth advocacy group in Kathmandu, Nepal. “The training and the climate advocacy workshop [in 2023] helped me understand the linkage between climate change, human rights and young people’s empowerment.”
At last year’s Conference of the Parties (COP 29) in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku, Zunaira was the youngest delegate at the conference and was one of 20 youth delegates from South Asia. 
In February this year, Unicef appointed Zunaira as its youth advocate for climate action and girls’ empowerment in Pakistan. The announcement came during the Dawn Media Group’s ‘Breathe Pakistan’ conference on climate change, where Zunaira was a speaker.

AGAINST THE ODDS
Zunaira’s efforts and achievement are made all the more important by the status of her own province: ravaged by climate change and trailing the national average on literacy as well as other development indicators.
Zunaira was born in Zehri — in Balochistan’s central Khuzdar district — a deeply tribal-cum-patriarchal society, where female education is said to be abysmal. The situation is comparatively better in the rest of Balochistan, where literacy stands at 42 percent, but still lags behind the national average of 60 percent, according to the Economic Survey of Pakistan 2024-25. Female literacy in Balochistan is estimated at 36.8 percent, against a national average of 51.9 percent. 
Zunaira’s parents decided to relocate to the city of Hub in 2019. The city in Balochistan’s south is a major commercial centre due to its proximity to Karachi. It also afforded greater educational opportunities for Zunaira and her four siblings, three younger sisters and one younger brother. 
Tragedy struck in 2020 when Zunaira lost her father, a government worker who also ran a small grocery shop in Hub. She says her mother, Naseema Rasool, stepped up to ensure that Zunaira and her siblings were always provided for. “My mother runs a beauty parlour and also does embroidery of traditional Baloch attire.”
Since then, Zunaira has completed a certification in the English language from a local language centre in Hub, where she has been teaching English for over a year now. She also teaches the language to her four siblings who, she adds, also share her love for the written word. 
FIGHTING THE BIG FIGHT
Zunaira says she aspires to be the best version of herself so she can better tackle the challenges facing her home province. And it is a gargantuan task. 
Balochistan’s education minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani recently said that there are over three million out-of-school children in Balochistan. This is despite the fact that Article 25-A of Pakistan’s constitution guarantees free and compulsory education for children aged 5 to 16.    
Aside from challenges of education, law and order, health, road network and digital connectivity, Balochistan also remains in the throes of climate change. Torrential rains and floods often wreak havoc in the province, most notably in 2022, while parts of the province are also regularly hit by droughts. 
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Balochistan recorded 42 percent less rainfall during September to October this year as compared to the previous year. During this period, temperatures also remained 0.9 degrees Celsius above the average.
Zunaira is aware of the challenges. “Over the last several years, I have been vying for climate-friendly policies through my work,” she says. “The reason is Balochistan is vulnerable to climate change, affecting the lives of children, too.”
Despite having age on her side, Zunaira knows that such changes don’t happen overnight. “Sometimes it takes 80 to 90 years to bring about change, as it is a long and slow process,” she says. 
“I am the first female to get education from my mother’s side of the family,” Zunaira tells Eos. “This is why I always say I am blessed and this is what pushes me to work for the education of the women in Balochistan,” she continues. There will be redemption in suffering, she says, pointing out that it is a recurring theme in Dostoyevsky’s works. 
And there seems to be challenges galore for the young activist, including from unexpected sources. While Zunaira and her family were attending a wedding in Khuzdar recently, some people broke into their home in Hub. “They caused significant damage to my personal belongings and, most distressingly, tore up my passport, Unicef documents, shields and trophies,” she tells Eos.
But spurred on by Dostoyevsky’s words, regarding pain and suffering being always inevitable for a large heart and deep intelligence, she remains committed to her goal: to improve the lot of Balochistan and become the first female secretary-general of the United Nations.
