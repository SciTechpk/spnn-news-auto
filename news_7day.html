<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02160025752d80a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946126/justice-jahangiri-moves-apex-court-against-shcs-decision-in-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Jahangiri moves apex court against SHC’s decision in degree case</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri on Thursday moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Sindh High Court’s ruling on his degree and seeking to have the verdict declared “null and void”.
In his petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Justice Jahangiri contended that the SHC “dismissed my application to become a party to the case”, adding that passing a “one-sided order without hearing the affected party is contrary to law”.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside.
The judge further argued that the SHC “ignored the question of maintainability of the petition”.
According to the petition, the IHC judge urged the apex court that his appeal “may graciously be granted and after granting leave to appeal, this Honourable Court, may graciously set aside the Impugned Order”.
The petition, filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, names the “Province of Sindh and others” as respondents. Dr Mohammad Usman Mirza has been appointed as defence counsel for the petitioner.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.

According to a statement from his office, Naqvi said that he had taken notice of the “unfortunate” incident and demanded a report from the Islamabad inspector general of police.
“Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he was quoted as saying. “Disciplinary action must be taken against officials involved in the incident.”
Earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the “assault on journalists by Islamabad police” at the National Press Club.
“HRCP strongly condemns the raid on the National Press Club and [the] assault on journalists by the Islamabad police,” the rights group wrote in a post on X. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book.”
 






Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen attacking journalists on the press club premises.

Journalists across the country condemned the incident, calling it shameful and claiming that police acted like “thugs”.
Renowned journalist Hamid Mir wrote about the incident on X, stating that police were trying to arrest members of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAC) and that they “targeted journalists present in the cafeteria”.
 






Meanwhile, journalist Matiullah Jan condemned the incident in a post on X, deeming the incident “extremely shameful and condemnable”.
“This incident is [a product] of the incompetence and cowardice of the club administration,” Jan wrote. “The press club is the home of journalists, where it is disgraceful for the police to barge into the cafeteria with batons and attack people.
 






Anas Mallick, who works with TV channel Asia One, alleged that police had raided the club to arrest Kashmiri journalists covering a “call to protest” by the JAAC, adding that the police were “acting like thugs”.
 






Zebunnisa Burki, an editor at The News daily, called visuals emerging from the raid “insane” and added that journalists were being attacked by police inside the press club itself.

Here’s what analysts have to say</strong></a><br><p>American multinational corporation Procter & Gamble said on Thursday that it would wind down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan and rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers as part of a restructuring programme.
The news comes as various multinational corporations (MNCs) have pulled their operations in Pakistan over the past three years, including Eli Lilly, Shell, Microsoft, Uber and Yamaha.
Does this point to a greater trend suggesting that the economic climate in Pakistan is inhospitable for multinationals or are there other reasons? Here’s what analysts have to say:
‘Companies have own reasons for exiting’
Business and economy journalist Khurram Hussain said that companies have “their own reasons” for exiting. “It is not really about Pakistan, but restructuring at their end,” he said.
“Take Shell as an example. They have exited the retail fuel business in Mexico and Indonesia as well as Pakistan, and retail energy more broadly in many other markets,” he said.
“They’re trying to refocus in higher margin areas like liquefied natural gas etc […] their exit from Pakistan was part of this global restructuring,” he said.
‘Exit does not always result in withdrawal of products’
Speaking to Dawn.com, Pakistan Business Council (PBC) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ehsan Malik highlighted several factors leading to the exit of MNCs, stating that it varied from sector to sector.
He said that MNCs in the pharmaceutical sector leave due to delays in price change approvals and poor promotional ethics of some local companies, while companies like Shell and P&G responded to the “global change of focus on categories and geographies”. Others leave due to weak enforcement of intellectual property rights, he added.
He further noted, “Growing competition from local companies, a large informal sector and shrinking margins dilute the group performance, which together with high taxes and a weaker Rupee are factors that also contribute to an exit.”
Companies often cite “security conditions”, he said, adding that with fewer expatriates, local managements have learnt to cope with the conditions.
“It is important to note that an exit does not always result in the withdrawal of products and brands,” he stated.
“A distributor model can maintain their presence and MNCs can rely on third-party market research and advertising agencies to promote their brands.”
‘Companies relocating as part of strategic shift’
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said, “Many companies are relocating as part of a strategic shift toward operating from regional hubs instead of maintaining manufacturing facilities in every country, enabling them to leverage economies of scale.”
He highlighted “growing efficiencies among local distribution players”, with a more skilled workforce and adoption of advanced technologies, which have facilitated “seamless product distribution” without having a physical presence.</p><small>2025-10-02 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021515297a1220d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946122/from-clanker-to-delulu-what-were-the-most-searched-slang-words-on-google-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>From Clanker to Delulu: What were the most searched slang words on Google in 2025</strong></a><br><p>Google search data from January to September 2025 revealed the slang terms dominating online curiosity, with TikTok, Instagram, gaming, streaming, and Gen Z and Alpha communities driving the trends.

This term has become a synonym for something that is ugly, undesirable or unattractive.
6. Big back (57,000 searches)

Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night, the fleet said. Israel has so far intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said today.
The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Also onboard the fleet is former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“
“Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted.
 






In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla.
They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said.
The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”.
 






Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel.
Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“.
Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“.
South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela.
Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters, showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up.
 


A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers.
According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing.
The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip.
 






Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday.
At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”.
“The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted.

The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military.
It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”.
Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.
Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO
Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.”
Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.”
 
 

It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added.
 






Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists.
“Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X.
 






Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”.
“We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice.
In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”.
“The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said.
“Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added.
Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained
Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum.
 
 

In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.”
The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.”
 






JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.”
“We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added.
Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.”
 






Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla.
“They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.”
“Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added.
 






Israel faces international backlash
Malaysia
PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians.
“By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement.
 






In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”.
“My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay.
“I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added.
He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”.
 






Turkiye
Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians.
The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency.
 






Colombia
Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year.
Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel.
 






Britain
The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely.
“We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement.
“The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added.
Spain
Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said.
“Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE, saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla.
 






Brazil
Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker.
The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.”
“The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.</p><small>2025-10-02 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021501449080e0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946118/we-stand-with-china-in-good-times-and-bad-says-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>‘We stand with China in good times and bad,’ says President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari has stated that Pakistan stands with China during good times and bad.
He made the remarks during an interview with Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN that was aired on Thursday. During the interview, the president, who visited China earlier this month, said that all his visits to the neighbouring country were “goodwill visits”.
“My visits are always goodwill visits because China is the future and all of the East will work with China,” he said. Talking about China’s Global Governance Initiative, he said: “Global governance means that I cannot walk into any other country nor any other country [can] walk into me. They have to be respectful about my territory, I shall be respectful of their territory.”
He said that he was bringing international goodwill and the Pakistani people’s goodwill, as well as the assurance that “we stand with China in good times and bad times”.
“Not that I see China going through a bad time, but even then, we are there, in case [we are] needed,” he asserted.
 






Asked whether China and Pakistan could work together to promote the Global Governance Initiative, the president said: “We don’t need a marshal mindset, we need an economical mindset. We need to let the people live and let live.”
Talking about the relationship between the two countries, the president termed Pakistan and China: “All-weather, iron-clad brothers, but […] that we are joined on the hip also.
“That’s how close we are. And that is an opportunity,” he said.
President Zardari further stated that Pakistan has always tried to “help Chinese positions”.
“Wherever I go in the world, my first position is respect China […] for its people, for its technology, for everything,” he said.
Commenting on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) 2.0, President Zardari said: “We are the closest port to China […]. One day, the generations to come will thank Chinese people and Pakistani people [for thinking] about that port.
“That port will be the closest link you have to China,” he said, calling it a “great futuristic project”. He said that once the port would become operational, it would enhance employment opportunities and trade in the area.
“So there is great importance for me to make sure Balochistan is safer,” he said, adding that “economic growth kept nations together”.</p><small>2025-10-02 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02160551e474af0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946082/high-level-govt-delegation-holds-talks-with-joint-awami-action-committee-amid-unrest-in-azad-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>High-level govt delegation holds talks with Joint Awami Action Committee amid unrest in Azad Kashmir</strong></a><br><p>A high-level delegation of the government held negotiations with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory.
“A high-level delegation from Pakistan has started formal dialogue with representatives of the Joint Action Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Muzaffarabad today,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on X as the talks commenced.
 






A strike has paralysed AJK under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JAAC, the AJK government, and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wednesday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and federal minister Chaudhry invited the JAAC for fresh dialogue.
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK and directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to AJK capital Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
The committee includes Senator Rana Sanaullah as well as federal ministers Sardar Yusuf and Ahsan Iqbal, former President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Masood Khan, and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira.
Photos shared by Chaudhry on X showed him, Kaira, Sanaullah, Iqbal, Kashmir Affairs Federal Minister Amir Muqam, PPP leader Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf among those participating in today’s negotiations.
Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarbad, members of a government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days.
Among them, Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role in address the issues in AJK. But, he added, given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”.
He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK but they should also be mindful that no such situation was creating of which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage.
AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks to AJK and expressed the hope that members of the JAAC would also work toward ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides.
Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We all are saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives. As far as the  Joint Awami Action Committee is concerned, they are very honourable and disrespected people.”
He stressed the solution to the ongoing unrest was through talks. “They are a part of our body and their pain is our pain, their difficulties are our difficulties.”
Ashraf said whether the loss of lives was unfortunate, be it because of “administration or the civilian population”.
Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. “We are confident that when we sit with our friend of the Joint Awami Action Committee, all misunderstandings will be resolved.”
Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.”
Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views.
The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad today to consider steps to defuse the situation.
PM urges citizens to remain peaceful
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on X earlier today,  PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad.
 






According to the PMO statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as yesterday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint.
“The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.”
PM Shehbaz, according to the statement, also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters.
“The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers.
Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter.
“The prime minister has directed immediate assistance to the families affected by the demonstrations,” read the statement. “At the government level, to find a peaceful resolution to the issue, the prime minister has decided to expand the negotiation committee.”
“The prime minister has appealed to the members and leadership of the JAAC to cooperate with the government’s negotiation committee.
“The committee will send its recommendations and proposed solutions to the Prime Minister’s Office without delay so that steps can be taken for the immediate resolution of the issues.”</p><small>2025-10-02 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02155022ba5c13e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946124/4-wounded-suspect-shot-in-manchester-synagogue-attack' target='_blank'><strong>4 wounded, suspect shot in Manchester synagogue attack</strong></a><br><p>Four people were injured and a suspected knifeman shot by police on Thursday after a car ramming and stabbing incident outside a synagogue in Manchester, officials said.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) declared a “major incident” shortly after 9:30am (1:30pm PKT) after officers were called to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the Crumpsall neighbourhood of the northwestern city.
“Paramedics arrived at the scene … and are tending to members of the public,” it added, noting “currently four members of the public with injuries caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds.”
“Shots were fired by GMP firearms officers at 9:38am. One man has been shot, believed to be the offender,” the force said in a statement.
 






The incident came on the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday and days ahead of the second anniversary of the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel after which Tel Aviv began a military operation in Gaza.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “appalled by the attack” and a UK official confirmed he would be returning early from talks with the EU in Denmark.
“The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific,” he added. “My thoughts are with the loved ones of all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services and all the first responders.”
Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC the city was dealing with “a serious incident”.
“At the same time I can give some reassurance that the immediate danger appears to be over and GMP (police) have dealt with it very quickly with some amazing support from members of the public and security at the location,” he said.
Firearms officers were deployed at 9:34am (1:34pm PKT) amid reports from members of the public that a security guard had been attacked with a knife.
Burnham urged people “not to speculate on social media”, while noting the Jewish community “will be very worried by the news”.
The North West Ambulance Service said it had “dispatched resources to the scene”.
“We are currently assessing the situation and working with other members of the emergency services,” it added.
‘Holiest Jewish day’
“Our priority is to ensure people receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible,” the ambulance services said.
Manchester police noted it had activated Operation Plato, the UK’s national police guidance for responding to a so-called “marauding terrorist attack”.
It involves a coordinated, multi-agency effort to counter an incident involving attackers who pose an immediate and widespread threat to life.
The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish charity that records anti-Semitic incidents, said it was “working with police and the local Jewish community” following the incident.
“This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,” CST added, thanking police officers and synagogue security who “responded immediately to deal with the incident”.</p><small>2025-10-02 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0214275745128e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946085/pampg-says-it-is-winding-down-operations-in-pakistan-will-rely-on-third-party-distributors' target='_blank'><strong>P&G says it is winding down operations in Pakistan, will rely on ‘third-party distributors’</strong></a><br><p>American multinational corporation Procter & Gamble said on Thursday that the company would wind down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan and rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers in the country as part of the consumer product group’s global restructuring programme.
“We will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course until the process is complete, which may take several months,” said a statement by P&G.
“Supporting this company decision, P&G Pakistan and the supporting regional teams will begin transition planning immediately, with a focus first on P&G people,” it added.
According to the statement, employees whose roles are impacted by this decision will be “considered for opportunities in other P&G operations outside Pakistan or will be offered separation packages” in accordance with local laws, company policies, and P&G’s values and principles.
In Pakistan, a number of brands are under the P&G umbrella, including Pampers, Ariel, Always, Safeguard, Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Olay, and Vicks.
Meanwhile, Gillette Pakistan, a subsidiary of P&G, said it would evaluate a potential delisting following a decision by its parent to discontinue its business in Pakistan.
It plans to convene a board meeting shortly to evaluate the actions required for this business discontinuation, including the potential delisting from the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the company said in a filing.
Reacting to the news, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Pakistan (ICAP) Asad Ali Shah termed P&G’s exit as “another red flag for investment climate”.
“Procter & Gamble’s decision to leave Pakistan underscores a deeper truth: doing business here has become increasingly unviable — not just for multinationals, but for investors of all kinds,” he posted on X.
“When global giants pack up, it signals that our policy unpredictability, currency risks, and regulatory chaos have outweighed market potential,” he said, adding that this was not about one company but about the growing perception that “Pakistan punishes investment instead of protecting it”.

US media outlets described the moves announced by the energy and transportation departments as part of the administration’s efforts to pressure Democrats in Congress to agree on a deal to end the shutdown.
US President Donald Trump had raced to enact hard-right policies even before the shutdown began after midnight on Tuesday, threatening mass firings and to slash government departments, and blaming Democrats for Congress’ failure to resolve a funding stand-off.
The Department of Energy announced on Thursday “the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects, resulting in a savings of approximately $7.56 billion for American taxpayers”. It said in a statement that those projects — overseen by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and other bodies — “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs … and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars”.
However, recipients of federal funding have 30 days to appeal against a termination decision, and some have already begun the process, the statement said.
It did not list the projects in question.
In a post on social media platform X, Russell Vought, who heads the powerful Office of Management and Budget, called the slashed projects “Green New Scam funding” that was used to advance “the Left’s climate agenda”.
He listed the states affected by the decision. They include California, New York and 14 others — all blue states where Trump failed to win in the 2024 presidential elections.
 






California Governor Gavin Newsom said the Trump administration had decided to cancel “up to $1.2bn” slated for a major hydrogen energy project, threatening tens of thousands of jobs.
“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Newsom said in a statement, vowing to keep pursuing a “clean energy strategy… no matter what DC tries to dictate.”
In New York — the home state of top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — the Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced on Wednesday it was freezing nearly $18bn in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects, the Second Avenue subway and Hudson Tunnel.
The move takes aim at diversity, equity and inclusion policies, according to the department’s statement, saying that subsidising projects with “race- and sex-based contracting requirements … is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources”.
The funds would be frozen until a “quick administrative review is complete”, it said.
“Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries shutdown, however, USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time,” it added, saying that the department “has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review”.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement that halting funding for “critical infrastructure projects” was “political payback and an attack on New York”.
“Donald Trump has been clear: he is intent on using his reckless government shutdown to hurt the American people,” she said.</p><small>2025-10-02 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0209491317ccb6e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945920/new-force-blood-testing-planned-to-tackle-drug-menace-among-karachi-students' target='_blank'><strong>New force, blood testing planned to tackle drug menace among Karachi students</strong></a><br><p>• ‘Coalition Against Drugs’ to monitor children’s behaviour, attendance, academic performance and social interactions
• Those doing drugs should be treated as victims, not criminals, says Shehzad Roy
KARACHI: The Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force comprising 50 police personnel was established on Wednesday to curb the menace of drugs in educational institutions within the jurisdiction of the South Zone of Karachi police.
A decision to this effect was taken in a consultative meeting of the ‘Coalition Against Drugs’ here. The coalition comprises heads of over 50 academic institutes in Clifton, DHA, Saddar, and other areas, as well as police officials.
It was also decided in the meeting that random blood tests to check for drug abuse among students would be carried out with the consent of their parents.
Speaking to journalists after the meeting, South DIG Syed Asad Raza said that the Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force had been established with 50 personnel including women officers, who would be deployed at different institutes.
He said their uniforms were designed in consultation with the institutes so that their presence would not be domineering, but rather cooperative.
He said the police had consulted with around 150 schools, colleges and universities located in South-Zone to grasp the issue of drug abuse, share responsibilities and devise strategies to tackle the problem.
He said as part of a larger strategy against narcotics, the police were focusing on shisha bars, social media platforms, and courier services, which were allegedly involved in the supply of drugs.
Earlier, during the consultative meeting, singer-turned-activist Shehzad Roy suggested that students involved in drug abuse should be treated as victims, not as criminals.
Sadia Faisal of Karachi Grammar School proposed that an age-appropriate curriculum should be devised at the institutes.
Meanwhile, a statement issued after the meeting said that presence of the new campus force could deter substance abuse. “Collaborative working between police and institution administrators will help in developing strategies for addressing substance misuse.”
The participants of the meeting also decided to develop a curriculum that educates students about the risks and consequences of substance abuse, including its physical and mental health effects.
The special curriculum would also incorporate life skills training to help students resist peer pressure, make informed decisions, and manage stress, it was stated. Awareness campaigns, workshops, and seminars would be organised to educate students, teachers, and parents about substance misuse.
Regarding parents’ awareness and consent for testing, it was decided that parents would be educated about the risks of substance misuse and the importance of regular testing.
The parents’ consent would be obtained for random drug testing, ensuring that the parents were involved in the process. “Support and resources would be provided to parents to address substance misuse issues with their children.”
About random blood testing for drug abuse on the campus, the participants agreed that random drug testing could deter students from substance misuse. “The students would be identified who may be struggling with substance misuse and will be provided with support and resources.”
Besides, it was also decided that teachers would be trained to identify signs of substance misuse among students.
The signs include changes in behaviour and physical symptoms.
They would be equipped with skills to support students who may be struggling with drug abuse and refer them to appropriate resources. The teachers would also be provided with strategies to manage classrooms effectively and promote a positive learning environment.
Moreover, the heads of academic institutes and the police officers agreed that “behavioural changes in students would be monitored”.
“Students should be considered victims, rather than perpetrators,” the participants said.
Students’ behaviour, attendance, academic performance, and social interactions would be monitored. “Frequent collaboration between law enforcement, educators, and administrators would be ensured to develop effective strategies and action plan for addressing substance misuse,” declared the participants.

The development comes days after tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over onto the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Men’s Asia Cup staged in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during all three clashes in the tournament. The tensions had culminated in India not accepting the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief.
The tournament had seen the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May after India had launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention.
 
 

Against this backdrop, Pakistan is kicking off its Women’s World Cup campaign today by playing Bangladesh in Colombo. Pakistan will face India in the tournament on Sunday.
According to a report published by BBC Sport on Wednesday, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia told BBC Stumped — a weekly cricket show — the following: “I cannot forecast anything, but our relationship with that particular hostile country is the same, there is no change in the last week.”
He added, “India will play that match against Pakistan in Colombo, and all cricket protocols will be followed. I can only assure that whatever is in the Marylebone Cricket Club regulations of cricket, that will be done.
“Whether there will be handshakes, whether there will be hugging, I cannot assure you of anything at this moment,” he said.
 
 

Meanwhile, The Indian Express reported while citing BCCI sources that the Indian team had been advised by the board to avoid handshakes with Pakistan’s players before they departed for Sri Lanka.
The sources noted, “The team won’t be shaking hands with the Pakistan team during the World Cup. The team has been informed by the BCCI bosses about this. The Indian board will stand by its players.”
A day earlier, PCB chief Naqvi had refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the BCCI over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final.
The closing ceremony of the Asia Cup had descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team.
Subsequently, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday, Financial Express and Hindustan Times, reported that Naqvi had apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy.
Responding to the media reports, Naqvi had stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.”
The PCB chairman called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. He slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”.
“As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”</p><small>2025-10-02 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021154387c4e787.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945977/renowned-primatologist-jane-goodall-dies-at-91' target='_blank'><strong>Renowned primatologist Jane Goodall dies at 91</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: Scientist and global activist Jane Goodall, who turned her childhood love of primates into a lifelong quest for protecting the env­ironment, died on Wed­n­esday at the age of 91, the institute she founded said.
Goodall died of natural causes, the Jane Goodall Institute said in a social media post.
“Dr Goodall’s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionised science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” it said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The primatologist-turned-conservationist spun her love of wildlife into a life-long campaign that took her from a seaside English village to Africa and then across the globe in a quest to better understand chimpanzees, as well as the role that humans play in safeguarding their habitat and the planet’s health overall.
Goodall was a pioneer in her field, both as a female scientist in the 1960s and for her work studying the behavior of primates. She created a path for a string of other women to follow suit, including the late Dian Fossey.
She also drew the public into the wild, partnering with the National Geog­r­aphic Society to bring her beloved chimps into their lives through film, TV and magazines.
She upended scientific norms of the time, giving chimpanzees names ins­tead of numbers, observing their distinct personalities, and incorporating their family relationships and emotions into her work. She also found that, like humans, they use tools.
“We have found that after all there isn’t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom,” she said in a 2002 TED Talk.
As her career evolved, she shifted her focus from primatology to climate advocacy after witnessing widespread habitat devastation, urging the world to take quick and urgent action on climate change.
“We’re forgetting that were part of the natural world,” she told CNN in 2020.  “There’s still a window of time.”  In 2003, she was appointed a Dame of the British Empire and, in 2025, she received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Kenya-bound
Born in London in 1934 and then growing up on Eng­l­a­nd’s south coast, Goodall had long dreamed of living among wild animals. She said her passion for anim­als, stoked by the gift of a stuffed toy gorilla from her father, grew as she imme­rsed herself in books such as  “Tarzan” and  “Dr Doli­ttle.”  She set her dreams aside after leaving school, unable to afford university.
She worked as a secret­ary and then for a film company until a friend’s invitation to visit Kenya put the jungle within reach.
After saving up money for the journey, by boat, Goodall arrived in the East African nation in 1957. There, an encounter with famed anthropologist and paleontologist Dr Louis Leakey and his wife, arc­haeologist Mary Lea­key, set her on course to work with primates.

The Engineering Development Board (EDB), through official notifications, has made it mandatory for all new and used imported vehicles to conform to dozens of WP-29 standards. These cover road safety, passenger protection, emission limits, and environmental compliance. WP-29 is a framework set by the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations under the United Nations.
The decision was ratified by the federal cabinet on the recommendation of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC).
 
 

Importers will now be required to meet a wide range of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations covering braking systems, airbags, safety belts, lighting, emission levels, crash protection (frontal, side, and pole impacts), child restraints, head restraints, tyre safety, and systems specific to electric and hydrogen vehicles.

Regulations require all vehicles to comply with UN-set WP-29 safety, emission standards by June 2026

Only companies incorporated under the Companies Act 2017 — with adequate capital and after-sales service networks — will be allowed to import used vehicles. Each imported unit must have pre-shipment inspection certification from approved agencies such as JAAI (Japan) or KTL (Korea).
These certificates must confirm that the vehicle is roadworthy, with intact airbags, untampered odometers, and no structural damage. Upon arrival, vehicles will also undergo post-shipment inspection at designated centres in Pakistan.
Locally assembled and manufactured vehicles must also comply with the same WP-29 standards, including regulations for braking, steering, glazing, tyres, structural integrity, noise, and emissions. This will apply to both internal combustion and electric vehicles.
Automakers have until June 30, 2026 to comply. Failure to do so will empower the EDB to revoke manufacturing certificates and import authorisations.
However, stakeholders have expressed reservations over the new framework. Amir Allawala, a senior member of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts & Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), questioned the EDB’s capacity to implement and regulate such standards.
“All local assemblers already follow international standards aligned with Japanese, Korean, or Chinese practices,” he said.
“If the government fails to establish certified testing labs domestically, the cost of testing parts abroad will drive up production costs and result in foreign exchange outflows.”
He also voiced doubts over the credibility of any local labs the government may set up.
The move has also triggered a jurisdictional conflict. The EDB has been authorised to regulate automotive safety and quality, sidelining the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) — the country’s legally mandated standards body under the Ministry of Science and Technology.
The PSQCA, established through an Act of Parliament, is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s sole standards organisation and represents the country in the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).
Pakistan pays annual membership fees for participation. Under the WTO’s Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement, overlapping mandates for standards-setting are discouraged.

The action was proposed following the reports that many major public sector teaching hospitals have allowed private firms to operate pharmacies or medical stores on their premises in blatant violation of the set rules.
It was also reported that these private pharmacies were selling drugs of particular brands on higher prices, in connivance with the doctors, nurses and other concerned employees of the hospitals.
The issue surfaced when some private pharmacies at three major teaching hospitals in the provincial capital managed to get contracts to run their outlets, in connivance with the heads of the institutes, and then obtained stay orders from civil courts to prolong their businesses.
An official privy to the development says that the situation, particularly worsened at the Jinnah, Mayo and Services hospitals in Lahore, where the owners of the private pharmacies hired armed men to confront the administrations concerned.
About the Services and Mayo hospitals, the official says that a private pharmacy owner had secured a one-year contract with both institutes in 2021, allegedly in connivance with the then medical superintendents concerned. As the contract period ended, the new administrations of both institutes refused its further extension.
However, the owner of the pharmacies managed to obtain stay order from the civil courts, leaving the hospital administrations helpless.
The official says that Mayo Hospital’s management got the stay order vacated in 2023 by challenging it in the court through its legal teams.
He says the private pharmacy owner offered resistance and brought armed men to confront the hospital security guards, creating a tense environment in the hospitals.
However, the hospital administration got back the premises with the police assistance, the official says.
Later, as the new management took the hospital charge, the private pharmacy owner again occupied the premises and started business there.
The official says that tension again mounted in 2025, when the hospital management geared up efforts to close down the illegal outlet. But, the owner offered resistance by again deploying his armed men in the institute.
Recently, the official says, the pharmacy owner again obtained a stay order from another civil court, prompting the Mayo Hospital management to take up the matter with the health department high-ups.
He says that a high-profile meeting was called by the department, where the complete data pertaining to the private pharmacies operating within the government hospitals across the province was presented.
During the meeting, he says, it transpired that private pharmacies are operating in many government hospitals across Punjab on the basis of courts stay orders, to prolong their illegal businesses.
To resolve the issue, the health authorities sought opinion of law department and finally decided to slap a ban on all the private pharmacies operating at the state-run hospitals of the province, the official says.
It has also been decided that the health department will extend full support to the government hospitals in getting the stay orders vacated and closing down these illegal pharmacies, he adds.
“It has come to the notice of the health department that certain private pharmacies are operating within the premises of the public sector hospitals across the province working under the administrative control of the specialised healthcare and medical education department,” reads the health department’s notification.
It directs the heads of all government teaching and other hospitals to abandon the practice of awarding contracts to run private pharmacies on the premises of their institutes.
The department also issued strict directions to the heads to take necessary measures to close down these illegal private pharmacies.

FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said Pakistan’s logistics sector accounts for 15.6pc of GDP, compared to 8-9pc in developed economies such as the United States, Japan, and Singapore. He warned that this high cost continues to erode Pakistan’s trade competitiveness.
Citing the FPCCI Policy Advisory Board’s latest policy brief, “Pakis­tan’s Logistics Performance and Its Impact on Trade Competitiveness,” Mr Sheikh highlighted the country’s steep fall in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI) — from 68th position in 2016 to 122nd in 2018. Notably, Pakistan was excluded altogether from the 2023 index.
He noted that regional peers like India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh have improved logistics infrastructure and performance, which has helped them better integrate into global value chains.

In Pakistan, over 94pc of cargo is transported by road, while rail carries just 6pc — despite being a cheaper and more sustainable option. Operational locomotives have declined from 528 in 2011 to 449 in 2025. Freight volumes dropped from 7.4mn tonnes in FY20 to 5.8m tonnes in FY25.
Port inefficiencies are also a drag. Karachi Port and Port Qasim, which handle over 95pc of external trade, operate at just one-third of their capacity. The average container dwell time ranges from 5.5 to 6.5 days, compared to India’s 2.6 days for imports, Bangladesh’s 1.6 days for exports, and Vietnam’s four days for exports.
Gwadar Port remains marginal, handling less than 0.5pc of total trade, mainly due to weak hinterland connectivity and limited integration into the national supply chain.
Post-harvest losses further add to inefficiencies. Mr Sheikh estimated that 30-40pc of fruits and vegetables are wasted due to inadequate warehousing and cold-chain facilities.

According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), the domestic surge followed a $35 per ounce rise in international gold prices, which climbed to $3,890 per ounce.
APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said that despite minor corrections in recent months, the global trend has remained upward. He attributed the increase to global uncertainties, including a weaker US dollar, fears of a potential US government shutdown, and expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
International media also linked the rally to rising investor interest in gold as a safe haven amid financial uncertainty.
However, Mr Shikarpuri noted that speculation now dominates the global gold market. “Investors appear to be selling gold rather than accumulating it, which adds volatility,” he said.
In Pakistan, jewellers reported subdued retail demand, with most footfall coming from investors rather than traditional buyers. Many gold shops remained quiet, reflecting the high price levels and reduced purchasing power among consumers.

In its Annual Debt Review 2025, the MoF said the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 70pc, up from 68pc a year earlier. This was attributed to a lower nominal GDP growth rate, resulting from reduced inflation, which limited economic expansion and pushed the ratio higher despite efforts at fiscal consolidation.
The MoF noted that while interest expenses rose by 9pc year-on-year, this increase was significantly lower than the 43pc recorded in the previous fiscal year. Total domestic debt stood at Rs54.5tr, and external debt at Rs26tr — both reflecting a 13pc annual increase.
 
 

The average time to maturity (ATM) for domestic debt improved from 2.8 years in FY24 to 3.8 years in FY25. External debt ATM remained above six years, consistent with the government’s Medium-Term Debt Strategy 2026–28. The external debt share in total public debt fell to 32pc from 34pc, reducing exposure to currency risk.

Fiscal deficit of Rs7.1tr and slower GDP growth drive up debt ratio to 70pc

The fiscal deficit was primarily financed through do­­mestic borrowing — 91pc — mainly via net issuances of Pakistan Investment Bonds and Government Ijarah Sukuk (GIS). The remaining 9pc (around Rs600bn) came from external sources, mostly multilateral and commercial, with a net retirement in bilateral loans.
 
 

The MoF highlighted a deceleration in debt growth, noting that it had been reduced from 23pc in FY22 and 28pc in FY23 to 13pc in both FY24 and FY25. This was attributed to fiscal discipline and the generation of a significant primary surplus.
The report claimed credit for the government’s first-ever early repayments of over Rs1.5tr in FY25 and the launch of the inaugural Green Sukuk auction. These developments, alongside fiscal consolidation, helped narrow Eurobond yields to 6-9pc and contributed to a reported Rs850bn reduction in interest expenses.
 
 

Currency movements continued to impact debt valuation. In FY25, the rupee depreciated against the US dollar, while the dollar weakened against other major currencies, including the euro, SDR, and Chinese renminbi. Although the exchange rate had stabilised in FY24, these developments still added pressure on external debt servicing.
Domestic debt rose by 15pc YoY to Rs54.5tr, the lowest increase in the last three fiscal years. The share of short-term Treasury bills declined, reflecting the government’s strategy to retire short-term debt through buybacks.
At the same time, the share of floating-rate instruments, especially PIBs, increased, reflecting investor preference amid interest rate volatility. Sharia-compliant instruments like GIS grew to 12.6pc of total domestic securities in FY25.
External debt rose 6pc YoY to $91.8bn by June 2025, driven by inflows from the IMF, an ADB-guaranteed commercial loan of $1bn, and other multilateral lenders. Multilateral loans accounted for 57pc of total external debt, bilateral loans 26pc, and commercial sources — including Eurobond/Sukuk, commercial banks, and Naya Pakistan Certificates — made up 17pc. Bilateral deposits from friendly countries, mostly rolled over, accounted for 9.8pc of external debt.

If this trend continues, the current year may turn out to be one of the deadliest in decades.
This is the crux of two reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), about militant violence in the country over the past month.
According to PICSS, militant violence dropped significantly in Sept 2025, with both the number of attacks and militant capacity showing sharp declines compared to the record levels seen in Aug. The PICSS Militancy Database recorded 69 militant attacks in Sept — a 52 per cent reduction from August’s 143. These attacks resulted in 135 deaths and 173 injuries, whilst militants abducted at least 27 people.
The fatalities included 61 security personnel, 20 militants, and 54 civilians. Amongst the injured were 74 security personnel and 99 civilians. Compared with August, the number of martyred security personnel declined by 16pc, militant fatalities by 66pc, and civilian deaths by 17pc, reflecting a notable decrease in lethality.

If current trends continue, think tanks warn 2025 may be the ‘deadliest year’ in decade in terms of militant violence

KP remained the most affected province, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. In mainland KP, 25 attacks caused 33 deaths — 20 security personnel, nine militants, and four civilians — whilst 42 people were injured. Militants kidnapped nine individuals, while security forces carried out 22 operations, killing 88 militants, though five personnel lost their lives and five militants were arrested.
In the tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 20 militant attacks claimed 21 lives — six security personnel, three militants, and 12 civilians — and injured seven. Militants also abducted four people, while security forces conducted 18 operations in these districts, killing 83 militants. However, 24 civilians also lost their lives during these actions.
In Balochistan, 21 attacks claimed 79 lives — 33 security personnel, eight militants, and 38 civilians — and injured 122 others, including 37 security personnel and 85 civilians. Militants abducted 14 people. Security forces responded with seven major operations, killing 26 militants and arresting 10. Sindh experienced three attacks that killed two security personnel and injured two civilians.
According to CRSS’s report, Pakistan witnessed an over 46pc surge in overall violence in its security landscape for the third quarter of 2025, with at least 901 fatalities and 599 injuries — amongst civilians, security personnel, and outlaws — resulting from 329 incidents of violence.
“In just three quarters, 2025 has proven nearly as deadly as all of 2024, with 2,414 fatalities recorded compared to the entire tally of 2024 (2,546). With an entire quarter still remaining, this indicates that 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll. If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade,” the report stated.

• Farmers’ body demands $10bn in compensation from ‘world’s rich’
LAHORE: In a move reminiscent of the prepaid debit cards issued in the wake of the 2010 floods, the Punjab government has decided to issue ‘ATM cards’ to flood survivors across the province after due verification.
Dubbed ‘Maryam Nawaz Sharif Flood Relief ATM Cards’, these will be issued after verification from the Punjab Info­rmation Technology Board (PITB), Pun­jab Land and Revenue Authority (PLRA), and the National Database and Regis­tration Authority (Nadra), said Provincial Disaster Management Autho­rity (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia.
The cards will be issued to flood victims to compensate for their losses due to the devastating floods, he added.
The decision to launch a new mechanism for distributing flood aid comes amid a war of words between the PML-N and the PPP — both allies in the Centre and ruling Punjab and Sindh, respectively —  over the relief measures.
These new debit cards will be issued after a survey, currently underway in the flood-affected areas. CM Maryam has assured that the government would not only reach out to every flood-affected individual, but would also compensate them.
After the survey, the amount will be allocated in light of the losses and be transferred to the ATM card.
According to a PDMA report, 1,314 survey teams are actively engaged in flood-affected areas across 27 districts of the province. So far, survey teams have collected data from 41,735 flood victims. Details of crop losses from 28,632 farmers have also been compiled, covering 49,510 acres of the affected land.
 
 

Moreover, data has been collected on 12,500 damaged houses, 603 farmers lost their livestock, and a total of 2459 cattle perished.
200 villages under water
Meanwhile, more than 200 villages in Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur districts remain submerged due to breaches in the embankment along the Sutlej River, while the government has pledged to plug all fissures within a week.
For the past 20 days, these areas have been submerged. However, stagnant water in these villages has decimated homes, destroyed crops, and left thousands of residents homeless.
 
 

Afzal Baloch of Kotla Chakar said water was not moving. “Our homes are destroyed; our crops are gone. We have been patient for 20 days, but now we need this water to be drained so we can even begin to think about rebuilding our lives.”
Irrigation officials confirmed that a major breach in the Noraja Bhutta embankment, from where water from the River Sutlej was entering the area, was plugged, which had stopped fresh inflows.
Provincial Minister for Irrigation Kazim Ali Pirzada stated that teams were engaged in closing the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta bund in Jalalpur Pirwala. So far, four out of seven breaches in the flood bund have been successfully closed, he said, adding that the breaches would be plugged within one week.
Overhaul of agri policies
Separately, the Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee (PKRC) has called for immediate international financial assistance, a moratorium on foreign debt repayments, and a complete overhaul of domestic agricultural and fiscal policies.
Speaking at a press conference here on Wednesday, PKRC General Secretary Farooq Tariq said the committee discussed the climate change problem and the ensuing floods and demanded that rich countries must immediately provide at least $10 billion to Pakistan as a direct aid grant as compensation for the damage they caused to the climate.
The statement said that the flood-affected farmers, particularly in Sindh and Punjab, must be provided with immediate targeted cash support, including grants for seeds, fertiliser, and small machinery. Furthermore, their debts should be cancelled, and interest on agricultural loans for affected districts should be waived to enable them to replant and restore production.
He said the committee demanded the abolition of corporate farming and called for land redistribution. Specifically, the land of public-sector agricultural farms should be given to the tenants who have been cultivating it for over 100 years.

• Distrust remains over proposed International Stabilisation Force
• Hamas seeks changes to ‘disarmament’ clause
DESPITE their misgivings with the ‘pro-Israel’ draft of US President Donald Trump’s plan to bring peace to war-ravaged Gaza, countries from the eight-member Muslim bloc may yet push for it to be accepted.
Officials from Qatar and Pakis­tan have already implied — albeit diplomatically — that the plan announced by the White House was quite different from the one they signed up to in New York.
But some countries — especially those in Gaza’s immediate neighbourhood — also believe they have secured key concessions, such as Trump’s refusal to recognise Israeli annexation of the West Bank and a US commitment that Palestinians will be allowed to remain in Gaza.
Israel has also agreed, under the plan, not to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip.
“Gaza’s reconstruction represents a major economic opportunity for Egypt, ranging from debris removal to infrastructure development and urban projects. Such operations would channel billions of dollars into Egypt, directly and indirectly, boosting its economy in the long run,” Middle East Eye quoted a senior Egyptian political source as saying.
 
 

This would also end the looming threat of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza being expelled into the Sinai Peninsula.
“Accepting Trump’s plan to halt the war in Gaza would completely end the displacement scheme, which had become a source of deep tension between Cairo and Tel Aviv,” Middle East Eye reported.
The most surprising changes concerned the number of Palestinians set to be released as part of the deal, and the phased approach to the Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian enclave.
 
 

Where previously hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would have been released alongside 1,700 men, women and children detained from Gaza, now just 250 inmates would be freed with the detainees.
Original drafts mandated 600 aid trucks entering Gaza per day, while the new version’s vague language afforded no such commitment.
There were also changes to what had been agreed on governance: Gaza would be run by a ‘Board of Peace’, to be led by Trump and former British PM Tony Blair, cutting out international ­con­sult­ation.
Troop deployment
Meanwhile, the so-called Inter­national Stabilisation Force (ISF), which was slated to train Palestinian police to take over security duties, suddenly had expanded powers, which suggested increased Israeli control.
Not only was the Israeli troop withdrawal staggered without clear deadlines, the addition of a “security zone” around the perimeter appeared to signal the prospect of a permanent presence within Gaza.
The ISF was one of the main issues discussed in the 45-minute meeting between Trump and leaders of Muslim nations in New York last week.
According to Middle East Eye, Trump had asked all countries present — Pakistan, Jordan, UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt — to contribute troops to the force.
In the wake of Trump’s announcement, all eight countries issued a joint statement welcoming the Gaza plan and expressing their readiness to help finalise it.
But despite those positive words, behind closed doors serious concerns still exist in these countries about the prospect of deploying their soldiers on the ground in Gaza.
“Who will lead this force? Who will decide when to intervene? What will be the rules of engagement?” another senior regional official asked. “These questions all need to be discussed.”
The official suggested that further negotiations involving Arab and Muslim countries, the US, Israel and Palestinian representatives would be necessary before such a force could be viable.
The source added that Turkey, Jordan and Egypt sought to have UN Security Council approval for the force to legalise the move in the eyes of the international community, but the US and Israel dropped it from the draft plan.
“The Israelis don’t want UN involvement in any matter related to Palestine,” Middle East Eye quoted a source as ­saying.
A Turkish source familiar with Ankara’s position said Turkey is considering deploying troops in Gaza, depending on variables such as the structure and leadership of the force.
However, those familiar with Israeli thinking say Netanyahu would oppose any Turkish participation in such a mission, which is exactly why Hamas may insist on Turkish involvement.
Pressure on Hamas
Despite dissatisfaction with several elements, officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt convened quickly in Doha on Tuesday to encourage Hamas to give a positive response to Trump’s proposal.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told the media over the weekend that while the US was tasked with persuading Israel to accept the plan, Turkey and other regional players would focus on convincing the Palestinians.
“Hamas leaders were briefed on its terms immediately after the official announcement, with an emphasis that this was the last opportunity to end the war and ease the suffering of the Palestinian people,” Middle East Eye quoted a source as saying.
However, Hamas officials still want amendments to clauses in President Trump’s peace plan including on disarmament, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday.
In their discussions in Doha, the group said it needed “two or three days at most” to respond.
Hamas wants to amend some of the clauses such as the one on disarmament and the expulsion of Hamas and faction cadres, the source said.
Its leaders also want “international guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip” and guarantees that no assassinations attempts will be made inside or outside the territory.

Also, four terrorists disguised in women’s clothing were arrested in Khuzdar on Wednesday, according to the military’s media wing.
According to CTD officials, an operation was conducted in the Aghbarg area on the outskirts of Quetta after a tip-off about the presence of terrorists.
A CTD team cordoned off the locality, prompting armed militants to open fire. Security personnel retaliated, and an intense exchange of fire ensued for over an hour, during which automatic weapons were used.
“As a result of the gun battle, 10 terrorists were killed on the spot,” a CTD spokesman said, adding that two personnel sustained injuries and were shifted to hospital. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, explosives, and other equipment were seized from the site. The slain terrorists, however, remain unidentified. Further investigation is underway.
In a separate operation in Sherani district, eight terrorists were killed when security forces struck a suspected camp of the outlawed Fitna al Khwarij in the rugged Mughal Kot area. Officials confirmed that a cache of sophisticated weapons, ammunition, and equipment was recovered.
Meanwhile, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 13 terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan — the state’s terms for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Baloch separatist outfits, respectively - were killed in Quetta and Kech on Sept 30 and Oct 1.
During the Quetta operation, security forces engaged a militant hideout, resulting in the deaths of 10 “Indian-sponsored Khwarij.” Another IBO in Kech district neutralised three terrorists affiliated with Fitna al Hindustan. Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from both sites.
Four held
Additionally, ISPR reported that four terrorists were apprehended in Khuzdar district during an intelligence-based operation (IBO).
The suspects, allegedly linked to the Indian proxy group Fitna al Hindustan, were captured while attempting to flee disguised in women’s attire. Weapons and ammunition were also seized.
According to the ISPR, the arrested terrorists had been involved in multiple attacks in the region. It reiterated that security forces remain committed to eradicating terrorism and reaffirmed the nation’s determination to bring all perpetrators and their facilitators to justice.

• Kaira calls BISP ‘transparent aid method’, asks CM not to peddle ‘narrow nationalism’
• Azma hits back, says PPP cannot ‘steady itself’ by targeting PML-N
LAHORE: As PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row sparked by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s recent outburst against the coalition partner, the former has asked the Punjab CM to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz.
The war of words, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River, as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
Addressing a press conference, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira urged the CM not to fan ‘narrow nationalism’.
“Differences should be kept within limits. You (Maryam Nawaz) are a woman and our sister, and our leader (Benazir Bhutto) too was a woman. Reconsider your tone.  What do you want to achieve by playing narrow nationalism… Do you want the rest to leave Punjab, and their rights to be ended?”
Flanked by Usman Malik, Chaudhry Aslam Gill, and Faisal Mir, Mr Kaira said the country could not be run by a “single leader or institution”. “This country does not belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us. You (Maryam Nawaz) are not just a CM, you are also the daughter of Nawaz Sharif and the niece of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. If you say that you will not allow anyone to speak, this approach is not appropriate in any way. Reconsider this attitude,” he said.
He further said the floods had caused immense damage, and the entire nation spoke with one voice on this. “Where something is wrong, we will point it out and we will protest. But when we give opinions or criticism, you start threatening. The question concerns flood management, but the response is to target the Sindh government,” he said.
The PPP leader said BISP was even endorsed by the IMF. “It…provides immediate relief, and this was done before as well. If you don’t want to use BISP, fine; but in terms of transparency, BISP stands first, which is why the IMF itself directed that Rs200bn be added to it in this year’s budget. Our objections concern the relief mechanism,” he added.
 
 

In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.”
PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response.
Azma’s presser
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims.
Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added.
She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.
