MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday moved to mediate the escalating crisis involving Iran on Friday, holding separate telephone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in an effort to “quickly de-escalate tensions”.
The Kremlin stated that Putin during both phone calls expressed Moscow’s willingness to “continue its mediation efforts and to promote constructive dialogue with the participation of all interested states”.
Pezeshkian briefed Putin on Tehran’s efforts to stabilise the situation, blaming the US and Israel for fomenting unrest.
The two men confirmed their commitment to a 20-year strategic partnership agreement signed last year, which includes joint economic projects, it added.
Meanwhile, fears of an immediate US attack have retreated slightly since President Donald Trump noted killings were easing, however, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted the president was keeping “all of his options on the table”.
The US has redirected an aircraft carrier and its strike group toward Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln is carrying fighter jets, guided missile destroyers and at least one attack submarine. The Israeli spy chief was also expected to meet White House envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday.
On the ground in Iran, a deadly state crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests for now. While state media reported more arrests on Friday, residents in Tehran noted the capital had been quiet since Sunday.
Munich conference scraps invite
Amid the crackdown, the Munich Security Conference withdrew its invitation to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi for its upcoming forum.
“In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations,” organisers said in a statement. Diplomatic reactions varied globally. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) condemned external interference and blamed Western economic pressure for the instability.
On the other hand, Pakistan urged the UN Security Council to uphold international law regarding non-interference. Ambassador Asim Ahmad, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, warned that unilateral actions would only deepen the crisis. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure,” Ahmad said, calling Iran a “brotherly country” and urging all parties to resolve differences through peaceful means.
Starlink behind the scenes
Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service has emerged as a primary tool for Iranian dissidents to bypass state-imposed internet blackouts following a violent crackdown on protests, according to activists and researchers.
The network, which uses thousands of low-orbit satellites to beam internet to terminals the size of a pizza box, has become a crucial lifeline for demonstrators.
Digital rights groups estimate 50,000 terminals have been smuggled into Iran, defying a law that bans the unlicensed technology. As Iran attributes the country’s tensions to foreign involvement, the extensive scale of this Starlink network implies that it may be receiving sophisticated external support.
Given the difficulty of transporting large quantities of restricted hardware across Iran’s tightly controlled borders, the logistics mirror the capabilities of foreign intelligence services; however, no official link has been con­fi­rmed.

Canadian PM Mark Carney shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the People’s Great Hall in Beijing.—Reuters

BEIJING: Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a raft of measures from trade to tourism on Friday at the first meeting between the countries’ leaders in Beijing in eight years.
The Canadian premier hailed a “landmark deal” under a “new strategic partnership” with China, turning the page on years of diplomatic spats, retaliatory arrests of each other’s citizens and tariff disputes.
Carney has sought to reduce his country’s reliance on the United States, its key economic partner and traditional ally, as President Donald Trump has aggressively raised tariffs on Canadian products.
“Canada and China have reached a preliminary but landmark trade agreement to remove trade barriers and reduce tariffs,” Carney told a news conference after meeting with Xi.
Under the deal, China — which used to be Canada’s largest market for canola seed — is expected to reduce tariffs on canola products by March 1 to around 15 per cent, down from the current 84pc.
China will also allow Canadian visitors to enter the country visa-free.
In turn, Canada will import 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) under new, preferential tariffs of 6.1pc.
“This is a return to the levels that existed prior to recent trade frictions,” Carney said of the EV deal.
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government’s decision to allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a low tariff rate is “problematic” and said Canada may come to regret the decision. “I think it’s problematic for Canada,” Greer told CNBC on Thursday.
Welcoming Carney in the Great Hall of the People, Xi said China-Canada relations reached a turning point at their last meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in October. “It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,” Xi told the Canadian leader.
“The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations serves the common interests of our two countries,” he said, adding he was “glad” to see discussions over the last few months to restore cooperation.
Ties between the two nations withered in 2018 over Canada’s arrest of the daughter of Huawei’s founder on a US warrant, and China’s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.
The two countries imposed tariffs on each other’s exports in the years that ensued, with China also accused of interfering in Canada’s elections.
But Carney has sought a pivot, and Beijing has also said it is willing to get relations back on “the right track”.
Canada, traditionally a staunch US ally, has been hit especially hard by Trump’s steep tariffs on steel, aluminium, vehicles and lumber.
Washington’s moves have prompted Canada to seek business elsewhere.

ISLAMABAD: Senators on Fri­day called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under 18, with the chair proposing a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries.
The issue was raised through a calling-attention notice moved by Senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan.
Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee comprising representatives of the ministries of information technology, interior, education and law, along with parliamentary parties and provincial governments. She said the final decision would rest with Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani.
Speaking on the notice, Senator Naz said most platforms were designed for adults and warned that children’s exposure to inappropriate content could make them vulnerable to online harassment, exploitation and dangerous trends.
She referred to last year’s killing of Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old TikToker, and said such incidents underscored the risks of unmonitored social media use for minors.
She called for a comprehensive legal framework and urged the government to introduce mandatory age verification, parental supervision and other protective measures.
She also demanded restrictions on the use of TikTok, Instagram, VPNs and similar tools by children below 18. “The matter is serious in nature and immediate and serious steps should be taken to prevent children from further dangers of social media,” she said, seeking a briefing from the IT ministry on existing laws and a future action plan.
Senator Fawzia Arshad said social media had become a serious concern for parents and required a collective response. She stressed the need for counselling in educational institutions to guide children and discourage harmful online behaviour.
“The age between 16 and 18 is very vulnerable and fragile,” she said, adding that the problem could worsen without proper guidance. She also said civics and moral development were insufficiently covered in the curriculum.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry described the matter as a national issue and said it should be referred to the relevant standing committee.
He said the issue was not limited to the IT ministry and involved the ministries of education and interior as well. He called for coordination among stakeholders to propose curriculum changes and appropriate restrictions for underage users in line with international practices. “This is not a challenge for Pakistan but an international issue,” he said.
The minister said law enforcement and cybercrime institutions, including the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should be engaged in efforts to address the issue.
“There is a need for a national debate to find a solution to save the underage children from the dangers (of social media),” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman noted that Australia had introduced legislation to restrict social media use for children under 16, but said she was not in favour of blanket bans. Describing social media as an educational tool as well, she said the Senate should consider all aspects and proceed “judiciously”.
PTI protest
Separately, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers criticised what they described as a continued ban on meetings with the party’s founder Imran Khan, alleging violations of court orders.
Speaking on a point of order, PTI parliamentary leader Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been kept in solitary confinement for the past two months, calling it the “worst form of torture” prohibited under the Constitution, domestic laws and international human rights conventions.
He alleged that the jail authorities were effectively punishing the couple without trial, arguing that prolonged detention under harsh prison conditions amounted to punishment in itself. The cases against them were being used as political tools, he said.
Senator Zafar rejected the government’s assertion that meetings were not allowed because visitors made political statements, saying this could not justify the denial of fundamental rights. “Legal rights cannot be suspended on political grounds,” he said.
He told the House that, despite being legal counsel for Mr Khan, he was not being allowed to meet his client, describing this as a violation of the sanctity of the lawyer-client relationship and a denial of the right to legal defence.
PTI Senator Falak Naz also said Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and that no one had been allowed to meet him for the past two months.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the jail superintendent had the authority to schedule meetings based on conduct. He pointed out that Adiala Jail fell under the jurisdiction of the Punjab government and that the federal government had no authority to issue directions in this regard.
The minister rejected the opposition’s claim that Mr Khan was being kept in solitary confinement.
Separately, the House also discussed reports of tree cutting in Chitral, with Senator Naz alleging that the timber mafia continued illegal felling. Senator Sherry Rehman said Chitral had “turned brown from green” over the past two decades, adding that the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change would take up the issue in its next meeting.
Senator Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said forestry was a provincial subject but noted that the federal government could write to the provincial authorities.

Members highlighted the problem of fake driving challans, as well as fraudulent messages from educational institutions, banks, mobile phone companies and other entities. It was also informed that in some cases people responded to such fake messages and later faced charges of blasphemy and anti-state activities, resulting in imprisonment.
On the other hand, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry claimed that necessary steps were being taken to introduce reforms in the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in order to effectively tackle cybercrimes.
PTI leader Sheryar Afridi informed the House that a large number of young people were facing cases and imprisonment after being declared guilty of committing blasphemy and anti-state activities.

House told NCCIA received over 150,000 cybercrime complaints in a year

“A number of people told me outside Adiala jail that they and their family members are facing cases after responding to some fake messages on the internet from people posing as representatives of educational institutions, banks and other organisations,” he added.
PPP legislator Shazia Marri drew the attention of the assembly to fake traffic challans (fines) sent by fraudsters and hackers. She said a large number of people had been cheated through such messages, as they believed them to be genuine and paid fines to the perpetrators.
In response, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said he had also received such messages claiming that he had committed traffic violations and was liable to pay fines.
Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhry said the NCCIA had received over 150,000 complaints last year. He said the best officers had been appointed to the agency and that efforts were under way to enhance its capacity.
He said over 81,000 of these complaints were related to financial crimes, and that 1,095 accused persons had been arrested. He added that cellular companies had been directed to enhance their security features for the issuance of SIMs.
Responding to a question, Mr Chaud­hry said the air quality of Islamabad had improved compared to a year ago. He said measures such as vehicle emission certification were among the steps taken to improve the environment.
To another question, the minister expressed the government’s commitment to purging Islamabad of all kinds of encroachments.
Responding to a calling attention notice, he said Vision 2027 would be announced this month for the development of the federal capital territory.
Privatisation
Later, State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani told the House that PIA had been privatised in the most transparent manner in accordance with the law and the Constitution. He clarified that only the core operations of the airline had been privatised, while PIA-owned hotels were not part of the transaction.
Expressing confidence in the move, Bilal Kayani said the privatisation would improve service delivery and strengthen the airline’s financial position.
Responding to a calling attention notice, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan said interventions had been made to achieve the target of $6bn in exports.
Bills introduced
Meanwhile, several bills were laid before the House. These included the Export Development Fund Amendment Bill, 2026; the National Tariff Commis­sion Amendment Bill, 2026; the Export-Import Bank of Pakistan Amendment Bill, 2026; the Pakistan Telecommu­ni­cation Reorganisation Amendment Bill; the Life Insurance Nationalisation Ame­n­dment Bill; the Federal Board of Inter­mediate and Secondary Education Amen­dment Bill; the Islamabad Capital Territory Condominium (Ownership and Management) Bill; and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Amendment Bill, 2026.

The employee earns these benefits through long, continuous, faithful and unblemished service, observed Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui in a six-page judgement that upheld the right of a former civil servant to receive pension benefits despite the fact that he had applied for pension 13 years after his resignation.

 

Justice Siddiqui was a member of a three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, which also comprised Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.
The bench had taken up an appeal filed by Muhammad Usman against the July 3, 2024 rejection of his plea by the Federal Service Tribunal (FST).

Sets aside ruling of service tribunal on plea by ex-auditor

The appellant was a former senior auditor (BS-11) in the office of the Military Accountant General, Rawalpindi. He was held disentitled to pension benefits on the grounds that he had tendered resignation from public service and applied belatedly for the release of pensionary benefits, notwithstanding the fact that the requisite length of service — i.e. 20 years — had already been completed by the employee.
Earlier, his department dismissed the application on the grounds that the qualifying length of service for pension benefits was 25 years. Likewise, his subsequent application for condonation of the shortfall period was also declined on Oct 27, 2020.
The SC noted that since the resignation was tendered in September 2007, the petitioner, for the purposes of pension benefits, was required to have served for a period of 20 years, as the relevant clause (i) to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, had been amended through Ordinance No XXXIV of 2001 on Aug 4, 2001, whereby the qualifying service was reduced from 25 to 20 years.
During the hearing, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rashideen Nawaz Qasoori did not object to the fact that, at the relevant time when the resignation was tendered, the petitioner had completed the requisite period of 20 years.
However, the AAG opposed the grant of pension benefits to the petitioner on two counts: first, that the petitioner had belatedly applied for the pension claim; and second, that since he had tendered resignation on his own from public service, Regulation 418 of the Civil Service Regulations would disentitle him from such a claim.
The petitioner had moved the department for the first time to claim pension benefits in the year 2020, i.e. after a lapse of 13 years from the date of tendering resignation, which was later accepted. This delay was considered sufficient by the relevant department to disentitle the petitioner from claiming pensionary benefits, the judgement noted.
However, treating CSR as an independent provision to oust a civil servant from claiming pension benefits after successful completion of the requisite length of service was misconceived and legally untenable, the SC ruled.
The apex court further held that both the FST and the concerned departmental authority had failed to understand the true spirit of Regulation 418 of the CSR, and that a belated application to claim pension benefits did not, by itself, constitute a ground for disentitlement.
While concluding, the SC set aside the FST order as unsustainable and converted the petition into an appeal, holding that the appellant was entitled to his pension benefits in accordance with law.

Winning the toss at the Takashinga Sports Club in Harare, Pakistan U19 team captain Farhan Yousuf elected to field first — a decision that turned out to be in the team’s favour as it bowled out England for just 210 in a fifty-over match.
English batter Caleb Falconer scored 66 runs, for which he also got the Man of the Match award later, aided by Ben Dawkins’ 33 and Ralphie Albert’s 25.
With the help of the commanding spells by Pakistani bowler Ahmed Hussain, who took three wickets, and Ali Raza, Abdul Subhan, and Moshin Qamar, who grabbed two wickets each, Pakistan established their position, booming in the first innings.
While chasing the target, howeve, Pakistan’s top order could not stand England’s Alex Green and James Minto’s bowling attack, as both took a couple of wickets each.
Six of Pakistan’s batters were sent back to the pavilion at the score of just 86 runs.
Despite captain Yousaf’s 65-run knock, a fighting and resilient one, no other Pakistan batter could sustain on the pitch anymore to keep the chase alive.
U19 Asia Cup’s Final hero Sameer Minhas could only add 10 runs before being out of the innings.
England bowled Pakistan out for just 173 runs in 46.3 overs.
In the upcoming match, Pakistan U19 cricket team has to face Scotland’s U19 on Jan 19.
The tournament opener turned out to be gloomy, but the remaining matches could help Green Shirts keep the hopes up for the knockouts.</p><small>2026-01-16 19:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16225916bf89cd2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967326/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-countries-that-dont-back-greenland-takeover-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens tariffs on countries that don’t back Greenland takeover plan</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said Friday he may impose trade tariffs on countries that don’t support his plans to take over Greenland, part of the territory of Denmark.
“I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,” Trump said at a health roundtable at the White House. “I may do that,” added Trump.
Trump compared the possible Greenland tariffs to those that he threatened on France and Germany last year over the price of pharmaceutical products.
The threat is the latest pressure tactic by Republican Trump as he steps up his bid to acquire the autonomous Arctic island, a goal that he has threatened to achieve by military means if necessary.
Trump claims the United States needs mineral-rich Greenland and has accused Greenland of not doing enough to ensure its security against rivals Russia and China.
European nations have in recent days shown their support for North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (Nato) ally Denmark and Greenland over Trump’s escalating threats, including by sending troops to the strategic territory.
The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland visited the White House on Wednesday for talks to defuse the issue, but said afterwards that they remained in “fundamental disagreement” with Trump.
But the United States, Denmark and Greenland had agreed to set up a working group to continue talks every two to three weeks on the issue, the White House said on Thursday.
US congress members visit Denmark to support Greenland
A bipartisan US Congress delegation began a visit to Copenhagen on Friday to voice support for Denmark and Greenland after Trump threatened to take over the Arctic island, an autonomous Danish territory.
The two-day visit comes alongside a European show of support in the form of a military reconnaissance mission to Greenland.
The 11 congressmen and women were to hold talks with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen.
The group arrived at the Danish employers’ association Dansk Industri around midday for discussions with business leaders.
They were due later to meet members of the Danish parliament, over which the Greenlandic flag was raised on Friday in a show of unity.
“We are showing bipartisan solidarity with the people of this country and with Greenland. They’ve been our friends and allies for decades,” Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told reporters.
“We want them to know we appreciate that very much. And the statements being made by the president do not reflect what the American people feel,” he added of Trump.
An AFP reporter in Copenhagen saw a large black van leave Frederiksen’s office shortly before noon on Friday, but her office declined to confirm whether the meeting had taken place.
The delegation’s visit follows a meeting in Washington on Wednesday at which Danish representatives said Copenhagen and Washington were in “fundamental disagreement” over the future of Greenland.
In Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, residents welcomed the show of support.
“(US) Congress would never approve of a military action in Greenland. It’s just one idiot speaking,” a 39-year-old union representative told AFP.
“If he does it, he’ll get impeached or kicked out. If people in Congress want to save their own democracy, they have to step up,” said the union rep, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Trump claims the United States needs mineral-rich Greenland and has criticised Denmark for, he says, not doing enough to ensure its security.
The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland — as part of Denmark — being covered by NATO’s security umbrella.
Military personnel were more visible in Nuuk on Friday, according to an AFP journalist, days after Denmark said it was beefing up its defence on the island.
“I don’t think troops in Europe impact the president’s decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.
Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen retorted that a US acquisition of Greenland was “out of the question”.
The European troop deployment in Greenland for a military exercise is aimed at “sending a signal” to “everyone”, including the United States, that European countries are determined to “defend (their) sovereignty”, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said.
Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced the deployment of small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic.
“A first team of French service members is already on site and will be reinforced in the coming days with land, air and maritime assets,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.
Large demonstrations are planned across Denmark and Greenland on Saturday to protest against Trump’s territorial ambitions.
Thousands of people have taken to social networks to say they intend to take part in the protests organised by Greenlandic associations in Nuuk and Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense.
In addition to Durbin, the US delegation included Democratic senators Chris Coons, Jeanne Shaheen and Peter Welch, as well as Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Thom Tillis.
Democrats from the House of Representatives in the delegation are Madeleine Dean, Steny Hoyer, Sara Jacobs, Sarah McBride and Gregory Meeks.</p><small>2026-01-16 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16220125384405d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967324/pti-leaders-want-dialogue-but-imran-not-in-favour-of-it-rana-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders want dialogue but Imran not in favour of it: Rana Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government, but jailed party founder Imran Khan opposed the move even as the party remained firm on its call for protests on February 8.
In December, the PTI had denied dialogue with the government until “ensuring a level-playing field” was provided to the party through its ongoing “street movement” — an agitation campaign against the government.
Speaking during Geo News’s programme Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal, Sanaullah said that the government had been in contact with PTI leaders for dialogue, stating that “several of them are in favour of negotiations with the government.”
“Whenever politicians come to the table for talks, problems get solved, and a way gets paved,” he said.
Sanaullah reiterated that many PTI leaders were in favour of dialogue, but  “whenever they meet us, they say that the PTI founder is not in favour of any sort of dialogue with the government,” he added.
He further said that PTI’s arrangement, speeches, and mobilisation efforts for the upcoming protest on Feb 8 indicated that they were “standing firm on their decision and wouldn’t step back as per the government’s assessment”.
“However,” he added, “the PTI leaders think that if they get to meet Imran, they could convince him to postpone the protest and initiate dialogue with the government.”
When asked about the meeting of PTI leaders with Imran, Sanaullah said: “They have gone too far now; any initiation of dialogues or meeting with Imran Khan can be possible only after Feb 8.”
“They are preparing for the protest at full throttle, so meeting them before that would not be possible,” he said.
The former interior minister also implied that the government would deal with the protests “administratively”, and PTI would emerge “unsuccessful”.
He advised the PTI to “play its role” in the parliamentary processes and return to the committee proceedings from which they had abstained.
Earlier, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran.
It further maintained that it would not engage in negotiations with the government, as the stance it followed was in line with the directions passed on by Imran.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1619413586c48bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967318/20-containers-destroyed-as-huge-fire-erupts-at-karachi-port-officials' target='_blank'><strong>20 containers destroyed as huge fire erupts at Karachi Port: officials</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: At least 20 containers, mostly containing electrical batteries, were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon, but no casualties were reported as workers were away for Friday prayer, according to officials and rescue services officials.
South-DIG, Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the police “immediately responded to the fire that broke out in a container at Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT), West Wharf, within the limits of Docks police”, while rescue and fire teams also reached there for fire extinguishing efforts.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson, Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan, said that the central command and control room “received information of the outbreak of fire in a container at West Wharf, gate-20 at around 1:45pm”.
“Another container caught the fire by the time the team reached the spot,” he told Dawn, adding, “The teams then called for back-up rescue teams.”
“The container carrying electrical, dry chemical and lithium batteries spontaneously triggered the fire, which spread and engulfed 19 other containers carrying batteries, clothes and other goods,” the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding all 20 containers were completely destroyed, causing massive financial losses.
He noted that his teams faced difficulties in putting out the fire as it did not require water to extinguish it, but a specialised powder to control it.
Khan further said, “The Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation had provided water tankers, while 20 fire tenders of the rescue service, fire brigade of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), KPT and Pakistan Navy managed to control the fire by 4:50pm.”
Regarding the possible cause of the fire, Khan said, “This is an emerging challenge for firefighters in the metropolis as such batteries being used in electrical vehicles spontaneously trigger fire due to certain temperature and emerging as a new health hazard.”
He recalled that last year, a luxury electronic vehicle parked at a showroom in Defence Housing Authority had triggered a fire because of its battery, resulting in death of two women and injuries to several others.
Khan suspected the same thing might have happened in today’s incident at the KPT, as the container which caught fire was carrying a similar type of batteries.
Khan said their rescue teams were collaborating with rescue teams in Punjab and Islamabad to deal with the new challenge of spontaneous fire that is emerging due to the batteries being used in electric vehicles.
However, Raza told Dawn that during the initial probe, it transpired that the fire broke out due to a short circuit in the container filled with clothes, which spread and engulfed other containers. “The fire was completely controlled by 4:30pm, however, cooling work continued.”
He said so far, no injury was reported, while further information about the incident and financial losses was being obtained.
According to a KPT public relations officer (PRO), Shariq Ameen Farooqi, “Fire erupted in a container at KICT Terminal, Karachi Port, West Wharf. The fire was spreading quickly in the closely placed set of containers, which were also placed on one another.”
“An immediate and well-coordinated emergency response was carried out, led by Karachi Port Trust Fire Brigade Service,” he added.
He said that a total of 8 fire tenders from KPT were deployed on-site, supported by 4 fire tenders from the Pakistan Navy, one from Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works, and two fire tenders from Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.
“Through swift action, effective coordination, and professional handling by all responding teams, the fire was successfully brought under control, preventing its spread and ensuring the safety of port infrastructure and operations.”
He said that KPT acknowledged and appreciated the timely support, professionalism, and teamwork of all participating agencies in safeguarding Karachi Port.
In 2020, two people were burned to death, and three others were injured when a huge fire broke out at an oil terminal in Keamari.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16221734bc594ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967325/india-liquidates-chabahar-stakes-over-trumps-tariff-threat' target='_blank'><strong>India liquidates Chabahar stakes over Trump’s tariff threat</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI:  Responding to renewed US sanctions, India transferred approximately $120 million to Iran to fully liquidate its financial commitment for developing Chabahar port, a key gateway to landlocked Afghanistan, The Economic Times said on Friday.
A government source stated that India now has “no liability” in its commitment and that Iran is free to use the funds independently.
In October last year, India was granted a six-month exemption from US sanctions on the port. New Delhi and Tehran signed a contract to develop and equip the long-stalled Chabahar project in 2024, giving India 10 years of access.
Following the reimposition of sanctions, the state-owned entity India Ports Global Ltd (IPGL) effectively exited the project.
Government directors resigned en masse, and its website was taken down to “insulate everybody associated with the port from potential sanctions”. A government source concluded, “India has no choice but to exit the Chabahar port”.
The collapse followed US President Donald Trump’s January 12, 2026, warning that any country doing business with Iran would face a 25 per cent tariff on all business with the United States.
The decision, say officials, was driven by a stark cost-benefit analysis under immense US pressure. Combined with existing punitive tariffs, this could have raised total duties on Indian exports to the US to as high as 75pc.
The value of protecting Chabahar (with bilateral India-Iran trade at about $1.68 billion) paled in comparison to the risk of losing access to the US market.
The US had already crippled the project by reimposing sanctions on the port effective September 29, 2025. India’s transfer of funds and operational wind-down were designed to secure a temporary six-month sanctions exemption from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This was a tactical move to avoid secondary sanctions on Indian entities.
Indian officials sought to downplay the direct trade impact, noting that Iran is not among India’s top 50 trading partners, accounting for only about 0.15pc of India’s overall trade.
This made the strategic project easier to sacrifice in the face of a broader US trade confrontation.
Sources said that with the Taliban’s rise in Afghanistan diminishing Chabahar’s primary utility as a gateway, and with Iran facing internal unrest, the project’s strategic returns appeared increasingly uncertain.
The decision reflects a pragmatic, if reluctant, prioritisation of immediate economic security with the US over long-term regional connectivity goals.
With the surrender, India loses a critical gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia that allowed it to bypass Pakistan, undermining years of diplomatic and financial investment aimed at expanding regional influence.
The episode also starkly reveals the limits of India’s “multi-alignment” policy. When confronted with a direct clash between US demands and its partnership with Iran, India chose to capitulate to Washington, potentially damaging its credibility as a reliable, independent strategic partner, analysts say.
There’s a view that India’s withdrawal creates a vacuum in Chabahar’s development that China, with its deeper pockets and greater willingness to defy US sanctions, is well-positioned to fill. This could further expand China’s influence in the Indian Ocean region.
While the overall trade volume with Iran is small, specific sectors like basmati rice exports (where Iran is India’s largest market) face immediate disruption due to payment delays and shipment uncertainties, reports said.
India’s business sources say the apparent “flip-flop” on Chabahar is not a capricious policy change but a forced retreat.
It underscores a painful reality: when confronted with a binary choice between safeguarding its vital economic ties with the United States and preserving a strategically important but economically secondary project with Iran, New Delhi will prioritise the former.
The move secures short-term economic relief but at the cost of a long-term strategic vision, highlighting the persistent vulnerability of middle powers in an increasingly polarised world order.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1620405422bfddc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967315/fpcci-warns-against-widespread-textile-factory-closures-unemployment-amid-high-energy-tariffs-taxes' target='_blank'><strong>FPCCI warns against widespread textile factory closures, unemployment amid high energy tariffs, taxes</strong></a><br><p>The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Friday warned that Pakistan’s industrial sector was facing a severe crisis due to high energy tariffs and heavy taxation, leading to widespread factory closures and job losses.
In December, it was reported that over 100 spinning mills and over 400 ginning factories had become non-operational, triggered by unprecedented taxes, high power tariffs, and a surge in under-invoiced cotton yarn and fabric imports from China and other countries.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, President FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said, “Costly electricity has crippled industrial activity, particularly in the textile sector.”
“Around 150 large textile units had shut down over the past two years,” he stated.
Sheikh urged the government to immediately abolish cross-subsidies imposed on the industrial sector and reduce the policy rate to single digits.
He proposed that interest rates be cut first to nine per cent and subsequently to seven per cent to revive industrial growth and investment.
Trader and business leader SM Tanvir said that the situation had also been highlighted in the World Economic Forum’s 2026 report, which increased Pakistan’s risk rating.
“According to the report,” he said, “The business activity and employment opportunities in the country are declining, while the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector has been reduced to a junkyard.”
Tanvir criticised tax policies, saying “non-filers face no scrutiny when depositing money in banks, but are heavily taxed”. “It appears the Federal Board of Revenue is working to please banks,” he alleged.
FPCCI officials warned that if the government failed to urgently address the issue of expensive electricity, the industrial sector could come to a “standstill”.
The officials criticised the government and the Power Division for not passing the relief of reduction in electricity tariff to the industrial consumers.
Recently, after NEPRA determined a reduction in the base tariff of electricity, the power division maintained that the number of domestic consumers availing subsidised rates was very high.
They emphasised that there was additional electricity available in the country, but the capacity charges for unused power units were paid by the citizens of the country.
Furthermore, they highlighted that the industrial tariff was around 12.5 cents per unit in Pakistan, whereas it was around 7.5 cents in India.
They appealed to the prime minister to “remove the industry from the ventilator” and reduce taxes on the export sector to prevent further economic decline.
According to an analysis, Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed.
It further said that high and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation.</p><small>2026-01-16 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16202455c97935a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967321/pause-on-immigrant-visas-until-vetting-meets-maximum-degree-of-eligibility-says-us-mission-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pause on immigrant visas until vetting meets ‘maximum degree’ of eligibility, says US mission in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The US government has said that it decided to pause immigrant visa processing until it ensures new applicants are “vetted to the maximum degree to ensure their eligibility”, according to a Friday statement shared by the US Embassy in Islamabad on the X platform.
On Wednesday, the US announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, along with 74 other countries, effective from January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.
“The Trump Administration is focused on protecting the American people by upholding the highest standards of screening and vetting of visa applicants,” the statement said.







“Effective January 21,” the statement added, “the Department of State is pausing issuance to all immigrant visa applicants from selected countries, including Pakistan.”
The statement said that US State Secretary Marco Rubio had instituted this pause until his government could “ensure that new immigrants have been vetted to the maximum degree to ensure their eligibility for a US visa”, including that they would “not use public assistance”.
However, the statement clarified that the action would apply to the issuance of immigrant visas “only”.
“It does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, students, athletes, skilled workers, and their families,” the statement added.
Earlier, the State Department had said, “The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”







Pakistan was among more than 75 countries whose nationals will be affected under the new measure, which the State Department said is part of a comprehensive review ordered by President Donald Trump to ensure that immigrants are “financially self-sufficient and not a financial burden to Americans.”
“President Trump has made clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,” the department said, adding that all policies, regulations and guidance are being reviewed to prevent immigrants from becoming a public charge.</p><small>2026-01-16 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16212454ed38352.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967323/security-forces-kill-12-terrorists-thwart-hostage-attempt-in-balochistans-kharan-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 12 terrorists, thwart hostage attempt in Balochistan’s Kharan district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 12 terrorists and effectively thwarted their attempt to create a hostage situation in Balochistan’s Kharan district during multiple operations, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR),  on January 15, “approximately fifteen to twenty Indian-sponsored terrorists of Fitna Al Hindustan carried out multiple terrorist activities in Kharan City, District Kharan.”
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
It said that during the operations, “terrorists attacked [the] City Police Station, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited.” They also looted Rs3.4 million from the banks.
“Security forces effectively responded and engaged the terrorists, prompting them to retreat. During the ensuing clearance operation, twelve terrorists were sent to hell in three different engagements,” the ISPR said.
“Terrorists’ design to create a hostage situation at the police station was also effectively thwarted.”
It added that a sanitisation operation is underway in the surrounding areas of Kharan to eliminate any other terrorists.
“A relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm-e-Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
On January 6, ISPR Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared during a press conference that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.
Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan.
He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.
On January 13, the ISPR said four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.

According to a report by The Independent, the website and its app failed to load for users across the globe, with many visitors saying they saw a blank screen.
“Some users also saw Cloudflare error pages – though the issue was at X itself, and the problem did not seem to be a repeat of recent Cloudflare technical issues that did take X offline,” the report said.
Staffers at Dawn also saw a Cloudflare error page when they tried accessing the website, while the app did not load at all and showed posts from hours ago.

According to Reuters, there were more than 41,000 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 10:35 am ET in the United States  (8:35pm PKT), according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.
The actual number of affected users may differ from what is shown on Downdetector, as the reports are submitted by users.
Users in the UK reported around 8,000 incidents, and over 2,400 issues were reported in India.
X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
On Tuesday, thousands of users worldwide reported issues with accessing the X, with the outage beginning around 9am Eastern (7:38pm PKT), peaking at more than 28,300 logged issues with Elon Musk’s platform in the US before cooling to about 700 reports, according to Downdetector.
In the UK, reports fell to roughly 130 from a high of more than 8,000, while Canada saw issues decline after topping 3,200 earlier in the day, according to the website that tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.
In Pakistan, complaints peaked at 93 at 7:38pm, falling to four by 8:23pm.
In November 2025, a Cloudflare outage had briefly prevented access to X after a faulty security configuration crashed its traffic system. A few days later, a separate disruption took X offline for thousands of US users.

Afridi visited Karachi and other cities of Sindh last week as part of the PTI’s renewed anti-government agitation campaign called the “street movement”. The chief minister decried the treatment meted out to him by the Sindh government during his visit, alleging that the police tried to stop his motorcade and PTI supporters from staging a peaceful protest at Mazar-i-Quaid. The Sindh government denied the allegations, stating that the Jinnah Ground was under the control of the Centre, so it was not entitled to issue a no-objection certificate to the party.
Speaking to reporters in Karachi, Governor Tessori said that the PTI had “turned the whole country upside down, but the agitation was confined to social media and had no value on the ground.”
Referring to KP CM’s Karachi visit, Tessori said, “You must come here, we will welcome you again, but come with positive work to do”.
He suggested that CM Afridi should meet with traders and industrialists and ask them to invest in his province instead of mobilising people to take to the streets.
“If you talk about establishing new industries, expanding inter-provincial trade, the future of people, giving health and educational opportunities, people will definitely welcome you,” Tessori said.
“However, incendiary political narrative, incitement to vandalism, blockades, causing trouble to people — these things will not be welcomed.”
The governor added that putting this city to a halt caused losses worth billions of rupees, because “Karachi is the financial and economic hub of Pakistan,” he stated.
“For God’s sake, don’t do this,” Tessori pleaded.
He reminded the chief minister that Pakistan was now at the centre of the “global lens”, making progress through diplomatic efforts.
“Why don’t you understand that we are a triumphant nation and the time has come to pull ourselves out of the problems we have been facing for the last 70 years,” he said.
He said that repeating the incidents of May 9  — when PTI supporters staged violent nationwide protests, vandalising state-owned institutions and military installations following Imran Khan’s arrest — at this stage would be “equivalent to a foreign conspiracy and a foreign agenda.”
“We have to provide educational opportunities because I believe that ignorance is the biggest reason for terrorism,” the governor said.
Speaking in favour of the armed forces and calling the chief minister out for criticising them, Tessori said that politicians might disappoint the nation, but the army would never do that.
“Didn’t we see what happened on May 10?” he questioned.
Tessori added that the world was praising the Pakistani Army and acknowledging the country’s defence capabilities, but the PTI was doing the opposite. “Rather than lauding your army, you started abusing it.”
“Is there any country or leader in the world who talks against his own army?”
He was referring to Imran’s recent social media comments against the leadership of the armed forces on the X platform, in response to which the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations had called him a “national security threat”.
“There are countries where presidents can be picked up, and their armies can’t do anything”, Tessori said, “but India couldn’t even seize an inch of land of Pakistan because of our army.”
“Politicians may disappoint you, but not your army.”
He accepted that the country was facing economic difficulties, though the world was handing orders to Pakistan’s defence industries to manufacture aircraft. “Our economy will improve by this,” he stated.
Further criticising the PTI, Governor Tessori said that Karachi city gave the PTI a president, Arif Alvi, who was a citizen of this city. “Tell me how many projects he gave to Karachi,” he asked.
“Karachi gave the MNA seat to Imran Khan, but he hadn’t even spent a night in this city.”
“Tell us what your performance was?” he asked. “How many industries had he [Imran] inaugurated in Karachi?”
“What have you done for Pashtuns, Balochs, Sindhis, Urdu-speaking, and other communities in this city?” he questioned. “But you made speeches to incite violence like May 9.”
“Name a single project,” he challenged. “Even if some time is given to you now, you still can’t do anything.”
Governor Tessori added that PTI could only incite innocent people on social media and sold them a narrative that had neither rendered them any favour nor could it now.
“We have to choose whether we want to strengthen our country economically and educationally, or go after the people who would just make you chant slogans and hold flags,” he stated.</p><small>2026-01-16 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16191841f0895d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967317/russia-pakistan-relations-genuinely-mutually-beneficial-says-president-putin' target='_blank'><strong>Russia-Pakistan relations ‘genuinely mutually beneficial’, says President Putin</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that his country’s relations with Pakistan are “genuinely mutually beneficial” and that Moscow maintains close relations with Islamabad.
“We maintain close cooperation with Pakistan, a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the largest regional organisation in terms of economic, technological, and human potential. Russia-Pakistan relations are genuinely mutually beneficial,” the Embassy of Russia in Pakistan quoted President Putin as saying on X.







The statement came as Pakistan’s Ambassador to Russia, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, formally presented his credentials to President Putin during a ceremony held on Thursday at Moscow’s Grand Kremlin Palace, according to the Pakistani Embassy in Russia.
In recent years, Pakistan and Russia have significantly strengthened their economic ties, driven by mutual necessity. Following Western sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict, Moscow turned toward new energy outlets, while Islamabad simultaneously sought more affordable fuel sources to reduce national import expenses.
This diplomatic shift culminated in 2023, when Pakistan officially integrated Russian crude oil into its energy portfolio.
Last month, Finance Mini­ster Muhammad Aur­a­ngzeb said Islamabad and Moscow were in talks regarding a new potential oil-sector agreement.
Pakistan, which imports 70 per cent of its crude oil, is mainly dependent on Russian crude exports. Despite this, Pakis­tan has enjoyed lower tariffs from Washington and close relations with its current administration, even as India recently saw a punitive 25pc tariff impo­sed on its goods.
In November last year — as Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev visited Islamabad to participate in the 10th Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission — the two countries reaffirmed their resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation in diversified trade, energy, business-to-business engagements and social sectors like health and education.</p><small>2026-01-16 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161605089a733d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967311/shah-mehmood-qureshi-refuses-to-support-fawad-chaudhrys-committee-says-cant-deviate-from-ptis-policies' target='_blank'><strong>Shah Mehmood Qureshi refuses to support Fawad Chaudhry’s committee, says can’t deviate from PTI’s policies</strong></a><br><p>PTI Vice-Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday refused to support former party leader Fawad Chaudhry’s National Dialogue Committee, saying he cannot “deviate from PTI’s policies”.
The senior PTI leader, incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail since 2023 in cases related to the May 9 riots, made the remarks during an informal discussion with a journalist in a courtroom.
In response to a question on “consensual” meeting with Chaudhry, the PTI leader said, “While I was in the hospital, he visited to inquire about my health. We both remained in a political party. How could I ask a guest why he came to meet me?”
Last year in November, Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood tried to gain access to Qureshi, who was hospitalised, when he was alone in his room, ostensibly to convince the senior PTI leader to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by him.
Speaking on the current political situation, he said a solution needed to be found as “the country could only move forward with dialogue”. “Resistance is followed by reconciliation,” he said.
In reference to the dialogue between the government and opposition, he said, “[PTI’s incarcerated leader] Imran Khan has authorised Mehmood Khan Achakzai to take a decision regarding dialogues. He can make a better decision regarding the future course of action, as we are in prison with limited information.”
While speaking on the prevailing relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, he said that Islamabad had supported Kabul, and this had been our “legitimate demand” that “their soil must not be used against us”.
If Afghan Taliban “want stability, they have to maintain good relations with Pakistan” as their “road to prosperity passes through Pakistan,” he said, adding Islamabad “desires peace and Afghanistan has to support us against terrorism”.
He also spoke about relations with Iran and India, saying the situation was under control at the Iran border. Despite winning the war with India, he said, “the danger is not over yet”.
Last month, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) acquitted Qureshi in one of the cases related to the May 9 riots.</p><small>2026-01-16 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16220138d91ba61.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967314/eu-delegation-visits-sialkot-airport-to-monitor-departure-processes-measures-taken-to-prevent-irregular-migration' target='_blank'><strong>EU delegation visits Sialkot Airport to monitor departure processes, measures taken to prevent irregular migration</strong></a><br><p>A high-level European Union delegation on Friday visited the Sialkot International Airport to monitor the immigration processes and measures to prevent irregular migration, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) spokesperson said in a statement.
The move comes after around 66,154 passengers were offloaded last year despite holding valid documents, particularly at Lahore and Karachi airports, amid a post-2024 Greece boat tragedy crackdown on migrant smuggling, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
According to the spokesperson, the delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on the “working, performance, and achievements of the FIA Immigration at the Sialkot airport, with particular emphasis on the progress made over the last five months.”
The delegation comprised the Frontex officer to Pakistan, an official from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, a representative from the Embassy of Hungary in Pakistan, and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development’s official.
“The briefing was focused on measures taken to prevent irregular migration, including the effective implementation of risk indicators, enhanced profiling mechanisms, and optimal utilisation of the Second Line Border Control Office,” the spokesperson added in the statement.
The spokesperson stated that the EU delegation was further apprised of the pre-departure facilitation mechanisms established at both the zonal level and the airport, aimed at strengthening border management, improving operational efficiency, and creating a passenger-friendly environment.
Last week, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced that the FIA had set up pre-departure facilitation desks at all its zonal offices nationwide to assist international travellers.
“The delegation appreciated and acknowledged the professionalism and commitment in ensuring effective, secure, and robust border control operations at Sialkot International Airport,” he said.
In December, the immigration authorities of FIA offloaded four passengers, belonging to Sialkot and Gujranwala, from flights to Indonesia and Turkiye.
An FIA official told Dawn that the passengers had been in contact with the human smugglers, who had to send them to Italy through illegal means. The authorities also offloaded two passengers at the Sialkot International Airport for allegedly attempting to illegally migrate to Europe in the guise of Umrah pilgrims.
Over the past year, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents.
The immigration border management system (IBMS) data analysis of the July-December 2024 period revealed the trend of passengers travelling to at least 15 countries.
The data analysis showed that most of the passengers travelling to these transit destinations are mainly from nine districts of Punjab, including Sialkot.</p><small>2026-01-16 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16170337f116368.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967312/pm-shehbaz-relaunches-sehat-card-health-insurance-scheme-in-ict-ajk-and-gb' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz relaunches Sehat Card health insurance scheme in ICT, AJK and GB</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reintroduced the state-run health insurance programme — popularly known as the Sehat Card Programme — in the federal capital, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Speaking at the launch ceremony of the facility in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz said, “Access to health facilities is the right of every citizen, and such facilities should be delivered to their doorsteps.”
The prime minister added that through the launch of the Sehat Card, his government had taken yet another swift step to serve the nation.
“This step is the revival of the same scheme that my leader, Nawaz Sharif, had initiated in 2016 for the first time,” he said.
The scheme was originally introduced in 2016 when the PML-N government was in power. It was made available to citizens in Punjab, Balochistan, and the then Federally Administered Tribal Areas (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), with expansion plans.
In 2019, the PTI-led government relaunched the programme under the title of Sehat Insaf Card after making some changes to it, such as the provision of up to Rs720,000 worth of medical expenses of the family of each beneficiary annually, while those earning less than Rs150,000 per annum were also covered, provided such people also contributed a little to the insurance plan.
The service was partially suspended in the federal territories for three years, while residents of Islamabad, AJK and GB were suffering since March 2024, as the service was completely suspended because the federal government had failed to clear its dues.
“Nothing is more precious in life than health, as it is needed to pursue education, to earn money, take part in sports, and defeat the opposition. Nawaz Sharif’s services will be remembered and spread on a priority basis.
“Today, the Sehat Card is being issued for Islamabad, AJK and the people of GB.”
Congratulating the Health Minister, Mustafa Kamal, health secretary, and all the members of his team, PM Shehbaz added: “It should be noted that the elite in Pakistan and across the world can afford expensive treatment for themselves and their families, but it’s very hard for a common man, orphan children and labourers to earn money.
“If they or their family members fall sick and die without treatment, the lives of their dependents become very dark.”
He added that good health and the right to treatment were every Pakistani’s right.
“I hope the health minister, the secretary, and his team, through a third party, will ensure the treatment will be provided properly. And I hope this programme will continue at speed, and you will monitor it,” he said, addressing Kamal and his team.
PM Shehbaz also said that he would talk to the chief minister of Sindh regarding the initiative based on Kamal’s suggestion.
“In Punjab, this programme is onging and billions of rupees are being spent on it. Likewise, in Balochistan and KP, the programme is running successfully. I  am sure Sindh has a similar programme, and its CM is very active regarding health and education. But I will talk to him and resolve the issue so this facility will take shape there as well.”
Total of 70 hospitals to be added to covered regions: Kamal
Speaking during the ceremony, Kamal thanked the prime minister for his guidance and efforts to make the initiative possible.
“This programme was initiated in 2016 by your government, and provinces took it up. However, it was abandoned in the federal territories for the last three years, so we’ve proposed its revival.
“Now, the government will provide free-of-charge health facilities to citizens living in Islamabad, GB and AJK, making up nearly 10 million people,” he said.
Detailing the benefits of the Sehat Card, the health minister said that citizens would be able to use their card instead of cash at hospitals.
“Today, you have resolved the problem of a lot of people. May Allah help us in sustaining this initiative. Over the last four to five weeks, your efforts led to the revival of a dead programme. When we talk about healthcare, it is a matter of preventing people from falling sick, ensuring adequate gaps in childbirth, immunising children, and providing them with clean drinking water.
“Our ecosystem of health is not in an ideal condition. Our hospitals are overpopulated, so we blame doctors for this, but a doctor, who should ideally treat 35 patients, is responsible for 350 patients.”
Kamal added that under the initiative, more hospitals will be added to all three regions, “We will add a total of 70 hospitals in Islamabad, AJK and GB,” he said. “Akin to that, people possessing the CNICs of these territories can get treatment from 16 hospitals in Karachi as well.
He, however, stated that Sindh is the only province where this card cannot be utilised. “We have shortlisted 10 urban and rural districts of Sindh. We request the prime minister to include Rs24 billion for two years in the budget. For the third year, we will make the programme self-sustainable,” Kamal said.</p><small>2026-01-16 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16125209964ce96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967306/ecp-suspends-membership-of-159-lawmakers-over-non-filing-of-assets' target='_blank'><strong>ECP suspends membership of 159 lawmakers over non-filing of assets</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday suspended the membership of 159 lawmakers of the National Assembly, Senate, and provincial assemblies who failed to submit a statement of their assets and liabilities by the due date.
The commission directed that “they shall cease to function as members with immediate effect until such statements are submitted by them,” according to a statement issued by the ECP.
On Thursday, the ECP reminded lawmakers to submit the details of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouse and dependent children, for the financial year 2024-25, warning of suspension if they fail to do so by January 15.
Syed Ali Musa Gilani, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Muhammad Akhtar Mengal are among 32 members of the National Assembly whose membership has been suspended, while Musadik Malik is among nine Senators also suspended by the election regulator.
Out of the suspended MPAs, 50 are members of the Punjab Assembly, 33 of the Sindh Assembly, 28 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, and seven of the Balochistan Assembly.
Saeed Ghani and Hafiz Naeeemur Rehman are among the lawmakers from the Sindh Assembly who failed to submit details of their assets and liabilities.
The ECP had stated that the submission was a mandatory requirement under Section 137 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137 (1) of the Elections Act, 2017 stipulates that “every member of an assembly and senate shall submit to the Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a copy of his statement of assets and liabilities, including assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day of June on Form B.”
Last year, ECP suspended the membership of 139 lawmakers after they failed to submit their annual statements of assets.</p><small>2026-01-16 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16143349dc2bf15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967299/achakzai-named-opposition-leader-in-national-assembly-after-months-long-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Achakzai named opposition leader in National Assembly after months-long delay</strong></a><br><p>After a months-long delay, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly on Friday.
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had named Achakzai for the opposition leader’s slot in the NA in August last year.
The notification, seen by Dawn, read: “Honourable Speaker has been pleased to declare Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai, member of the National Assembly, as leader of the opposition in the NA, with effect from January 16, 2026.”
“The notification has been issued under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007,” said a statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat.

Prior to the notification being issued, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq summoned PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Chief Whip Amir Dogar to his chambers, stating that he had a “notification to give” them.
“Come to my chamber, I have a notification to give,” said Sadiq while addressing Gohar. The three proceeded to the speaker’s chamber while the acting speaker presided over the lower house session.







After emerging from the speaker’s chamber, the PTI chairman announced that the opposition leader had been appointed.
Gohar said that the “notification was supposed to be issued yesterday; however, it was not, due to some issues.”
“Today, it has finally been issued,” he added.
“Although it was our right, we received it today after a long delay,” he further said.



Congratulations pour in
Former opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan congratulated Achakzai on the appointment, voicing optimism that he will “fulfil his responsibilities brilliantly”.
In a post on X, Ayub said, “Heartiest congratulations to Mahmud Khan Achakzai sahib, who has been officially declared as the ‘Leader of the Opposition National Assembly’.
“It is a great singular honour, and Mahmud Khan Ackhakzai sahib will, InshahAllah, fulfil his responsibilities brilliantly,” he said.







PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan also congratulated Achakzai.
In a post on X, the PTI leader said, “Congratulations on becoming the opposition leader. It’s a great honour and responsibility given to him by our leader”.
Khan expressed hope that Achakzai, in his position, “will do his best” to ensure the release of Imran and “other innocent political prisoners, including our vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi”.
He also hoped that Achakzai would put “derailed democracy back on track”.
PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari also took to social media to congratulate the opposition leader.
“I’m sure he will not let down the trust Imran Khan has put in him. Best of luck, sir,” he said.







PTI leader Ali Asghar Khan hailed the development as well and congratulated Achakzai.
“We are sure you will fulfil this responsibility with the commitment to the people’s cause we have come to expect of you.”







The Senior Vice President of PTI’s Women’s Wing, Naureen Farooq Ibrahim, also hoped that Achakzai would “fulfil his responsibilities brilliantly”, congratulating the opposition leader.







PTI’s struggle to appoint new opposition leader
On January 13, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirmed the party’s submission of Achakzai’s nomination papers to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
It was the second time that the party had formally proposed his name for the post of opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
The slot has been vacant for almost five months since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August 2025.
On January 6, NA speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had said that the process for the appointment of the opposition leader was to be initiated afresh.
The opposition had also submitted the nomination papers for Achakzai — who also heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office in October 2025.
Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
But the submission in October was made to the speaker’s office rather than to him personally.
The opposition has also repe­atedly accused the government of delaying Achakzai’s appointment, while the NA speaker had maintained until recently that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
Ayub had filed pleas in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal, but later withdrew the petitions.
Subsequently, the NA Secretariat sent a letter to PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar in December, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing was necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
Dogar submitted the required documents to the NA speaker on January 5, following which the latter had said that the constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader would be initiated afresh in the next parliamentary session.
During the January 6 NA session, the speaker formally initiated the process for the appointment of the NA opposition leader by seeking proposals for the nomination.</p><small>2026-01-16 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16135644ed33154.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967308/ecp-withdraws-schedule-of-local-body-polls-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>ECP withdraws schedule of local body polls in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday withdrew the schedule for local government polls in Islamabad.
The development came after the promulgation of an ordinance that changed the structure of local government and the mode of elections in the federal capital.
On Monday, President Asif Ali Zardari approved the ordinance, which introduces several amendments to the Local Government Act 2015. Besides replacing the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) with three town corporations, the ordinance gives the government-appointed administrator more powers and an indefinite tenure.
The statement issued by the ECP today stated that since “the structure of Local Governments and mode of Local Government Elections in Islamabad Capital Territory have been changed” after the “promulgation” of the local body ordinance, the schedule issued earlier is being withdrawn.
Thousands of people from all 125 Union Councils of the federal capital had already submitted nomination papers for the elections.
Meanwhile, the ordinance also stated that, in the absence of local government, the administrator may hold office until new local government elections are held, replacing the previous bar that the administrator’s tenure shall not exceed six months.
The ordinance also empowered the administrator to levy tax, fee, rate, rent, toll charge or surcharge.
The federal cabinet approved 14 amendments to the Act, including a change in the name of the Metropolitan Corporation of Islamabad, replacing it with town corporations.
PTI, human rights activists, civil society organisations and residents of the federal capital rejected the new amendments to the Islamabad local government system promulgated through an ordinance.
On Wednesday, Emir Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Hafiz Naeemur Rehman demanded that local body polls in the federal capital be held as per the earlier announced schedule.
“The elections should be held on time and on the basis of nominations that have been done, while the ordinance needs to be abolished and undemocratic practices need to end,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-16 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16121643ce51aeb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967303/bushra-bibis-daughter-moves-lhc-for-visitation-rights-to-her-mother' target='_blank'><strong>Bushra Bibi’s daughter moves LHC for visitation rights to her mother</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Bushra Bibi’s daughter has moved the Lahore High Court (LHC), requesting to be allowed a meeting with her mother in Adiala Jail, it emerged on Friday.
Bushra is serving a seven-year sentence in the £190 million corruption case. She was recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case, which revolved around the purchase of an expensive jewelry set gifted to ex-premier Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during his May 2021 visit.
Bushra’s daughter, Mubashra Khawar Maneka, filed the petition through LHC Bar President Asif Niswana under Article 199 of the Constitution.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, named the Punjab government, via the home department secretary, the provincial inspector general of prisons, and the superintendent of Adiala jail as respondents.
It said that Maneka was a “law-abiding citizen of Pakistan” as well as the real biological daughter of Bushra Bibi, and was “aggrieved” by the “unlawful, arbitrary, and unjustified refusal of the jail authorities to allow her to meet her mother, despite repeated requests, clear entitlement under law, and absence of any legal bar”.
“The petitioner, being her (Bushra’s) real daughter, is deeply concerned about her physical, emotional and psychological well-being,” the petition stated.
It added that under the Pakistan Prison Rules as well as the Constitution, prisoners were entitled to family visitation, particularly by immediate blood relatives, “subject only to reasonable security regulations”.
According to the petition, Maneka had made repeated visits and requests to meet her mother but had been denied access, although she had not been informed of “any security concern, restriction, prohibition or legal impediment” that justified the denial.
“The refusal is therefore arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Pakistan prison rules and the fundamental rights granted by the Constitution of Pakistan 1973,” it said.
Further, the petition said that the sustained denial of meetings over a long time had caused mental agony, emotional trauma and psychological distress to the petitioner.
It pointed out that the right to life and liberty guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution included the right to dignity, emotional well-being and family association, while Article 14 further ensured the inviolability of human dignity, including for prisoners.
The petition requested that the LHC “issue a direction to the respondents to immediately allow the petitioner to meet her real mother, Mrs Bushra Imran Khan, at Central Jail Adiala, Rawalpindi, on any designated visitation day and time deemed appropriate”.
It also requested that the court declare the denial of visitation to immediate family members without lawful justification to be “illegal, unconstitutional and void”, and to direct the respondents of the petition to adhere to Pakistan’s Prison Rules and constitutional safeguards regarding family visitation.</p><small>2026-01-16 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16113958da931a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967301/social-media-posts-case-court-directs-islamabad-dig-to-arrest-imaan-hadi-within-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Court directs Islamabad DIG to arrest Imaan, Hadi ‘within 24 hours’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad district and sessions court on Friday issued directions to law enforcement authorities to arrest lawyer and activist Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, “within 24 hours”, warning them of contempt in case of non-compliance.
Mazari and Chattha have been facing legal proceedings in a case on accusations of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
During today’s hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka issued strict orders to the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Islamabad, Jawad Tariq, to arrest Mazari and her husband within 24 hours.
“Take them from Pakistan, India or Afghanistan. You have 24 hours. I don’t know whether they are at sea or in the sky. Wherever they are, arrest Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha within 24 hours, otherwise contempt of court proceedings will be initiated,” the judge remarked during the hearing.
A day earlier, the court cancelled the interim bail granted to the accused after they failed to appear before the court despite repeated directions.
Judge Majoka directed the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCIA) to arrest both accused and keep them in lockup upon arrest.
Additionally, the court ordered that the statements of Mazari and Chattha be recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) via video link, should their physical presence not be immediately possible.
On January 7, Mazari and her husband submitted an application seeking to summon the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general (DG ISPR) as a witness in the case.
The duo claimed that during a recent presser by the military spokesperson, an attempt was made to influence the ongoing criminal trial, as the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”.
The case
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-16 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161208498843754.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967302/trump-says-he-supports-transitional-palestinian-panel-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he supports transitional Palestinian panel in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was backing the newly appointed “Palestinian Technocratic Government” in Gaza, where Washington has announced the launch of a second phase in a ceasefire that went into effect in October but remains fragile.
“I am backing a newly appointed Palestinian Technocratic Government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, supported by the Board’s High Representative, to govern Gaza during its transition,” Trump said on social media.
Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas signed off in October on Trump’s plan, which says the Palestinian technocratic body will be overseen by an international so-called “Board of Peace” that is meant to supervise Gaza’s governance for a transitional period.
In another post, Trump said the “Board of Peace,” of which Trump himself is the chair, was formed, and its members would be announced shortly.
Israel and Hamas have accused each other of ceasefire violations in Gaza, where, since the start of the truce in October, over 440 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed.

 

The ceasefire has also been tested by the failure to retrieve the remains of one last Israeli hostage, Israeli delays in reopening Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt, and Hamas’ refusal so far to disarm.
By pressing on with the second phase of the ceasefire, Washington and its mediator partners will need to tackle the vexing challenges of disarming Hamas, further Israeli withdrawal tied to the disarmament and deploying an international peacekeeping force.
The Palestinian technocratic body will have 15 members and will be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority who had been in charge of developing industrial zones, according to a statement by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey.
“These Palestinian leaders are unwaveringly committed to a PEACEFUL future,” Trump said. Many experts say that Trump being the chair of the board meant to supervise Gaza’s governance resembled a colonial structure.
He also said Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will help to secure what he called a “comprehensive demilitarisation agreement” with Hamas.
Israel’s assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis, and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.
Israel has said it took action in self-defence after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages in their 2023 attack.</p><small>2026-01-16 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/160914257f950ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967288/at-un-pakistan-voices-hope-for-early-normalisation-of-situation-in-iran-rejects-any-external-interference' target='_blank'><strong>At UN, Pakistan voices hope for early normalisation of situation in Iran, rejects any external interference</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has told the UN Security Council that it hopes for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, warning that the UN Charter and international law prohibit external interference in the internal affairs of states.
“The UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against other states’ territorial integrity or political independence, or interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the 15-member Council on Thursday evening.
The United States convened the Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Iran, with the country’s Ambassador Mike Waltz criticising the actions taken against Iranian protesters and assuring them of President Donald Trump’s support.







In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said, “We have been carefully observing developments in Iran and the region in recent days,” pointing out that new threats to regional peace and stability remain a serious cause of concern.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
A stable and peaceful Iran is in the interests of Pakistan, the region and beyond, he said, adding that his country has full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and leadership, rooted in the country’s culture, history and resilience.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad highlighted that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct, noting that the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.
Any external interference in the internal affairs of states, he added, is inconsistent with international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
“We strongly believe that all disputes must be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with international law,” the Pakistani envoy affirmed, warning that continued hostilities, use of force and unilateral actions would only deepen crises and cause unnecessary suffering.







“We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure, and that all relevant parties will return to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said in conclusion.
Opening the debate, UN Assistant Secretary-General Martha Pobee, briefing the Security Council members, called for restraint by all parties to prevent further escalation.
Pobee described the situation in Iran as fluid and deeply concerning, noting that protests continue, albeit reportedly at a smaller scale than last week.
She voiced alarm, however, over public statements suggesting possible military strikes on the country.
“This external dimension adds volatility to an already combustible situation. All efforts must be undertaken to prevent any further deterioration,” she said.
Moreover, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remains convinced that all concerns regarding Iran, including those related to the nuclear issue and ongoing protests, are best addressed through diplomacy and dialogue.
He also urged maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and called on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation.
The protests erupted on December 28 after shopkeepers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, took to the streets to rail against the collapse of the national currency, soaring inflation and worsening living conditions.
Ambassador Waltz, the US envoy, accused the Iranian government of actions against its own citizens that have repercussions for international peace and security.
“President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America stand by the brave people of Iran,” he said. “Regardless of its excuses, the regime is solely responsible for the economic misery of the Iranian people and will be held accountable.”
Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back, saying the world has been watching as the United States continues to escalate tensions and fuel hysteria around Iran.
He said that the current Security Council meeting, requested by the United States, is nothing more than yet another attempt to justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
“And if, as Washington puts it, Iran’s authorities do not come to their senses, then Washington will solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime in order to lend credibility to and justify its actions,” the Russian envoy said.
China’s Ambassador, Sun Lei, said the United States has openly issued threats of the use of force against Iran.
Stressing that China has always advocated adherence to UN Charter principles and international law, he said sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the most fundamental norms of international affairs.
“The use of force can never solve problems,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that military adventurism would push the region towards an abyss.
“No action that defies international law can be tolerated,” he added.
Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iran, said he was speaking on behalf of a nation in mourning.
“It is deeply regrettable that the representative of the United States, which requested this meeting, has today resorted to lies, distortions of facts and deliberate disinformation to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran towards violence,” he said.
He added that the United States requested the meeting in order to conceal its direct complicity in the crimes its mercenaries have committed against Iran.
“The United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,” he said.
He described these claims as particularly cynical in light of what he called the United States’ long and well-documented record of unlawful military interventions, regime-change operations and systematic violations of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.</p><small>2026-01-16 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161043503ec89c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967300/netanyahu-urged-trump-not-to-attack-iran-report' target='_blank'><strong>Netanyahu urged Trump not to attack Iran: report</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged United States President Donald Trump to delay any American military strike on Iran, according to a report by The New York Times, a development that highlights growing regional unease over the risk of a wider conflict.
Netanyahu spoke to President Trump on Thursday, the same day the US president publicly suggested that Tehran had eased its internal crackdown and halted executions, citing information from “very important sources on the other side”, remarks that were widely read in Washington as a signal of hesitation about imminent military action, the report said.
The Israeli leader’s intervention comes as several key Arab partners of the US have also pressed the Trump administration to avoid an attack on Iran, warning that such a move could trigger a broader regional war, according to a senior official from a Gulf Arab country cited by the newspaper.
Officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt have contacted senior US officials over the past two days to convey concerns that a US strike could destabilise the region, disrupt energy flows and provoke Iranian retaliation beyond US targets, the official told NYT.
At the same time, the four Arab states have been urging Iranian officials to refrain from attacking regional countries should the United States decide to strike Iran, reflecting a coordinated effort to contain escalation on both sides, the Gulf official said.

 

Two diplomats based in the region also confirmed that multiple Arab governments have privately warned Washington against military action, reinforcing a rare convergence between Israeli caution and Arab anxiety over the potential consequences of open conflict with Iran, the report added.
Saudi Arabia has articulated its position publicly in measured terms, with Minister of State Adel al-Jubeir saying in Riyadh that the kingdom believes disagreements should be resolved through dialogue and negotiations rather than military confrontation.
Netanyahu also spoke with Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday, the same day senior Trump administration officials met at the White House to review military options against Iran, underscoring how diplomatic engagement and military planning have been unfolding simultaneously, US officials told the newspaper.
The White House has offered few details about the discussions, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirming that President Trump spoke with Netanyahu but declining to elaborate, while the Israeli prime minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment, according to the report.
For the Trump administration, the episode reflects a familiar tension between projecting military resolve and avoiding another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, particularly as US allies in the region signal concern about the fallout of escalation rather than confidence in its outcomes.
The alignment of Israeli and Arab appeals for restraint suggests that, despite deep divisions over Iran’s policies, regional actors see greater danger in a rushed military confrontation than in a temporary pause that keeps diplomatic channels open, the report concluded.</p><small>2026-01-16 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16100822b675de4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967289/trump-accepts-nobel-medal-from-venezuelan-opposition-leader-machado' target='_blank'><strong>Trump accepts Nobel medal from Venezuelan opposition leader Machado</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to US President Donald Trump on Thursday during a White House meeting, as she tries to gain some influence over how the president shapes the South American country’s political future.
A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.
In a social media post on Thursday evening, Trump wrote: “Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Maria!”







Machado, who described the meeting as “excellent,” said the gift was in recognition of what she called his commitment to the freedom of the Venezuelan people.
Machado’s attempt to sway Trump came after he dismissed the idea of installing her as Venezuela’s leader to replace the deposed Nicolas Maduro. Trump openly campaigned for the prize before Machado was awarded it last month and complained bitterly when he was snubbed.
Though Machado gave Trump the gold medal that honorees receive with the prize, the honour remains hers; the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.







Asked on Wednesday if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump told Reuters: “No, I didn’t say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize.”
The Republican president long expressed interest in winning the prize and has at times linked it to diplomatic achievements.

 

The lunch meeting, which appeared to last slightly over an hour, marked the first time the two have met in person. Machado then met with more than a dozen senators, both Republican and Democratic, on Capitol Hill, where she has generally found more enthusiastic allies.
While the visit was ongoing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had been looking forward to meeting Machado, but that he stood by his “realistic” assessment that she did not currently have the support needed to lead the country in the short term.
Machado, who fled Venezuela in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump’s ear with members of Venezuela’s government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.







After the US captured Maduro in a snatch-and-grab operation this month, various opposition figures, members of Venezuela’s diaspora and politicians throughout the US and Latin America have expressed hope that Venezuela will begin the process of democratisation.
Hopes of a move to democracy
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the senators who met with Machado, said the opposition leader had told senators that repression in Venezuela was no different now than under Maduro. Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez is a “smooth operator” who was growing more entrenched by the day thanks to Trump’s support, he said.
“I hope elections happen, but I’m sceptical,” said Murphy, of Connecticut.
Trump has said he is focused on securing US access to the country’s oil and economically rebuilding Venezuela.
Trump has on several occasions praised Rodriguez, Maduro’s second-in-command, who became Venezuela’s leader upon his capture. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said, “She’s been very good to deal with.”
Machado was banned from running in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with Maduro allies. Outside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, won by a substantial margin, but Maduro claimed victory and retained power.
While the current government has freed dozens of political prisoners in recent days, outside groups and advocates have said the scale of the releases has been exaggerated by Caracas.
In an annual address to lawmakers, Rodriguez called for diplomacy with the US and said that should she need to travel to Washington, she would do so “walking on her feet, not dragged there.”
She also said she would propose reforms to her country’s oil industry aimed at increasing access for foreign investors.</p><small>2026-01-16 05:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/160742402817b08.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967208/no-more-imports-of-personal-used-cars' target='_blank'><strong>No more imports of ‘personal’ used cars</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Ministry of Commerce has amended the Import Policy Order 2022, imposing a ban on the import of used cars under the “personal baggage scheme.”
The ministry on Wednesday issued an SRO 61(I)/2006, which said that used cars would be imported only under the “transfer of residence and gift schemes.”
Vehicles imported under the gift and transfer of residence schemes shall remain non-transferable for a period of one year from the date of importation, the SRO said.
Vehicles imported under the transfer of residence scheme shall be from the same country in which the overseas Pakistani resides. The time frame for importing the vehicles has also been extended to 850 days from the previous 700 days from the date on which the Goods Declaration for the last import under this order was filed.

Commerce ministry restricts import of second-hand vehicles to ‘gift’ and ‘transfer-of-residence’ schemes

The SRO further stated that minimum safety and environmental standards and regulatory measures, as applicable to the commercial importation of used vehicles, duly notified by the Ministry of Industries and Production or the Engineering Development Board (EDB), shall apply mutatis mutandis to vehicles imported under the gift and transfer of residence schemes.
Earlier in January, the Federal Cabinet ratified the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decision of December 9, 2025, allowing overseas Pakistanis to import used vehicles up to three years old under two schemes.
All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association (APMDA) Chairman H.M. Shahzad painted a gloomy picture of the arrival of used cars in 2026, following an influx of 40,000 used cars in FY25 and 18,000 units in 6MFY26 (first six months of FY26).
He said on Dec 9, 2025, the personal baggage scheme, which had long facilitated overseas Pakistanis, had been abolished, while the gift and transfer of residence schemes were further tightened with additional restrictions. The decision has created anxiety among overseas Pakistanis and stakeholders in the motor import business.
The government, he said, would lose millions of dollars in duties and taxes, as the import of 40,000 vehicles had contributed $500 million to the exchequer in FY25. The commercial import of vehicles has also been subjected to highly unreasonable terms, he added.
Mr Shahzad said that out of the total imports of used cars, the share of small cars (660cc) was 90 per cent, while 99pc of small cars were finding their way into Pakistan from Japan.
He said that previously, out of the total imports of used cars, 99 per cent arrived under the “personal baggage scheme.”
Regarding commercial imports of used cars, he said standard operating procedures are being formulated, but the government has already imposed a 40 per cent regulatory duty on used cars (under five years old) until June 30, 2026, on top of existing duties. He said the regulatory duty would be reduced by 10 per cent annually from FY27, reaching zero by FY30.
On Jan 12, Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers Chairman Usman Aslam Malik and Senior Vice Chairman Shehyar Qadir said that the government’s decision to regularise used car import schemes is a major step towards restoring their original intent for genuine overseas Pakistanis while safeguarding the country’s local automotive and auto parts industry.
