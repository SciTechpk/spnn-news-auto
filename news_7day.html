Trump, who has campaigned aggressively this year for a Nobel Peace Prize, was given FIFA’s inaugural peace prize for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world’s hotspots.
Amid TV cameras and flashbulbs from the international press, Trump dominated the scene at Washington’s Kennedy Center on Friday, placing himself squarely at the center of one of the biggest events in the sporting world.
The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will host the soccer tournament next year. The prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, and the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, were there, too, but it was all Trump’s show.
“This will be unique, this will be stellar, this will be spectacular,” Gianni Infantino, the gregarious president of FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, said at the opening of the ceremony, talking about next year’s games.
But he could have been talking about the Kennedy Center event itself, which was located in Washington at Trump’s urging.
Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli sang “Nessun Dorma,” a favorite of Trump’s and a staple at his campaign rallies, to launch the proceedings.
“Nobody ever thought a thing like this could happen,” Trump said before proceedings got under way, omitting the fact that the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994.
Last month, FIFA announced that a new annual award called the FIFA Peace Prize would be presented at the draw to “reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.”
A video prior to the presentation celebrated Trump for resolving the war in Gaza and trying to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. The trophy, a gold-plated globe carried by upraised hands, was considerably larger than the Nobel, which is just a simple medal.
But Trump got a medal as well and donned it as Infantino lauded him. The president deserved the award for “promoting peace and unity around the world,” Infantino said.
Trump called the award “an awfully nice tribute to you and the game of football, or as we call it, soccer.”
He took a moment to congratulate himself. America, he said, was “not doing too well” before he took office.
“Now, I have to say, we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said.
Trump received the award the same week his administration froze immigration applications from 19 countries after last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.
It also came days after the president demeaned Somali immigrants in the United States as “garbage” — sparking an outcry both at home and abroad.
Earlier, Trump told reporters he did not care about the prize, but noted that he had “settled eight wars” in his 10 months in office.
“I don’t need prizes. I need to save lives,” Trump said. “I saved millions and millions of lives, and that’s really what I want to do.”</p><small>2025-12-05 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05210136abe0357.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959369/fm-dar-slams-israeli-exit-only-restriction-on-rafah-crossing-as-clear-violation-of-gaza-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar slams Israeli exit-only restriction on Rafah crossing as ‘clear violation’ of Gaza peace plan</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday slammed Israel’s restriction on the Rafah border crossing to allow only the exit of Gaza residents, calling it a “clear violation” of the peace plan that finally brought an end to the fighting.
Israel announced on Wednesday it would unilaterally open the Rafah crossing to allow residents to flee the Gaza Strip, a move swiftly rejected by Egypt as Cairo insisted on lifting the blockade in both directions to relieve the besieged Palestinian territory.
Egypt refused to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians, insisting on adherence to the terms of the United States-brokered peace plan, which mandates full humanitarian access.
The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid.
The Foreign Office (FO) said FM Dar held a phone call with Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan today and discussed regional developments, particularly Gaza.
“FM strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring unfettered aid to Gaza and advancing coordinated efforts toward lasting peace,” the FO said.







FMs reject ‘any attempt to expel’ Palestinians in joint statement
The FO later published a joint statement with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Qatar expressing their concerns about the use of the Rafah crossing to expel Palestinians.
“The Ministers underscore their absolute rejection of any attempts to expel the Palestinian people from their land and stress the necessity of the full adherence to the plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, including its provisions on keeping the Rafah Crossing open in both directions, ensuring the freedom of movement for the population, and refraining from compelling any resident of the Gaza Strip to leave, rather to create the right conditions for them to stay on their land and participate in building their homeland, within a comprehensive vision aimed at restoring stability and improving their humanitarian conditions,” the statement read.
The FMs also underscored the need to fully sustain the ceasefire and ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip. They urged early recovery and reconstruction efforts and to create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip.







Negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday.
The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza.
For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye.
Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs, but no date has yet been set.
The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas.</p><small>2025-12-05 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05224254b9bb972.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959372/gloves-are-off-tarar-vows-strict-action-against-adiala-demonstrators' target='_blank'><strong>‘Gloves are off’: Tarar vows strict action against Adiala demonstrators</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Friday said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, will be dealt with harshly.
In a blistering press conference earlier today, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric.
Separately, PTI figures, in recent days, have staged demonstrations outside the prison. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time, while Imran’s sisters also staged sit-ins on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.
“If anyone tries to create a law and order situation outside the jail, they will be dealt with very harshly. The gloves are off,” Tarar emphasised.



He added that during her recent visit, Uzma violated jail rules and the law when she discussed politics with Imran, thus she would not be allowed any more meetings with the ex-premier.
“Meetings happen in accordance with the law and jail rules,” he said, adding that the jail superintendent reported this. “It is written in the jail manual that well-being and legal matters can be discussed, but not politics. She violated these rules, and she has been barred from meetings.”
The minister added that when Uzma emerged from the meeting, she said Imran “was angry and frustrated”.
“It means that he cannot find a way out of the punishment for the mega corruption £190 million case and sees no political future for himself,” Tarar said.
“We truly believe he is a mentally ill man,” he added.
When asked about the Inter-Services Public Relations director general’s press conference earlier today, Tarar said he endorsed every word on behalf of the civilian government and stated that Imran is a threat to the country.
“This person’s party prayed for the country to come to the brink of default and wrote to the IMF declining a bailout without thinking about the effect on citizens, the chaos, or the economy,” he said.
The information minister reiterated that on May 9, PTI supporters staged riots nationwide and destroyed state property, including monuments to martyred soldiers.
A day prior, the federal government ruled out any further meetings for Uzma and others who violated the prison code while meeting the PTI founder.
Addressing a press conference with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on the entire situation, the information minister announced: “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen.”
He added that reports of incitement against the state and its officials had surfaced. “Meetings are banned for anyone who violates the rules,” Attaullah said, adding that it was not right for people to hold meetings and then go on to peddle “Indian and Afghan stances and orchestrate posts against the army and the army chief”.</p><small>2025-12-05 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0522374047f136a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959371/ptis-barrister-gohar-appeals-for-reducing-tensions-after-disappointing-ispr-briefing' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Barrister Gohar appeals for reducing tensions after ‘disappointing’ ISPR briefing</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali appealed to pro-democratic forces to help reduce political tensions, expressing “disappointment” over a briefing by the military spokesperson targeting the party and former premier Imran Khan.
In a blistering press conference earlier today, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The majority of the DG ISPR’s 90-minute press conference focused on criticising Imran, the party and its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This is the time for everyone to acknowledge one another, make space for each other and eliminate the lack of trust. I appeal to all pro-democracy forces to play their role in reducing tensions,” said PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar in a post on X, reacting to the military spokesperson’s remarks.
Gohar said he had always held hope that tensions would ease and relations would improve, but expressed that he was “disappointed” by the press conference held by DG ISPR.
“The defence of the country is paramount. PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state. It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats. Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.”
He further urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions.
Barrister Gohar said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them.
“The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar concluded.







On a different note, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “A troubled response is not a political strategy.”







Meanwhile, Shahid Khattak, Imran’s nominee for the parliamentary leader in the National Assembly, said insulting remarks against KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi were an “insult to the entire Pakhtun nation and the tribal people”.







</p><small>2025-12-05 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0520094707b8e5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959367/pakistans-ogdcl-ramps-up-unconventional-gas-plans' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s OGDCL ramps up unconventional gas plans</strong></a><br><p>The state-run Oil & Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) is planning a major expansion of unconventional gas developments from early next year, aiming to boost production and reduce reliance on imported liquefied natural gas.
Pakistan has long been viewed as having potential in both tight and shale gas, which are trapped in rock and can only be released with specialised drilling, but commercial output has yet to be proved.
Managing Director Ahmed Lak told Reuters that OGDCL had tripled its tight-gas study area to 4,500 square kilometres after new seismic and reservoir analysis indicated larger potential. Phase two of a technical evaluation will finish by the end of January, followed by full development plans.
The renewed push comes after US President Donald Trump said Pakistan held “massive” oil reserves in July, a statement analysts said lacked credible geological evidence, but which prompted Islamabad to underscore that it is pursuing its own efforts to unlock unconventional resources.

“We started with 85 wells, but the footprint has expanded massively,” Lak said, adding that OGDCL’s next five-year plan would look “drastically different”.
Early results point to a “significant” resource across parts of Sindh and Balochistan, where multiple reservoirs show tight-gas characteristics, he said.
Shale pilot ramps up
OGDCL is also fast-tracking its shale programme, shifting from a single test well to a five-to-six-well plan in 2026-27, with expected flows of 34 million standard cubic feet per day (mmcfd) per well. If successful, the development could scale to hundreds or even more than 1,000 wells, Lak said.
He said shale alone could eventually add 600 mmcfd to 1 billion standard cubic feet per day of incremental supply, though partners would be needed if the pilot proves viable.
The company is open to partners “on a reciprocal basis”, potentially exchanging acreage abroad for participation in Pakistan, he said.
A 2015 US Energy Information Administration study estimated Pakistan had 9.1 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, the largest such resource outside China and the United States.
A 2022 assessment found parts of the Indus Basin geologically comparable to North American shale plays, though analysts say commercial viability still hinges on better geomechanical data, expanded fracking capacity and water availability.
OGDCL plans to begin drilling a deep-water offshore well in the Indus Basin in the fourth quarter of 2026, Lak said. In October, Turkey’s TPAO, with PPL and its consortium partners, including OGDCL, were awarded a block for offshore exploration.
A combination of weak gas demand, rising solar uptake and a rigid LNG import schedule has created a surplus of gas that forced OGDCL to curb output and pushed Pakistan to divert cargoes from Italy’s ENI and seek revised terms with Qatar.</p><small>2025-12-05 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05173525bce4448.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959349/india-withdraws-pilot-rest-policy-after-indigo-chaos' target='_blank'><strong>India withdraws pilot rest policy after IndiGo chaos</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation ministry on Friday rolled back a new policy of weekly rest for pilots after chaos caused by hundreds of flight cancellations by the country’s biggest airline, IndiGo.
In a bid to improve air travel safety, Indian authorities have introduced new stricter regulations limiting pilot flying times and placing tighter restrictions on their operation of night-time flights.
Airports across India have been in disarray since Monday, with the private carrier blaming the disruption on “unforeseen operational challenges”.
On Thursday, IndiGo admitted to aviation regulators that “misjudgement and planning gaps” in adapting to new rules led to the operational meltdown, even though it had two years to prepare for the switch.
The new rules came into effect last month with the aim of giving pilots more rest periods to enhance passenger safety.
India’s civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said the ‘Flight Duty Time Limitations’ rules “have been placed in abeyance with immediate effect”.
“Without compromising on air safety, this decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients, and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs,” Naidu said in a statement.
Naidu said his ministry expected that “flight schedules will begin to stabilise and return to normal by tomorrow”.







IndiGo, which cancelled all domestic flights Friday from New Delhi and Chennai, apologised for “the immense inconvenience and distress” caused to travellers.
In a video statement, the company’s CEO Pieter Elbers said late Friday the relaxation of the rules was “of great help” but there was “still lots of work in progress”.
Friday was the “most severely impacted day” with “well over a thousand” cancellations, Elbers said.
He added that the company expected cancellations to fall below 1,000 on Saturday ahead of a return to normal between December 10 and 15.







IndiGo, which commands 60 per cent of India’s domestic market, operates over 2,000 flights a day.
The carrier admitted it failed to plan properly ahead of a November 1 deadline for the measures’ introduction. And with air travel now approaching its December peak, that has forced widespread flight cancellations this week, which have stranded thousands of travellers.
“These last few days, we have [had] a serious operational crisis,” it said in a statement. “While this will not get resolved overnight, we assure you we will do everything in our capacity to help you in the meantime.”







Following a request by IndiGo, India’s civil aviation authorities granted it a temporary exemption from some of the new rules on Friday to help it deal with the crisis.
IndiGo had earlier flagged that it did not expect to fully restore operations until February 10, though on Friday it said there should be “progressive improvement” from Saturday.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.
Hundreds of flights cancelled, passengers vent anger
On Friday, Delhi airport announced all IndiGo departures were cancelled for the day, a number that a source put at 235 flights. Chennai airport also announced all departing IndiGo flights were cancelled.
The airline cancelled 165 flights in Mumbai, 102 in Bengaluru, 92 in Hyderabad, airport sources, who declined to be named, said. Other major metro airports saw IndiGo flights up to 6pm (5:30pm PKT) cancelled on Friday.

At many airports across the country, crowds of stranded passengers voiced their frustrations, aggressively arguing with staff.
Social media platforms and local media were flooded with videos of angry travellers.
“Down with IndiGo! Down with IndiGo!” a group of passengers at Bengaluru airport shouted in protest, a video post on X showed.
Another video showed a father shouting at IndiGo crew members, demanding a sanitary pad for his daughter.







A post on X from earlier Friday morning showed dozens of young children sitting inside a Delhi airport terminal.
“Kids waiting since 4am for their IndiGo (flight) … hungry, tired, sleepy,” read the post’s caption.
IndiGo receives exemptions from new pilot duty rules
Shares of IndiGo dropped nearly 3pc on Friday, taking their weekly slump to 10.3%. India’s main opposition party has demanded a discussion on the issue in parliament.
The new pilot duty rules mandate that pilots can only make two night-time landings per week, down from six previously.
That provision was put on hold for IndiGo until February 10 by India’s civil aviation regulator. The airline was also temporarily exempted from a rule specifying maximum flight duty periods for pilots doing some night flying.
IndiGo said it will offer waivers on all cancellations and booking changes for travel between December 5 and December 15. The airline has also arranged ground transportation and thousands of hotel rooms for stranded customers, it said.</p><small>2025-12-05 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0519472037fcf55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959366/turkish-delegations-visit-delayed-due-to-talibans-lack-of-cooperation-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Turkish delegation’s visit delayed due to Taliban’s lack of cooperation: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday that the continued absence of a top Turkish delegation meant to mediate tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to a lack of cooperation from the Taliban regime.
Turkiye, one of the mediators alongside Qatar, recently hosted multiple rounds of talks between Islamabad and Kabul following an escalation of tensions between the two neighbours over the past weeks.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had earlier signalled plans to send a delegation to Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. The Turkiye-Qatar effort had produced a fragile ceasefire, though the FO spokesperson said the truce had faltered because it was “contingent on a halt in terrorist activities”.
Questioned in his weekly press briefing about the lack of a visit thus far from the Turkish delegation, the FO spokesperson responded: “Pakistan was open, and stands ready. And I believe that the delegation has not arrived because of scheduling issues, and perhaps by a lack of cooperation from the Taliban. This, you have to ask the Taliban regime. So, our position on this remains firm.”
The spokesperson maintained that Pakistan had welcomed the announcement made by President Erdogan about the mediation effort and reiterated the government’s readiness to receive the Turkish delegation and hold negotiations and discussions.
The spokesperson said he was not aware of any schedule for its arrival.
He further stressed: “During last week’s briefing, I was asked that Pakistan and the Taliban regime were not cooperating with this mediation framework initiated by Turkiye and Qatar. Let me emphasise that it is not attributable to Pakistan’s cooperation that the Turkish delegation has not arrived yet.”







Saudi Arabia is also engaged in a separate peacemaking initiative and intends to stay engaged with another round of talks possible in the near future. Pakistan and Afghanistan held a brief but high-stakes round of unannounced talks in Riyadh on Sunday, but the engagement ended swiftly and without progress, as both sides stuck rigidly to their positions, multiple diplomatic sources had told Dawn.
However, the FO spokesperson said he did not know anything about the Saudi talks when pressed for details in today’s briefing.
“Our position on this mediation, as I have expressed it in the last few press briefings and today, is that we, in principle, welcome the mediations. We believe that our position on terrorism from Afghanistan is on moral principles strongly rooted in national and international legality. So, any objective mediation would naturally favour Pakistan.”
“As regards any country offering its mediation, we will react if we receive any request for official proposal for a mechanism of mediation process.”
The spokesperson also elaborated on the government clearing humanitarian cons­i­g­n­ments for Afghan­istan, marking the first controlled reopening of transit trade since routine trade was suspended in October, saying it was done at the United Nations’ request.
“Consistent with our own commitment to humanitarian access and the requests made by UN agencies, the government has officially approved the movement of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan which will take place in three phases: in the first phase, the containers with food items will be allowed; in the second phase, containers carrying pharmaceutical products and medical equipment will be granted access; and in the final phase, containers transporting other essential goods related to education and health will be allowed.”
He said the FO did not intend to categorise the three phases for any purpose other than to ensure the process would be seamless and to determine how humanitarian aid would flow into Afghanistan.
The spokesperson said there were meetings between the FO and the commerce ministry, with the former directed to expedite the procedural formalities.
He said the utilisation of border crossings for the resumption of trade and overall movement would remain closed.
“This decision to allow UN aid was taken in line with our obligation to humanitarian access, and, secondly, Pakistan does not have anything against the people of Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan are our brothers and sisters. We intend them no harm.”
“While the closure of borders, has a specific context and the rationale behind it still stands. On the issue of aid to the Afghan people, we remain positive and engaged. On the issue of border closure, we would see how far the Afghan Taliban regime in Kabul supports our position to stop the flow of terrorism and terrorist elements from their soil into Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-12-05 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051917311ee3589.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959364/pakistan-will-definitely-launch-sovereign-stablecoin-crypto-czar-says' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will ‘definitely launch’ sovereign stablecoin, crypto czar says</strong></a><br><p>Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib announced that Pakistan is set to launch its first “stablecoin” as part of its drive to make virtual assets a part of the economy.
The PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes.
A stablecoin, according to Bloomberg, is a digital token whose value is intrinsically linked to a physical currency, such as the US dollar, making it more stable than other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.­
Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, the crypto czar said that Pakistan will “definitely launch” a stablecoin, adding that the country is working on both that and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).
“I think it is a great way to collateralise the government debt,” Saqib said. “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening. Why should we be at the tail-end of it when we have the muscle and the adoption?”







The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) said that Saqib also participated in a panel discussion on the future of virtual assets and emerging-market regulation, according to a post on their X account.
“He emphasised that for countries like Pakistan, clear and innovation-friendly crypto regulation is a key driver of economic growth,” the post read. “Pakistan’s work on stablecoins, data frameworks, and banking the unbanked can become valuable case studies for the world.”







Earlier this year, Saqib unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.
In May, the government announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p><small>2025-12-05 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051641541f2e805.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959328/who-do-you-think-you-are-dg-ispr-lashes-out-at-imran-khans-anti-army-rhetoric' target='_blank'><strong>‘Who do you think you are?’: DG ISPR lashes out at Imran Khan’s ‘anti-army rhetoric’</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
At the beginning of his press conference in Rawalpindi, he talked about a “creeping national security threat” that had become necessary for the military to address.
“That threat emanates from a delusional mindset of a delusional person who has become captive to his own ego, thinking that his wishes are bigger than those of the state of Pakistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, in an apparent reference to incarcerated PTI founder, Imran Khan.
“His ego, his wishes, and frustrations have grown to such an extent that he thinks that the world would cease to exist without him.”
The DG ISPR added that it would be “a bit strange to see it coming from me, but the narrative that person is pushing is no more about politics now but has become a matter of national security.”
According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was “very important” for the military’s media wing to clarify, remove all ambiguities and doubts, and say what needs to be said. “We need to understand how this narrative is working, and unfortunately, how it is working in deep collusion with external actors.”



He continued: “To understand that, first, I will set the stage by repeating something that the armed forces have been saying again and again, that we are the armed forces of Pakistan, we don’t represent any ethnicity, don’t represent any language, religious inclination, political thought or school of thought. We have people from all areas of Pakistan, all religions, all sects, all languages, and all political views, but we put all that aside once we wear this uniform.
“That is our pride, that is our honour; we strive, we die daily not for some language, area or political viewpoint. We strive and die on a daily basis for the people of Pakistan, for the integrity of Pakistan. And that we say very clearly, and we also don’t come from the elite class of Pakistan, we belong to the middle, lower-middle, and the poor socio-economic classes; we do not carry the flag of any political actor, class or elitism; This is your armed forces, and we are absolutely clear about the character of the armed forces of Pakistan, starting from a soldier all the way up to his field marshal,” he said.The DG ISPR added that if someone attacked the armed forces and its leadership for the sake of their ego, delusional mindset and narcissistic way of thinking, “then we will also come and fight bare-knuckle, there should be no doubt about that,” he said.“That is why we request again and again, you must be doing your politics. We respect all political parties and personalities, but please keep your politics away from the armed forces of Pakistan; don’t drag us into it. We don’t want to be part of your politics. That is why we need to communicate a few things clearly.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry then pointed out ways in which Imran’s rhetoric was harming the armed forces.
“First, no one can be allowed to create fissures between the people and the armed forces of Pakistan. Why? Because this is the only armed force that you have. You don’t have a choice; this country doesn’t have any other armed forces. You can have an opinion or observation about the forces, and if that could be a constructive observation or criticism, you are most welcome to do that. But that doesn’t allow you to instigate or provoke the people of Pakistan against the army and try to create a gap between the two.”
He said that it was the armed forces that were standing between the Hindutva mindset in India and their hegemonic design, and the people of Pakistan.
“It is these armed forces that are standing between the khawarij, terrorists, fitna al-khawarij, fitna al-Hindustan operating from Afghanistan and the people, and we also know for a fact that every country has an army. It is a famous saying that there will always be an army in a country, but if it is not yours, it will be your enemy’s. So, the one who attacks their own army and its leadership, is he trying to create space for someone else’s army? What is his design? Why is he trying to do that?
“We are clear, and the people of Pakistan are clear that this cannot happen, because they understand, we understand, that you can fool some of the people all the time,” he said.
Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said that whenever someone meets “this person”, he keeps aside the law, Constitution and rules and plays the narrative against the state of Pakistan, especially the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership.
“Tell me, under which law, rules and Constitution can this be allowed? Which politics in Pakistan allows you to go and meet a convict, and a narrative is continuously built from there against their own country’s armed forces? Which constitutional provision allows this?” Lt Gen Chaudhry questioned, referring to PTI’s demand to allow them to meet Imran at Adiala Jail, where he’s been imprisoned since 2023.
“You talk about Article 17 of the Constitution and freedom of expression, it clearly says that freedom of expression and political activity are permitted, subject to reasonable restrictions. Under reasonable restrictions, nothing can be allowed that will be against the security and integrity of the state.
“Article 19 says freedom of expression is allowed, it absolutely is, but such freedom of expression cannot be allowed that goes against the security, integrity and defence of Pakistan. Is it written [in the Constitution] or not? So, under which law, constitution, or rules, when you meet a convict, he spins a narrative against the army and its leadership? This is beyond our understanding.”
Citing some examples, the DG ISPR recalled how Imran had been “spinning this narrative by trying to stop remittances to Pakistan so that the country defaults.”
“He then writes a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking it not to enter into any agreement with the country so that the state could default. He then resorts to civil disobedience, doesn’t pay electricity bills, so that anarchy is spread in the country. Let me give you another example from a few days ago: He (Imran) tells his followers to target the leadership of the army — the army which stood against an economy and an armed forces eight times bigger than it during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-i-Haq. And doing so, they gained respect for the nation.”
He then questioned who would actually benefit from such a narrative, adding that anyone living in Pakistan could not have such an agenda against the country.
“That agenda can only come from someone in Delhi. Someone sitting there and guiding that — who wishes that this army, which is your armour against kharjis and terrorists, sacrificing their lives — stops doing it. This agenda and narrative cannot come from elsewhere,” he said.
It is also worth mentioning that while he did not mention Imran’s name throughout the presser, he showed a video clip containing Imran’s anti-army tweets to prove his point.
Pointing out to certain social media accounts, the DG ISPR asked, “From where are these accounts run? No one knows. And when the party [PTI] is asked about where the accounts are run from, they say they don’t know it either, but they completely own the narrative that is being spread through these accounts.”
Calling Imran a “mental patient”, the DG ISPR recalled how a tweet was posted on Imran’s X account two days ago, which went viral within minutes.
“A lot of unnamed, troll accounts are involved in making the post viral. These accounts are being operated from outside Pakistan. They carry forward this narrative, but they originate from this mental patient’s post”.
He said that the Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral.
“The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public.”
The head of the military’s media wing added that Afghan social media, being “facilitators of the khawarij”, was also involved in spreading Imran’s anti-army rhetoric.
“Why wouldn’t they do it? Because someone here is saying things about the Pakistan army and its leadership, then why will they not do it? They all operate simultaneously, and then the international media picks up such news, too. It is a collusion because they have the same purpose and the same enemy, i.e. the Pakistan Army and its leadership.”
Referring to Imran’s harsh comments against PTI members who attended a function at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad and terming them as traitors, the DG ISPR said: “By that logic, he is also saying that anyone in the ISPR and army is also a traitor, because they too went to NDU, he believes anyone who even is linked [to the army] is a traitor.”
Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said: “I will again repeat that you can fool some of the people all the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”
He said the time had come “for an end” to the PTI’s “political trickery”.
The military spokesperson also slammed the persistent speculation over the issue of the notification for the chief of defence forces and questioned the “obsession” with the army.
He questioned why the PTI continued to talk about the army instead of the governance of its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its performance against terrorism.
“Please grow up. Talk about real issues.”
The military spokesperson also criticised the PTI for its policy and stance on the issues of terrorism, Afghanistan and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“Tell me, can the state’s security be sublet? Is appeasement a security policy?”
The DG ISPR quipped that if Kabul or New Delhi would be the ones to ensure Pakistan’s security.
“The world knows that security is only granted by standing tall against the evil, the aggressor, there is no other way … had appeasement granted security, Libya and Gaza wouldn’t be in the situation that they are in today.
“We know that without this state, we neither have any identity, nor any worth, nor any politics, that is why we are ready to sacrifice our lives every day, because we are absolutely clear
“Similarly, we are also clear that anyone’s person and politics cannot be above the state for us.”
The DG ISPR also wondered why the PTI and its founder called for talks with terrorists.
“Firstly, he is a mental patient. Apart from that, there are two more reasons. One, there is a terror crime nexus … there is political patronage and terrorists provide them with protection. The terrorists act against law enforcers, FC personnel, security forces and anyone who stands against them. There is a huge economic interest and there is a political reason also … the only story that comes out of KP is security … there is a narrative of the army being behind terrorism so that no one questions them about governance in the province where they have been in power for the past 12-13 years.”
He said even more could be found if one looked for them.
“It is clear to us that what is happening, why it is happening and why it is being carried out. We need to tell that this business of lies and deception will not continue anymore in Pakistan. This cannot be allowed.”
DG Chaudhry said that if anyone thought their person and politics were bigger than the country’s security, they would be wrong to do so.
“The Pakistan Army is standing and will keep on standing. We are not going anywhere. We have taken an oath for the protection of this state.”
The military spokesperson also criticised the KP chief minister and said no one talked about the province’s governance from the PTI but kept focusing on the army.
“If the barking dog barks, don’t pay attention to it.”
Questioned about a ban on the PTI, the military spokesperson said: “The state is above the army. It is all wise. It is their decision. What they do and why they do. You need to ask them. … We are not politicians … the state has much more vision and clarity.”
The DG ISPR was also asked about the imposition of governor’s rule in KP and said it had nothing to do with the army, adding that the government had to decide on the matter.
He said it was for the government, Parliament and all stakeholders to decide the future course of the province.
Headquarters of chief of defence forces
The DG ISPR congratulated the nation on the chief of defence forces (CDF) headquarters beginning its work today, stating that it was one of the most important steps towards providing the requisite synergy and jointness for military operations in the country.
“This was debated a lot in the media, and we understand that the character of warfare has changed — now there are multidomain operations taking place. It’s no more just land, sea and air; it’s in space, it’s in cyberspace, it is the informational domain, it’s intelligence-based, and war is fought in multiple domains,” he told reporters.
“The wars have become violent, short and intense, so to get efficiency, efficacy and economy of effort in that, the CDF headquarters was a long-awaited essential requirement, and it’s not only in Pakistan, but there are more than a dozen countries, almost more than 70 countries, where synergetic headquarters of the chief of defence are available,” he said.
The chief of the military’s media wing added that the CDF headquarters had been established on the directives and orders of the parliament; therefore, it was a “monumental and great day for the national security of Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-12-05 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05185420618d4d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959360/crackdown-against-passengers-using-fake-documents-to-intensify' target='_blank'><strong>Crackdown against passengers using fake documents to intensify</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Friday decided to intensify its crackdown against passengers attempting to travel abroad using fake documents.
Recently, several incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown on migrant smuggling following last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
The interior minister subsequently declared that anyone attempting to travel on incomplete or bogus documents would be stopped under all circumstances.
In a special meeting held in Islamabad under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, it was decided to make the protector issuance system foolproof with reforms to be introduced in the immigration system to facilitate passengers.
The federal ministers sought final recommendations within seven days.
‎An effective crackdown was ordered against those involved in the business of fake visas and agent mafias. Naqvi said an AI-based pilot application would be launched in Islamabad from January to curb illegal immigration, enabling authorities to determine in advance who was eligible to travel and who was not.
The interior minister said that deported individuals would not be reissued visas after their passports were cancelled, adding that there would be zero tolerance for fake visas and agent mafias.
“We are in contact with other countries to improve the ranking of the green passport. People going abroad through illegal means damage the country’s reputation. Immigration reforms aim to facilitate the public and improve our global standing,” he added.
Naqvi also said that the National Police Bureau would issue a standardised international driving licence.
Meanwhile, Hussain stated that a fully transparent protector system was the need of the hour, since it was essential for individuals travelling on labour visas to possess authentic documents.
He said the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis would extend full cooperation to the Ministry of Interior in improving the protector and immigration systems.
‎The meeting’s participants also reviewed measures regarding action against illegal migrants and individuals with incomplete documentation. E-driving licences, protector stamps and immigration matters were discussed in detail.</p><small>2025-12-05 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051339148f2f464.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959331/putin-and-modi-discuss-trade-peace-and-uninterrupted-oil-shipments-in-new-delhi-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Putin and Modi discuss trade, peace and ‘uninterrupted’ oil shipments in New Delhi summit</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi began summit talks in New Delhi on Friday, as New Delhi rolled out the red carpet for the Russian leader and Modi told him India supported peace efforts in Ukraine.
Putin is on his first visit to India in four years, aiming to boost trade with the top buyer of Russia’s arms and seaborne oil as Western sanctions squeeze their decades-old ties.
The visit comes at a time when New Delhi is engaged in talks with the US for a trade deal to cut punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on its goods over India’s Russian oil purchases.



Moscow has been India’s top arms supplier for decades and has said that it wants to import more Indian goods in an effort to grow trade to $100 billion by 2030, which so far has been skewed in its favour due to New Delhi’s energy imports.
Since European countries cut their reliance on Russian energy after Russia invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago, India ramped up its purchases of discounted Russian crude, only to reduce them under pressure from US tariffs and sanctions this year.
Putin proposes ‘uninterrupted’ oil supply
Putin said he was ready to continue “uninterrupted shipments” of fuel to India, as New Delhi faces heavy US pressure to stop buying oil from Moscow.
Trump imposed punishing 50 per cent tariffs on most Indian products in August, citing New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil; revenue, Washington argues, helps fund the war in Ukraine.
Modi thanked the Russian leader for his “unwavering commitment towards India”.
“Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything that is required for the development of India’s energy,” Putin told Modi after talks.
“We are ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy,” he added, according to an official translator.
Modi said that “energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership”, and while he referenced nuclear power, he made no specific reference to oil.
India emerged as a major buyer of Russian oil after the start of the Ukraine war, providing Moscow with a crucial export market as Europe sharply reduced purchases.
In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36pc of India’s total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day. New Delhi recently reduced Russian crude imports under pressure.
Efforts to end Ukraine conflict
“India is not neutral. India has a position, and that position is for peace,” Modi told Putin as they opened their talks. “We support every effort for peace, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every initiative taken for peace.”
Putin, in response, thanked Modi for his attention and efforts aimed at resolving the conflict.
“We had the opportunity — and you gave me that opportunity — to speak in detail about what is happening on the Ukrainian track and about the steps we are taking jointly with some other partners, including the United States, toward a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis,” Putin said.
“As our countries and economies grow, the opportunities for cooperation expand,” Putin said. “New areas are emerging — high technologies, joint work in aviation, space, and artificial intelligence.
We have a very trusting relationship in the field of military-technical cooperation, and we intend to move forward in all these areas.”
21-gun salute welcome
Putin landed in Delhi on Thursday to a warm welcome from Modi, who greeted him with an embrace on the tarmac of the airport. The two men then travelled together in the same vehicle for a private dinner hosted by Modi.
On Friday, Putin was given a ceremonial welcome on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, the colonial-era presidential palace, with a 21-gun salute as his convoy drove in.
The two sides are expected to announce a raft of deals at the end of formal talks.
Indian firms are expected to sign an agreement with Uralchem group, Russia’s top potash and ammonium nitrate producer, to jointly set up a urea plant in Russia, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Russian lenders Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) and Alfa Bank have also sought approval to begin operating in India to help Moscow boost its trade with India, Reuters reported.
Putin Challenges Washington
Modi and Putin are also expected to discuss topics including labour and civil nuclear energy.
A large business and government delegation has accompanied Putin for the visit, including Defence Minister Andrei Belousov who held talks with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh on Thursday.
Belousov stated that “the Russian defence industry is ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in the field of defence production,” India’s defence ministry said after the talks.
In an interview with broadcaster India Today that was aired late on Thursday, Putin challenged US pressure on India not to buy Russian fuel when the US could purchase Russian nuclear fuel.
“If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn’t India have the same privilege? This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President Trump,” Putin said.
He also said that while there was a minor dip in India-Russia trade during the first nine months of this year, energy trade was “running smoothly”.
India has said Trump’s tariffs are unjustified and unreasonable and pointed at ongoing US trade with Moscow. The US and European Union continue to import billions of dollars’ worth of Russian energy and commodities, ranging from liquefied natural gas to enriched uranium.
‘India’s Conundrum’
Putin arrived in India a day after holding talks with Trump’s top envoys on a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, but they did not reach a compromise.
India has resisted condemning Russia over the war and called for peace through dialogue and diplomacy, while saying that its ties with Moscow were being unfairly targeted by Western nations that it said continued to do business with Moscow when it was in their interest.
“India faces a conundrum; by taking steps to strengthen ties with Moscow or Washington, New Delhi risks setting back ties with the other,” Michael Kugelman, senior fellow at Washington’s Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week.</p><small>2025-12-05 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05172556d43694b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959348/controversial-social-media-posts-case-imaan-mazari-hadi-chatha-submit-list-of-defence-witnesses' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial social media posts case: Imaan Mazari, Hadi Chatha submit list of defence witnesses</strong></a><br><p>Lawyer Imaan Mazari and her spouse, Hadi Ali Chatha, on Friday handed over their list of defence witnesses as proceedings resumed in the controversial tweets case before Additional Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka in the District and Sessions Courts, Islamabad.
At the start of the hearing, Chatha filed a fresh application requesting the court to allow both accused to record their statements under Section 342 of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CRPC) and to present witnesses in their defence. The court issued a notice to the prosecution on the application and briefly adjourned the hearing until 10am.
When proceedings resumed, Chatha argued the application himself, stating that the 342 statement submitted by the state counsel was not theirs and had been filed without the accused being informed.
He maintained that during cross-examination, the state counsel was given a questionnaire of 33 questions, which was later used to prepare a 342 reply that the defence does not accept.
Chatha also informed the court that a no-confidence application had been filed against state counsel Taimur Janjua and insisted that the accused must be allowed to submit their own statement.
He also read out the names of proposed defence witnesses, which include Ahmed Noorani’s mother, journalist Mudassar Naru’s mother, Sardar Akhtar Mengal, poet Ahmed Farhad, journalist Arifa Noor and others. Chatha added that the witnesses could appear physically or online, subject to the court’s approval.
Representatives of the bar, including District Bar President Naeem Gujjar, Raja Aleem Abbasi, and Riasat Ali Azad, supported Chatha’s plea, arguing that the right to a fair trial required the court to record the accused’s personal statements under Section 342.
They maintained that no case could proceed without ensuring that the accused were fully aware of the contents submitted on their behalf.
The prosecution began its arguments after the defence submissions, disputing the claim that no forensic examination had been conducted and asserting that the matter had already been examined. The prosecution also cited Supreme Court precedents to support its position.
During the proceedings, the state counsel submitted written closing arguments.
Judge Majoka briefly exited the courtroom, prompting slogans from some lawyers before he returned.
After arguments on various applications and the prosecution’s main submissions, the court adjourned the hearing until Monday, December 8.</p><small>2025-12-05 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051542585c7c9ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959337/minister-assures-across-the-board-accountability-for-incidents-of-citizens-falling-into-manholes' target='_blank'><strong>Minister assures across the board accountability for incidents of citizens falling into manholes</strong></a><br><p>All government departments would be held responsible and held accountable if any citizen fell in a manhole, said Minister of Local Government and Housing Town Planning Nasir Hussain Shah while speaking to the media in Sukkur.
The body of the boy, who drowned in an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident occurred.
The child’s tragic death, particularly the lack of cooperation from relevant civic agencies to launch an immediate search, had angered relatives and area residents, who staged a protest on University Road on Sunday night and again during the day on Monday.
“All government departments, including KMC, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, as well as the administration, including police, deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners of relevant areas, would be responsible, if such kind of incidents happen again,” the minister said, adding that no excuses from officials would be entertained.
Hussain maintained that the orders were applicable across Sindh.
Referring to the unfortunate incident, the minister said, “Such an unfortunate incident can happen to anyone.”
Addressing the issue, he said the government was making efforts to “over manholes”, but they were being “removed” as shown in multiple “videos circulating on social media”.
On Tuesday, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
A post by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on X on Wednesday night said the mayor visited the boy’s family and extended his condolences.
“An impartial inquiry will be conducted, and anyone found negligent will face action. We will take structured measures to prevent such incidents in the future,” the post quoted the mayor as saying.
A district court issued notices to the Karachi mayor, managing director of the KWSC, the Gulshan Town chairman, and the Red Line contractor on an application seeking the registration of a case against them over their alleged negligence in the tragic death.
The applicant submitted that the incident demonstrated blatant failure of local authorities and emergency services.
He also argued that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people had lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes.</p><small>2025-12-05 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051334258012140.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959329/india-weighs-greater-phone-location-surveillance-apple-google-and-samsung-protest' target='_blank'><strong>India weighs greater phone-location surveillance; Apple, Google and Samsung protest</strong></a><br><p>India’s government is reviewing a telecom industry proposal to force smartphone firms to enable satellite location tracking that is always activated for better surveillance, a move opposed by Apple, Google and Samsung due to privacy concerns, according to documents, emails and five sources.
A fierce privacy debate erupted in India this week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government was forced to rescind an order requiring smartphone makers to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all devices after activists and politicians raised concerns about potential snooping.
For years, the Modi administration has been concerned that its agencies do not get precise locations when legal requests are made to telecom firms during investigations. Under the current system, the firms are limited to using cellular tower data that can only provide an estimated area location, which can be off by several meters.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents Reliance’s Jio and Bharti Airtel, has proposed that precise user locations should only be provided if the government orders smartphone makers to activate A-GPS technology — which uses satellite signals and cellular data — according to a June internal federal IT ministry email.
That would require location services to always be activated in smartphones, with no option for users to disable them. Apple, Samsung and Alphabet’s Google have told New Delhi that it should not be mandated, said three of the sources who have direct knowledge of the deliberations.
A measure to track device-level location has no precedent anywhere else in the world, lobbying group India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which represents both Apple and Google, wrote in a confidential July letter to the government, which was viewed by Reuters.
“The A-GPS network service is not deployed or supported for location surveillance,” said the letter, which added that the measure “would be a regulatory overreach”.
Dedicated surveillance device
India’s home ministry had scheduled a meeting of top smartphone industry executives to discuss the matter on Friday, but it was postponed, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. On Thursday, Reuters sent questions related to this topic to the ministry.
India’s IT and home ministries, which are both analysing the telecom industry’s proposal, did not respond to Reuters queries.
Apple, Samsung, Google, Reliance and Airtel did not respond to requests for comment. Lobby groups ICEA and COAI also did not respond.
At this point, no policy decision has been made by the IT or home ministries.
Taking advantage of A-GPS technology — which is typically only turned on when certain apps are running or when emergency calls are being made — could provide authorities with location data precise enough that a user can be tracked to within about a meter, according to technology experts.
“This proposal would see phones operate as a dedicated surveillance device,” said Junade Ali, a digital forensics expert associated with Britain’s Institution of Engineering and Technology.
Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at the United States-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, said he had not heard of any such proposal elsewhere, calling it “pretty horrifying”.
Governments worldwide routinely seek new ways to better track cellphone users’ movements or data. Russia has mandated the installation of a state-backed communications app on all mobile phones in the country.
Telcos vs smartphone firms
India is the world’s second-biggest mobile market with 735 million smartphones as of mid-2025, where Google’s Android powers more than 95 per cent of the devices, with the rest using Apple’s iOS, Counterpoint Research says.
Apple and Google’s lobby group, the ICEA, argued in their July letter that there are significant “legal, privacy and national security concerns” with the proposal from the telecom group.
It warned their user base would include people from the military, judges, corporate executives and journalists, adding that proposed location tracking risked their security given that they hold sensitive information.
Even the old way of location tracking is becoming problematic, the telecom group said, as smartphone makers show a pop-up message to users, alerting them that their “carrier is trying to access your location”.
“A target can easily ascertain that he is being tracked by security agencies,” said the telecom group, urging the government to order phone makers to disable the pop-up features.
Privacy concerns should take priority and India should also not consider disabling the pop-ups, Apple and Google’s group argued in its July letter to the government.</p><small>2025-12-05 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05141231374f87d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959333/cloudflare-says-dashboard-outage-issue-is-fixed' target='_blank'><strong>Cloudflare says dashboard outage issue is fixed</strong></a><br><p>Cloudflare, a content delivery network (CDN) and domain name server (DNS) service, said on Friday it had fixed an issue with its dashboard related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
The outage had sent shares down 4.5 per cent in premarket trading.
In updates posted on its status page, the company said it was investigating issues with Cloudflare Dashboard and related APIs.
Minutes later, it said a fix had been implemented and it was monitoring the results. On 9:20 UTC, it said the incident had been resolved.
Detailing the incident, Cloudflare said: “A change made to how Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall parses requests caused Cloudflare’s network to be unavailable for several minutes this morning.”
The company clarified that “this was not an attack; the change was deployed by our team to help mitigate the industry-wide vulnerability disclosed this week in React Server Components.”
Canva, an online graphic design tool, in a post on X, initially informed its users that the issues were impacting its services.
“Our CDN, Cloudflare, is experiencing an outage that’s impacting Canva,” it said, adding that it was working with the company to get things back up and running. The post was later deleted.
Once the fix was implemented, Canva said its platform was functional again.







Meanwhile, users of social media platform X also complained about their inability to access several websites.
Cloudflare runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks.
Last month, Cloudflare experienced a global outage that affected access to web services worldwide.

The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “In exercise of the powers conferred under Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act, the president on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years.”
A separate notification issued by the ministry also notified Zardari’s approval of the prime minister’s advice regarding the leadership of the air force.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 243 of the Consitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 10B of the Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953, the president on the advice of the prime minister is pleased to extend the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar (NI) M, as chief of the air staff for a tenure of two years with effect from March 19, 2026,” a separate notification said.
The extension will take effect upon completion of his current five-year term in Mar­­ch next year, keeping him in office until March 2028.
The army chief has been named the first CDF in the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
PM Shehbaz, in a post on X, again congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his “historic” appointment.
“As the sentinel of our nation’s security, his leadership has been pivotal in guiding our brave armed forces to a decisive victory in the battle for truth,” he said.
“The people of Pakistan will always remember his bold and courageous leadership in wartime, that unified the armed forces, galvanised the entire nation and secured a historic victory for our homeland,” he said.







He also congratulated the air chief marshal. “Under his exemplary command, the Pakistan Air Force destroyed seven enemy aircraft and sophisticated missile defence systems with unmatched professionalism and reinforced Pakistan’s air superiority,” he said in an apparent reference to the May conflict with India.
“All national institutions stand united for the defence, development, and prosperity of Pakistan,” he said, adding that “together we will make our country’s defence truly invincible”.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also congratulated Field Marshal Munir and ACM Babar.
Those who gave the nation a “historic win”, the nation was today honouring them in admission of their “endless service”, Asif posted on X.







‘Pakistan’s defence has strengthened’
Today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened after the army chief’s appointment as the CDF.
He expressed these views while speaking to the media, during which he also appeared to be referring to speculation surrounding the notification for appointment to the CDF post.
“They had brewed a storm in a teacup,” he said, adding, “Those who were spreading rumours on social media and electronic media should feel ashamed in front of the nation today.”
He said Pakistan’s defence had now strengthened, and “the enemy will now be worried that Pakistan has established a unified command for all forces by making structural changes”.







Five-year tenure reset
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.
Delay in notification
The prolonged delay in issuing the notification had triggered intense speculation, especially after the post of CJCSC was abolished on Nov 27 when Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza retired.
The absence of a notification on Nov 29, the date when Field Marshal Munir’s original three-year term as army chief (prior to last year’s amendment) ended, fuelled further uncertainty about whether the government was holding back the appointment to negotiate upcoming four-star postings.
Political circles suggested the delay may have been used to bargain over the selection of the new Commander National Strategic Command (CNSC), the Vice Chief of the Army Staff (VCOAS) and potentially a future ISI chief.
The army had already clarified that no VCOAS was being appointed. Under the amended law, the appointments of the CNSC and any VCOAS are tied to the CDF’s recommendations.
Government officials repeatedly denied any tensions with the military, maintaining that procedural requirements and the prime minister’s travel itinerary dictated the timeline. None­t­heless, the silence was widely viewed as unusual, especially after the speed with which the 27th Amendment was rushed through parliament.
The amendment also empowers the federal government to define the CDF’s functions, including multi-domain integration, restructuring and enhancing jointness across services.
New organogram
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said on Thursday the defence ministry was finalising a new organogram for the CDF and had shared a draft with the Prime Minister’s Office a day earlier.
He dispelled the impression of differences over a CDF notification, stressing that it was delayed since the premier was out of the country.
Officials say the organogram will lay out the command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly established strategic command.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0514145725637c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959334/choosing-na-opposition-leader-prerogative-of-parliamentarians-not-speakers-naveed-qamar' target='_blank'><strong>Choosing NA opposition leader prerogative of parliamentarians, not speaker’s: Naveed Qamar</strong></a><br><p>Member of the National Assembly Naveed Qamar said on Thursday that the speaker of the house did not have the right to decide who would be the leader of the opposition, as it was the prerogative of the parliamentarians.
After receiving approval from the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI in October formally nominated Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas to lead the opposition in the NA and Senate, respectively. However, the government has not yet formally recognised the nominations, with NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq terming the matter “sub judice”.
In an interview with Nadir Guramani on the Dawn News TV programme Doosra Rukh on Thursday evening, Qamar said that it was not the authority of the speaker to decide not to act upon the nomination.
“At one time it was definitely the entitlement of the speaker,” he said, referring to 2002, when Maulana Fazlur Rehman was made the opposition leader instead of the PPP’s Amin Fahim, even though the PPP had a greater representation in the house, “which was manifestly not politically correct”.
“After that, we changed the Rules of Procedure,” he said, adding that under the new rules, “whoever votes against during the election of the leader of the house becomes the opposition bloc.”
In this opposition bloc, Qamar added, whoever had the most members submits the nomination and “that person will be made the leader of the opposition”.
“So, this is not the discretion of the speaker,” he said. “Whoever has the majority among (opposition) members — it is in their hands, and whoever they decide on, that person should be the opposition leader.”
The nominations of Achakzai and Abbas came after the Election Commission of Pakistan in August disqualified PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan as the NA opposition leader and Shibli Faraz from the same role in the Senate, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in May 9 cases.
Ex-premier Imran had in October voi­ced concern over the government’s continued delay in officially recognising his party’s nominees.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051346000a0d4bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959330/hrcp-condemns-police-action-against-aurat-march-activists-in-karachi-urges-authorities-to-respect-peoples-access-to-civic-spaces' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP condemns police action against Aurat March activists in Karachi, urges authorities to respect people’s access to civic spaces</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Friday condemned police action against Aurat March activists in Karachi a day earlier, calling on authorities to respect people’s access to civic spaces.
On Thursday, a rights activist was ‘briefly detained’ from outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC), ahead of a press conference by Aurat March over the alleged abduction of two Baloch girls.
The organisers said classical dancer and human rights activist Sheema Kermani was also manhandled by police, while other women participants were also “mistreated” by female officers on their way to the press club. Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim was also barred from attending the press conference, which was eventually held at the KPC.
In a post on social media platform X today, the HRCP said it condemned the police obstruction of Aurat March’s scheduled press conference and the brief detention and manhandling of activists and reporters, including Kermani.
“We are also alarmed that journalist Ebrahim was barred from entering the press club. The HRCP urges the authorities to respect all people’s access to civic spaces and investigate the alleged police misconduct,” the commission said.







While the authorities refused to give any official account of yesterday’s incident, a police officer who wished not to be named, said that “extreme vigilance and heightened security measures” had been put in place in the Red Zone, particularly around the KPC, because of security concerns.
The officer said there was a “terrorist threat” and that security had therefore been tightened. The officer denied the arrest of any woman activist.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051114556b8b411.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959304/pm-shehbaz-calls-malaysian-counterpart-offers-all-possible-assistance-for-flood-hit-country' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls Malaysian counterpart, offers ‘all possible’ assistance for flood-hit country</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone call with his Malaysian counterpart, Anwar Ibrahim, on Friday, expressing solidarity and offering “all possible” assistance to the southeast Asian country in the aftermath of recent cyclone-induced floods, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
Monsoon rains paired with two tropical storm systems dumped record deluges across Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand, and northern Malaysia last week. The death toll from the floods and landslides in all affected areas has surpassed 1,000.
Today, PM Shehbaz, “on behalf of the people and government of Pakistan, extended heartfelt condolences to the Malaysian prime minister over the precious loss of lives and damage to property due to rains, flooding, and massive landslides triggered by the recent storm,” a post on PTV News’ X account said.







PM Shehbaz expressed his condolences over the loss of lives and prayed for the swift recovery of citizens who had been injured or displaced, the state broadcaster reported.
He also expressed solidarity with the Malaysian people, and offered “all possible assistance” from Pakistan in Malaysia’s ongoing relief and rescue operations.
According to PTV News, he assured his Malaysian counterpart that Pakistan “will provide to the Malaysian government whatever assistance it may require in the relief operations”.
The PTV News report said that Malaysian PM Ibrahim thanked PM Shehbaz, saying that “sentiments of sympathy and concern” expressed by him, as well as him reaching out at this difficult time, were a “manifestation of the close brotherly relations between Pakistan and Malaysia”.
Pakistan has also provided assistance to Sri Lanka in the wake of ravages caused by Cyclone Ditwah, which has killed over 450 people there. On Wednesday, Pakistan sent an urban search and rescue team to the flood-hit country by air for assistance in relief efforts.</p><small>2025-12-05 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0512591492f8145.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959327/us-slashes-work-permit-validity-period-for-foreign-nationals-including-refugees-and-asylum-seekers' target='_blank'><strong>US slashes work permit validity period for foreign nationals, including refugees and asylum seekers</strong></a><br><p>The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Thursday announced changes that sharply reduced the maximum validity period for employment authorisation documents (EADs) for several categories of foreign nationals, citing security concerns and legislation signed earlier this year.
The move, the latest in a sweeping immigration crackdown by the administration of US President Donald Trump, took place just two days after it halted immigration applications for citizens from 19 nations.
Under the new rules, the maximum validity period for initial and renewal EADs has been shortened from five years to 18 months for categories including refugees, asylum seekers, those granted withholding of deportation or removal, and applicants with pending adjustment-of-status or relief applications.
Additional categories, including those paroled as refugees, granted temporary protected status (TPS) or under entrepreneur parole, will see the validity of their work permit reduced to one year or the end date of their authorised parole or TPS period, whichever is shorter.
These changes apply to applications pending or filed on or after Dec 5, 2025, or Jul 22, 2025, depending on the category.
“The reduced maximum validity periods will result in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for authorisation to work in the US,” the agency said.
The agency added that after the attack on National Guard service members in Washington earlier this month, “it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens”.
USCIS Director Joseph Edlow linked the change directly to safety concerns.
“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorisation will ensure that those seeking to work in the US do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” he said.
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday the US plans to expand the number of countries covered by its travel ban to more than 30.
After a meeting with Trump on Monday, she said she recommended a full travel ban on “every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”
All asylum cases on hold
Earlier this week, the Trump administration has imposed the most sweeping internal freeze on immigration benefits in decades, ordering USCIS to halt all asylum adjudications and suspend a wide range of applications from nationals of 19 “high-risk” countries, while reopening thousands of previously approved cases for fresh security screening.
The directive, issued to USCIS field offices, followed a series of violent incidents involving Afghan nationals admitted under earlier programmes. Those cases prompted the White House to conclude that vetting procedures between 2021 and 2024 were “dangerously insufficient”, triggering a system-wide overhaul of immigration screening.
The USCIS memorandum directed officers to place an immediate hold on all asylum applications, regardless of nationality. This included applicants from countries rarely associated with security concerns. Immigration attorneys said they were not aware of any previous instance in which asylum adjudications were frozen across the board.
The order also suspended all immigration benefit applications filed by nationals of the 19 restricted countries. These included green card petitions, replacement green cards, travel documents, parole extensions and applications to preserve continuous residence for naturalisation. Even routine services — such as replacing a lost green card — were paused.
USCIS officers were also instructed to reopen and re-examine all approved immigration benefits granted to nationals of the listed countries who entered the US on or after Jan 20, 2021. Mandatory interviews — with no possibility of a waiver — would be required in many cases, and cases may be referred to law enforcement if concerns arose during the review.

The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered the case against Akbar in July this year over allegedly defamatory and controversial remarks shared on his social media account.
According to the court order, issued by Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah, the decision was taken after Akbar failed to appear before the court despite multiple summons.
The order also directed the authorities concerned to issue an arrest warrant for Akbar to ensure his production before the court. The order noted that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation and remained absent during the legal proceedings.
A challan in the case has already been submitted to the court.
With the proclamation order now in place, law enforcement authorities are expected to intensify efforts to apprehend the former aide on accountability as the trial moves forward.
Interior minister hands extradition requests to UK envoy
The development comes a day after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott and he handed over the extradition papers for Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja.
“The extradition papers for Akbar and Raja from the government of Pakistan were handed over [to Marriott],” a statement issued by the interior ministry said.
“Both individuals are wanted in Pakistan. They should be handed over to Pakistan immediately,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He also provided evidence against Pakistani citizens who were spreading propaganda, the statement said.
“I fully believe in freedom of expression, but fake news is a problem for every country,” he said, as per the statement.
“No country can allow slander and defamation against state institutions from those sitting abroad,” the minister said. Naqvi also said that Pakistan would welcome British cooperation for the return of those who “spread anti-Pakistan propaganda”.
While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.</p><small>2025-12-05 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05095108050e06e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959289/us-plans-to-expand-travel-ban-to-more-than-30-countries-says-homeland-security-secretary' target='_blank'><strong>US plans to expand travel ban to more than 30 countries, says Homeland Security secretary</strong></a><br><p>The US plans to expand the number of countries covered by its travel ban to more than 30, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday.
Noem, in an interview on Fox News’ ‘The Ingraham Angle’, was asked to confirm whether the administration of US President Donald Trump would be increasing the number of countries on the travel ban list to 32.
“I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” she said.
Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats. The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.
Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list.
“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem said.
Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.
An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.
Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement program under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting.
Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”
Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic president Joe Biden and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries.
Since returning to the office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border.
His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now, it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.</p><small>2025-12-05 05:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0507565895b3652.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959232/centre-seeks-rs65tr-revenue-hike-at-11th-nfc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Centre seeks Rs6.5tr revenue hike at 11th NFC meeting</strong></a><br><p>• Invites legal opinion on whether provinces are bound by federal expenditure priorities• Seven working groups to be formed; second meeting to be held between January 8 and 15
ISLAMABAD: Building the case on overburdening and rising debt servicing costs post-2010, the federal government on Thursday proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than five per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC), which also sought legal opinion on whether provinces are bound by federal expenditure priorities.
The Centre urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 3 to 3.5 percentage points from around 10pc at present in three years and asked the provinces to enhance their share of revenues to 3pc of GDP — through taxes on property, agriculture income and sales tax on services — from the existing 0.28pc.
It argued that the measure was necessary to stabilise the rising fiscal deficit, which had gone up from close to 4pc to over 6.6pc now after the fiscal imbalance created since 2010 under the 7th NFC award, resulting in massive deterioration of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
The meeting, held over an official lunch in a “very good atmosphere”, was chaired by Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb and was attended by the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (both holding the finance minister portfolio), finance ministers of Punjab and Balochistan, four provincial non-statutory NFC members, KP chief minister’s adviser Muzammil Aslam, and federal and provincial finance secretaries.







Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
The participants decided with consensus to form seven different thematic working groups and call a second meeting of the NFC between Jan 8 and 15, depending on the reports of working groups before Jan 8.
These groups would deliberate on horizontal and vertical distribution of resources, how the provinces should advance taxation policies based on the latest experiences, impacts of debt servicing, poverty and so on.
A special working group was also agreed upon on the request of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as to the fiscal and social impact of the merger of tribal districts and how to move forward with adequate resources.

 

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the meeting was held in a very good environment and all stakeholders — the Centre and the provinces — explained their fiscal positions.
“It was agreed to form six to seven working groups. They will continue their consultations to take the process forward before the next NFC meeting,” he said, adding that a joint statement would be issued by the federal finance ministry.
Mr Aslam, the KP chief minister’s adviser on finance, said the beauty of the inaugural meeting was that the Centre acknowledged the issues facing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s merged districts (formerly Fata), and the larger provinces — Sindh and Punjab — supported KP’s cause in this regard.
He said the Sindh chief minister raised the issue of questions and discussions in certain quarters on provincial expenditures.
Mr Shah reminded that under Article 160 of the Constitution, the NFC was a forum of only revenue sharing and the provinces were not bound to follow “federal dictations” on the expenditure side, meaning that provinces were autonomous in setting their spending priorities. Their item-wise expenditure details are publicly available through respective budget documents and official websites.
Federal Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal reportedly suggested that a legal opinion might be required from the Attorney General of Pakistan for interpreting the constitutional provision and whether the provincial and federal spending priorities are in national alignment, and if a reduction or an increase in shares means absolute numbers or a percentage of the pie.
Centre’s fiscal challenges
The Centre put on the table its fiscal challenges following the 7th NFC award in 2010 and its continuation for more than 15 years, putting a squeeze on the country’s defence and development expenditure that compromised infrastructure development and social standards, as a major part of the resources went into interest payments. This financially weakened the Centre and, as a result, the provinces as well.
This could only be addressed with the best revenue efforts, both by the Centre and the provinces. All participants agreed that a strong federation could transform strong federating units and vice versa.
Earlier, Finance Minister Aurangzeb recalled the constitutional importance and collaborative spirit of the NFC process and noted the inaugural gathering reflected a shared resolve to fulfil a vital constitutional responsibility. He promised Centre’s commitment to transparent and sincere dialogue, ready to listen to the provinces and work collectively in the national interest, an official statement said.
He also commended the provinces for their cooperation in signing the National Fiscal Pact and in achieving mandatory fiscal surpluses to support Pakistan’s compliance with IMF requirements.
KP CM thanks Centre
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was quoted as expressing gratitude to the federal government for holding the NFC meeting. “A strong federation and strong provinces will guarantee a strong and united Pakistan,” he said.







He highlighted the sacrifices of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made in the ‘war on terror’, which he said had resurfaced again.
Mr Afridi hoped the NFC would “address the ultra vires of the 7th NFC since June 2018 and include the population and other variables of the newly merged districts in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and update the share of the province to give them due representation”.
Punjab’s Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman also emphasised the need for consensus but stressed that “consensus-building will take a lot of effort on everyone’s part”, according to the statement.
Balochistan’s Finance Minister Shoaib Nosherwani said the province would continue the path of cooperation and consensus and mentioned his province’s efforts in strengthening the federation through projects like Sui Gas, Saindak and Reko Diq.
After the meeting, KP Chief Minister Afridi told reporters that it was held in a cordial atmosphere and a decision was taken to form sub-committees for different issues, including the merged districts’ share.
“I raised the issue and said that it was unconstitutional to deprive KP of its due share. It was decided that the next meeting will be held in January,” he said.
When asked why the PTI government did not address the issue of provincial share when it was in power, he said it was because his party’s government, which came to power in 2018, was toppled in 2022.

The effort is led by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Greg Casar, and includes signatures from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, two Muslim members of the House known for their advocacy on Palestinian and other Muslim issues.
In the letter, made public on Wednesday, the lawmakers called for targeted measures, including visa bans and asset freezes on officials responsible for threatening US citizens and residents who criticise Pakistan’s military establishment, as well as their family members in Pakistan.
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, or the embassy in Washington.

More than 40 lawmakers write to Marco Rubio, ask for sanctions against officials involved in ‘transnational repression’

The letter emphasises the need for Washington to act against those who “weaponise state power to jail political opponents, intimidate citizens abroad, and crush democratic freedoms”, said First Pakistan Global, a rights group sympathetic to the PTI, which distributed the letter.
“In recent years, US citizens and residents who have spoken out against authoritarian abuses in Pakistan have faced threats, intimidation, and harassment — often extending to their families in Pakistan. These tactics include arbitrary detentions, coercion, and retaliatory violence, targeting diaspora individuals and their relatives,” the letter stated.
The lawmakers warned that Pakistan was experiencing a deepening authoritarian crisis: opposition leaders have been detained without charge, journalists intimidated or forced into exile, and ordinary citizens arrested for social media activity. Women, religious minorities, and ethnic communities — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate repression, they claimed.
“This authoritarian system in Pakistan is sustained through relentless repression. Opposition leaders are held without charge, denied fair trial, and kept in indefinite pretrial detention. Independent journalists are harassed, abducted, or forced into exile. Ordinary citizens are arrested for social media posts, while women, religious minorities, and marginalised ethnic groups — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate violence and surveillance,” the letter read.
The lawmakers cited specific cases, including that of Virginia-based investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, whose brothers were allegedly abducted and held for over a month after his reporting on military corruption.
They also raised concerns about the 2024 elections, noting irregularities documented by independent observation reports.
The US State Department had previously expressed concern over these irregularities and called for a full investigation.
The letter urged the US administration to impose measures such as Global Magnitsky sanctions, visa bans, and asset freezes against officials credibly perpetrating systematic and transnational repression.
It also called for the release of former prime minister Imran Khan and other political prisoners. “Such steps would reinforce US commitment to human rights, protect American citizens from transnational repression, and promote regional stability,” the lawmakers wrote.
To strengthen congressional oversight, the lawmakers submitted five detailed questions to the State Department regarding sanctions, conditions for targeted measures, and steps to protect US residents from threats directed at their families abroad. The lawmakers have requested a response from Secretary Rubio by Dec 17, 2025.
Earlier this year, more than 50 lawmakers submitted another resolution in the House, named the “Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act”. It sought legal sanctions against those responsible for “undermining democracy in Pakistan”.
That resolution, HR 5271, is in queue for voting at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

A constitution is an avenue. It is often located in a federal capital. It goes from left to right and north to south. You can drive over it with ease anytime you want. It is protected on either side by footpaths that are regularly trod upon by citizenry who cannot afford motorised means of transport. It is surrounded by enormous buildings of legislation, justice and diplomacy.
“It is only important for those individuals who have nothing to do. For men of action and consequence, it is nothing more than a hindrance. It hinders them and, in turn, they hinder it right back, because men of action do not take crap from anyone or anything.

“Ipso facto, a constitution is a document of great import. However, should the judiciary deem it otherwise, it can also assume the shape of an obstreperous obstacle, which must be placed within such constraints as found necessary by their lordships, commanders of the judicial galaxy and masters of all they survey.
“As a document, it is merely a set of rules and regulations that have been agreed upon by a group of beautifully fragranced individuals. These laws do not necessarily apply to this group, unless said laws are in a position to benefit said individuals. The regulations laid therein also have no impact upon the state of non-humans and inanimate objects within the republic.
“However, like a well-oiled corporate entity, every country must bear the burden of a constitution, if it is to exist in today’s modern world. This has become necessary due to the world being run mostly by socialist feminist transgenders, placed in positions of power and prestige by the deep state, in order to wreak havoc over the world that has been so painstakingly created by wealthy but powerless, strong but weak, unaccountable but selfless, affluent, heterosexual men, who have been blessed with all the knowledge that is contained in — to quote the late, great Peter Cook — “the universe and all that surrounds it.”
“As a member of the Supremes, I am given the opportunity to interpret the constitution any which way I wish. I am also blessed with the ability to uphold my judicial principles at my convenience and pass judgements, wind and water, as and when I desire.
“Ergo, it is something that plays an important part in my life, despite trying my best not to let it. But it gives me a pension. And free post-retirement travel. And pays for my utilities. And security. And a staff member or two. And also, I get to keep the gown even when I am no longer part of the Supremes. So, there is that.”
— Legal Eagle and Member of the Supremes Justice Ifti 2.0, addressing members at the Supreme Court Bar Association
 “What is a constitution, you ask? I swear upon it and at it. It is nothing but a piece of paper, which I can tear and throw in the dustbin if I so desire. I like its malleability, as it can be easily suspended, amended and even held in abeyance at a distance if it smells foul (which it often does). It is an impediment to efficient ruling, but does have the ability to make one immune. And that is not such a bad thing in times like these, where all kinds of strange, democratic viruses are rife.”
— Brig (forcibly retd) Babar ‘Bobby’ Niazi, in the recently released documentary Dinner With An Autocratic Babydoll
“A constitution is a waste of time. It has things in it which make no sense. I am told it can be changed. But then, why put something in it that would have to be changed later? This kind of thinking never happens in the corporate world. Evil people use it to run their evil system. That is why leaders like me are sent by the gods to take down the system from within.
“I will do whatever it is in my power to do whatever it is in my power. This is what being a billionaire means. It also means that any document that provides rights to those who don’t deserve them (ie non-billionaires) must be shamed, ridiculed, mocked, made redundant and, subsequently, officially destroyed. It is the least I can do for my followers.”

“Men are not robots and robots need no constitution, just programming. When it works for me, then fine, I say, keep it. But when it stops working, throw it away like a bottle top before they catch you!”
