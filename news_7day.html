“We are going to be taking away Harvard’s tax-exempt status. It’s what they deserve,” Trump wrote on social media.
The tax-exempt designation allows nonprofits such as universities to avoid federal income taxes and enables donors to claim tax deductions.
 


The statement comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and elite universities over issues including admissions, hiring practices, curriculum oversight and responses to pro-Palestine campus protests.
Trump earlier threatened to revoke the university’s tax-exempt status, adding: “Tax-exempt status is totally contingent on acting in the public interest!”
The Trump administration has already cut more than $2 billion in federal grants to Harvard and has taken similar steps against other elite institutions, including freezing Columbia University’s federal funding and launching investigations into dozens of universities.
Last week, Harvard University sued the Trump administration over the cut.</p><small>2025-05-02 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02212908737f16e.jpg?r=212921' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907975/govt-insists-programme-on-track-amid-reports-of-india-asking-imf-to-review-pakistan-loan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt insists programme on track amid reports of India asking IMF to review Pakistan loan</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Shehzad on Friday said the country’s International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was “completely on track”, noting a smooth review process despite reports that India had raised concerns with the lenders over Pakistan’s loans and sought a review.
Relations between the two neighbouring countries turned hostile following an April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
In the aftermath of the attack, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, and the two countries closed their airspace to each other’s airlines.
Pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3bn climate resilience loan in March.
The IMF Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new arrangement, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing bailout programme, the global lender said earlier this week.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Shehzad said that the programme was “completely on track” and the review was “done well”.
He said that they conducted “very productive meetings” with the IMF, World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other International Financial Institutions.
“While in the spring meetings in DC, we did about 70 meetings within (a) span of six days,” he said, adding that interest was very high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turned around and raters gave a positive outlook while upgrading the ratings as well.
Separately, India raised concerns with the IMF on its loans to Pakistan, asking for a review, a government source told Reuters without elaborating.
The IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
The programme is critical to the $350bn economy and Pakistan said it has stabilised under the bailout that helped it stave off a default threat.
The soaring tensions between the two countries have drawn global attention and calls for cooling tempers.
US Vice President JD Vance said yesterday that Washington hoped Pakistan would cooperate with India to hunt down the assailants.
“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance had said.</p><small>2025-05-02 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02191532e4638e5.jpg?r=203908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pahalgam tensions: Army leadership warns of decisive response against any Indian attempt to impose war</strong></a><br><p>The army’s top brass on Friday warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war, as relations deteriorated between Islamabad and New Delhi amid rising tensions after last week’s attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir warned a day ago that “any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response.”
A press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief presided over a special session of the Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today in which the military brass conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing geo-strategic environment, with particular emphasis on the current Pakistan-India standoff and the broader regional security calculus.
“While reaffirming Pakistan’s abiding commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity, the forum made clear that any attempt to impose war will be responded to, surely and decisively and aspirations of people of Pakistan shall be respected at all costs,” the ISPR said.
“The forum reaffirmed the unflinching resolve of the Pakistan Armed Forces to uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country against any aggression or misadventure,” it added.
The ISPR said the army’s top brass reiterated that Pakistan’s path to peace and development would not be deterred by terrorism, coercion or aggression — whether directly or through proxies.
“Deliberate destabilisation efforts by the Indian government will be confronted and defeated with resolve and clarity,” the statement said.
The ISPR said COAS Munir lauded the military’s “unwavering professionalism, steadfast morale and operational preparedness”, saying that it stood in unity with the nation to defend the homeland at all costs.
The army chief also highlighted the critical importance of “heightened vigilance and proactive readiness” across all fronts amid the situation.
 
 

The statement said the CCC participants expressed grave concern over the “intensification of Indian atrocities” in occupied Kashmir in the attack’s aftermath, as well as the continued targeting of innocent civilians along the Line of Control by Indian occupation forces.
They reiterated that such “inhumane and unprovoked acts” served only to escalate regional tensions and would be met with a “resolute and proportionate response”.
“The forum noted, with serious concern, India’s consistent pattern of exploitation of crises to achieve political and military objectives. They have been following a predictable template — whereby internal governance failures are externalised. These incidents have often coincided with unilateral moves by India to alter the status quo, as seen in 2019 when India similarly exploited the Pulwama incident to unilaterally alter the status quo of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, through revocation of Article 370.
“In the latest instance, the Pahalgam episode appears to be part of a deliberate strategy to divert Pakistan’s focus away from the western front, as well as ongoing national efforts for economic revival; the two fronts where Pakistan is decisively and sustainably gaining grounds. Such diversionary tactics aimed at providing operational breathing space to Indian terror proxies will never succeed.
“In the same vein, the forum expressed serious concern that India is now exploiting the Pahalgam incident to undermine the longstanding Indus Waters Treaty, seeking to usurp Pakistan’s legitimate and inalienable water rights. This constitutes a dangerous attempt to weaponise water, threatening the livelihood and sustenance of over 240 million Pakistanis and escalating strategic instability in South Asia,” the ISPR said.
 
 

It added that the CCC members also “voiced deep alarm over credible evidence of direct Indian military and intelligence involvement in orchestrating terrorist activities” inside Pakistan.
The ISPR said these state-sponsored actions were in blatant violation of international norms and were universally unacceptable.
The statement said the meeting concluded with the COAS expressing “complete confidence in the operational readiness, deterrence posture and morale of all formations and strategic forces to defend the nation across the entire threat spectrum”.
Morale is high thanks to our army chief: Khawaja Asif
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said morale was high among the armed forces and the public under COAS Munir’s command,
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister lauded the army chief for his “high resolve” following today’s corps commander meeting, calling his command “befitting”.
“Over the past five days, the way he (the army chief) has met troops in the various cantonments, the LoC and the working boundary has contributed to high morale among the armed forces and the people,” Asif said. “God willing, the situation will be just like the communique after the corps commander meeting.”
The defence minister reiterated that India’s allegations held no credibility and that Indians were turning against Modi’s narrative.
“After the attack, they filed an FIR and levelled allegations, raising a hue and cry,” Asif said. “Reports are emerging that there were preparations for the attack and that allegations would be made against Pakistan.
“Till now, there is not a shred of evidence,” he added. “They carried this out for their political gains. Otherwise, there is no credibility.”
 
 

The defence minister highlighted that “no country in the world” believed India’s version of events or supported them following the incident.
“Nobody is believing their story, even his (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s) people and media are not standing behind it,” Asif said, noting: “He’s a desperate man, you can expect anything from him, but this is a major defeat against the narrative he has tried to create.”
Asked about an interview with a former indian intelligence chief, Asif said he saw the interview and noted that his diction indicated Modi’s credibility.
“If you base your politics on lies on such a heightened pitch … then you will ultimately fall flat on your face, and they have,” Asif said.
In response to a question about the potential suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and weaponisation of water, Asif said Pakistan would pursue legal action against India’s suspension of the treaty.
“They can’t deny us our rights [under the treaty],” Asif said. “Based on what I know of geography, the Chenab and Jhelum flow from Kashmir. Its location does not allow for them to be diverted.
“Architecturally, practically, this is not possible,” the defence minister said. “This is an established treaty … violating it is not easy.”
Asked if any diversions of waterways counted as an act of war, Asif said, “Absolutely. If they construct any structure to divert water, then we have the right to strike it; it is an act of war.
“For the time being, we are approaching all fora — including the IWT — and pursuing action.”</p><small>2025-05-02 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/021920101eab40e.jpg?r=192138' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907988/pm-shehbaz-urges-saudi-arabia-gulf-allies-to-help-ease-tensions-in-region' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz urges Saudi Arabia, Gulf allies to help ease tensions in region</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday urged Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies to impress upon India to de-escalate and defuse tensions in South Asia in the wake of plummeting ties between the two countries following last week’s militant attack in occupied Kashmir, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults on civilians in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
As tensions continue to simmer in light of the attack, Pakistan on Thursday had engaged a host of friendly nations, including China, to seek their support for de-escalation measures between the nuclear states and to take them into confidence regarding the ‘weaponisation’ of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.
A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz continued his engagements with other countries over the current political climate in the region.
“He urged brotherly countries, including Saudi Arabia, to put pressure on India to reduce tensions in the region. He reiterated Pakistan’s desire for peace and stability in South Asia,” the PMO statement said of his meeting with Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Maliki.
The premier made a similar request in a separate meeting with Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi. PM Shehbaz also met Ambassador of the State of Kuwait Nasser Abdulrahman Jasser.
While sharing Pakistan’s stance with the ambassadors on the recent situation in South Asia following the Pahalgam incident, the prime minister said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
“It had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts over the years. This was done not only to protect Pakistan but the entire world,” the prime minister said.
 
 

He outrightly rejected “baseless Indian accusations” linking Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident without any evidence and reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral international investigation into the incident.
Emphasising the government’s complete focus on consolidating the hard-earned economic gains of the past 15 months, the prime minister said it was “inconceivable for Pakistan to act irresponsibly to jeopardise its achievements and derail the country from the path of economic progress” or take such an action that could imperil regional peace and security.
The prime minister thanked the Saudi leadership and people for always standing in solidarity with Pakistan through thick and thin.
The Saudi ambassador thanked the prime minister for sharing his views on this important issue and said that Saudi Arabia wanted to work with Pakistan for peace and security in the region.
During the meeting with the UAE ambassador, the prime minister thanked the UAE for its unwavering support to Pakistan, saying it “bore testament to the historic, deep-rooted, fraternal ties between the two countries”.
The UAE ambassador thanked PM Shehbaz for sharing Pakistan’s position and said that the UAE would work closely with Pakistan to maintain regional peace and security.
PM Shehbaz shared that Pakistan was reaching out to other friendly countries to present its position on the current crisis.
During the meeting with the Kuwait ambassador, the prime minister noted the strong, historic, brotherly relations between Kuwait and Pakistan.
The premier said that he looked forward to the visit of Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah at the earliest possible time.
The Kuwaiti ambassador thanked PM Shehbaz for sharing Pakistan’s position and affirmed that Kuwait shared Pakistan’s vision for regional peace and security.
PM Shehbaz had contacted Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong a day ago regarding the situation.
 
 

The Gulf states — traditionally viewed as friendly toward India due to strong economic ties and the presence of a large Indian diaspora — have chosen a measured, noncommittal approach amid the tensions. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have all issued statements emphasising de-escalation and peaceful resolution.
These responses were less about backing India’s position and more about protecting their own strategic interests.
Meanwhile, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also continued his engagements and held a telephonic conversation with Panama FM Javier Eduardo Martinze-Acha Vasquez.
Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including India’s “inflammatory propaganda and its illegal unilateral actions against Pakistan”, including holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty in a clear violation of international law, according to a Foreign Office press release.
FM Vasquez emphasised that both sides should exercise restraint.
Being non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to international peace and security.
Dar also held a similar talk with Denmark FM Lars Løkke Rasmussen, briefing him on the evolving regional situation and the measures taken by the National Security Committee in response to India’s actions.
He strongly rejected India’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, saying it was a clear violation of treaty provisions and international law.
Dar underscored Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and national interests, while contributing to regional peace and security.
Expressing concern over the escalation, FM Rasmussen emphasised the importance of both sides exercising restraint.
“The two leaders agreed to maintain close contact on regional and global developments, particularly at the UNSC, as non-permanent members.
“They also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation, especially in areas of economy and investment, as well as promoting high-level exchanges,” the FO said.</p><small>2025-05-02 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02194729f041957.jpg?r=195546' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907990/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-postponed-to-may-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Grand Theft Auto VI release postponed to May 2026</strong></a><br><p>The creative team behind the popular Grand Theft Auto videogame series postponed the launch of the latest instalment by several months to May 2026, hitting shares of parent Take-Two Interactive.
Grand Theft Auto VI was originally due to be released later this year, with a trailer having shown that it would be set in a Miami-like Vice City and would feature a playable female protagonist for the first time.
 


“We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,” publisher Rockstar Games said in a statement.
“With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,” it said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”
Its predecessor, GTA V, was released in 2013 and sold more than 200 million copies.
Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of Take-Two, supported the move in a statement released by the parent company.
“While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,” Zelnick said.
The first trailer for GTA VI appeared in December 2023 and has been seen more than 250m times on Rockstar’s YouTube channel.
Set to the Tom Petty song “Love Is A Long Road,” it opens with a female character named Lucia being released from prison in what appears to be a fictionalised version of Florida.
Near the close of the one-minute-and-30-second clip, she tells her male partner in crime: “The only way we are going to get through this is by sticking together, being a team.”
The pair go on to burst into a store with pistols drawn and bandanas covering the lower halves of their faces.
Fans saw the scene as confirmation that rumours of a “Bonnie and Clyde” type crime couple are coming true.
Along with its wild success, the GTA series has faced criticism over its violent content.
Critics have from the beginning accused Grand Theft Auto of glorifying violence and encouraging players to engage in criminal behaviour — allegations rejected by New York-based Take-Two Interactive.
GTA players sell drugs, fight, rob, go on car rampages and more. Gameplay options also included assaulting sex workers and going to strip clubs, raising the ire of activists.</p><small>2025-05-02 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0213375804eee48.jpg?r=190959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907962/3-dead-8-injured-as-bus-overturns-in-karachis-gulshan-i-hadeed' target='_blank'><strong>3 dead, 8 injured as bus overturns in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed</strong></a><br><p>Three people were killed and eight others were injured when a bus overturned in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed on Friday morning, rescue officials said.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Traffic Police Pir Mohammed Shah said, “At 6:30am, a fatal road traffic accident occurred on Link Road Kathore towards the National Highway near Samandari Baba.”
He said a passenger bus bearing registration number LES-1244, while travelling along the route, veered off the roadway and overturned.
According to preliminary findings, the driver of the bus had fallen asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to drift off the road and subsequently overturn.
“The incident occurred without direct interaction with any other vehicle at the time of the crash,” DIG said.
The accident tragically resulted in the death of three individuals, who have been identified as 59-year-old Abdul Ghafoor, 25-year-old Ghulam Fareed, and 35-year-old Kausar Saeed.
The body of the deceased was moved to the Jinnah Hospital Karachi via Chhipa Ambulance Service.
Furthermore, approximately 15 to 20 passengers sustained injuries, DIG Shah said.
He added that KRAAT’s (Karachi Road Accident Analysis Team) preliminary investigation indicated that the primary cause of the accident was driver fatigue, leading to the driver falling asleep at the wheel.
Consequently, he said, the bus veered off the road and overturned, adding that recklessness and negligence, in the form of driving without adequate rest, directly contributed to this fatal crash.
In pursuance of the continued efforts of the provincial government to control the menace of accidents in Karachi, the city administration on Thursday extended the complete ban imposed on heavy vehicles in the city during daytime for another two months.
A total of nine dumpers and water tankers were set on fire by angry mobs last month near the main road leading to 4-K Chowrangi after a heavy vehicle hit a bike rider, injuring him in the North Karachi area.
An elderly man was killed in April after being run over by a water tanker, police and rescue officials said.
On Tuesday, an employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.</p><small>2025-05-02 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02183159352257a.jpg?r=183323' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907986/uk-comedian-russell-brand-appears-in-court-on-rape-charges' target='_blank'><strong>UK comedian Russell Brand appears in court on rape charges</strong></a><br><p>British comedian and actor Russell Brand appeared in a London court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences.
Brand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month.
He faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault.
Arriving for the first court hearing in the case, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside the court.
The celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear in court again on May 30.
In a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself.
“I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video.
 






The charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women.
Prosecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023.
London’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information”, to contact officers.
Millions of online fans
Brand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London.
He has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster.
The court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire.
Born in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager.
He burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online.
He has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8m on Instagram.
He presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008 but left after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.
He also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies.
Brand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012.
He is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children.</p><small>2025-05-02 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/021511174883fcc.jpg?r=180344' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907970/core-inflation-slows-down-to-03pc-in-april' target='_blank'><strong>Core inflation slows down to 0.3pc in April</strong></a><br><p>Core inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decelerated further to 0.3 per cent during April as compared to 0.7pc recorded during March, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Friday.

Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said a relatively tight monetary and fiscal policy over the past year has led to a “sharp decline in inflation”.
“A comfortable current account balance, a stable currency, and softer commodity prices have also contributed to the disinflation trend,” Farooq said.
He said that as long as Pakistan remained under the programme with the International Monetary Fund, the government was expected to maintain fiscal discipline and avoid overspending, supporting continued price stability.
“While interest rates are expected to decline, the pace of easing is likely to be gradual, with the central bank expected to remain cautious, prioritising reserve accumulation,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-02 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02132042537abe9.jpg?r=132241' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907957/shares-at-psx-rebound-as-investor-confidence-returns' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX rebound as investor confidence returns</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) bounced back on Friday after a steep plunge on Wednesday.
The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 2,787 points, or 2.5 per cent, to close at 114,113.93.
On Wednesday, the market had plunged by more than 3,500 points.
Yousuf M Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “The market is tracking India-Pakistan tensions, and some news flow has indicated de-escalation, prompting a rebound today.”
He continued that investors were also encouraged by the inflation data and the monetary policy announcement on Monday, with expectations of a rate cut ranging from 50 to 100 basis points.
“Additionally, Pakistan’s IMF [International Monetary Fund] board approval is scheduled for the 9th. As a result, market participants are primarily focused on developments regarding regional tensions, interest rates, and the upcoming IMF decision.”
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, also attributed the increase to the lack of any military action from India.
“The likelihood of a full-scale war between Pakistan and India remains low, constrained by the nuclear deterrence factor,” he said.
“[This] has boosted investor confidence, prompting them to take positions in stocks that align well with Pakistan’s improving economic conditions.”
In recent days, Washington urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.”
The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.</p><small>2025-05-02 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0217381683717c4.jpg?r=173821' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907977/fact-check-dawncom-did-not-report-on-ttp-stealing-paf-f-16-viral-screenshot-is-doctored' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Dawn.com did not report on TTP stealing PAF F-16; viral screenshot is doctored</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple Indian users on social media platform X since Thursday shared a screenshot of an alleged Dawn.com news report that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant group had stolen a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 fighter jet. However, Dawn has not published any such report.
Relations between Pakistan and India have turned exceedingly sour since an attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer, on April 22. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. Following the attack, India, without providing evidence, implied that attackers had links to Pakistan, an allegation that Islamabad has vehemently refuted.
The incident led to a severe downgrading of ties between the two countries. Since then, the Indian mainstream and social media outlets have been spreading propaganda against Pakistan.
On Thursday, an alleged screenshot of Dawn.com was shared by an Indian account on X, claiming that the news outlet had reported the TTP had stolen a PAF F-16 fighter jet.
The caption of the post said: “Reports claim TTP has stolen a Pakistan Air Force fighter jet. If true, this marks a shocking breach in military security.” It further added, “Even fighter jets are not safe in Pakistan.”
The user did not share the link to the alleged news story or its text beyond the headline.
The post gained 263,000 views.
The same alleged screenshot and claim were circulated by several other Indian accounts on X as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here,here, here, here and here, collectively receiving over 26,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the events unfolding between India and Pakistan in the wake of the recent Pahalgam attack.
Analysing the alleged Dawn.com report screenshot using the AI-based forensic tool FotoForensics revealed significant blurriness and distortion throughout the image, especially around the text, an indicator of potential digital manipulation.
In contrast, when a screenshot of a report from Dawn.com’s official website was analysed using the same tool, no overt blurriness of the text was indicated.
 


A side-by-side visual comparison further highlighted key discrepancies. In the alleged screenshot, each word in the headline is in uppercase — unlike Dawn.com’s actual headline style, which only capitalises selected words.
The spacing between the headline and byline is also noticeably larger than the consistent format seen on Dawn.com’s website.
 


Additionally, a keyword search to locate the alleged Dawn.com article yielded no such report on the new outlet’s website or any other leading mainstream media outlet.
Instead, according to a June 10, 2020, Dawn.com report titled, “Fake news screenshot about ‘missing F-16’ posing as Dawn.com surfaces on social media”, a similar situation had occurred before.
As per the report, a screenshot of a fake news story doctored to look like an article on Dawn.com had surfaced on social media. The fake screenshot, shared on Twitter (now X), had attempted to mislead the public by suggesting that a PAF F-16 fighter jet had gone ‘missing’ during a ‘panic situation’ in Karachi.
The fake screenshot — widely shared by Indian Twitterati — had surfaced on the same day that Indian media reported “panic” in Karachi following what they called rumours of Indian Air Force fighters crossing the Line of Control.
The image was cropped to show only the fake story’s headline and doctored to resemble news articles on Dawn.com. However, certain grammatical and stylistic deviations had pointed to the “glaring inauthenticity of the screenshot”.
The iVerify Pakistan team also contacted the editor at Dawn.com to verify whether any such report had ever been published. Dawn.com news editor Bilal Farooqi confirmed that “no such story was reported on by the digital desk on May 1 or any other date.”
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim regarding a viral screenshot of an alleged Dawn.com report about the TTP stealing a PAF F-16 fighter jet is false. Dawn.com never reported on any such story, nor was it covered by any other mainstream outlet, and the viral image of the alleged news story is doctored.

The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
The Indian police continued their operations on the orders of the Indian Home Ministry and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), according to Kashmir Media Service.
During search operations, the Indian forces seized house and bank documents, mobile phones and other digital devices from the residents.
All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) spokesman Advocate Abdul Rashid Minhas expressed concern over the unsettling atmosphere created by house raids, looting of house goods and attacking properties.
He urged the United Nations to take immediate notice of the deteriorating situation in the occupied territory and resolve the Kashmir dispute according to the UN resolutions and aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
Following the Pahalgam incident, Indian troops and paramilitary forces escalated operations across the valley, carrying out widespread house raids and arbitrary arrests.
Last week, Indian soldiers blew up the family homes of two men who police alleged were among a gang that carried out the attack.
The Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown by Monday.
Azad Kashmir govt orders stockpiling of food
Meanwhile, the Azad Kashmir government called on residents near the border with India to stockpile food.
“Instructions have been issued to stock food supplies for two months in the 13 constituencies along the Line of Control (LoC),” AFP quoted AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq from the local assembly on Friday.
The regional government has also created an emergency fund of one billion rupees ($3.5 million) to ensure the supply of “food, medicines and all other basic necessities” to the 13 constituencies, he said.
Government and privately owned machinery were also being deployed to maintain roads in the areas along the LoC, he added.
Fearing a military escalation, authorities also shut more than 1,000 religious schools for 10 days on Thursday in Kashmir.</p><small>2025-05-02 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02164503e09b233.png?r=170208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907979/iran-must-walk-away-from-all-uranium-enrichment-rubio-says' target='_blank'><strong>Iran must ‘walk away’ from all uranium enrichment, Rubio says</strong></a><br><p>Iran has to ‘walk away’ from uranium enrichment and long-range missile development and it should allow American inspectors of its facilities, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday as a round of nuclear talks was postponed.
Rubio’s comments underscore the major remaining divisions in talks between the countries to resolve the long-running dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump threatening to bomb Iran if there is no agreement.
“They have to walk away from sponsoring terrorists, they have to walk away from helping the Houthis (in Yemen), they have to walk away from building long-range missiles that have no purpose to exist other than having nuclear weapons, and they have to walk away from enrichment,” Rubio said in a Fox News interview.
Iran has repeatedly said it will not give up its missile programme or its uranium enrichment — a process used to make fuel for nuclear power plants but which can also yield material for an atomic warhead.
 
 

On Thursday, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that the scheduled fourth round of talks due to take place in Rome on Saturday had been postponed and that a new date would be set “depending on the US approach”.
Rubio said Iran should import enriched uranium for its nuclear power programme rather than enriching it to any level.
“If you have the ability to enrich at 3.67 per cent, it only takes a few weeks to get to 20pc, then 60pc, and then the 80 and 90pc that you need for a weapon,” he said.
Iran has said it has a right to enrich uranium under the terms of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
It denies wanting to build a nuclear bomb.
Rubio also said Iran would have to accept that Americans could be involved in any inspection regime and that inspectors would require access to all facilities, including military ones.</p><small>2025-05-02 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02154039d5a0e15.png?r=154914' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907969/finance-minister-credits-financial-discipline-coordination-between-centre-provinces-for-primary-surplus' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister credits financial discipline, coordination between Centre, provinces for primary surplus</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb credited strict financial discipline and robust coordination between the federal and provincial governments for enabling the achievement of a primary surplus, according to a Finance Ministry statement released on Friday.
Last November, unprecedented profits by the State Bank of Pakistan, driven by the highest-ever interest rates and record petroleum levy revenue — both non-tax sources — have helped the country convert its entrenched budget deficits into a fiscal surplus for the first time in at least 24 years.
The finance minister “credited strict financial discipline and robust coordination between the federal and provincial governments for enabling the achievement of a primary surplus,” the statement said.
Aurangzeb, along with his team, held a Zoom meeting today with representatives of S&P Global Ratings as part of the ongoing Pakistan Sovereign Ratings Review, the statement added.
“During the session, the finance minister presented a detailed overview of the government’s macroeconomic reform agenda and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth by enhancing productivity and promoting exports, the statement continued.”
He emphasised the continuity of reforms across key sectors, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), privatisation, public finance management, rightsizing of government functions, and more active debt management strategies.
The finance minister noted that inflation and the current account deficit (CAD) had remained on a positive note throughout the year, contributing positively to overall economic stability.
“He also highlighted the achievement of surpluses in both the primary balance and the current account as major milestones, underscoring the improving fundamentals of Pakistan’s economy,” the statement read.
“He stated that the country’s external portfolio was well-managed, with foreign exchange reserves projected to reach $14 billion by the end of June, supported by upcoming institutional and trade inflows, strong remittances, and easing oil prices, all of which are helping reduce pressure on the external account,” the statement quoted the finance minister as saying.
Aurangzeb pointed to significant institutional reforms, including the signing of a comprehensive National Fiscal Pact, operationalisation of the National Tax Council, and the imposition of agricultural income tax, reflecting a whole-of-government approach and a shared national resolve to improve resource efficiency, broaden the tax base, and ensure long-term inclusive growth.
He further stated that the tax-to-GDP ratio was expected to reach 10.6 per cent by the end of June, which would mark progress toward the government’s target of raising it to 13pc by the conclusion of the 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
He added that the separation of the Tax Policy Office from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was part of a broader effort to align tax policymaking with economic value principles rather than administrative convenience.
The finance minister also shared insights from his recent visit to the United States for the World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings, during which he held over 70 meetings in six days with counterparts, Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), investment banks, multilateral and bilateral partners, rating agencies, think tanks, and media outlets, according to the Finance Ministry.
He conveyed that the feedback received from these stakeholders consistently reflected appreciation and support for the structural reforms and macroeconomic stability achieved by Pakistan over the past 14 months.
“At the same time, there was a strong and unified recommendation for Pakistan to stay the course, deepen the reform momentum, and focus on embedding permanence in macroeconomic stability, with international partners expressing readiness to support the country in achieving these objectives,” the statement concluded.
Earlier in the week, Aurangzeb expressed confidence that the global situation following the imposition of US tariffs is manageable for Pakistan.
The minister, speaking at the leadership of the business community during his visit to the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Karachi, said Pakistan already has constructive engagements with US authorities on the sidelines of World Bank and IMF summer meetings, while the premier has also announced the decision to send a delegation to the US to negotiate tariff issues.
Last month, global ratings agency Fitch had upgraded Pakistan’s foreign currency credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’, citing increased confidence in the country’s progress on narrowing its budget deficits.
The upgrade also reflects confidence that the country would implement structural reforms, supporting its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme performance and funding availability, Fitch had said.</p><small>2025-05-02 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0215010528b2f8d.jpg?r=150150' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907968/smart-lockdown-enforced-in-kp-locality-amid-rising-mpox-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Smart lockdown enforced in KP locality amid rising mpox cases</strong></a><br><p>The administration of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s district Khyber has enforced a 12-day smart lockdown in a locality in tehsil Jamrud, Associated Press of Pakistan reported on Friday.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has now recorded a total of 17 cases of mpox during the past three years. Most of the patients had arrived either from the United Arab Emirates or Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the disease was endemic. In August last year, the World Health Organisation declared mpox an emergency of international concern.
The district administration of Khyber imposed the smart lockdown in the Pump House locality of Ghandi, sealing all entry and exit points, according to a notification issued by its deputy commissioner, retired Captain Bilal Shahid Rao.
The report says the decision aims to prevent further transmission of the virus within the community.
“During the lockdown, only essential services will be allowed to operate, such as grocery shops, pharmacies, general stores, tandoors, and emergency services,” the report added.
Legal action will be taken against anyone violating the lockdown restrictions within its stipulated time period, the report quoted the officials as saying.
“Residents have been advised to cooperate with health teams, follow health guidelines and avoid any unnecessary movement.”
Last week, a 31-year-old male resident of Khyber district tested positive after he was screened while departing for Dubai at Bacha Khan International Airport. Following the confirmation of his case, KP health department issued directives to the district health officer of Khyber for immediate surveillance and contact tracing.
The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, with children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications.</p><small>2025-05-02 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02085026fb75280.jpg?r=113028' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907930/us-hopes-that-indias-response-to-pahalgam-attack-doesnt-lead-to-broader-regional-conflict-vance' target='_blank'><strong>US hopes that India’s response to Pahalgam attack doesn’t lead to broader regional conflict: Vance</strong></a><br><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday Washington hoped that India’s response to the recent attack in occupied Kashmir does not lead to a broader regional conflict.
The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
“Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’ show.
“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance added.
Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it “terror” and “unconscionable,” while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.
India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington’s ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
In recent days, Washington urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.” India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.
The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“This government is in constant communication,” State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at her daily news briefing
“We are asking for a responsible resolution from both parties.”
“As the President articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the US stands strong with India against terrorism, and Prime Minister Modi has our full support,” she said.
Bruce said Secretary Rubio encouraged both countries to work toward a responsible solution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia.
“We continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries, as I mentioned, at multiple levels.”
Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.
After the attack, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries closed airspace to each other’s airlines. They also exchanged fire across their border.
Pakistani ambassador, UN chief discuss ‘evolving security situation’
Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.
“The discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,” a press release issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.
“The ambassador reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability,” it added.
 






Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.
Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.
“So I don’t think there would be any travel until there’s a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they’ve both accepted his good offices,” he added.
Dar apprises Panama counterpart on current regional situation
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday held a telephonic conversation with the Foreign Minister of Panama, Javier Eduardo Martinze-Acha Vasquez, the foreign ministry said in a post on X.
“[Dar] briefed him on the current regional situation, including India’s inflammatory propaganda, its illegal unilateral actions against Pakistan, including holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty — a clear violation of international law.
“[Vasquez] emphasized both sides to exercise restraint,” the foreign ministry said. “Being non-permanent members of UNSC, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment for international peace and security.”

Paris-based RSF, which has been tracking press freedom for the last 23 years, said its main index had fallen to its lowest-ever level.
“For the first time in the history of the index, the conditions for practising journalism are poor in half of the world’s countries and satisfactory in fewer than one in four,” an annual review of media freedom globally by the charity concluded.
RSF Editorial Director Anne Bocande highlighted the role of economic pressures in undermining fact-based reporting, with many independent outlets having to close because of funding difficulties.
Although spending on online advertising was still rising — hitting $247.3 billion in 2024, according to RSF — a growing share is captured by online giants Facebook, Google or Amazon rather than media companies.
“When journalists are impoverished, they no longer have the means to resist the enemies of the press — those who champion disinformation and propaganda,” Bocande said in a statement.
Authoritarian shift
RSF highlighted how Trump had made difficult conditions worse by axing US financial support for state-backed broadcasters such as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), as well as US foreign development aid that assisted media outlets overseas.
After a fall of 11 places in 2024, the US declined another two to 57th place on the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, one behind formerly war-torn Sierra Leone in western Africa.
 
 

The index, calculated according to the number of violent incidents involving journalists and other data compiled by experts, was topped by oil-rich Norway for the ninth year in a row. Estonia and the Netherlands were second and third.
“In the United States, Donald Trump’s second term as president has led to an alarming deterioration in press freedom, indicative of an authoritarian shift in government,” RSF said.
“His administration has weaponised institutions, cut support for independent media, and sidelined reporters.”
Large parts of the United States were now “news deserts”, RSF said.
Trump announced on Wednesday that he was considering legal action against The New York Times, in his latest attack on a media outlet.
He is also suing media group Paramount over a pre-election interview last year of his Democratic rival Kamala Harris on its CBS channel.
Trump alleges it was edited to remove an embarrassing response, although many legal analysts view the case as baseless and likely to be dismissed or fail due to constitutional protections for freedom of the press.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a media watchdog, also warned Wednesday that press freedom in the United States was declining and it urged newsrooms to form a united front against the “rising tide of threats” facing them.
Other countries that have suffered major declines in press freedom over the last year include Argentina (down 21 places to 87th) under right-wing Trump ally Javier Milei, and Tunisia (down 11 places to 129th).
RSF also again highlighted the plight of Palestinian journalists seeking to report on Israel’s devastating bombardment of Gaza.
“In Gaza, the Israeli army has destroyed newsrooms, killed nearly 200 journalists and imposed a total blockade on the strip for over 18 months,” it said.
Israel meanwhile had dropped a further 11 places to 112th and “continues to repress its own news media”.</p><small>2025-05-02 09:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02100550c64355a.jpg?r=101428' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907938/air-india-allowed-to-temporarily-extend-duty-and-rest-for-long-haul-crew-memo-shows' target='_blank'><strong>Air India allowed to temporarily extend duty and rest for long-haul crew, memo shows</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation regulator has allowed Air India to temporarily extend the maximum duty hours and rest period for pilots on long-haul routes to allow the airline to tackle Pakistan’s airspace ban, according to an internal memo.
The exemption is for about two weeks beginning April 30 and is applicable for Airbus and Boeing long-haul jets, according to the memo, and is meant to cover flights to destinations in the US.
The exemption has been put in place while a permanent solution is being worked out, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The exemption increases the maximum flight duty period — typically the time between reporting for duty and the end of flight-related activities — for pilots and cabin crew, the memo showed.
Air India and India’s civil aviation ministry, which houses the regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), could not be immediately reached for comment.
Indian airlines are bracing for higher fuel costs and longer journey times after
Pakistan shut its airspace to the country’s carriers as tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared following an attack on tourists in India-held Kashmir last week.
Reuters reported on Thursday that Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if the ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year, and has asked the federal government to compensate it for the hit.
The maximum pilot flight duty period for a flight of up to 12 hours is now 16 hours compared with the previous 14 hours, while for flights above 14 hours, the duty period has risen to 24 hours instead of 22 hours, according to the memo sent to pilots and seen by Reuters.
Extra rest periods of four hours and 12 hours over present limits have also been planned for crew at layovers and the home base, respectively.
The memo, which was earlier reported by the Economic Times newspaper, has stoked concerns among pilots about increased workloads at a time air travel in India is booming, with one Air India pilot telling Reuters the measures were “extreme”.
The DGCA is holding regular conversations with airlines to ensure pilots and cabin crew are not overburdened, the source familiar with the issue said. The pilot and the source declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p><small>2025-05-02 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0212482235c80d0.jpg?r=131057' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907958/hard-right-party-wins-local-uk-election-in-blow-to-pm-starmer' target='_blank'><strong>Hard-right party wins local UK election in blow to PM Starmer</strong></a><br><p>Hard-right upstarts Reform UK snatched a parliamentary seat from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour party on Friday in local elections that dealt a blow to Britain’s two establishment parties.
Reform, led by anti-immigrant firebrand Nigel Farage, won the by-election in Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by just six votes, as it picked up gains in other localities, including one mayoralty.
The group’s strong showing continues the momentum it built up at last year’s general election and appears to confirm a trend that the UK is entering an era of multi-party politics.
“For the movement, for the party it’s a very, very big moment indeed,” Brexit champion Farage said of Reform’s first-ever by-election win and Starmer’s first electoral loss since he took office last July.
Reform also picked up dozens of council seats from both Labour and the Conservatives as Britain’s political landscape shows signs of splintering.
In the fight for six mayoralties, Reform won Greater Lincolnshire with Labour holding three. Labour, however, only narrowly held the North Tyneside mayoralty after a 26 per cent swing to Reform.
New Greater Lincolnshire mayor Andrea Jenkyns said, “The fightback to save the heart and soul of our great country has now begun.”
“Now that Reform is in a place of power, we can help start rebuilding Britain. Inch by inch,” she said.
The polls were the first since Starmer became prime minister and Kemi Badenoch took over the reins of the struggling opposition Conservatives last year.
Just 1,641 seats across 23 local authorities were up for grabs — only a fraction of England’s 17,000 councillors — but early results suggested Reform was transferring leads in national polls into tangible results at the ballot box.
“The big question we wanted to know after these results was are the polls right in suggesting that Reform now pose a significant challenge to both the Conservatives and the Labour party? The answer to that question so far is quite clearly yes,” political scientist John Curtice told the BBC.
The centrist Liberal Democrats and left-wing Greens also expected to make gains, as surveys show Britons are increasingly disillusioned with the two main parties amid anaemic economic growth, high levels of irregular immigration and flagging public services.
Reform, which has vowed to “stop the boats” of irregular migrants crossing the English Channel, is hoping that winning mayoralties and gaining hundreds of councillors will help it build its grassroots activism before the next general election — likely in 2029.
Squeezed from both sides
British politics has been dominated by the centre-left Labour Party and centre-right Tories since the early 20th century.
But “British politics appears to be fragmenting,” Curtice wrote in the Telegraph this week.
He said Thursday’s polls were “likely [to] be the first in which as many as five parties are serious players”.
Labour won a huge parliamentary majority in July with just 33.7pc of the vote, the lowest share for any party winning a general election since World War II.
The Conservatives won just 24pc of the vote, securing only 121 seats in the 650-seat parliament as the party endured its worst election defeat.
Reform picked up five seats, an unprecedented haul for a British hard-right party, although one of those now sits as an independent. After Friday’s win, their tally now stands at five again.
The Liberal Democrats in July won 61 more MPs than at the previous election and the Greens quadrupled their representation to four.
Labour won Runcorn with 53pc of the vote last year, meaning it was one of its safest seats, while Reform got just 18pc.
At a result declared shortly before 6am (10am PKT) on Friday, election officials said Reform’s Sarah Pochin secured 12,645 votes to 12,639 for Labour candidate Karen Shore. The turnout was 46pc.
The vote was sparked after sitting Labour MP Mike Amesbury was convicted of assault for punching a man in the street.
Labour spokesperson said by-elections are “always difficult for the party in government” and the events surrounding the Runcorn vote made it “even harder”.
On Tuesday, Reform UK topped a YouGov poll of voting intentions in Britain with 26pc, three points ahead of Labour and six up on the Conservatives.
Labour has endured criticism over welfare cuts and tax rises that it claims are necessary to stabilise the economy.
As Labour edges rightwards, it is facing a growing challenge from the Greens on the left.
Under threat from Reform on the right, the Tories are also being squeezed on the left by the Liberal Democrats, the traditional third party, which was eyeing gains in the wealthy south.</p><small>2025-05-02 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/021144434377d55.jpg?r=114501' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907943/fo-snubs-indian-media-reports-says-wagah-border-open-for-returning-pakistanis' target='_blank'><strong>FO snubs Indian media reports, says Wagah border open for returning Pakistanis</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Thursday snubbed Indian media reports of Pakistan shutting the Wagah border to returning citizens amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the two countries following a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence. Two days later, India revoked the visas of Pakistani nationals and ordered them to leave the country by April 29. Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
A day ago, the Times of India claimed that Pakistan “refused” to open the gates at the Wagah border, leaving dozens of Pakistanis “stranded in the no-man’s-land of diplomatic deadlock”.
Late on Thursday night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to media queries about the availability of the Wagah border crossing for Pakistani citizens returning from India.
It issued a statement saying: “The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges.
“Many patients with fragile health had to return to Pakistan without completing their treatment. Furthermore, there are reports of families being split and children being separated from one of their parents.”
 






The last date to cross over through the Wagah-Attari border was April 30, 2025, it said.
“In that context, we are aware of the media reports indicating that some Pakistani nationals are stranded at Attari.
“We are open to receiving our citizens in case the Indian authorities allow them to cross the border from their side.
“The Wagah border will remain open for Pakistani citizens in the future as well.”
“In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, the Government of India has decided to suspend visa services to Pakistani nationals with immediate effect,” AFP reported.
“All Pakistani nationals currently in India must leave India before the expiry of visas, as now amended.”</p><small>2025-05-02 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0210505728f6905.jpg?r=105103' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907844/punjab-health-dept-to-hire-daily-wage-doctors-to-keep-hospitals-functional' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab health dept to hire daily-wage doctors to keep hospitals functional</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE/Rawalpindi: As the Young Doctors’ Association (YDA) Punjab chapter on Thursday threatened to shut down indoor services at all the public sector hospitals across the province from the coming Monday, the health department issued an order to hire doctors on daily wages to keep the healthcare facilities fully functional, besides terminating services of 12 more young doctors.
The health authorities have already cancelled leaves of all doctors and nurses in the province.
Holding a presser in Lahore, the YDA Punjab leaders announced expanding their agitation province wide in response to the terminations and suspensions of young medics and nurses by health authorities, saying they were not be afraid of the departmental punishments, victimisation and arrests by police.
Meanwhile, senior representatives of the Punjab Nurses Association (PNA) and the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) also came forward in the YDA’s support.
Earlier, the young medics shut down the OPD services at different public sector hospitals in the province for the last 10 days, while the government responded by terminating services of 17 doctors and nurses for denying treatment to patients.

YDA Punjab warns of closure of indoor services from Monday

YDA Punjab chairman Dr Salman Haseeb told journalists on Thursday that the Lahore police lodged two cases against more than 400 employees of the government hospitals who were protesting peacefully against the outsourcing of the health facilities.
He said the police allegedly tortured and arrested many employees, including the YDA leaders.
He also condemned the actions of the health department, saying the employees reserved the right to lodge a protest for their “legitimate demands” under the law of the land.
The YDA leaders and nurses urged three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to intervene and resolve the issue on the table.
They alleged that some elements in the health department were misleading the Punjab government by distorting facts regarding demands of the protesting employees.
They said that they were ready for negotiations with the government representatives only. To a question, the YDA Punjab chairman said that all the health sector employees, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, have decided to close down the indoor services at all the state-run hospitals from coming Monday, if their demands were not accepted.
There are reports that the Punjab health department has terminated services of more than 30 young doctors and nurses so far for closing down OPD services at the state-run hospitals and denying treatment to patients. A senior official of the Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) told Dawn that the RMU called a meeting of professors and the administrations of the Holy Family Hospital (HFH), Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) and Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital (RTH) to deal with the situation following the YDA announcement of shutting down indoor services at the hospitals across Punjab.
He says that doctors from tehsils have been brought to run the OPDs in the major hospitals and disciplinary action has been taken against the YDA’s local leadership for not performing duties.
On the other hand, YDA’s Rawalpindi chapter president Dr Aarif Aziz says that his services were terminated by BBH administration and of the association’s secretary general Dr Fakhar has been suspended from the service.
He says the YDA’s general meeting has been called on Friday (today) to chalk out a plan to deal with the new situation. However, he says, no strike was observed in emergency and other wards in any hospital in Rawalpindi.
He says that the doctors are protesting against the “wrong decision” of the government and instead of victimising them, the government should sit on the table and resolve the issue.
“We are not demanding salaries, but we are struggling to save the public sector hospitals from the contractors,” he says.
He says that outsourcing means patients will be deprived of affordable treatment. He added that medical education and training will also be negatively affected and employment and working conditions of doctors will deteriorate because of outsourcing health facilities.

In a detailed research in the half-yearly report on the State of the Economy 2024-25, released on Monday, the central bank observed that one of the key underlying issues facing Pakistan’s economy was weak competitiveness.
“From a macroeconomic perspective, this is reflected in consistently declining exports (as a percentage of GDP), low FDI, and overall insufficient integration with global value chains (GVC),” said the report.
From a micro perspective, this is reflected in the low quality of products, the higher unit cost of production, inability to create brands in international markets, and other ancillary indicators, the report added.

Pakistan’s labour productivity is the lowest among peer economies

The country’s productivity growth has been declining, even though productivity has featured in the government’s broad economic policy frameworks since at least the late 1990s, according to the report.
Pakistan’s economy has been caught in boom-bust cycles for more than five decades, with recurring episodes of high inflation and external account pressures, said the report, adding that historically, these cycles comprised three to six years of relatively high growth followed by a crisis — particularly balance of payments crisis — that necessitated urgent stabilisation measures.
“In recent decades, however, the frequency of boom-bust cycles has increased with the boom periods getting shorter. Moreover, access to external support has become challenging, warranting implementation of deep-rooted and long-pending structural reforms to address the underlying issues,” said the report.
Labour productivity
Pakistan’s labour productivity (LP) growth, measured as a change in GDP per worker, is among the lowest compared to its peer economies.While average annual growth in GDP per worker in the last two decades increased by about 1.0 percentage points over the average growth in the preceding decade, it remains low compared to peer economies by income — lower-middle-income countries (LMIC).
Labour quality in Pakistan accounted for 21pc of the improvement in labour productivity during 2000-2022, compared to 61pc in ASEAN economies.
Several attempts have been made in Pakistan to increase exports and attract FDI to kick-start economic growth. With some exceptions, most such attempts have been based on the low road model (short-term approach) coupled with the protection of domestic industries on the premise of infant industry.
However, these approaches have not delivered desirable outcomes; nor have foreign aid, grants, loans, privatisation and other windfall or external endowments sustainably driven long-term growth prospects, said the report.
It is productivity growth, which is the biggest structural driver of competitiveness, that boosts the economy’s ability to continue to export competitively, attract FDI, and sustain economic growth, said the report.
An important dimension is that while the short-term offers quick gains, it is inherently unsustainable.
Similarly, solely relying on exchange rate undervaluation to compensate for the high cost of production, lack of innovation, low product quality, etc., could be counterproductive, said the report.

Jason Miller, a long-time adviser to President Donald Trump, signed a $150,000-a-month contract to represent the Indian government — his first formal lobbying role during Trump’s second term.
According to filings with the US Justice Department, seen by Dawn, Miller will provide strategic counsel, tactical planning, lobbying, and public relations services to New Delhi.
A communications strategist, Miller played a key role in both of Trump’s presidential campaigns, and served as a senior adviser in the White House.
He later launched the social media platform Gettr, which was promoted as a pro-free speech alternative to Twitter, and remained active in conservative political circles.
The same day, two other Trump aides — Keith Schiller, a former White House Deputy Assistant; and George Sorial, a former Trump Organisation executive — registered as foreign agents for Pakistan. Sorial is also the co-author of The Real Deal, a memoir chronicling his time with Trump
Their firm, Javelin Advisors LLC, signed on as a subcontractor to Seiden Law, which recently secured a $200,000-a-month agreement with the Pakistani government.
Javelin’s share of the contract is $50,000 per month, according to Politico, a US-based publication that covers politics and policy. While the foreign lobbying contracts are ostensibly focused on economic and diplomatic engagement, the timing of the two new contracts has drawn scrutiny.

MUZAFFARABAD / RAWALPINDI: With the threat of an Indian escalation looming over Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), its prime minister indicated on Thursday that his government was considering imposing an emergency in the territory if something untoward happens.
Also on Thursday, authorities stopped tourists from entering Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the Line of Control (LoC) in view of the security situation.
 
 

The government has ordered all religious seminaries in the region to remain closed for 10 days, while the owners of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and marriage halls have pledged to place their establishments at the military’s disposal in case India launches an attack.
Meanwhile, Pakistan announced that certain sections of airspace over the two largest cities — Karachi and Lahore — will remain closed for eight hours a day throughout the month of May.
In addition, flights to and from destinations in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face disruptions due to the closure of airspace in that region.
Preparedness plans
Speaking during a session of the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said his administration was monitoring the situation on the Indian frontier.
He assured the House that his government had made arrangements to ensure the availability of food, medicines, and other basic necessities in the 13 constituencies located along the LoC.
“We have established an Emergency Response Fund and transferred Rs1bn into it… arrangements have been made to ensure food, medicines, and other essential supplies,” he said, adding that administrations and residents in the border areas had been directed to stock rations for two months.
In addition, official and private machinery was being deployed to keep roads open in the LoC constituencies of Neelum, Jhelum, Poonch, Haveli, Kotli and Bhimber.
Additionally, the State Disaster Management Authority, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defence had been directed to remain prepared for any emergency.
Stating that India had been exposed before the world as a terrorist state, Mr Haq urged the nation to remain vigilant, warning that the “vile adversary could resort to any ghastly act.”
“I assure you that if India commits any kind of aggression, the government, the people, and all political and religious parties and leaders are fully prepared to respond to its aggressive designs,” he said.
Mr Haq added that Indian occupation forces had resorted to unprovoked firing along the LoC on Thursday and had been given a strong and timely response by the army.
Later in the day, PM Haq hosted a multi-party meeting at his official residence, where participants, including leaders from outside the Legislative Assembly, ren­ewed the resolve to teach India a befitting lesson in the event of any aggression.
Restrictions
Also on Thursday, authorities began stopping tourists from entering the Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the LoC.
Many visitors who were unaware of the fresh restrictions were turned back from the Marbal checkpost, and even AJK residents who were not local to these areas were stopped from proceeding further.
In Leepa Valley, officials advised residents to avoid areas near the LoC and urged them to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure their safety.
Separately, the government ordered all religious seminaries to remain closed for 10 days, citing a heatwave.
However, official sources indicated that the decision was based on intelligence rep­orts suggesting India mi­ght target such institutions, under the pretext
of hitting militant training centres. “We are dealing with such a cunning, cruel, and conspiratorial enemy that no vile act can be ruled out,” said Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed.
In a related development, the Joint Action Committee of Hotels, Guesthouses, Restaurants, and Marriage Halls of AJK held an emergency meeting to express solidarity with the army.
Chaired by Raja Ilyas, the meeting included members from Kotli, Mirpur, Bagh, Rawalakot, and Neelum, some of whom joined via video link.
Participants pledged to hand over their establishments to the Pakistan Army through the AJK prime minister if India launched an attack.
Airspace closures
Pakistan has also decided to close certain sections of the airspace over Karachi and Lahore between 8am and 4pm (local time) for the month of May “due to operational reasons”.
The restrictions will not be applicable on Sundays.
New Delhi had earlier closed its airspace to Pakistani planes on Wed­nesday, a few days after Islamabad banned Indian planes from overflying.
“Affected routes are located between flight levels 9,000 and 25,000 feet,” according to the latest Notice to Airmen (Notam) issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).
The decision affects selected corridors within the FIRs rather than a complete shutdown, and is being implemented as a precautionary security measure, officials added.
Although authorities say the closure will not significantly disrupt commercial flight operations, as aircraft will be rerouted via alternative flight paths during the restricted hours, these hours are considered peak times for domestic flights.
The closure comes in addition to restrictions already in place in the skies over Gilgit-Baltistan, as PIA flights from Islamabad to Gilgit-Skardu were cancelled for a second day on Thursday. The airspace was unavailable between 1:30am and 10pm on Thursday.
Separately, rain and windstorms in northern parts of Pakistan disrupted the flight schedule, with as many as five international and domestic flights delayed and diverted to other cities due to bad weather in Islamabad.

• Army chief inspects military exercise, vows befitting response in case of aggression
• Tarar says situation on the border is ‘ever evolving’
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan-India tensions continue to simmer in light of the Pahalgam attack in the held Kashmir, Pakistan on Thursday engaged a host of friendly nations, including China, to seek their support for de-escalation measures between the nuclear states and to take them into confidence regarding the ‘weaponisation’ of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.
The hostilities, which led to the downgrading of ties between the neighbours, also came up during a contact between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as both dignitaries noted with concern the “belligerent attitude and provocative statements” by India, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability.
In his contacts with Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani on Thursday evening, PM Shehbaz discussed developments in South Asia and expressed concerns over India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin. The PM, according to a statement, deemed the action unacceptable, emphasising that the Indus water was the lifeline of the 240 million people in Pakistan.
 
 

In his meeting with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong, PM Shehbaz informed the Chinese envoy that the belligerent actions by India could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counter-terrorism efforts against militant outfits operating from Afghanistan. He informed the envoy that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue was the only way to ensure “lasting peace” in South Asia and also thanked him for China’s support to Pakistan in its demand for a transparent probe into the attack.
The premier said that India’s decision to weaponise water was extremely regrettable, as there was no provision for either party to unilaterally walk away from its commitments under the Indus Waters Treaty. During the meeting, the Chinese ambassador thanked the PM for sharing Pakistan’s perspective on the emerging situation due to India’s propaganda and unilateral actions, the Prime Minister’s Office said.
‘No compromise’
The breakdown in ties with India also featured prominently in a meeting between the president and the premier on Thursday. They affirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a “befitting manner”.
They said the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military, which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan’s response to India’s “belligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression”. They said that the international community should take note of India’s involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.

The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.
Separately, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also had a conversation with Slovenia Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and briefed her on the evolving situation. In his contact, FM Dar rejected India’s baseless allegations and denounced unilateral actions, including holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, as a clear violation of international law. FM Fajon called on both countries to exercise restraint and resolve issues through diplomacy.
‘Let there be no ambiguity’
As civilian leaders took world leaders into confidence, army chief General Asim Munir warned that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a quick and decisive response.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests are absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
According to the ISPR, COAS Munir visited the Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness ‘Exercise Hammer Strike’, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military’s Mangla Strike Corps. Speaking on the occasion, the army chief reaffirmed the military’s “unyielding resolve” to defend the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
The COAS lauded the “high morale, combat proficiency, and war-fighting spirit” of the officers and troops, terming them the “embodiment of Pakistan Army’s operational excellence”.
‘No proof’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said India failed to provide proof of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam incident. About allegations levelled by India, he said they kept blaming Pakistan, adding that New Delhi used such incidents as pretexts to attack Pakistan in the past. “They will have to tell the world who was involved. You cannot just say that Pakistan was behind this…” he said, adding that Pakistan demanded an impartial inquiry to prove that it had nothing to do with Pahalgam.
He said Islamabad also engaged the friendly nations to share with them its perspective regarding the recent tensions.
To another query, he said, “The situation is fluctuating and sometimes escalation is high and sometimes it is low; sometimes engagement with the diplomatic community, and this is an ever-evolving situation.”
 
 

“We keep receiving intelligence reports, and having said that, our armed forces are on alert…we are conducting exercises, and there is much at the operational level which I cannot share right now,” he said, adding that there was a possibility that India could attack Pakistan. “Yes, there is a possibility, that is why I said that Pakistan is always well prepared to defend that and our armed forces are ready for self-defence,” he added.
He said he had shared the information about the potential attack “very timely” with the world as a form of deterrence.
“There are three forms of deterrence: one is our capability, which is our very strong military… second is the resolve…of the nation…and third is the communication,” he added. “So, communication plays a big part in averting crises.”

Kharif season begins on April 1, and water availability criteria and distribution among provinces are usually settled for the entire season by the advisory committee in the last week of March.
 
 

But given peculiar sca­rce water conditions, it had allocated only drinking water shares to provinces for April — the first month of the season generally used for sowing crops. Provinces had delayed sowing because of the unprecedented water shor­tage, estimated at 43 per cent at the time.
Irsa’s advisory committee decided on March 26 to meet again in the first week of May to take stock of the latest situation and finalise “Anticipated Wat­er Availability Criteria” and set provincial water shares for the season.
The shortage has since dropped to about 25-27pc to be finally approved by the committee on May 5. The water storage in reservoirs, particularly Mangla and Tarbela, has further improved to 1.762 million acre-feet (MAF), up from 1.3 MAF on April 20 and almost zero on April 1.
Irsa has invited irrigation and agriculture secretaries from the four provinces, Wapda’s members for water and power, the chief engineering adviser and the chairman of the Federal Flood Commission, along with all Irsa members, to attend the crucial meeting.
The authority has already increased provincial water shares, raising hopes about better cotton sowing that was earlier feared to dent Kharif crops amid a 43pc water shortage for the season predicted on March 26 by the Irsa’s advisory committee.
The committee earlier resisted provincial pressures on March 26, particularly from Sindh, for lower allocations and gave monthly allocations to provinces from the maximum shortage scenario.
As a result, the provinces were given minimum shares, mostly sufficient only for drinking instead of irrigation.
The provinces generally delayed sowing crops where possible.
