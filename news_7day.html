<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/241242471d006c3.jpg?r=130303' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919683/psx-climbs-nearly-5800-points-amid-announcement-of-iran-israel-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>PSX climbs nearly 5800 points amid announcement of Iran-Israel ‘ceasefire’</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed by 5759.16 points after an earlier halt in trading on Tuesday, in the wake of  US President Donald Trump announcing a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day war.
The KSE-100 index climbed 5759.16 points by 2:20pm, or 4.96
per cent, to reach 121,926.63 points.
Earlier in the day, shares at the PSX had climbed by 5,878 points a few hours after it opened. It reached an earlier intraday high of 122,045.62 from the last close of 116,167.47 yesterday, before a market halt was intiated.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities attributed the rise to the overnight announcement of a ceasefire, with broad-based gains across sectors.
Farooq said, “The Pakistan market rallied earlier today following the overnight announcement of a ceasefire.
“However, reports during the day of Israeli claims that Iran has violated the ceasefire dampened sentiment, pulling the market down from an intraday high of 122,045.62 to 121,926.63 currently. Despite the pullback, local fundamentals remain intact, and the rally could resume if the ceasefire holds. Geopolitical developments will continue to drive market direction in the near term.
Global shares rallied and the dollar extended declines as a ceasefire to end a 12-day war between Iran and Israel came into effect, while oil prices dived to nearly two-week lows on easing concerns about supply disruptions, Reuters reported.
At 11:26am, a PSX notice informed that due to a 5pc increase in the KSE-30 index from the previous trading day close of the index, a market halt had been triggered as per PSX regulations and all equity and equity-based markets have been suspended accordingly.
The market reopened after a gap of an hour at 12:31pm.
Farooq explained, “If the KSE-30 Index moves ±5pc from the previous day’s close and remains at that level for five consecutive minutes, trading is stopped for 60 minutes.”
He added that this mechanism kicks into action whether the index rises by 5pc or falls by that margin to help cool the market down.
The PSX had endured a sharp sell-off on Monday, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — sparked by reported US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Tehran’s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz — sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering panic selling and wiping out more than 3,800 points from the benchmark KSE-100 index.
The Israeli government said it had achieved all its objectives in the war with Iran, and that it had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire after removing the “dual existential threat” of Tehran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Israel nonetheless warned it would “respond forcefully” to any Iranian violation of the truce.
Oil prices fell 5pc after Israel agreed to the proposal.
The ceasefire agreement, as outlined by Trump on social media in a surprise late-night post, would see the arch enemies stop firing in staggered phases.
According to Trump, Iran would unilaterally halt all operations beginning 4am GMT (9am PKT) on Tuesday, with Israel following suit 12 hours later.
After Trump’s announcement, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media that “as of now, there is no ‘agreement’ on ceasefire or cessation of military operations”.
However, he added that if Israel stopped “its illegal aggression”, Tehran would have “no intention to continue our response afterwards”.

Doshi died in London on Monday, Indian media reported.
The left-arm spinner was already in his thirties when he made his Test debut in 1979, and finished with 114 wickets in 33 matches.
Doshi also played 15 one-day internationals for India between 1980 and 1982.
Cricket veteran Sachin Tendulkar said Doshi was a “warm-hearted soul”, adding that he “will miss those cricketing conversations”.
Former all-rounder Ravi Shastri said that Doshi was “a gentleman to the core and a fine, fine bowler”.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) also paid tribute to the former spinner.
A bespectacled Doshi carried forward the Indian spin legacy started by the famous quartet of Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Srinivas Venkataraghavan and Bhagwath Chandrasekhar.
Doshi bamboozled world batsmen and played English County cricket, with a long stint with Nottinghamshire.</p><small>2025-06-24 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24114812802b2b6.png?r=115839' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919668/uk-plans-to-increase-control-over-google-in-search' target='_blank'><strong>UK plans to increase control over Google in search</strong></a><br><p>Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it was proposing to designate Google with “strategic market status” to give it greater control over how the United States tech giant operates search services, according to a report by Reuters.
According to a press release by the CMA, Britain’s competition regulator, Google search accounts for more than 90 per cent of all general search queries in the UK — with millions of people relying on it as a key gateway to the internet and more than 200,000 businesses in the UK relying on Google search advertising to reach their customers.
The CMA said that steps it could take include making it easier for users to access different search providers and ensuring fair ranking principles for businesses appearing on Google search.
It also proposed more transparency and control for publishers whose content appeared in search results if it goes ahead with the designation in October.
Google will be the first company designated since the regulator gained new powers this year.
 
 

“The UK’s new Digital Markets Competition Regime can help unlock opportunities for innovation and growth, by promoting competition in digital markets while protecting UK consumers and businesses from unfair or harmful practices,” the CMA said.
Google said the move could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in Britain.
“We’re concerned that the scope of the CMA’s considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided,” said Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director for competition.</p><small>2025-06-24 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/240747220115335.jpg?r=074930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919528/gligit-baltistan-govt-presents-rs1486-billion-budget-for-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>Gligit-Baltistan govt presents Rs148.6 billion budget for FY26</strong></a><br><p>• Region to receive Rs80bn in federal grant; size of ADP to be Rs22bn
• Opposition slams budget as ‘anti-poor’
GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan finance minister on Monday unveiled the region’s Rs148.63 billion budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
The budget was presented by Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate.
Addressing the session, Finance Minister Muhammad Ismail said Rs88.19bn has been allocated for non-development and Rs37bn billion for development expenditures.
As per the minister, the region will get Rs80bn in federal grant for the next financial year.
Moreover, Rs20bn has been allocated for the purchase of subsidised wheat. The size of Annual Development Plan will be Rs22bn, with Rs11bn allocated  for PSDP projects.
Moreover, Rs59.60bn has been allocated for the salaries of government employees; Rs28.29bn for service delivery and administrative matters, including health, education, basic facilities, peace and electricity supply; and Rs80 million for regional elections to be held in November.
Rs50m has been allocated for the health endowment fund.
The minister, Mr Ismail, said no funds have been allocated for new development projects in the next fiscal year to ensure the completion of ongoing schemes.
He claimed that for the first time, a coalition government in GB presented its second annual budget.
The aim of this budget is to esnure the welfare of people, he said, adding the government focused on health, education, power, local government and infrastructure development in the budget.
The region has limited revenue reso­urces and mostly relies on federal grants, the minister said, and stressed the need to increase revenue collection from local resources.
 
 

He said due to the region’s exemption status, the government can’t impose direct taxes.
Still, the revenue collection has increased by 45 per cent from last year, the minister claimed.
Despite financial difficulties and limited resources, GB is “on the path of development”.
According to the minister, Rs13.3m has been allocated for the rehabilitation of those affected by natural disasters. Rs45m will be spent on the benevolent fund and group insurance funds for the welfare of government employees.
Earlier, the opposition boycotted the budget session, calling the budget “anti-poor”.
Opposition Leader Kazim Mesum and other opposition members tore budget speech copies and chanted slogans against the government.
Published in Dawn, June 24th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-24 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24111221e5320c2.jpg?r=111226' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919657/supreme-court-lifts-limits-on-trump-deporting-migrants-to-countries-not-their-own' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court lifts limits on Trump deporting migrants to countries not their own</strong></a><br><p>The US Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for President Donald Trump’s administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harm they could face, handing him another victory in his aggressive pursuit of mass deportations.
In an action that prompted a sharp dissent from its three liberal justices, the court granted the administration’s request to lift a judicial order requiring that migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” get a “meaningful opportunity” to tell US officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out.
Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy had issued the order on April 18.
The Supreme Court’s brief order was unsigned and offered no reasoning, as is common when it decides emergency requests. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.
 
 

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the two other liberal justices, called the decision a “gross abuse” of the court’s power.
“Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,” Sotomayor wrote.
Sotomayor called the court’s action “as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.”
Murphy had found that the administration’s policy of “executing third-country removals without providing notice and a meaningful opportunity to present fear-based claims” likely violates the US Constitution’s due process protections. Due process generally requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking certain adverse actions.
After the Department of Homeland Security moved in February to step up rapid deportations to third countries, immigrant rights groups filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a group of migrants seeking to prevent their removal to such places without notice and to gain chance to assert the harms they could face.
Murphy on May 21 found the Trump administration violated his order requiring additional steps before attempting to send a group of migrants to politically unstable South Sudan, which the US State Department has urged Americans to avoid “due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.” The judge’s intervention prompted the US government to keep the migrants at a military base in Djibouti.
After the US Supreme Court ruling, Murphy in a court order made clear that his decision preventing the rapid deportation of eight men to South Sudan “remains in full force and effect.”
 
 

Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which helps represent the plaintiffs, called the ramifications of the court’s action “horrifying,” stripping away “critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.”
The administration told the Supreme Court that its third-country policy already complied with due process and is critical for removing migrants who commit crimes because their countries of origin are often unwilling to take them back. It said that all the South Sudan-destined migrants had committed “heinous crimes” in the United States, including murder, arson and armed robbery.
“The Supreme Court’s stay of a left-wing district judge’s injunction reaffirms the president’s authority to remove criminal illegal aliens from our country and Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said after Monday’s decision.
“Fire up the deportation planes,” said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.
A flood of cases
The dispute is one of many legal challenges to Trump policies to have reached the nation’s highest judicial body since he returned to office in January.
The Supreme Court in May let Trump end humanitarian programs for hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the United States temporarily. The justices, however, faulted the administration’s treatment of some migrants whom Trump targeted for removal under the Alien Enemies Act — a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime — as inadequate under constitutional due process protections.
Sotomayor said that in sending migrants to South Sudan, and in another instance four others to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on to El Salvador, the administration “openly flouted two court orders” issued by Murphy. Sotomayor also pointed to the separate Alien Enemies Act litigation in which questions were raised about the administration’s compliance with an order issued by a judge in that case.
“This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” Sotomayor wrote.
“Yet each time this court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”
The administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals on May 16 declined to put Murphy’s decision on hold.
Reuters has also reported that US officials had been considering sending migrants to Libya, another politically unstable country, despite previous US condemnation of Libya’s harsh treatment of detainees.</p><small>2025-06-24 06:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2313420739af6f8.jpg?r=134342' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919034/americas-many-wars-in-the-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>America’s (many) wars in the Middle East</strong></a><br><p>The year 1990 marked the beginning of America’s “endless wars” in the Middle East. It commenced with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  — before that, US military operations in the region had been short-term or temporary. In the years that followed, ‘coming back home’ for the superpower has become increasingly difficult.
Over two decades on, the US once again stood at one of its “biggest and riskiest foreign policy gamble”, as Reuters described it. On June 21, the US military bombed Iran’s nuclear sites on the orders of President Donald Trump, directly joining Israel’s war on its regional arch-nemesis.
“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” Trump said in a televised address from the White House, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.
“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” he added.
America’s B-2 bombers were involved in the strikes, a US official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity after reports earlier in the day said B-2 bombers — which carry so-called “bunker buster” bombs — were headed out of the US.
Tehran termed the US attacks a violation of international law, adding that it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”.
After 12 days of war, Trump, in a post on X last night, announced that a ceasefire had been reached between Iran and Israel. The Islamic Republic’s foreign minister said, however, that there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.
These recent developments have pushed the Middle East to the edge. The region holds its breath, waiting to see if the US move marks the end of the conflict or the beginning of the third world war. But the US is no stranger to such situations.
War on Lebanon (1982-83)
In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon while the latter was embroiled in a civil war. According to various reports, Tel Aviv’s military operation was designed to militarily and politically debilitate the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The group’s leader, Yasir Arafat, was based in Beirut at the time.
The war was immensely destructive, killing thousands of civilians and fighters.
By September, the US had entered the war, dispatching battleships USS John Rodgers and nuclear cruiser USS Virginia to the Lebanese shores. American gunboats engaged in the bombing of several targets, including the town of Suk Al-Gharb. The mission stretched for 17 months and left 262 US servicemen dead. The first US Marine to die during the war was killed while defusing a bomb in the same month.
“If Washington had been clearer-headed and braver, it could have prevented Mr Begin’s [then-Israel prime minister] adventure and saved thousands of lives,” wrote the Guardian.
On February 7, 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced the end of US participation in the peacekeeping force.
“Reagan’s decision to withdraw the Marines remains controversial. Supporters argue that it did not make sense to sacrifice American lives and resources to help resolve a conflict where the parties involved showed little interest in working toward US goals. Critics, however, claim that Reagan failed to stand firm against terrorism and demonstrated that the United States was an undependable ally,” according to the US Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute.

War on Libya (1986 and 2011)
In April 1986, the United States launched air strikes on Libya against ‘‘terrorist centres’’ and military bases, the New York Times reported. In a speech broadcast nationally, Reagan said the American forces had “succeeded” in retaliating against Libya for what he called the “reign of terror” waged by Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader.
The American attacks were mounted by 14 A-6E Navy attack jets based in the Mediterranean and 18 F-111 bombers from bases in England. In the months that followed, US air and naval forces carried out a series of strikes on the Libyan capital, Tripoli, resulting in the deaths of at least 40 civilians, including Gaddafi’s daughter.
One of the targets was Colonel Gaddafi’s personal residential compound on the grounds of the Bab al-Aziziya army barracks. Forewarned, Colonel Gaddafi escaped unharmed, according to the New York Times.
Operation El Dorado Canyon, as it was code-named, was deemed a success by US officials. In subsequent years, America continued to keep a close eye on Libya, targeting it again.

In 2011, a Nato military coalition led by the US, Britain and France intervened in the Libyan civil war with airstrikes and a naval blockade. The objective? To protect civilian lives. But as the New York Times reported, “ […] the effect was to tip the balance in the fighting in favour of anti-Gaddafi forces, who ultimately drove him from power and killed him“.
Subsequent attempts to form a civilian government in Libya failed, with another civil war breaking out in 2014. Over the next two years, American warplanes carried out a series of strikes to target “Islamic state leader and Tunisian terrorists taking refuge in the anarchy of post-Gaddafi Libya”.
The Iraq War (1991-2011)
The Persian Gulf War, codenamed Operation Desert Storm, began in 1991 after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion and occupation of Kuwait in August 1990. This prompted neighbouring Arab countries to call for US intervention.
The Iraqi invasion was immediately condemned by then-President George HW Bush. A few months on, a fleet of US Air Force fighter jets, accompanied by Nato troops, began arriving in Saudi Arabia. By September, the UN Security Council authorised the use of “all necessary means” of force against Iraq if it failed to withdraw from Kuwait by January 1991.

On January 17, 1991, a massive US-led air offensive hit Iraq. The war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands and the establishment of US military bases in the Gulf. It also sowed the seeds of many other military interventions in the following years, the impact of which can be felt in the region even today.
With the Iraqi resistance collapsing, Bush declared a ceasefire in February, ending the Persian Gulf War. In all, an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Iraqi forces were killed.
However, following the 9/11 attacks, the US once again fixated its guns on Iraq with President George W Bush calling for the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq in 2002. The US claimed it had intelligence that the country possessed or was developing weapons of mass destruction. By the next year, Bush demanded that Saddam Hussein step down from power and leave Iraq within 48 hours. Hussein’s refusal to do so led to the second Persian Gulf War, popularly known as the Iraq War.
Saddam Hussein was captured by US forces on December 13, 2003, and executed on December 30, 2006, for “committing crimes against humanity”. The United States would not formally withdraw from Iraq until December 2011.

War on Afghanistan (2001-2021)
After the 9/11 attacks, the US announced its war on terror, and Afghanistan was its biggest target. On October 7, 2001, a US-led coalition began attacks on Afghanistan with an intense bombing campaign by American and British forces — a conflict that would span two decades and become the longest war in US history.
Codenamed “Operation Enduring Freedom”, the invasion of Afghanistan was aimed at targeting Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda. The invasion began with the bombardment of Taliban and al-Qaeda installations in Kabul, Kandahar, Jalalabad, Konduz and Mazar-i-Sharif.

The aerial attacks were followed by a ground invasion. On November 12, Taliban officials and their forces retreated from Kabul, and a month later, the last Taliban stronghold, Kandahar, too, had fallen. By 2002, a transitional government led by Hamid Karzai was established in Kabul.
However, as the US focus from Afghanistan shifted to Iraq, the Taliban got a chance to regroup. Subsequently, in 2008, Bush decided to send additional soldiers to Afghanistan, with the number of US troops rising to 48,500 by mid-2008.
 
 

When Barack Obama assumed the presidency, this number reached an all-time high of 100,000. However, after the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011, Obama announced that the US would begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. However, some back and forth was seen regarding the same in the following years until 2021, when the Taliban and the Trump administration reached an agreement for US troops to fully withdraw by 2021 in exchange for stopping attacks against US forces and cutting ties with al-Qaeda.
By August of the same year, the Taliban entered Kabul, and all US troops exited Afghanistan.
Syrian war (2011)
In 2011, what started as a protest movement spiralled into a civil war in Syria against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. When the situation worsened, the US intervened, with President Obama and Western allies explicitly calling on Assad to stand down.
What followed were sanctions on the Syrian government and the US ambassador leaving the country.

In 2013, Washington said that the Assad regime had carried out a chemical attack near Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people. The attack prompted Obama to mull striking Syria, but he pulled out last minute and instead agreed to a deal with Moscow, which was aimed at dismantling Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal, according to Al Jazeera.
A year later, however, US and Arab allies launched air raids in Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group, expanding a campaign underway in neighbouring Iraq at the time. In 2017, when Trump came to power, US forces fired a barrage of missiles at the Shayrat airbase, which was said to be the launch site of a chemical attack that resulted in the killing of 88 people.
A year later, the US launched fresh attacks after an alleged Syrian government chemical attack on the then-rebel-held town of Douma killed 40 people.
Then, in 2018, Trump announced the withdrawal of the roughly 2,000 US troops in Syria because ISIL had been “defeated”. However, a year later, a suicide attack claimed by ISIL killed four US servicemen and 15 others at a restaurant in northern Syria in what was termed as the deadliest attack on US forces.
Later the same year, the US announced that its forces would withdraw from Syria to make way for a “long-planned operation” by Turkish forces — a decision that caused an uproar in Washington.
War on Yemen
Yemen has remained a Western target for a while now. But drone strikes on Yemen became frequent under the Obama and Trump administrations, according to the Middle East Eye.
 
 

These attacks often took place through the use of the US military drone programme, and were justified as part of the US ‘war on terror’, particularly to target al-Qaeda operatives. The US also aided Saudi Arabia in its bombing of the Houthis.
In December 2023, the US initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian in response to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, which began following Israel’s invasion of Gaza. By 2024, the Biden administration re-designated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group.

Witnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel.
Israel’s military said six waves of missiles were launched by Iran and Israel’s national ambulance service said four people were killed in Beersheba, the first reported deaths in Israel since Trump announced the ceasefire late on Monday.
Trump said on Tuesday a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was now in place and asked both countries not to violate it, only hours after Iran launched waves of missiles, which Israel’s ambulance service said killed four people.
“The ceasefire is now in effect. Please do not violate it!” he said in a Truth Social post.
Earlier, a senior White House official said Trump had brokered a ceasefire deal in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel had agreed so long as Iran did not launch further attacks.
“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR’,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site.
 


An Iranian official earlier confirmed that Tehran had agreed to a ceasefire, but the country’s foreign minister said there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.
Abbas Araqchi said early on Tuesday that if Israel stopped its “illegal aggression” against the Iranian people no later than 4am Tehran time (5:30am PKT) on Tuesday, Iran had no intention of continuing its response afterwards.
“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,” Araqchi added in a post on X.
 






Trump appeared to suggest that Israel and Iran would have some time to complete any missions that are underway, at which point the ceasefire would begin in a staged process.
Iran’s semi-official SNN news agency reported on Tuesday that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.
Israel, joined by the United States on the weekend, has carried out attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, after alleging Tehran was getting close to obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies ever having a nuclear weapons program but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that if it wanted to, world leaders “wouldn’t be able to stop us”.
Israel, which is not a party to the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran’s agreement during a call with Iranian officials, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Tuesday.
US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were in direct and indirect contact with the Iranians, a White House official said.
Neither Irans UN mission nor the Israeli embassy in Washington responded to separate requests for comment from Reuters.
Hours earlier, three Israeli officials had signaled Israel was looking to wrap up its campaign in Iran soon and had passed the message on to the United States.
Netanyahu had told government ministers whose discussions ended early on Tuesday not to speak publicly, Israel’s Channel 12 television reported.
Markets reacted favourably to the news. S&P 500 futures rose 0.4 per cent late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday.
US crude futures fell in early Asian trading hours on Tuesday to their lowest level in more than a week after Trump said a ceasefire had been agreed, relieving worries of supply disruption in the region.
End to the fighting?
There did not appear to be calm yet in the region.
The Israeli military issued two evacuation warnings in less than two hours to residents of areas in the Iranian capital Tehran, one late on Monday and one early on Tuesday.
Israeli Army radio reported early on Tuesday that alarms were activated in the southern Golan Heights area due to fears of hostile aircraft intrusion.
Earlier on Monday, Trump said he would encourage Israel to proceed towards peace after dismissing Iran’s attack on an American air base that caused no injuries and thanking Tehran for the early notice of the strikes.
He said Iran fired 14 missiles at the US air base, calling it “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered”.
Iran’s handling of the attack recalled earlier clashes with the United States and Israel, with Tehran seeking a balance between saving face with a military response but without provoking a cycle of escalation it can’t afford.
Iran’s attack came after US bombers dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Iranian underground nuclear facilities at the weekend, joining Israel’s air war.
Much of Tehran’s population of 10 million has fled after days of bombing.
The Trump administration maintains that its aim was solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, not to open a wider war.
“Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,” Vice President JD Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier.”
“Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it,” Vance said.
Trump has cited intelligence reports that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon, without elaborating.
However, US intelligence agencies said earlier this year they assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and a source with access to US intelligence reports told Reuters last week that that assessment hadn’t changed.
In a social media post on Sunday, Trump spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Israel, however, had made clear that its strikes on Evin prison — a jail for housing political prisoners — and other targets in Tehran were intended to hit the Iranian ruling apparatus broadly, and its ability to sustain power.</p><small>2025-06-24 05:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24104136282e6ab.jpg?r=104446' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919571/dawnmedia-oup-partner-for-new-initiative' target='_blank'><strong>DawnMedia,  OUP partner for new initiative</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: DawnMedia, under its climate change initiative Breathe Pakistan, has announced the ‘Mycelium Warrior Competition’  in collaboration with Oxford University Press Pakistan (OUP).

The incident prompted a complete shutter down strike, drawing thousands of locals to streets.
According to local sources, the quadcopter attack occurred last Friday, targeting schoolchildren. In response, residents staged a massive demonstration in Makeen Bazaar.
Hundreds of protesters, including tribal elders, youth and members of the victims’ families, gathered in front of the security forces’ office, holding a jirga to voice their outrage over the continued quadcopter operations in civilian areas.
Addressing the gathering, PTI MNA Zubair Wazir and tribal leaders Malik Bashir and Malik Riaz condemned the recurring suspected quadcopter strikes in tribal regions. “Innocent civilians – especially children, women, and the elderly – are being targeted regularly. These attacks are eroding the already fragile trust between state institutions and the local population,” they said.
They stressed that the tribal people were peace-loving and patriotic citizens, who have suffered immensely due to terrorism. “Instead of further punishment, they deserve compassion and rehabilitation,” the speakers added.
Tribal elders held negotiations with top security officials. However, according to sources, the talks ended inconclusively. In light of this, tribal representatives announced a jirga of all Mehsud tribes to be convened in Makeen on July 10 to determine the collective response and future course of action.
The incident is the third reported quadcopter strike in the region within the past two weeks. The first occurred in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan, injuring 23 people, including several children. A second attack targeted the district headquarters in Ladha, damaging residential quarters of the additional deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner, though no casualties were reported.
The latest and deadliest strike took place in Makeen on Friday, directly hitting schoolchildren.
Security forces and the district administration officials have attributed these attacks to terrorist elements. Security officials claim that the perpetrators are operating independently and are not affiliated with state agencies. “Terrorists possess and operate multiple quadcopter drones,” sources said, citing previous attacks on military checkposts that resulted in casualties among security personnel.
Officials from both the civil and military administrations condemned the targeting of innocent civilians, calling it a deeply regrettable act. They reiterated their solidarity with the affected families.

• Accuses Israel of repeating false claims about Iran’s nuclear weapons to manipulate American policy
ISLAMABAD: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday vociferously condemned the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, noting that the Israeli government was forcing the American public into a war that the people do not support.
“This is done through the same lie that was peddled to the American public before the Iraq war in 2003. Now it has been claimed that Iran is the one with weapons of mass destruction,” he said while speaking in the National Assembly.
The PPP chairman said that after decades of repeating the same lie—that Iran was just days away from developing nuclear weapons, a claim made by the Israeli prime minister in 1996, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2023, 2024, and 2025 — Israel’s regime has finally attacked Iran under the pretext of this falsehood, which he deeply regretted.
Condemning the attack on Iran, he said the strike was in violation of international law. “Military leadership of Iran was targeted not on the frontlines or the battlefield, but while they slept in their homes, resulting in the loss of not only their lives but the loss of lives of other innocent civilians. Not only military personnel, but scientists, journalists and media institutions have been targeted.”
“Any attack on nuclear facilities is not just a potential attack on Iran; if there is any radiaton, it would have consequences for all neighbouring countries in the region, including Pakistan,” he observed. He called on the government to mobilise the foreign minister to form a group of like-minded counterparts who not only oppose the conflict but also represent countries whose people are at risk.
 
 

Quoting a poem written in the context of World War II, Chairman Bilawal said: “First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.
“Since October 2023, we have seen a genocidal, apartheid-imposing expansionist regime conducting and ever-expanding war which has the potential to drag us all into World War III. This time, first they came for the Palestinians but the world did not speak out because they weren’t Palestinian. Then they came for the Lebanese, but we did not speak out because we were not Lebanese.
“Then they came for the Yemenis but we did not speak out because we are not from Yemen. Now they have come for Iran. If we do not speak out, there will be no one left when they come for us,” Chairman Bilawal said.
The Israeli regime’s aggression across the region must be stopped, we want to see the day when we can all live in peace. We can only start working towards that peace if the Netanyahu regime is stopped from its illegal war with Iran, forced to abide by the terms of its withdrawal and ceasefire in Lebanon and end its apartheid and genocide in Palestinian lands. As it continues to bomb Iran, the world must not forget that this Israeli Netanyahu regime is carrying out forced starvation of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip“ he said.
Cheaper copy of Netanyahu
Chiding India, he said that in South Asia too, there was a cheaper copy of Netanyahu. “We can say with pride that this cheaper version was defeated militarily, diplomatically and in terms of narrative”, he remarked.
The former foreign minister further said that when India violated the rights of Kashmiris in 2019, the then-PM of Pakistan had expressed helplessness. “This time, when Kashmir was attacked, and Pakistan was attacked, we did not bow or succumb to fear; we fought a war and won.”
Referring to the unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) by India as water terrorism, he said the treaty even today was binding on India and Pakistan. “If India decides to implement this threat, we would have to fight another war.”
Share for south Punjab
He stated that the PPP had specific goals it hoped to achieve in this budget, but they could not be fulfilled.
The former foreign minister said that during consultations with the government, the PPP had desired for south Punjab to get its 30 per cent share from the PSDP. “While this was not possible in the current round of negotiations, we were assured that the next budget would allow us to bridge this discrepancy,” he said.
He further stated that another objective of the PPP was to ensure that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan receive federal funding as they are the most vulnerable to terrorism.
Expressing his disappointment, he said that agriculture was the backbone of our economy, but the government’s policies were impairing it.
“We were also compelled to not set a support price or procure from our farmers. Where should the farmers go? At this point, we cannot justify the losses we have incurred as a result of our own policies on the agricultural front. As a result of these decisions, we have sustained a damage worth Rs800 billion when it comes to the wheat crop.” He said that the total wheat loss for the farmers of Sindh has amounted to Rs150bn, including Rs24bn for Larkana, Rs26bn for Sukkur, Rs30bn for Shaheed Benazirabad, Rs22bn for Hyderabad, Rs10bn for Mirpurkhas, Rs12bn for Karachi, and Rs4bn each for Sajawal and Thatta.
Mr Bhutto advised the PTI to shun the politics of opposition for the sake of opposition, talk to the government and make positive proposals so that a positive impact can be felt by the people.
He said that a change in strategy can not only benefit the PTI, but also the whole country.

Earlier this year there were briefly fears that the 60-metre-wide (200-foot-wide) asteroid called 2024 YR4, which is big enough to level a city, would strike Earth on Dec 22, 2032.
It was given the highest chance — 3.1 percent — of hitting our home planet that scientists have ever measured for such a giant space rock. Subsequent observations from telescopes definitively ruled out a direct hit on Earth.
However, the odds that it will crash into the Moon have risen to 4.3pc, according to data from the James Webb space telescope in May. A new preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed, is the first to estimate how such a collision could affect Earth.
It would be the largest asteroid to hit the Moon in around 5,000 years, lead study author Paul Wiegert of Canada’s University of Western Ontario said. The impact would be  “comparable to a large nuclear explosion in terms of the amount of energy released”, he added.
Up to 100 million kilograms (220 million pounds) of material would shoot out from the Moon’s surface, according to a series of simulations run by the researchers. If the asteroid hit the side of the Moon facing Earth — which is roughly a 50-pc chance — up to 10pc of this debris could be pulled in by Earth’s gravity over the following days, they said.
‘Like a bullet’
Earth’s atmosphere would protect the surface from the millimetre- to centimetre-sized lunar rocks, Weigert said. 0.04-2.54 But these meteors could be capable of destroying some satellites — and there are expected to be a lot more of those orbiting the planet by 2032. “A centimetre-sized rock travelling at tens of thousands of metres per second is a lot like a bullet,” Wiegert said.
In the days after the impact, there could be more than 1,000 times the normal number of meteors threatening Earth’s satellites, he added. Meanwhile, those of us on the ground would be treated to a  “spectacular” meteor shower lighting up the night sky, the study said.
But the current odds of a direct hit on the near side of the Moon remain at just two percent, Wiegert emphasised. The asteroid is not expected to be visible again until 2028, so the world will have to wait to find out more.
If a direct hit is eventually found to be likely, humanity probably has enough time to plan a mission to spare the Moon. “I’m sure it will be considered,” Wiegert said. The asteroid is half as wide and has 10pc of the mass of Dimorphos, which Nasa’s DART mission smashed into in 2022, successfully changing its trajectory.
If 2024 YR4 is on a collision course with the Moon, it would be  “a good target” for another test of our planetary defences, Wiegert said. But if not, trying to deflect something zooming so close to Earth could be a little  “dangerous”, he added. The preprint study, which published on the arXiv database last week, has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

The prime minister made these remarks during a meeting with Min­ister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik, who was part of the delegation. Mr Malik briefed the prime minister on the delegation’s diplomatic engagements and outcomes of the tour.
The two leaders also discussed government climate policies, as well as recent diplomatic efforts undertaken in the wake of heightened tensions between Pakistan and India.
During the meeting, the prime minister was also briefed on the initiatives taken by the Ministry of Climate Change to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change under the government’s ongoing programmes.

Minister briefs premier on diplomatic engagements, outcomes of the tour

During its overseas visits, the delegation had urged the international community to support dialogue betwe­­en Pakistan and India, stressing that sustained communication was essential to curbing regional instability.
 
 

The delegation emphasised the urgent need for a structured dialogue process, warning that the absence of communication between the two nuclear-armed neighbours only emboldens terrorist elements and exacerbates regional insecurity.
During their engagements with officials from the United States, the United Kingdom and European Union, the delegation conveyed Pakistan’s position that India was attempting to politicise terrorism to damage Pakistan’s global reputation.
The prime minister was informed that, despite India’s aggressive lobbying efforts to undermine Pakistan’s progress on the Financial Action Task Force front, Islamabad had successfully transitioned from the FATF grey list to the white list.
Pakistan’s delegation also strongly criticised what it described as “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dangerous doctrine of escalation”, calling it a threat to peace and stability in the region.
 
 

Delegates further highlighted that Pakistan has borne the brunt of terrorism far more than India — suffering attacks ten times greater in number — many of which, they claimed, could be traced back to Indian funding or involvement.
The delegation also conveyed a firm message that Pakistan will not compromise on its share of water and will take all necessary steps to ensure its people receive their rightful allocation from all six rivers, including the River Indus.

India recently re-entered the international rice market after a two-year hiatus imposed to ensure domestic food security. The lifting of export bans by New Delhi generated considerable excitement in Indian media, which predicted a significant economic blow to Pakistan’s rice exports, which had been performing robustly in the interim.
 
 

For the three months preceding India’s return (July to September 2024), Pakistan’s rice exports averaged a strong 550,000 tonnes per month. Indian officials, trade bodies, and think tanks anticipated that a surge in cheaper Indian rice would undercut Pakistan’s global market share.
However, Pakistani exporters countered with a swift, quality-centric strategy, avoiding a direct price war and instead focusing on premium offerings. According to sector expert Hamid Malik, this approach paid off as India’s re-entry failed to significantly disrupt Pakistan’s rice trade in the following six months (October 2024 to March 2025).

New Delhi’s cheap rice strategy faces WTO heat, market blowback

Pakistan retained its foothold in high-end markets such as the United Kingdom and European Union while also serving price-sensitive African destinations through a calibrated quality approach. Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics shows rice exports for the first 11 months of FY25 stood at 5.544 million tonnes, compared to 5.593m tonnes a year earlier — a marginal decline of just 0.87pc.
Falling production
Yet, a new challenge looms. A 3.7pc drop in rice output during Kharif 2024 has led to rapid depletion of stocks since April 2025. As a result, rice exports for the final quarter (April–June 2025) are projected to fall by around 15pc due to tight inventory.
Meanwhile, India continues to offer both Basmati and non-Basmati rice at what industry insiders describe as “throwaway” prices. At $349 per tonne (FOB), India is currently the cheapest exporter of 25pc broken non-Basmati rice — undercutting Thailand ($376), Vietnam ($362), and Pakistan ($365).
This aggressive pricing has raised eyebrows, given India’s government-set Minimum Support Price (MSP) for non-Basmati paddy stands at $265 per tonne. With a 66pc milling recovery, the ex-mill cost comes to $330 per tonne, and when factoring in transportation, port handling, packaging and wharfage — around $55 — the actual FOB cost is closer to $385. This discrepancy suggests deep, potentially WTO-incompatible subsidies.
In fact, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have lodged complaints with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), alleging that India’s export strategy violates the Doha Agreement by exceeding the allowed 10pc subsidy threshold.
Despite its subsidised push, India’s rice exports declined sharply in April and May 2025 — falling 50pc year-on-year. The downturn has drawn criticism from within India. Prominent voices such as rice historian and author Chandrasakhran, as well as exporters, have questioned the government’s policy, pointing to rice diversion for ethanol, swelling stocks at the Food Corporation of India (39m tonnes of rice and 19.5m tonnes of paddy), inefficiencies in the Public Distribution System, and the removal of the Minimum Export Price (MEP).
As global scrutiny of India’s subsidy-driven strategy intensifies, Pakistan’s exporters are cautiously monitoring developments — focused on safeguarding their gains through quality, adaptability, and disciplined market targeting.

Speaking during a budget session of the KP Assembly, chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, CM Gandapur alleged that the Centre was deliberately trying to delay the KP budget in an attempt to trigger a financial crisis in the province.
Consulting with the PTI founder on the KP budget was their democratic right, but despite repeated requests over 21 days, no meeting was arranged with Imran Khan, he regretted. “If you can’t arrange our meeting, then admit that this isn’t your government. Either acknowledge that someone else is running this  government or stop calling yourself democratic.”
CM Gandapur said a government could only be brought down under two conditions — financial instability and a deteriorating law and order situation. However, he said the PTI-led KP government had overcome financial hurdles despite repeated obstacles created by the Centre.
The chief minister lamented that drone attacks continued despite being repeatedly condemned on the floor of the house. “Since they have no other option left, they now want to stop us from passing the budget and declare a financial emergency in the province. We will never let them succeed in their conspiracies.”
Mr Gandapur alleged that the PTI was systematically attacked and that all state institutions and powers had jointly decided to eliminate Imran Khan and his party.
The chief minister alleged that PTI’s mandate was stolen in three provinces and at the federal level, and that no one was able to produce Form-45. He pointed out that the Rawalpindi commissioner had confessed to altering the results of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections.
He accused the members of political parties who were part of the interim government — and are now part of the federal government — of abusing power and targeting PTI candidates during the Feb 8 polls.
“They instructed ISI, MI, and the police to pick up their opponents. PTI candidates were abducted and tortured,” Mr Gandapur alleged, adding that he himself had been picked up before May 9, 2023 and was tortured to issue a statement against Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi.
Mr Gandapur also referred to the judges’ letters alleging pressure, saying that no action had been taken on those complaints. He reiterated that only Imran Khan had the authority to order the dissolution of the KP Assembly. “As soon as Mr Khan gives the order, I will not waste a moment and dissolve the assembly.”
Since PTI holds a majority in the KP Assembly, Mr Gandapur said, they reserved the right to amend the budget as per the directives of their party founder.
The chief minister added that the province had collected Rs65 billion from its own resources over 76 years. However, due to Mr Khan’s policies, KP’s revenue rose to Rs93bn and is projected to reach Rs129bn during the fiscal year 2025-26.
He criticised the federal government for failing to release Rs43bn under the Accelerated Impleme­ntation Programme for the merged districts, saying that only Rs6bn had been paid.

• 20pc tax proposed on profits from investments in government securities
• FED of Rs10 imposed on one day-old chicks
• No changes to voluntary pension regime; tax on pensions won’t apply to commutation & gratuity amounts
ISLAMABAD: As the government announced a modest tax relief for the lower income slabs, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday introduced three new tax measures in the National Assembly to offset its revenue impact — part of the country’s ongoing commitment to remain within the fiscal parameters agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In his winding-up speech, Mr Aurangzeb informed the National Assembly that the proposed measures aim to offset the revenue shortfall resulting from the tax relief, while ensuring that the industrial and commercial sectors are not subjected to additional burden.
As part of three new revenue measures, the government has proposed raising the tax rate on income derived from the debt portion of dividends issued by mutual funds to companies — from 25 per cent to 29pc. The revision aligns this category with the tax rate already applied to other corporate income streams.
A 20pc tax has been proposed on profits earned by corporations and companies through investments in government securities — underscoring the government’s broader objective of expanding credit access for the private sector.
Additionally, a federal excise duty (FED) of Rs10 has been imposed on one-day-old chicks, aimed at ensuring the poultry industry contributes its due share to national revenue.
Mr Aurangzeb stated that the government initially proposed reducing the tax rate from 5pc to 2.5pc for annual incomes between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. However, following the prime minister’s directive, the rate was brought down to 1pc for this income bracket.
He also clarified a misperception stemming from his budget speech, where it was mistakenly inferred that the proposed tax on pensions would also apply to commutation and gratuity amounts. He said that that would not be the case. It was also clarified that there would be no changes in the taxation of voluntary pension scheme.
The minister said that the tax will only apply to individuals receiving annual pensions exceeding Rs10 million, while pensioners above the age of 75 are entirely exempt from any form of taxation.
He also informed the lower house that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) powers related to tax fraud have been reassessed, in line with proposed amendments in the Finance Bill.
Under the revised framework, tax fraud cases are now classified as either ‘cognisable’ or ‘non-cognisable’. For cases involving alleged tax fraud of up to Rs500m, the FBR will no longer be empowered to make arrests without a court-issued warrant.
Furthermore, any arrest under this provision must meet at least one of the following criteria: the accused has deliberately failed to respond to three official notices; the individual has attempted to evade investigation; or there is evidence of record tampering.
The minister clarified that, even in such instances, arrest authorization will not rest with a single officer, rather must be approved by a three-member high-level committee within the FBR. Any individual taken into custody would have to be presented before a special judge within 24 hours.
Mr Aurangzeb also informed the National Assembly that the amount of sales tax proposed on solar power equipment had now been reduced to 10pc. However, he said, this tax will apply to only 46pc of imported components, resulting in a modest 4.6pc increase in the overall price of imported solar panels.
The original Finance Bill also proposed curbs on large asset purchases by undocumented individuals.
However, these restrictions will not apply to residential properties valued up to Rs50 million, commercial plots or properties up to Rs100 million, and vehicles priced up to Rs7 million.
Additionally, under existing law, capital gains tax will not be levied on the sale of property held for more than six years, provided the asset was acquired before July 1, 2024.
 
 

The minister said that such property will be subjected to 4.5-6pc withholding tax on purchase, which he said was generally reimbursed upon filing returns. To give relief, property that was in personal use for 15 years or more would not be subject to this withholding tax.
The government has proposed levying a sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn, in a bid to narrow the price disparity between imported and locally produced goods, while bolstering the domestic agriculture sector.

The move came as several Middle Eastern and international carriers suspended their operations across the Gulf region.
 






The announcement follows a closure of airspace by Qatar and Bahrain as Iran attacked the Al-Udeid US military base in Doha.
However, Qatar reopen­­ed its airspace early on Tuesday. Qatar Airways said that it had temporarily cancelled flights to and from Iraq, Iran and Syria.
 






Airspace over the UAE — a hub for airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and flydubai — is also closed based on flight paths and air traffic control audio, according to a post by FlightRadar.
Emirates said that it had temporarily suspen­ded flights to and from Tehran and Iraq (Baghdad and Basra) until June 30. Etihad said that it had cancelled flights between Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv until July 15.
Flydubai said that it had temporarily suspended flights to and from Iran, Iraq, Israel and Syria until June 30.
Kuwait Airways also suspended flight departures from the country due to regional developments, it said in a post on X.
Russia’s Aeroflot said that it had cancelled flights between Moscow and Tehran, and made changes to other routes in the Middle East.
Lufthansa said that it had suspended all flights to and from Beirut until and including June 30 and to and from Tel Aviv and Tehran until and including July 31.
The Turkish airline Pega­sus said that it had cancelled flights to Iran until July 30 and flights to Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan until June 30.

The assembly session, presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, continued late into Monday night, concluding the debate on the budget.
During the session, opposition’s legislators urged the government to ensure an equitable distribution of PSDP funds for development schemes suggested by them.
They identified corruption as the province’s most significant challenge, warning that without effective controls, the substantial budget would be squandered.
“The biggest issue of the province is corruption and if corruption is not controlled, the biggest budget of the province would go to waste,” opposition members said.
Conversely, members of the treasury benches lauded the budget, asserting that its significant allocations would help alleviate the province’s backwardness. They refuted the opposition’s claims of non-consultation.
“CM Bugti had taken all coalition partners and opposition parties on board on the budget and provided more funds for the opposition members’ constituencies,” treasury members said.
They also noted it was “the first government against whom no protest was witnessed outside the assembly during the budget session”.
Former chief minister Dr Malik Baloch highlighted pressing provincial and international concerns.
“Iran is facing Israeli aggression and in this hard time Pakistan should extend all help to Iran [but] Pakistan should not jump into this war,” he said.
He identified corruption and price hikes critical domestic issues, noting that “in Turbat chicken is being sold at Rs1000 per kg”.
Dr Baloch said: “The government must take steps for controlling corruption. Otherwise the huge budget will be lost.”
He also addressed the issue of missing persons, saying:  “The missing persons issue is important and the state should play a positive role in resolving it and also release all arrested political leaders.”
Dr Baloch claimed schemes he proposed for the PSDP were excluded, calling it “unfair to the people of my constituency”.
 
 

Provincial Minister for Public Health Engineering Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran described the budget as “a balanced document”, affirming the government’s commitment to improving facilities in health, education, and other sectors.
Minister for Communication and Works Mir Saleem Khosa said: “No negative thing was included in the budget,” and added that “the government has provided more funds for the opposition constituencies”.
He further remarked that the current administration “had released 98 percent PSDP allocations before the end of financial year”.
Other members, including Mir Asghar Rind and Raheela Durrani, also characterised the budget as balanced, reiterating that the chief minister had engaged with all coalition partners and opposition parties during its preparation.

The session was marked by the absence of opposition lawmakers. A three-member ministerial committee sent by Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar to bring them in informed the House of their refusal to attend, resulting in the suspension of Question Hour and call-attention notices.
Raising a point of order, PML-N’s regional president Shah  Ghulam Qadir questioned under what legal or constitutional authority the House was debating a budget that had already been passed through suspension of rules. He contended that without a resolution or the finance committee’s report on the agenda, no further discussion was permissible.

Assembly session marked by absence of opposition lawmakers

Speaker Akbar supported Mr Qadir’s argument, saying there was no procedural basis for debate after approval.
Law Minister Mian Abdul Waheed, however, said that the rules had only been suspended for a day. He argued that since the finance bill was still under consideration and the prime minister had yet to deliver his budget speech, members retained the right to offer suggestions and feedback.
Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq also defended the session, saying the budget process was not yet final until the finance bill was passed. He asserted that the Assembly operated under both rules and parliamentary traditions and welcomed constructive input from all lawmakers.
“This House is governed by rules of procedure. Debate and dissent are integral to its function. Since only the two-day interval rule was suspended, there’s no bar on discussion now,” he said.
Mr Haq said that supplementary grants continued throughout the year and that valid proposals from lawmakers could still be incorporated. He stressed that both opposition and treasury members had equal access to development allocations and representation.
Mr Qadir responded that while his party was part of the coalition and its ministers had supported the budget in cabinet, it was his constitutional responsibility to highlight procedural violations.
“We’re not here to be pushed around. Majority doesn’t mean unbridled power. The Assembly must have a formal agenda,” he said.
He challenged the law minister to cite any article allowing debate on a post-approved budget, accusing the government of rushing the process for a third consecutive year. “This is not a democratic practice,” he said.
In response, PM Haq noted that in the absence of explicit provisions, the Speaker’s ruling carried authority and traditions helped fill procedural gaps.
“Both Mr Qadir and I have served as Speaker. We know how long a point of order can stretch,” he added.
Resolution on Islamabad airport
Meanwhile,  the House ‘unanimously’ passed a resolution tabled by Minister for  Social Welfare and Women Development, Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi, calling for the renaming of the New Islamabad International Airport after the late prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
Mr Naqvi argued that the previous Islamabad airport had been named after Ms Bhutto, and the removal of her name following the construction of the new facility was unjust.
“When an institution bears someone’s name, that should continue even after renovation or relocation,” he said.
His cabinet colleague Sardar Javed Ayoub supported the resolution, terming it timely, especially since Ms Bhutto’s 72nd birth anniversary was observed just two days ago.
The Speaker declared the resolution unanimously adopted and directed that its copies be sent to all national and provincial assembly speakers, the Senate chairman, and the prime minister. The session was then adjourned until Tuesday.

• Speaker briefly suspends proceedings; reconciliation on both sides saves members from punitive action
• FBR arrest powers restricted to tax frauds of over Rs50m
 • Non-filers allowed to buy homes worth Rs50m, cars worth Rs7m                              
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly session on Monday broke into a disarray as government and opposition members hurled abuses at each other, with some getting into physical brawls.
The rowdy scenes overshadowed the finance minister’s speech — to formally close the budget session — in which he announced several changes to budget proposals, including more checks on FBR’s powers to arrest tax defaulters and relaxation for non-filers to purchase assets.
The situation in the house became so tense that Speaker Ayaz Sadiq briefly suspended the session as his entreaties for restraint fell on deaf ears.
Sergeant-at-arms, the parliament’s security men, had to be called but they too failed to break the scuffles between angry opposition and government lawmakers.
The tempers in the house flared when opposition lawmakers interrupted the speech of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his remarks about jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
In turn, the PPP lawmakers opposed the speaker’s decision to give the floor to leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan.
The first altercation broke out between PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi and PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi amid loud protests and chants from both sides. The war of words soon turned physical with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle pushing and shoving each other near the speaker’s podium.
Speaker Sadiq warned members that such behaviour “would not be tolerated in the House”.
“This is a place for debate, not brawls,” he said while admonishing the lawmakers.
The second scuffle took place between PTI’s Nisar Jatt and PPP’s Agha Rafiullah after the former called Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s recent foreign visit a “junket for recreation and not for diplomacy”.
The sergeant-at-arms and deputy sergeant-at-arms who tried to separate the two members were allegedly abused and thrashed by some opposition lawmakers.
The irate speaker decided to punish four opposition lawmakers but decided not to after both sides held a two-hour-long meeting in his chamber, sources told Dawn.
Later, members from both sides of the aisle apologised for their remarks and actions.
FBR’s arrest powers
Amid the commotion, the finance minister announced the government has decided to restrict the arrest powers granted to FBR officers over alleged tax frauds. The powers, which allowed FBR officers to investigate tax fraud and make arrests, had made businesspersons and lawmakers apprehensive, who warned the excessive authority would be used to victimise taxpayers. 
As per the government’s proposal, assistant or deputy commissioners could arrest tax defaulters after seeking approval from the commissioner.
However, after opposition from businesspeople and lawmakers, the prime minister, last week, formed a committee to reevaluate the proposal.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the house that under the new proposal, court warrants have been made a prerequisite for cases involving tax fraud of up to Rs50 million.
Even in such cases, arrests can only be made on three conditions: if the accused doesn’t join the inquiry after three notices; if the accused attempts to abscond; and tampers with evidence.
The arrests must also be approved by a three-member FBR committee with the accused presented before a special judge within 24 hours, ensuring protection against arbitrary detention and abuse of authority.
Relaxation for non-filers
The finance minister also announced that restrictions proposed on the purchase of assets by non-filers have been eased following the prime minister’s direction.
Now, non-filers will be able to purchase residential property worth up to Rs50m, commercial plots or properties worth up to Rs100m and vehicles worth up to Rs7m.
Additionally, under the existing law, capital gains tax will not apply to property sold after six years of purchase, provided it was bought before July 1, 2024.
However, it would be subject to a 4.5 to 6 per cent withholding tax on purchase, which he said was generally returned on filing returns.
He said the property in personal use for 15 or more years would not be subject to this withholding tax.
The minister also announced a collateral-free loan programme, offering credit of up to Rs1m to farmers owning up to 12.5 acres of land, to support the agriculture sector, especially small-scale farmers.
These loans will cover the costs of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, diesel and other essential inputs.
Health and crop insurance facilities will also be provided under the scheme.
The government will also introduce an electronic warehouse receipt system, allowing farmers to store crops securely and obtain better market prices, thereby contributing to national food security.
The minister also announced a 20-year loan scheme for low-income individuals to help them build or purchase houses.
Under the Women Inclusive Finance Programme, loans worth approximately Rs14bn have been provided to over 193,000 women.
In the coming year, another Rs14bn will be extended to women with support from the Asian Development Bank, announced Mr Aurangzeb.
On the tax imposed on e-commerce transactions, the minister said the move was aimed at rationalising the tax scheme and helping the industry to flourish. 
He further highlighted upcoming policy measures, including a new industrial policy, progress on the electric vehicle policy and comprehensive energy sector reforms aimed at achieving sustainable growth.
‘Distortion’ caused by EFS
Mr Aurangzeb said the export facilitation schemes announced in the past “unintentionally distorted market prices” of cotton as they allowed exporters to import raw materials without paying taxes and duties.
It disrupted the prices of domestically produced cotton and yarn, adversely affecting local farmers.
To address this imbalance, the government has proposed sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn to reduce the price gap between imported and local products.
He said the government has proposed a tax of Rs10 per broiler chick due to the poultry industry’s minimal tax contribution.
The Minister warned the ongoing tensions in the Middle East may affect regional economic stability but assured the house that the government was “closely monitoring developments”.

The proscription would put the pro-Palestinian group on a par with Hamas, Al Qaeda or IS under British law, making it illegal for anyone to promote it or be a member. Those who breached the ban could face up to 14 years in jail.
In its latest and most high-profile action, two of its members entered a Royal Air Force base in central England on Friday, spraying paint into the engines of the Voyager transport aircraft and further damaging them with crowbars.
“The disgraceful attack on Brize Norton … is the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage committed by Palestine Action,” Home Secretary (interior minister) Yvette Cooper said in a written statement to parliament.
“The UKs defence enterprise is vital to the nations national security and this government will not tolerate those that put that security at risk.”
She said the group’s actions had become more aggressive and caused millions of pounds of damage.
Under British law, the home secretary can proscribe a group if it is believed it commits, encourages or “is otherwise concerned in terrorism”. The banning order will be laid before parliament on June 30 and will come into effect if approved.
Palestine Action, which says Britain is an “active participant” in the conflict in Gaza because of military support it provides to Israel, called the ban “an unhinged reaction”, and accused Cooper of making “categorically false claims”.

The government had decided to nominate Trump for the prestigious award to hail his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” during last month’s Pak-India conflict, when both neighbours stepped back from the brink of war with US mediation.
In a statement, it had highlighted that Trump “demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi”, which ultimately secured a ceasefire.
However, after the US bombed Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, with Trump saying they were “totally obliterated”, leaders across the political spectrum joined citizens in voicing their reservations.
In the resolution dated today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Senator Murtaza said, “The Senate of Pakistan urges the Federal Government to rescind and withdraw its decision recommending US President … after bombing Iran by the USA on the orders of its President in violation of international law, interfering in the sovereignty of Iran, resulting several casualties also, as one of the concern of human rights, disturbing the peace in the region.”
The JUI-F leader also submitted a motion under Rule 218. It said that the House may discuss the government’s recommendation for his “decisive diplomatic role” during the conflict “against the will of people of Pakistan without taking into confidence any House of Parliament”.
Earlier today, an emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence following the US airstrikes.
A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said: “The committee strongly condemned Israel’s acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US.
“These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.”
On Sunday, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded that the government rescind its decision.
“President Trump’s claim of peace has proven to be false, the proposal for the Nobel Prize should be withdrawn,” Fazl told workers at a party meeting in Murree.</p><small>2025-06-23 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/23213404c64355a.jpg?r=213412' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919408/pakistan-extends-airspace-ban-for-indian-airlines-until-july-23' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace ban for Indian airlines until July 23</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Monday announced that the airspace ban on Indian airlines was extended until July 23.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
On April 24, Pakistan’s top brass had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.
A revised notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued by the PAA today said, “[The] airspace closure for India has been extended for one month.”
The statement said that the airspace will remain closed until July 23.
“PAA maintains [the] ban on Indian airlines’ passenger and military aircraft from using Pakistan’s airspace,” it further said, adding that all Indian registered or leased aircraft will remain under the ban.
The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times during the hostilities last month. Pakis­tan reopened its airspace for all types of flig­hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-06-23 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2320111403b88f9.jpg?r=201311' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919412/bangladesh-probe-into-hasina-era-abuses-warns-impunity-remains' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh probe into Hasina-era abuses, warns ‘impunity’ remains</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladesh government-appointed commission investigating hundreds of disappearances by the security forces under ousted premier Sheikh Hasina on Monday warned that the same “culture of impunity” continues.
The Commission of Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances is probing abuses during the rule of Hasina, whose government was accused of widespread human rights abuses.
That includes the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.
The commission was established by interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who is facing intense political pressure as parties jostle for power ahead of elections expected early next year.
Bangladesh has a long history of military coups and the army retains a powerful role.
 
 

“Enforced disappearances in Bangladesh were not isolated acts of wrongdoing, but the result of a politicised institutional machinery that condoned, normalised, and often rewarded such crimes,” the commission said, in a section of a report released by the interim government on Monday.
“Alarmingly, this culture of impunity continues even after the regime change on August 5, 2024”.
The commission has verified more than 250 cases of enforced disappearances spanning the 15 years that Hasina’s Awami League was in power.
Commission chief Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said earlier this month that responsibility lay with individual officers, who were “involved in conducting enforced disappearances”, but not the armed forces as an institution.
Earlier this month, a joint statement by rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, called on the security forces to “fully cooperate with the commission by guaranteeing unfettered and ongoing access to all detention centres … and providing free access to records regarding those seized or detained”.
Hasina era ex-election chief detained
Meanwhile, A Bangladesh court on Monday remanded in custody the former elections chief for his alleged role in rigging the vote in favour of Hasina.
KM Nurul Huda, 77, was ordered to be detained for four days while questioning continues, a day after a mob, who smashed into his home and assaulted him, eventually handed him over to the police.
On Sunday, the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) filed a case against Huda and other former election commissioners it accuses of rigging past polls in favour of Hasina.
Hours after the case was filed, a mob stormed Huda’s home in the capital, Dhaka and dragged him onto the street. They put a garland of shoes around his neck and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
The interim government condemned the incident and urged people not to take the law into their own hands.

“Swooping on an accused and physically assaulting him is illegal, contrary to the rule of law, and a criminal offence,” the statement read.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus has said elections will be held in early April 2026.
Police put a helmet on Huda while taking him to the court for his protection.
Human rights organisations also condemned the attack on Huda.
“It was a complete violation of … the rule of law,” Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir from the rights group Ain O Salish Kendra said in a statement.
Hasina, 77, remains in self-imposed exile in India, where she fled after she was ousted last year.
She has defied orders to return to Dhaka to face charges amounting to crimes against humanity. Her trial in absentia continues.</p><small>2025-06-23 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/231706511bde02f.jpg?r=170732' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919377/national-security-committee-reaffirms-irans-right-to-self-defence-after-us-attacks-on-nuclear-sites' target='_blank'><strong>National Security Committee reaffirms Iran’s right to self-defence after US attacks on nuclear sites</strong></a><br><p>An emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) on Monday reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence following the airstrikes by the United States on three nuclear facilities.
 
 

After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals, and starving a besieged population — Israel expanded its assault by launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on June 13, killing top commanders, scientists and civilians. A day earlier, President Donald Trump said US air strikes  “totally obliterated” Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.
The strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which came four days after Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir’s meeting with Trump and a day after the government said it decided to formally recommend Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his role during the recent conflict with India, were condemned by Pakistan. A meeting of the NSC,  the highest forum for security deliberations comprising the civil and military top brass, was subsequently convened.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired the meeting, with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir also attending the important moot, and reviewed the evolving regional situation following the Israeli aggression against Iran.
 






Sources in the Prime Minister’s Office had told Dawn that Field Marshal Munir would brief the committee on the details of his meeting with Trump.
A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said: “The committee strongly condemned Israel’s acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the US. These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran’s right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter.”
The committee members also conveyed their condolences to the Iranian government and people on the loss of innocent lives and offered prayers for the recovery of those injured.
“While reiterating Pakistan’s stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan on June 22 which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, relevant international law and the UN Charter.”
The committee members also reaffirmed Pakistan’s close engagement with relevant parties in the situation and endorsed the government’s readiness to continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.
The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy in line with the UN Charter, underscoring the need to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian laws.
 






The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck the country, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”. It also responded with a volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people in Tel Aviv.</p><small>2025-06-23 13:00</small></div><hr>
