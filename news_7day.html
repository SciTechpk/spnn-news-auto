<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69055b16e5e7f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952509/coding-conduct' target='_blank'><strong>Coding conduct</strong></a><br><p>TRADITIONAL Pakistan has long been aware of the destructive nature of coups — the abrupt toppling of political governments and their replacement with autocratic regimes marked by little to no accountability. Under such regimes, the noose tightens around dissent, crackdowns on diversity become routine, and tolerance for alternative opinions vanishes.
In relation to this, we can perhaps be somewhat grateful that such blatant usurpations of power are no longer in fashion. However, that does not mean that such autocratic tendencies have disappeared. Where once political governments were sent packing on charges of plane hijackings, ironically, today, the victims of those alleged hijackings are accused of ‘hijacking’ the judiciary itself.
Through the 26th Amendment, the executive and legislature had been given de facto control over judicial appointments, bench selections, and judicial performance evaluations. Efforts to convene a full court to determine the amendment’s validity had been neutralised, at least till now, the seniority of Islamabad High Court judges had been tampered with, some judges were parachuted in to keep others out, courts were packed with judges perceived to favour the amendment, and whether or not such a perception is accurate, an impression had been created that the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had become a treasury bench, while the one in Sindh had become the ‘people’s bench’.
In these troubling times, some dissent persisted, primarily on the part of a handful of judges in the Supreme Court and the high courts. These judges were never an existential threat to the new system crafted by the establishment, nor are their present protests or expressions of concern a real danger to its continuation. Their dissent and expressions of grievance were, and perhaps remain, an inconvenience.
 
 

Even that, however, is now intolerable. With the notification of the revised Code of Conduct, it is apparent that dissent of any kind is unacceptable, and that conformity is not a choice but a compulsion. Nothing makes this more evident than the decision to borrow from resolutions passed in the dark days of the Musharraf era, a time when democracy was a fairy-tale and autocracy was fair game.

Designed to uphold judicial independence, the Code of Conduct could result in suppressing it.

Article V of the Code deals with public controversies and how to avoid them. The earlier version was broad and generic; the new one is sweeping in scope, with a tendency to expand into every form of expression. Notably, it now prohibits public controversies arising from any “speech, writing, debate or comment at any forum” — essentially covering all forms of free speech. Yet “public controversies” remain undefined, leaving the article ripe for misuse.
The same article further states that a judge shall “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly, nor shall he make public any communication relating to his personal or official matters”. On the face of it, it may seem fine. However, there is a deeper concern involved in the phrasing of this section. How is a judge to ensure that any of his remarks, observations, or findings — whether during the course of proceedings in court or in a written judgement — do not “cause” public discussion or controversy? Public reaction lies well beyond a judge’s control, and is that not what is expected of a judge? Moreover, a judge may, at times, need to justify or reason a decision by citing communications relating to personal or official matters. Once cited, these inevitably enter the public record — leaving the judge technically liable for misconduct under this vaguely worded provision.
 
 

Another notable revision concerns judges’ attendance at social events, gatherings, and functions, which the Code now directs them to abstain from altogether. Even soliciting an invitation to an international conference, amongst other things, regardless of whether it pertains to legal issues, could constitute misconduct. This restriction is alarming, as international conferences and similar forums allow judges to engage with diverse perspectives, broaden their understanding, and stay informed on current global developments.
Additionally, if a judge is personally criticised or his character attacked, he or she is stopped from responding in any form. Instead, an institutional response is prioritised. Similar processes apply to attempts to influence judges. Yet if history is any guide, institutional responses — particularly in times of turmoil — tend to be timid, if not entirely absent.
Clauses such as these might be uncontroversial in mature democracies where the judiciary operates independently, free from legislative or executive influence. In such systems, where safeguards against interference and corruption are firmly embedded, and where an overall culture of respect is found between and amongst the various institutions themselves, a code of conduct of this nature could function effectively. But in countries where democracy is ‘made to order’ — and that too by those whose names appear nowhere in the Constitution as governing authorities — such codes serve instead as Damocles’ swords hanging over the heads of independent judges, or those who dare to express independent thoughts, even sparingly.
In such circumstances, such a Code of Conduct may well serve more so as a tool of misuse as opposed to a shield against wrongdoing. In essence, it may be used to manufacture misconduct as opposed to regulating conduct, with its real purpose being to cull independence, remove judges who think freely, and to protect those who do not. Designed to uphold judicial independence, it could result in suppressing it.
Some may think that we are going out of our way to highlight the ‘possible’ misuse of this code, where no actual misuse has, in fact, come to light. However, in the context of a strained system already finding it hard to give a voice to the people, it is not far-fetched. In fact, in these times, if anything may be perceived as far-fetched, it would be its innocent, effective and judicious use without misapplication. And this is why it may not be improper to state that this Code, in its present form, may do wonders in established democratic orders, but may wreak havoc in others. Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, in today’s world, we are ‘the others’.

Shah Mahmood has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023. In July 2024, the PTI leader was indicted by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.
Meher Bano Qureshi took to X today to announce that the PTI leader was undergoing baseline tests for the stones, which he had “lived with … for years”.
“In 2023, while incarcerated in Adiala Jail, doctors had advised surgery after his condition deteriorated. He chose not to undergo any procedures, then unwilling to do so while in solitary confinement,” she wrote.
“Since then, the stones have increased in size and surgery is now unavoidable. We await the doctors’ final report and a confirmed date for the operation,” Meher Bano added.
 






She added that Shah Mahmood also had a “cardiac emergency” while imprisoned at Kot Lakhpat Jail near Lahore earlier this year.
“What remains deeply painful is knowing that he is not alone in this suffering,” Meher Bano wrote. “Every single PTI leader and worker who has endured imprisonment over the past year has faced serious health consequences under inhumane and unjust conditions.
“Many continue to battle the effects of prolonged confinement, neglect and isolation … some of our workers have also lost their lives whilst unjustly imprisoned,” she added.
His son, Zain, said that his father had been suffering from gallbladder stones for several years and now surgery was required.
“Please pray for him, for Imran Khan sahib, Bushra Bibi, and all the imprisoned [PTI] leaders and workers,” he said.
 






Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry also took to X and wrote that Shah Mahmood has been in the hospital for several days and was visited by family members and constituents.
“If the PTI leadership can’t even go to inquire about him, then saying that we shouldn’t even visit him is strange logic,” Chaudhry wrote. “We have not only met Shah Mahmood Qureshi but also met workers and leadership in Kot Lakhpat Jail.”

As reported, Pakistani representatives were at the airport on Thursday when they were called back by the hosts to give diplomacy with the Afghan Taliban another shot. On Wednesday, Pakistani officials had said the talks had collapsed, mainly due to the Afghan side’s refusal to give explicit guarantees that their soil would not be used by anti-Pakistan militants such as the TTP.
The development is welcome, and the tone of officials indicates that a breakthrough may be possible. For example, the FO spokesman said on Friday that Pakistan hopes for a “positive outcome” from the Nov 6 talks. A mechanism to verify the ceasefire and ensure peace at the border has been agreed to, and this can be the starting point for a more formal peace plan.
The key problem remains Pakistan’s legitimate concern that terrorist groups in Afghanistan are not being prevented from staging attacks against this country, and Kabul’s ambiguous stance on the issue. According to reports, the Taliban negotiators said they could not fully control the TTP, particularly their attacks inside Pakistan. While internal security is indeed Pakistan’s own responsibility, it is the Taliban’s duty — as the de facto government in Kabul — to stop terrorist groups from crossing over into Pakistan. If they cannot stop cross-border terrorism, how can the Taliban be expected to be taken seriously as Afghanistan’s legitimate administration?
 
 

However, the Pakistani side’s reported demand that the Taliban declare the TTP a fitna may be unrealistic. The Taliban and the TTP are cut from the same ideological cloth, hence, we should not expect any such edicts from Kabul or Kandahar.
Much will depend on what the Taliban bring to the table in Istanbul next week. Hopefully they will realise that without a verifiable mechanism and commitment to stop cross-border terrorism, long-term peace with Pakistan will be difficult. Meanwhile both sides, including high officials in Pakistan, should shun intemperate language that could imperil the parleys. While Pakistan’s stance against terrorist groups like the TTP should be clear, aggressive commentary should be avoided.
And as this paper has stated, with cooperation from Muslim states, such as Qatar and Turkiye, which have been instrumental in hosting the talks, as well as regional allies, Kabul should be pressed further on terrorism. For example, along with the TTP, the Taliban also host Al Qaeda, ETIM and IS-K. These groups have staged attacks on regional states, which is why a coordinated, transnational counterterrorism policy is needed to address the problem of militants based in Afghanistan.

• Pakistan assessing impact of deal, says Foreign Office
NEW DELHI: India and the United States on Friday inked a 10-year defence framework agreement, a deal India’s defence minister described as a “signal” of growing strategic alignment, even as warming US-China ties raised questions about the region’s geopolitical landscape.
Indian reports confirmed the defence pact was sealed at a meeting here between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his American counterpart Peter Hegseth.
The “convergence” however seemed undermined by a potentially opposite view on the Obama era encircling of China that Chinese and US presidents presented at a globally watched meeting in South Korea.
Indian newspaper The Hindu noted that the meeting of US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan “sent ripple effects to India”.
Following the talks, US tariffs on China were cut to 47 per cent, leaving India and Brazil with the highest rate at 50pc.
The paper quoted unn­amed experts as saying the US-China “G-2” alliance could significantly impact the region. Considering that Pakistan is in clover with both countries, India’s diplomatic challenges have become only that much more forbidding.
The Singh-Hegseth mee­ting was not bereft of its ironies. “The firming up of the pact came amid efforts by the two sides to repair ties that came under severe strain following Was­hington’s slapping of 50pc tariffs on Indian goods,” The Hindu reported.
Mr Singh announced on X that the signing of the deal marks a new era in their already robust defence relationship, emphasising the growing strategic convergence and the importance of their partnership in maintaining a free, open, and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.
 






Mr Hegseth stated the agreement strengthens defence ties, crucial for regional stability, deterrence, coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation. “Our defence ties have never been stronger,” he said.
 






Mr Hegseth and Mr Singh are in Kuala Lumpur for a meeting with ASEAN member states and dialogue partners.
Moments before the summit, Mr Trump ann­ounced the “G-2 will convene shortly!”.
When asked about the summit, according to The Hindu, India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was non-committal.
The spokesperson stated that the impact of the recent Trump-Xi talks on their domain was still being evaluated and he was unaware of the technicalities. When asked specifically about the G-2 reference, he suggested directing questions about US-China relations to either country.
The idea of a “G-2” to manage global issues was floated about 15 years ago during a 2009 summit between then-presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao. However, Obama never used the term, and Washington dropped the concept by 2011 as US-China tensions grew.
On his flight back to the US, Mr Trump mentioned plans to visit China in April 2026 and host Mr Xi later that year. No date is set for Trump’s India visit for the Quad Summit with PM Modi, and The Hindu suggested it won’t happen in 2025.
“The question won’t just be whether he will be part of the Quad summit in India, but whether his new ‘G-2’ plans with China will dilute the group’s agenda to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific,” The Hindu concluded.
Move being assessed
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office stated that it is too early to comment on the pact, which is currently being assessed for its implications in South Asia.
“The agreement is a recent development, implemented early this morning. We are currently assessing its implications, especially concerning peace, security, and stability in South Asia,” a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said.

The new amendments, which will go into effect from next week, also includes the cancellation of the visa 30 days after its date of issuance in case the pilgrim has not entered the kingdom within this period.
Reducing the visa’s validity, however, will not affect the permitted duration of stay after the pilgrim arrives in Saudi Arabia. All those arriving to perform Umrah are allowed to stay for three months.
The changes were made to prevent overcrowding of pilgrims in the two holy cities during cooler months, according to Ahmed Bajafar, adviser to the National Committee for Umrah and Visit.
Although Umrah rituals are solely performed in Makkah, many Umrah pilgrims seize the chance to visit Madina during their short trip to Saudi Arabia.
In October, Riyadh introduced stricter Umrah rules, including mandatory pre-booking of accommodation and verifying transport bookings on Nusuk or Masar upon arrival. The kingdom has recently made it clear that holders of all types of visas are allo­wed to perform Umrah during their stay.

• Notes eight arrests, 30 FIRs, 23 actions initiated by FIA and cybercrime agency
• Calls for genuine, stakeholder-led reform rather than ‘bulldozing’ measures
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Press Foundation (PPF) has warned of a “bleak” year for media safety and free expression in Pakistan, documenting at least 137 confirmed incidents targeting journalists and media professionals between Jan­uary and October this year.
In a report released to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, PPF said threats ranged from physical assaults and detentions to criminal complaints, censorship orders and internet shutdowns, despite constitutional guarantees of free expression.
 
 

The PPF urged authorities to move “beyond lip service” and implement domestic and international commitments to protect press freedom, including effective use of existing safety laws and mechanisms.
The report documented 35 incidents of physical assault and manhandling, along with two journalists injured while on assignment, five detentions, two abductions and four attacks on property, including raids.
Legal pressure remained significant, with eight arrests, 30 FIRs — 22 of which invoked the Pakistan Elec­tronic Crimes Act (Peca), including the newly introduced Section 26-A on “fake information” — and 23 actions initiated by the FIA and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.
Journalists also faced intimidation, including seven threats (online and offline), three threats of legal action, seven cases of harassment, sometimes involving family members or political rhetoric, and two journalists placed on the no-fly list.
 
 

Meanwhile, censorship and rest­rictions included six suspensions of mobile or internet services, a Pemra directive, a court order blocking 27 YouTube channels (later suspended in separate proceedings) and restrict­ions on reporting outside Adiala Jail.
‘Brazen’ attacks
The PPF said political leaders’ rhetoric and government actions perpetuated a hostile climate for the press, alongside “brazen” attacks on property and the bulldozing of restrictive legislation.
It noted continued physical violence — including assaults, detentions and abductions — amid “a lack of preventive, protective and prosecutorial measures”.
The report highlighted the risks faced by journalists covering climate disasters. On Aug 30, Geo News reporter Irfanullah and cameraman Ali Arsalan were allegedly ass­aulted and forced away by Punjab Enf­orcement and Regulatory Aut­hority personnel while reporting on flood-hit residents in Faisalabad.
“In what has now appeared to become an unfortunate tactic are attempts to undermine the sanctity of physical spaces, including press clubs,” the report said.
It said police forcibly entered Quetta Press Club on March 1; men linked to a shrine dispute attacked Badin Press Club on June 2; and Islamabad’s National Press Club was raided on Oct 2, with journalists assaulted on the premises.
The PPF examined eight murders of media workers this year; six were deemed unrelated to journalistic work, while two — Abdul Latif Bal­och and Imtiaz Mir — remain inconclusive.
It called for genuine, stakeholder-led reform rather than “bulldozing” measures such as the Paki­stan Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act 2025, which drew concern over pote­ntial misuse.

• Home dept says move will help ensure PTI founder’s security, prevent untoward incidents
RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government has notified that all eleven FIRs registered against former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with the violent protests of May 9, 2023, will now be tried in the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Rawalpindi.
The trials will be conducted via video link from Adiala jail, where the PTI founder remains incarcerated.
According to a notification issued by the Home Department, the decision has been made under Sections 15(2) and 21(2)(b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The order directs that proceedings in all eleven FIRs — registered at various police stations, including RA Bazaar, Civil Lines, City, Waris Khan, New Town, Morgah, Sadiqabad, Saddar Wah, and Cantt — be held at the Rawalpindi ATC through video link from Adiala jail. The Home Department stated that the arrangement aims to ensure Imran Khan’s security and prevent any untoward incident during the hearings.
The fresh order replaces earlier notifications dated June 21, 2023, October 4, 2023, and November 6, 2024, which also addressed the transfer of trial venues. The last such notification was withdrawn by the Punjab government after being challenged before the Lahore High Court (LHC).
With this latest order, the government has once again sanctioned the holding of Imran Khan’s trials through remote proceedings.
An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi had earlier dismissed the PTI’s plea challenging the government’s decision to have Imran Khan appear via video link in the case pertaining to the violent protest outside the General Headquarters (GHQ) — one of the several May 9 cases. Judge Amjad Ali Shah ruled that the provincial government’s notification was valid and that the accused would continue to attend proceedings virtually from jail.
Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023, triggered widespread riots across Pakistan, during which government buildings and military installations — including the GHQ in Rawalpindi — were stormed and vandalised. Following the unrest, dozens of FIRs were lodged against PTI leaders and supporters under anti-terrorism provisions.
The new notification consolidates all eleven Rawalpindi district cases before the same ATC, streamlining the trial process. These cases include charges related to attacks on military installations, police stations, and public property during the May 9 riots.
The order has been circulated to key officials, including the advocate general of Punjab, the registrar of the Lahore High Court, the presiding judge of the Rawalpindi ATC, and the inspector general of prisons. It also instructs the superintendent of Adiala jail to ensure Imran Khan’s safe and secure participation via video link.
Imran Khan, who was indicted in the GHQ attack case on December 5, 2024, has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since August 2023. He was subsequently arrested in additional May 9 cases in January 2024.
The PTI founder’s legal team has consistently argued that the government’s insistence on conducting the trials through video link is politically motivated and undermines the principle of open justice. However, the provincial authorities maintain that the arrangement is strictly a security measure.
With the latest notification, the stage is now set for all pending May 9 cases in Rawalpindi to proceed simultaneously in the ATC via video link — a move that could expedite proceedings but also reignite the legal debate over the right to a fair and public trial.

• Praises sacrifices by people of KP, armed forces
• Promises Daanish schools standards will be ‘at a par with Aitchison College’
CHITRAL: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that Pakistan has secured a prominent position in the international community, acknowledging the diplomatic intervention of US President Donald Trump in helping to ease tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi in May of this year.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of a Daanish school here, the premier noted that Mr Trump’s efforts prevented a potential escalation by establishing a ceasefire between the two countries.
 
 

The prime minister reiterated his resolve to eliminate terrorism and promote peace and prosperity across the country.
He lauded the armed forces for their sacrifices and professionalism under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The premier said the patriotism of the people of KP was exemplary, particularly that of Chitral, noting that were highly educated and civilised people despite lacking educational facilities.
“That is the reason why [PML-N president and former prime minister] Mian Nawaz Sharif always took special interest in the development projects of this area [Chitral] during his tenure.”
He said that after assuming the office of the prime minister, he had planned to focus federal resources on remote areas and bring prosperity through such facilities so that KP, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir could also develop on par with Punjab and Sindh.
Daanish school
Describing the Daanish school as a special gift from the federal government to the people of Chitral, he said that residents could previously only dream of an educational institution of this quality, but now it had become a reality.
The prime minister stated that the standard of Daanish schools would in no way be lower than that of Aitchison College in Lahore.
“Completely free education, along with boarding and lodging facilities, will be provided, allowing poor and orphaned children to compete with the students of Aitchison College by receiving high-quality education,” he added.
PM Shehbaz announ­ced that construction of the Daanish school building would begin in December this year and will be completed within a year, with classes to be inaugurated by him next year.
The premier also announced several development projects for Chitral, including the establishment of a university and a state-of-the-art hospital in Upper Chitral, as well as the completion of the 153-kilometre Chitral-Shandur Road by December next year.
He further announced the completion of the gas plant project in Chitral, which had been initiated during the government of his brother, Nawaz Sharif.
Earlier, Federal Minister Amir Muqam, in his address, highlighted the performance of the PML-N government and described the prime minister’s tireless work and efforts as exemplary.
He criticised the provincial government of KP, stating that it should focus on performance-based politics rather than adopting a confrontational approach.
Later, PM Shehbaz visited Gahiret village to congratulate one of his protocol staff members on his recent marriage.

• Foreign Office insists Istanbul statement a ‘preface’, not full text of accord
• Says Taliban privately acknowledge TTP, BLA presence in Afghanistan
• Khawaja Asif hints at multi-nation monitors, says ‘terrorism must stop’
ISLAMABAD: Islamabad on Friday viewed the Istanbul agreement with Kabul as a conditional truce and a step forward, but not an end-state as it awaited the next high-level engagement with the Afghan Taliban regime scheduled for Nov 6 in Turkiye.
“Afghanistan should understand that this arrangement is a conditional truce, one which hinges on demonstrable responsibility by the Afghan side,” a senior security source said on condition of anonymity, underscoring Pakistan’s cautious optimism after five days of intense talks in Istanbul mediated by Turkiye and Qatar.
The round of negotiations, which concluded earlier this week, produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations.
The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on Thursday.
The Istanbul talks followed a sharp escalation in tensions last month that saw Pakistan launch Oct 9 airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan, triggering Oct 11 border clashes that continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on Oct 18-19.
The Istanbul agreement came after days of deadlock that nearly brought the process to a halt, with mediators pulling both delegations back to the table even as Pakistan’s team had already begun preparations to return home.
“The Istanbul round was initially scheduled for two days. However, in an effort to reach an amicable agreement with the Taliban regime, the Pakistani side, in earnest, continued the talks for four days,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Hussain Andarabi said at his weekly briefing on Friday.
“We would see these deliberations [in Istanbul] as comprehensive and all-encompassing as we move to the next stage,” Mr Andarabi added.
 






He, however, urged against critiquing the statement. “The statement released by the foreign ministry of Turkiye was a kind of covering note on the talks that were held. It should be read as a preface to a book rather than as the book itself,” he explained while responding to questions about the statement not fully reflecting the Pakistani position, especially as it missed a reference to the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan does not seek further escalation of hostilities but expects the Afghan Taliban regime to honour its commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking concrete and verifiable actions against terrorist entities, including Fitna al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army),” Mr Andarabi said.
While the Foreign Office emphasised diplomacy, the security official was explicit about Islamabad’s conditional approach.
“Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to peace and stability on its western border but equally emphasises that this ceasefire is not open-ended and not unconditional,” the official emphasised.
He added that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action, including dismantling of militant hideouts, disruption of logistical channels, arrests or prosecutions of leadership and transparent reporting through the agreed monitoring and verification mechanism”.
“If Afghanistan fails to deliver verifiable proof of agreed steps, or if militants continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, Pakistan will deem the ceasefire violated and reserves all options to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens,” he warned.
FO ‘fully engaged’
The Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was dominated by military and intelligence officials, though the Foreign Office spokesman insisted it remained fully engaged.
“Istanbul talks took place with full engagement from the Foreign Office,” Mr Andarabi said. “The deputy prime minister and foreign minister gave guidance on numerous occasions. The foreign secretary and our Afghanistan Division were also engaged. We need to dispel this impression that there is some sort of fragmentation in our government apparatus.”
Mr Andarabi also clarified that “the border remains closed for trade for now. The opening of the border for Afghan transit trade would depend on the evaluation of the security situation, and clearly that evaluation still warrants closure of the border.”
On the monitoring system, the security source said, “The monitoring and verification mechanism established under the mediators’ auspices will serve as the impartial and essential instrument to determine compliance by Afghanistan.”
Pakistan, however, remains sceptical about the Afghan Taliban’s sincerity.
“Despite repeated assurances in the past (by Afghan Taliban), there has been a surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan,” Mr Andarabi recalled.
The spokesman further disclosed that the Afghan Taliban had acknowledged the presence of TTP and BLA on Afghan soil, even if they offered excuses for inaction. “As far as the acknowledgement of their physical presence in Afghanistan is concerned, they agreed to it,” he said.
Security officials echoed that scepticism, while noting that “the single litmus test of Taliban sincerity is that Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan”.
Multi-nation monitors
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its long-term sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months.
He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this, it means they have connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” he said.
To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the TTP to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Mr Asif: “They accept this privately.”
He said the two were very entangled, and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban. They (TTP) won’t be living in hotels,” he added.
Mr Asif asserted that Pakistan’s main demand continued to be the “stopping of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”.
He added that “there is a ray of hope, but not because of Afghanistan and only so because of Qatar and Turkiye’s influence” over Kabul.
“There have been some ceasefire violations from Afghanistan,: he said, stressing that “until terrorism stops, the ceasefire cannot be
effective”.

The returns received until Oct 31, which is the last date for the filing of tax returns for the tax year 2025.
An official announcement of the FBR said that, as per the directions of the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, no blanket extension in the filing deadline has been granted. However, taxpayers facing genuine hardships may approach their respective field formations through FBR’s IRIS system for an extension in filing their returns.
Out of the filed returns, 3.6m taxpayers filed returns with tax payments, reflecting an 18.6pc rise in taxpayers who contributed revenue along with their returns, compared to the same period in 2024.
Moreover, individual taxpayers have paid nearly Rs9 billion more than last year, growing from Rs60bn to Rs69bn this year, representing a 15pc increase in tax payments from individuals.

Individual tax payments up 15 per cent to Rs69 billion

This recorded a significant increase in income tax return filings for tax year 2025, marking a new milestone in voluntary compliance and taxpayer awareness.
The FBR appreciates the growing cooperation of citizens and reiterates its commitment to facilitating honest taxpayers through simplified processes, digital tools, and responsive communication, ensuring that Pakistan’s tax system becomes fairer, transparent, and inclusive.
 
 

The rise in return filings is the outcome of a comprehensive outreach campaign. As part of these efforts, nationwide robocalls and WhatsApp messages were disseminated to remind citizens of their civic duty to file tax returns.
In addition, FBR sent a series of behaviourally informed messages to taxpayers using third-party data, beginning with congratulatory notes, followed by informational messages about rights and obligations, and finally cautionary reminders, with nearly 800,000 such nudges issued across the country.
Complementing these initiatives, targeted emails were also sent to around 70,000 taxpayers, highlighting the indicative income levels of comparable peers to encourage accurate and timely filing.

In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and relevant ministries.
According to the notification, the price of petrol now stands at Rs265.45 per litre from Rs263.02 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has increased to Rs278.44 per litre from Rs275.42 per litre.
Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Ogra also notified a Rs5.88 per kilogram (2.83pc) cut in LPG’s consumer price to Rs201.60 per kg (from Rs207.49 per kg).
The price of an 11.8kg cylinder has been set at Rs2,378.89 for November, down Rs69.44 from Rs2,448.53 for October. The government charges about Rs37,342 per tonne in GST and petroleum levy on LPG.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-11-01 02:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/010715166065664.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952518/us-seeks-pakistans-help-to-balance-chinas-mineral-grip' target='_blank'><strong>US seeks Pakistan’s help to balance China’s mineral grip</strong></a><br><p>• Critical Minerals Forum chief meets Aurangzeb
• Islamabad welcomes move; asks team to revert with a detailed framework for collaboration
ISLAMABAD: A leading US delegation met with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Friday, seeking to build secure and transparent mineral supply chains for American industry amid Washington’s growing concerns over China’s upper hand in global rare earth materials.
The delegation led by Robert Louis Strayer II, president of the US government-funded Critical Minerals Forum (CMF), “discussed avenues of cooperation in the minerals and mining sector, strengthening supply-chain security, and encouraging responsible and sustainable investment in Pakistan’s critical minerals landscape” with a Pakistani team headed by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to an official statement.
 






The meeting took place as the US and India announced a 10-year defence framework agreement.
The CMF’s focus is driven by the strategic threat posed by Beijing’s control over key resources. “China’s dominance of critical mineral supply chains has become a well-known threat to US national security, economic competitiveness, and long-term strategic objectives,” Strayer wrote in his only article on the CMF website.
Mr Strayer told Pakistan that the CMF is working globally to support reliable supply chains for US industry, particularly in emerging markets.
The forum, he said, “focused on rare and niche metals, including copper and antimony, and aims to de-risk investments from both financial and security perspectives”.
He also promised a commitment to support technology transfer, intel­lectual property protection, and US private-sector investor confidence.
Mr Strayer noted that the US viewed Pakistan’s science, engineering, and mathematics talent as a competitive advantage and “acknowledged Pakistan’s potential to become a future hub for critical mineral development,” the statement added.
Natalie Baker, the US Chargé d’Affaires in Islamabad who accompanied the delegation, noted the Embassy’s support for American commercial engagement in Pakis­tan and “emphasised the importance of ensuring strong investor confidence and enabling regulatory frameworks in the minerals sector”.
In response, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan is working on significant legal and regulatory reforms and would welcome structured proposals. “We encourage you to return with a detailed framework for collaboration. Pakistan will evaluate it with a view to facilitating responsible investment and ensuring mutual benefit,” the minister said.
Mr Aurangzeb also positioned Pakistan as navigating a complex geopolitical landscape, highlighting its strengthened partnerships. “Pakistan today stands at a constructive intersection of global relationships—renewed momentum in Pakistan-US ties, time-tested relations with China, and forward-looking strategic cooperation with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he said.
He stressed that Pakistan’s mineral sector represents a “transformational opportunity” that could shift the country from “consumption-driven cycles to export-led growth.”
He added, “A strong minerals policy framework will help Pakistan break the cycle of periodic balance-of-payments pressures and reduce future reliance on multilateral support.”
The minister also updated the delegation that during his recent visit to Washington he met multiple global financial institutions, including Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and International Finance Corporation (IFC), which expressed interest in expanding investments in Pakistan.
US stakeholders are concerned about China’s growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US under-investment.
 
 

According to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.
The Atlantic Council warned that these “supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption.” It noted that China has shown a “willingness to weaponise its dominance”, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.
However, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the “unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices”.
He added that this uncertainty has “a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profits.”

Saim smashed an unbeaten 71 off 38, hitting six fours and five sixes, to help Pakistan chase down the paltry 111-run target in the 14th over.
Earlier, Faheem Ashraf and Salman Mirza had kept South Africa quiet with a brilliant pace bowling show.
Pakistan openers Sahibzada Farhan and Saim had seen the side cruise to 49-0 by the end of the powerplay with a measured approach with no pressure on them whatsoever.
 






But right at the end of the period, Corbin Bosch trapped Sahibzada lbw with his pace. However, the incoming Babar Azam triggered raucous roars among the capacity crowds, getting off the mark with a scintillating cover drive.
Saim too carried on, launching Ottneil Baartman for a huge six over long-on as Pakistan edged closer to the small target.
The southpaw followed that up with a powerful cut through the off-side for four and an audacious flick for yet another maximum, milking a 21 runs from the ninth over.
Saim brought up his first T20I half century on home soil in 29 balls in the next over — which also saw him lift spinner Donovan Ferreira over the covers for six — as Pakistan posted 92-1 at halfway stage.
After Babar became highest T20I-run scorer — beating India’s Rohit Sharma with 4323 tuns in 123 matches — Saim dispatched George Linde and Ferreira for sixes to take Pakistan over the line.
 






Earlier, Pakistan put up a fast-bowling masterclass as South Africa were bundled out cheaply after they were put into bat.
Faheem took 4-23 while Salman — replacing Shaheen Shah Afridi in the Pakistan XI — returned figures of 3-14 and Naseem Shah chipped in with 2-28.
South Africa’s best batting display came from Dewald Brevis, but the right-hander’s burst was too short to lead the visitors to a competitive total.
They reeled at 31-4 by the end of the powerplay as Salman rattled their top-order with immaculate line and length and subtle movement.
The left-armer struck as early as on the second ball of the match, bamboozling South African opener Reeza Hendricks — who hit a match-winning half century in the first match — with an in-swinger that crashed into the stumps.
Naseem pushed the Proteas deeper into trouble, deceiving Quinton de Kock with a slower one, which the right-hander holed to Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha at mid-off.
Salman then returned to get Tony de Zorzi caught at deep fine before castling Matthew Breetzke with a stunning off-cutter.
 






The incoming Brevis, one of the most promising prospects in global T20 cricket, went after the Pakistan bowlers to bring back South Africa in the game, dispatching spinners Mohammad Nawaz and Abrar Ahmed and medium-pacer Faheem  for handsome sixes, but was undone by a shorter ball by Faheem to depart with 25 off 16 against his name.
Faheem then returned to make South African captain Ferreira drag the ball on to his stumps just at the halfway stage, to leave the visitors at 66-6.
 






The right-armer returned to send back Linde in the same manner two overs later.
South Africa’s struggles only kept on increasing, with Naseem producing a caught-behind dismissal of Bosch in the 14th over.
Abrar Ahmed got himself in the wickets column, thanks to a carrom ball that clipped Nandre Burger’s off-stump before Faheem came back to be gifted a fourth and South Africa’s last wicket on the second ball of the 20th over.
Pakistan will look to win the series when they take on South Africa in the third and final match at the same venue on Saturday.</p><small>2025-10-31 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3121320647f136a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952377/no-talks-ongoing-with-government-establishment-ptis-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>No talks ongoing with government, establishment: PTI’s Gohar</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Friday said that there are currently no negotiations or talks between the party and the federal government or the military establishment.
Last year, talks between the government and the PTI commenced in the last week of December to bring down political temperatures, but despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process hardly moved forward on major issues — the formation of a judicial commission and the release of PTI prisoners.
From December into January, the PML-N-led coalition and the PTI accused each other of derailing the negotiations and lacking seriousness. A highly demanded meeting of the PTI team with party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan in Adiala Jail on January 12 paved the way for a third round of talks. However, the PTI decided to boycott the fourth round of talks with the government, a day after it announced that Imran issued directions to call off negotiations due to a delay over the formation of judicial commissions.
Speaking on Dawn News programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, the PTI chairman denied that talks were taking place and said it was “unfortunate” that political issues were not being resolved with political solutions. He also recalled the history of talks between the PTI and the government, which did not bear fruit.
“When we announced that our mandate was stolen in March 2024, [Imran] Khan sahib formed a committee to hold talks, but when the talks did not take place, people said ‘ýou only want to talk to the establishment’,” Gohar said.
“Khan sahib said that [Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief] Mahmood Khan Achakzai sahib should hold talks; if he brings us any offer, we will consider it,” he added.
 


The PTI chairman noted that another committee was formed on November 26, but recalled that no talks were conducted and said the government did “not take the issue seriously”.
“Even when we and the government formed committees after November 26, we could not meet for two weeks,” he said. “They did not want to meet us after that. In these circumstances, we did not want to sit and gossip for a photo opportunity.”
“We wanted to bring some issues to the table because we understood that if we found a political solution to the political issues facing the country, it would be much better for democracy, for the House and it would be better for both parties if we progressed this way. But it didn’t happen, so the matter didn’t move forward.”
Speaking about military operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gohar said that the PTI held multiple all-party conferences on the issue and held the conferences in January, July and September this year.
“Intelligence-based operations are referenced in our press releases, but there cannot be collateral damage or politicisation,” he explained. “People displaced in prior operations have still not rebuilt their homes.”</p><small>2025-10-31 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31204339d7a0d0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952376/defence-minister-khawaja-asif-rubbishes-contentious-remarks-about-disarming-hamas' target='_blank'><strong>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif rubbishes contentious remarks about disarming Hamas</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday rubbished and strongly condemned the contentious remarks made by government spokesperson Danyal Chaudhry regarding the role of Pakistani troops in the Gaza peace force, which also included the disarming of Hamas.
Addressing the remarks by the federal parliamentary secretary for information and broadcasting in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister said: “I will say God forbid on all these three remarks; what kind of statement has he given. Nothing from this is our target or suits us.”
In an interview on Tuesday on Ary News show ‘11th Hour’, Chaudhry had said regarding the mandate of the Gaza peace force: “Pakistan and the other countries that will be chosen will make sure there is no extremism or violence … or that there is no cross-border attack. Pakistan will enforce that.”
Chaudhry also said that the security of any Pakistani soldier deputed for duty in the force would be the utmost priority. “We will fulfil our duty and protect Muslim brothers and make sure there are no cross-border violations or terrorism.”
Questioned if the mandate would also include the disarmament of Hamas, Chaudhry had said: “Yes absolutely, if [Hamas] will be disarmed, only then the other force will be able to carry on. Things will only move forward after disarmament.”
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
Addressing the matter while slamming Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said Pakistan would follow whatever collective decision is taken for the force. He also questioned on whose behalf the federal parliamentary secretary was speaking in terms of enforcing peace.
“I have no information about this. I am frankly speaking that if we are saying such things on a personal level on any TV [channel] then it is inappropriate.”
Questioned if the role of the force was really as per Chaudhry’s remarks, Asif said: “I won’t be in favour then. There has been no discussion like this.”
He agreed when asked that the inclusion of any Pakistani troops in such a force in the face of continued Israeli bombing would cause a complicated situation.
 
 

Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, have said discussions within the government and military establishment are at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
The ISF’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the ISF was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility. Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping.
Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF.
Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States.
Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counter-terrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence.
However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment. “Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said.
Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge.
Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official.
Asif had said on Tuesday that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”.
Afghan Taliban issue
Meanwhile, on the recent agreement with the Afghan Taliban to continue the current ceasefire ahead of further talks and the agreeement on a monitoring and verification mechanism for any violation, Asif suggested that there might be the inclusion of multiple countries in the monitoring mechanism to ensure its longterm sustainability instead of a breakdown in 12 or 15 months.
He said giving a “free hand” to any border crossing of terrorists amounted to abetting them or conniving with them. “If they don’t stop this or monitor this then it means they have a connivance and their agreement is involved in terrorists coming and spilling blood in Pakistan,” the defence minister said.
To a question on whether the Afghan Taliban accepted the presence and usage of their soil by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to conduct attacks on Pakistan, Asif: “They accept this privately.”
He said the two were very entangled and the entire TTP leadership was present in Kabul. “The sanctuaries in Kabul must have been provided by the Afghan Taliban, thry (TTP) won’t be living in hotels.”</p><small>2025-10-31 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311920317424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952369/punjab-govt-under-fire-for-manipulating-air-quality-data' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt under fire for ‘manipulating’ air quality data</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government is facing criticism and allegations of data manipulation after climate analysts and social media users accused the Environment Protection & Climate Change Department (EPCCD) of deliberately shutting down air quality monitoring stations in Lahore during peak pollution hours.
The controversy erupted when climate and public policy analyst Dawar Hameed Butt posted a series of tweets on X, alleging that the EPCCD had turned off several monitoring stations, particularly those in the more polluted northern and eastern parts of the city.
“EPCCD Punjab has turned off Monitoring Stations in Lahore,” Butt tweeted. “The ones left on are still ‘Beyond Index’. These are PAS officers, PhDs and ‘educated’ staff, and they think closing their eyes will solve the problem. Absolute failure unfolding now.”
 






He supported his claims with screenshots from the official government website, aqipunjab.com, which showed that data from multiple stations had not been updated for hours, still displaying readings from October 30.
The allegations were echoed by another social media user, Hassan Aftab, who suggested a “strategic motive behind the alleged shutdowns.”
“Punjab government’s new air quality strategy: if pollution levels look bad, just turn off the monitors. [Eight] out of 10 monitors are shut beyond 10pm in Lahore (when air quality dips further) to lower the average. Lahore now breathing the cleaner air (on paper),” he tweeted.
Aftab tagged Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, urging transparency. “Let’s ensure there’s uninterrupted data from the monitors; it will only help you better strategise on how to solve this,” he added, noting the millions already spent on the monitoring infrastructure.
 






In a post on X, the EPCCD stated that due to a technical issue, AQI monitoring at some stations had been interrupted.
“[A] technical team is working to restore regular data transmission. Current and any missing AQI data from Air Quality Monitoring Stations will be available soon,” the post read.
 






When checked by Dawn at 5pm on Friday, the aqipunjab.com website appeared to have updated most stations, with only the Multan Road station lagging. However, the updated data itself painted a grim picture of the province’s air quality, underscoring the critical need for reliable monitoring.
At that time, Kasur was ranked the most polluted city in Punjab with an AQI soaring to a hazardous level of 500. Other major cities also recorded unhealthy air, with Gujranwala at 207, DG Khan at 190, Multan at 187 and Lahore at 175.
In response to the allegations, EPCCD spokesperson Sajid Bashir firmly denied the claims and told Dawn that the department updates air quality levels on an hourly basis and dismissed the social media users’ accusations as “false claims.”
Bashir rejected the screenshots shared by Dawar and others, asserting the department’s commitment to providing accurate data.
Earlier this week, Lahore continued to rank as the most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality, according to the global monitor IQAir.
In response to the crisis, the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) has also launched a large-scale anti-smog operation, deploying 16 mechanical washers, 50 regular washers, and 400 workers for road washing and water sprinkling.
Meanwhile, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, in a statement, praised the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in handling the anti-smog operations, calling her hard work “a testament to the success of the vision of improving the environment”.
“In the coming years, Punjab will see improvements like Beijing,” she said.
‘Brief technical glitch’
Aurangzeb, in a statement released later in the day, said there was a “brief technical glitch” in the air quality monitoring network earlier today.
“It was immediately flagged by the EPA’s Smog War Room, and the vendor resolved it by 3:00 p.m. the same day. The issue was purely technical, not administrative, and was transparently announced on the official portal,” said the statement.
Praising the monitoring system, the minister said that the fact that the brief technical interruption was noticed “shows how widely trusted and publicly relied upon our system has become”.
Aurangzeb maintained that if the government wished to hide the air quality date, it would not have installed 41 monitoring stations across Punjab. It further claimed that the current provincial government has built “one of South Asia’s most transparent, data-driven air quality management systems accessible to every citizen”.</p><small>2025-10-31 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311643508c2c4c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952357/corruption-extortion-case-lahore-court-extends-physical-remand-of-6-nccia-officials-by-3-days' target='_blank'><strong>Corruption, extortion case: Lahore court extends physical remand of 6 NCCIA officials by 3 days</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore court on Friday extended the physical remand of six National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials by another three days in a case pertaining to the alleged misuse of authority, extortion of money, and acceptance of bribes.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who has been arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR was registered against a total of nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest on Monday.
Lahore NCCIA’s Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar are the six officials.
The six were presented in the court of Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo, with the FIA’s investigating officer (IO) requesting further 11 days of physical remand to continue the investigation.
Accepting the request, the judge remanded the suspects into three more days of physical custody to complete the investigation and ordered their appearance on Monday.
According to the court order, the counsels for the suspects variously argued that their clients were wrongly nominated in the case or alleged irregularities in the complaint against them. They also raised questions about the recoveries made.
Meanwhile, the FIA’s legal counsel strongly opposed all contentions and contended that it was a white collar crime.
“Earlier three days physical remand was granted and different heavy amounts were recovered from all accused persons. Learned counsels pointed out illegalities and irregularities in said alleged recoveries but this court has no mandate to decide said questions during remand at this stage. Heavy amounts are recovered from all accused persons. Progress is happened. Contention of IO looks plausible for further physical remand to make investigation due to said heavy amount recoveries. Contention of learned counsels looks not plausible to discharge accused persons at this stage,” the order said.
FIR
The FIR was registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman and the inquiry into his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to “extort Rs9 million” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman’s judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August 2025, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Salman Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added that Riaz gave Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping, while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director operations in Islamabad, and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen had been assigned the investigation of the case.</p><small>2025-10-31 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311752480cfb029.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952362/tlps-south-punjab-leadership-announces-disassociation-from-proscribed-outfit' target='_blank'><strong>TLP’s South Punjab leadership announces disassociation from proscribed outfit</strong></a><br><p>Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) leadership cadre from South Punjab on Friday announced their disassociation from the proscribed religiopolitical party in the wake of the ban imposed on the group for violence and rioting.
The interior ministry notified the ban on the TLP last week, saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism.
“The Pakistan Army is under threat from the East and the West,” said one leader. “TLP, the party which we were part of, gave calls for marches and protests because of which our state and army had to deal with an internal war along with foreign threats.”
Referring to Pakistan’s brief but intense military escalation with India in May, he said calls for protest by TLP during that time also worked in the enemy’s favour.
Elaborating further, he said the party is systematically benefiting the enemies of the country, which is why “we’ve decided to separate ourselves from TLP.”
He added that terrorists from the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have also shown their support for the TLP in a video statement released earlier.
The ban came a day after the federal cabinet approved a proposal to proscribe the group under the anti-terrorism act, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
The group currently only has a single seat in the Punjab Assembly, held by Mehmood Ahmad for PP-55 (Narowal-ii).
The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet.
The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country.
The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests. The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees.</p><small>2025-10-31 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311929505223720.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952372/men-shot-by-the-hundreds-disappeared-after-sudanese-city-falls-to-paramilitaries-witnesses-say' target='_blank'><strong>Men shot by the hundreds, disappeared after Sudanese city falls to paramilitaries, witnesses say</strong></a><br><p>Fighters riding camels rounded up a couple of hundred men near the Sudanese city of al-Fasher at the weekend and brought them to a reservoir, shouting racial slurs before starting to shoot, according to a man who said he was among them.
One of the captors recognised him from his school days and let him flee, the man, Alkheir Ismail, said in a video interview conducted by a local journalist known to Reuters in the nearby town of Tawila in the country’s western Darfur region.
“He told them, ‘Don’t kill him,’” Ismail said. “Even after they killed everyone else — my friends and everyone else.”
He said he had been bringing food to relatives still in the city when it was captured by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday — and, like the other detainees, was unarmed. Reuters could not immediately verify his account due to the conflict but has verified earlier material obtained from the journalist.

Ismail was one of four such witnesses and six aid workers interviewed by Reuters who also said people fleeing al-Fasher had been gathered in nearby villages and men separated from women and removed. In an earlier account, one of the witnesses said gunshots then rang out.
Activists and analysts have long warned of revenge killings based on ethnicity by the RSF if they seized al-Fasher — the last stronghold of the Sudanese military in Darfur.
The UN human rights office shared other accounts on Friday, estimating hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters may have been executed. Such killings are considered war crimes.
The RSF, whose victory in al-Fasher marks a milestone in Sudan’s two-and-a-half-year civil war, has denied such abuses — saying the accounts have been manufactured by its enemies and making counter-accusations against them.

RSF says men removed for interrogation
Reuters has verified at least three videos posted on social media showing men in RSF uniforms shooting unarmed captives and a dozen more showing clusters of bodies after apparent shootings.
A high-level RSF commander called the accounts “media exaggeration” by the army and its allied fighters “to cover up for their defeat and loss of al-Fasher”.
The RSF’s leadership had ordered investigations into any violations by RSF individuals and several had been arrested, he said, adding that the RSF had helped people leave the city and called on aid organisations to assist those who remained.
He said soldiers and fighters pretending to be civilians had been taken away for interrogation. “There were no killings as has been claimed,” the commander told Reuters in response to a request for comment.

The RSF’s capture of al-Fasher entrenches the geographical division of a country already reduced by the independence of South Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war.
In a speech on Wednesday night, RSF head Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo called on his fighters to protect civilians and said violations will be prosecuted. He appeared to acknowledge reports of detentions by ordering the release of detainees.
Most of the fighters holding back the RSF advance in al-Fasher came from the Zaghawa ethnic group whose enmity with the largely Arab RSF fighters dates from the early 2000s, when, as the Janjaweed militias, they were accused of atrocities in Darfur.
Alex de Waal, a genocide expert and specialist on Darfur, said the reported RSF acts in al-Fasher looked “very similar to what they did in Geneina and elsewhere”, referring to another Darfur city the RSF took during the latest war’s early stages as well as the early 2000s conflict.
The US said the RSF had committed genocide in Geneina and the attack is under investigation by the International Criminal Court. The Sudanese army and others accuse the United Arab Emirates of supporting the RSF, charges the Gulf state denies.
‘We can’t say they are alive’
Mary Brace, a protection adviser at Nonviolent Peaceforce, an NGO working in Tawila, said those arriving “are women, children and older men generally”, adding that trucks organised by the RSF have taken some people from Garney to Tawila while others have been taken elsewhere.
The RSF on Thursday posted a video it said showed the provision of food and medical aid to people displaced in Garney. Aid workers said the force may also be trying to keep people in towns it controls to attract foreign aid.
Some 260,000 people were still in al-Fasher around the time of the attack, but only 62,000 have been counted elsewhere, and only several thousand of them in Tawila, which is controlled by a neutral force.
In another of the testimonies obtained and verified by Reuters, Tahani Hassan, a former hospital cleaner, said she fled to Tawila early on Sunday after her brother-in-law and uncle were killed by stray bullets.
On the way, she and her family were apprehended by three men in RSF uniforms who searched them, beat them and insulted them, she said.
“They hit us hard. They threw our clothes on the ground. Even I, as a woman, was searched,” she said, adding that their food and water was also spilled on the ground.
They eventually made it to Garney where the fighters separated women and children from the men, most of whom they did not see again, including her brother and brother-in-law.
“We can’t say they are alive, because of how they treated us,” Hassan said. “If they don’t kill you, the hunger will kill you, the thirst will kill you.”</p><small>2025-10-31 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31184946cdb3793.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952365/bilawal-says-ppp-committed-to-finding-solutions-to-ajks-political-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal says PPP committed to ‘finding solutions’ to AJK’s political situation</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Friday said PPP remained committed to resolving the political turmoil in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), reflecting on the party’s “reputation for finding solutions.”
The PPP chairman’s remarks come amidst the party preparing to move a no-confidence motion against the current AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar-ul-Haq, after the PPP’s ranks in the 53-member AJK legislative Assembly swelled to 27 after ten — all elected on PTI tickets in the July 2021 general elections — from the forward bloc joined the party on Sunday.
Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Bilawal said that his party “was in a position to form a government in Kashmir, being a majority,” while reaffirming that the party remained committed to “resolving the issues of Kashmir and honouring the hopes and dreams of its people.”
“Whatever the issues are, PPP has a reputation for finding political solutions,” Bilawal asserted.
The PPP Chairman acknowledged that the current legislative assembly, until the elections, will be a “test” for the PPP.
Bilawal vowed that “PPP’s foundation was laid down in the name of the Kashmir cause,” adding that “three generations of the PPP leaders have struggled for the cause’ on both national and international levels.
He continued: “We all know what the conditions were in the last elections, it was Khan sahib’s govt, and (we know) the role the establishment had at the time; however, even in those times, I’m proud of PPP representatives in AJK. PPP won the election, but overnight their victory was taken away; the same script was applied in Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well.”
He regretted that “due to non-political behaviour and mindset, a vacuum was created in AJK, as a result of which, the people are being harmed,” he said, cautioning that it may also “pose a threat” to the Kashmir cause on the international level.
He asserted that PPP “was the sole party which is capable of representing Kashmir within the country as well as internationally.”
He vowed to give a “befitting response” to any conspiracy against AJK.
“I promise the people of Kashmir that I will not disappoint you,” he concluded.
While a joint no-confidence motion against AJK PM — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.
On Thursday, after days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif endorsed the plan.
Sources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by the PPP chairman.
On Monday, addressing a press conference with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah today, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira had said: “It has been decided that the current AJK govt, which we both parties were part of, has become a basis of creating a crisis instead of solving problems.”
“Now there is a consensus of opinion that a no-confidence motion will be brought against it on which the PPP and PML-N will be together,” Kaira added.
Meanwhile, incumbent AJK PM Haq, who at one stage had decided to step down, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can.
A source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3118491032dd643.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952367/israeli-attacks-kill-three-palestinians-in-gaza-testing-fragile-truce' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli attacks kill three Palestinians in Gaza, testing fragile truce</strong></a><br><p>The Israeli military attacked the Gaza Strip for a fourth day on Friday, killing three people, Palestinian health authorities said, in another test of a fragile ceasefire agreement.
Residents reported Israeli shelling and gunfire in northern Gaza on Friday, as Israel continued to bombard areas of the enclave despite saying that it remains committed to a ceasefire brokered by United States President Donald Trump.
The Israeli military did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
Another Palestinian died of wounds sustained from previous Israeli shelling, the Palestinian WAFA news agency reported.
 
 

The US-brokered ceasefire, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip unresolved, has been tested by periodic outbreaks of violence since it came into place three weeks ago.
Between Tuesday and Wednesday, Israel retaliated for the death of an Israeli soldier with bombardments that Gaza health authorities said killed 104 people.
More bodies handed over
Gaza’s health ministry said the Red Cross had delivered to it 30 bodies of Palestinians killed by Israel during the fighting, a day after Hamas handed over two bodies of captives.
Under the ceasefire accord, Hamas released all living hostages held in Gaza in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian captives and detainees, while Israel agreed to pull back its troops, halt its offensive and increase aid.
Hamas also agreed to hand over the remains of all 28 dead captives in exchange for 360 Palestinian fighters killed in the conflict. After Thursday’s release, it had handed over 17 bodies, while 225 Palestinian bodies have so far been returned to Gaza.
Hamas has said that it will take time to locate and retrieve the bodies of all the remaining hostages. Israel has accused Hamas of violating the truce by stalling in the handover.
Two years of conflict in Gaza have killed over 68,000 Palestinians and left the enclave in ruins. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and bringing 251 hostages back to Gaza.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31161802f1ff745.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952295/kp-cm-sohail-afridis-all-male-13-member-cabinet-takes-oath-of-office-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi’s all-male, 13-member cabinet takes oath of office in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>A 13-member provincial cabinet picked by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took the oath of office on Friday in Peshawar.
According to a statement from the KP government, the cabinet’s swearing-in ceremony took place at the Governor’s House in Peshawar.
“KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath,” the statement said. “Those sworn in as provincial ministers included Meena Khan Afridi, Arshad Ayub Khan, Amjad Ali, Aftab Alam Afridi, Fazal Shakoor Khan, Khaleequr Rehman, Riaz Khan, Syed Fakhar Jehan, Aqibullah Khan and Faisal Khan Tarakai.
“KP Governor Kundi congratulated the newly sworn-in provincial ministers and expressed his best wishes to them,” it added.
According to an earlier summary sent to the KP governor by the provincial government, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, CM Afridi had selected his cabinet members, while also picking Muzammil Aslam and Taj Muhammad as advisers, and Shafi Jan as a special assistant.
The PTI’s KP chapter had also confirmed the names in a post on social media platform X.
 






Former KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra congratulated the new provincial cabinet and wished them all the best.
 






Afridi — who was elected the new provincial chief executive earlier this month — had previously insisted that he would announce his team after meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
However, after repeated attempts to meet the former premier were unsuccessful, Imran’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
Opposition members in the KP Assembly were criticising the ruling PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers had also voiced the fear that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
The PTI’s provincial chapter had previously also insisted that members of the previous cabinet with “corruption allegations and bad reputation” should not be part of the new one.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31174430b40fbdf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952361/fia-withdraws-corruption-case-against-ex-fbr-chief-shabbar-zaidi' target='_blank'><strong>FIA withdraws corruption case against ex-FBR chief Shabbar Zaidi</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Investigation Agency has withdrawn a corruption case filed against former Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman Shabbar Zaidi, it emerged on Friday.
On Thursday, the FIA booked him over allegations of issuing unauthorised income tax refunds amounting to Rs16 billion during his tenure as FBR chairman. Sources said the FIA’s Anti-Corruption Circle had accused Zaidi of criminal misconduct, abuse of authority, and unauthorised disbursement of public funds.
According to the FIA, three private banks, two cement factories, and one chemical company were the beneficiaries of these refunds. The agency alleged that these entities were clients of Zaidi’s private audit and consultancy firm prior to his appointment as FBR chairman, raising concerns of conflict of interest.
However, a notification issued by the agency’s Karachi division on Thursday said: “The Director, FIA Karachi Zone, has been pleased to accord permission for cancellation of case FIR No. 32/2025 dated 29.10.2025 … as well as classification of case as ‘C-Class’ and submission of discharge report … against the then chairman FBR (1) Syed Muhammad Shabbar Zaidi.”</p><small>2025-10-31 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3117221662e3010.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952359/shc-orders-committee-to-visit-karachi-zoo-for-brown-bear-rano-inspection-on-nov-2' target='_blank'><strong>SHC orders committee to visit Karachi zoo for brown bear Rano inspection on Nov 2</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) court on Friday ordered a committee formed by the Sindh chief minister to visit the Karachi Zoo on November 2 and prepare a report on the condition of the animals there, including Rano, the brown bear.
The case of Rano, a female Himalayan brown bear who stirred public outcry over her ailing health in the zoo, has brought into sharp focus the neglect of animals kept in captivity in Karachi. She will be relocated to a bear rehabilitation centre under the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, before being moved to Gilgit-Baltistan on the SHC’s directives.
In a previous order dated October 17 — available with Dawn.com — SHC Justice Iqbal Kalhoro ordered the committee to visit the Karachi Zoo in the company of petitioner Jude Allen Pereira, Dr Nazeer Hussain Kalhoro from the Sindh Institute of Animal Health, Advocate Jibran Nasir and wildlife photographer Zafeer Ahmed Shaikh and prepare a detailed report highlighting the “number of animals, their physical and mental condition and the circumstances under which they have been kept”.
According to a copy of today’s order posted on X by Nasir, the judge observed that the October 17 order had not been complied with and no visits to the zoo had been scheduled by the committee. It also noted that the cage had not been placed in Rano’s enclosure and that letters from Nasir to the committee had gone unanswered.
“With the consent of learned AAG, we fix [November 2] as a date for visit by the committee constituted in terms of order dated [October 10] to visit the own bear and other animals to ascertain their physical and mental health, especially of brown bear for the shifting of which to Islamabad this petition has been filed. Matter is already fixed on [November 6] and be taken the same date,” the order reads.
 






Nasir filed an application earlier today for an urgent hearing on the petition, arguing that no action has been taken regarding Rano’s relocation by the authorities.
“On October 17, government officials had asked for two weeks’ time for the transfer,” Nasir contended. “Despite writing a letter to the committee members on October 22, no member has responded yet.”
The lawyer added that Rano’s cage has not been prepared for her transfer, noting that it would take some time for her to acclimate to it once it’s ready.
 
 

“A team from Islamabad has examined Rano. The team has confirmed the presence of insects in three wounds on Rano’s body,” Nasir emphasised. “We want as many animals as possible to be inspected in daylight.”
Languishing in a barren cage, Rano, a Himalayan brown bear, was reportedly brought to Karachi Zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Earlier this month, the bear was undergoing treatment for a head injury, with a zoo official saying that she had been treated earlier for the same wound, which she probably suffered after hitting the metal bars of her cage.
In January, the KMC, on the mayor’s directives, had notified a three-member committee to assess Rano’s condition, in a bid to address concerns regarding her well-being.
The committee, in its report, recommended that “the species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar“ — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan — and suggested that Rano’s DNA testing be carried out to identify its exact species.
While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and finding no wounds/injuries on her body, it observed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.
The team also noticed “heavy noise” during the visit, and said it seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.</p><small>2025-10-31 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31124330ce4435c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952344/bulls-in-control-as-kse-100-gains-over-4800-points' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls in control as KSE-100 gains over 4,800 points</strong></a><br><p>Bulls were in control at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday as the benchmark KSE-100 index rose by more than 4,800 points with analysts attributing the rally mainly to the extension of the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The KSE-100 index rose by 4898.86 points, or 3.13 per cent, to close at 161,631.73 points, breaking a seven-day losing streak.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market rebounded today on “reports of Pakistan–Afghanistan ceasefire talks, the end of rollover week, and renewed institutional buying after the recent correction opened up valuations”.
“Focus now shifts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and any revenue measures (including possible tax increases) needed to meet targets,” he said, adding that investors will also watch Monday’s trade balance data for cues on the economic outlook.
“Retail investors should use equities primarily for long-term wealth creation, set asset allocation by age, liquidity needs and risk appetite, and avoid overexposure if they have short-term cash requirements,” he said, adding that “volatility is normal and should be expected”.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com that after the continuation of the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the market shifted focus “back to improving macroeconomic fundamentals”.
He added that the stocks of companies that reported strong results, or were pursuing expansion plans, saw sharp recoveries.
“In the near term, key triggers include the IMF Executive Board’s approval for the release of US$1.2bn, the financial close of the Reko Diq project, and the renegotiation of regasified liquified natural gas contracts with Qatar,” he said.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also agreed that the ceasefire with Afghanistan had helped market sentiment as he attributed the rally to “easing geopolitical tensions”.</p><small>2025-10-31 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/3117291334a2abc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952358/police-drivers-to-be-trained-for-newly-implemented-e-ticketing-system-sindh-police' target='_blank'><strong>Police drivers to be trained for newly implemented e-ticketing system: Sindh police</strong></a><br><p>Sindh police has launched a training drive to acquaint Karachi police drivers with the newly implemented e-ticketing system, it emerged on Friday.
On Monday, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS). Under the new mechanism, traffic police personnel monitor real-time violations through surveillance cameras installed across the city and dispatch tickets to the home addresses of the violators.
On Tuesday, more than 2,650 electronic challans were issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the system’s inauguration, amounting to up to Rs1.2 million.
Today’s decision was notified in a letter written by the director inspector general (DIG) of the Training Department of Sindh police to DIG Police Karachi, DIGs Traffic Karachi, Technical and Transport, Rapid Response Force, Special Protection Unit, Crime and Investigations, Counter-terrorism department (CTD) and Special Branch.
“The training — to begin from November 1 — will aim to strengthen the skills of police drivers and make them aware of the new TRACS law,” the missive said.
A total of 925 drivers from different departments of the Sindh police will receive training, which will be held over the course of two sessions, as per the missive.
Separately, in a statement, spokesperson Sindh police said that “500 personnel from Karachi range, 100 from traffic police, 100 from T&T, 50 from RRF, 25 from SPU/CPEC, 25 from Crime and Investigation, 25 from CTD, 50 from Special Branch and 50 from DIG Training will receive the training.”
The training sessions will be held at the Scouts Auditorium of the Sindh Boys Scout Association, the spokesperson added.
On Thursday,  a petition was filed in the Sindh High Court (SHC) impugning the system in the metropolis. The petition pleaded to declare its implementation, without prior adequate road infrastructure and ownership-verification safeguards, as illegal and unconstitutional.
Lawmakers of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) also voiced serious concerns over the implementation of the e-challan system, terming it a financial burden on citizens rather than a solution to traffic chaos.
What is the e-ticketing system?
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Admin Karachi Traffic Police Kashif explained that the system has been introduced as part of the Karachi Safe City Project.
A total of 1,076 cameras have been installed on main thoroughfares in the first phase.
When phases 2 and 3 of the initiative are completed, up to 12,000 cameras will have been installed in all areas of Karachi as well as on toll plazas.
Once a challan is initiated, it will be sent via Pakistan Post to an address linked to the number plate issued by the Sindh Excise and Taxation Department.
While the total time to pay off the challan is 21 days, if it is paid within 14 days, the violator would get a 50 per cent waiver on the amount. However, failure to pay within 21 days will result in the total amount being doubled on the 22nd day.</p><small>2025-10-31 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311620110e98106.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952355/power-division-announces-large-scale-rollout-of-smart-meters-across-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Power Division announces large-scale rollout of smart meters across Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) on Friday announced the large-scale rollout of smart meters across electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country, which it described as a “major step” towards improving customer service and operational efficiency.
According to the spokesperson of the Power Division, Zafaryab Khan, metering plays a vital role as the key interface between the customer and the service provider.
“In line with the ministry’s declaration of 2025-26 as the Year of Customer Service Improvement, Discos have embarked on a comprehensive digitalisation drive to modernise their infrastructure,” said a statement by the Power Division.
“This initiative aims to ensure real-time data availability, transparency, and enhanced customer experience.”
Recognising that the pricing of smart meters was a major impediment in this transformation, the Power Division actively intervened to rationalise costs, said the statement, adding that out of nearly 38 million electricity consumers nationwide, around 80 per cent are single-phase users.
The statement pointed out that until recently, the cost of a single-phase smart meter was around Rs20,000, which is “significantly higher than international benchmarks”.
“Through strategic interventions, open and transparent procurement, and continuous monitoring, the price has now been reduced to approximately Rs15,000,” the Division said.
“This intervention alone will result in an estimated annual national saving of around Rs25 billion, considering 5m meter replacements per annum,” the statement quoted the spokesperson as saying.
“The reduced meter cost will also ease the financial burden on consumers applying for smart meters, making advanced technology more affordable and accessible. It is further anticipated that through upcoming international competitive bidding processes, the prices will decline even further.”
According to the division, this intervention will ensure “significant improvement” in the meter reading process because human involvement will be minimal.
“Automated and remote readings will not only enhance accuracy but also build consumer trust in the billing system,” the statement detailed. “The elimination of manual readings will address long-standing concerns about faulty or disputed readings, fostering a more transparent and reliable relationship between consumers and their respective Discos”.
Once deployed, according to the division, smart meters will enable consumers to monitor their electricity usage in real time through mobile applications equipped with modern features. “This will empower consumers to better control their energy consumption and manage their electricity costs.”
Among the benefits for consumers, the division listed the following: real-time monitoring of electricity usage, greater control over energy consumption and billing, accurate, tamper-proof meter readings, and future enablement of prepaid metering services
On the other hand, the division said the benefits for Discos would include remote meter reading and billing accuracy, faster billing and complaint resolution, enhanced visibility and control of the power network, real-time outage detection and quicker fault restoration, as well as improved safety and operational management
“This initiative marks a significant milestone in the Power Division’s continued efforts to digitalise Pakistan’s power sector and provide efficient, transparent, and customer-centric electricity services,” the statement added.
“It is a key step toward the digitalisation of the power distribution system, which remains a crucial part of the ongoing power sector reform agenda of the Government of Pakistan.”
Last year, while chairing a review meeting on the performance of Discos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had termed overbilling by power utility companies as “unacceptable” and had called for the installation of smart meters to measure electricity use accurately.
According to the PM, these meters would ensure transparency in the billing system.</p><small>2025-10-31 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31152214ce93288.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952350/pakistan-denies-indian-media-report-on-dropping-not-valid-for-israel-from-passports-sending-20000-troops-to-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan denies Indian media report on dropping ‘not valid for Israel’ from passports, sending 20,000 troops to Gaza</strong></a><br><p>The information ministry on Friday denied “unverified or politically charged claims” by an Indian news channel about Pakistan preparing to dispatch 20,000 troops to Gaza and the country removing the clause from its passports that makes it invalid for travel to Israel.
Indian news outlet Republic TV had made the allegations, specifying the number of soldiers Pakistan was planning to send to Gaza “under the supervision of Western countries and Israel.” The channel, according to a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, had also “ridiculously claimed that Pakistan had also removed the ‘Not valid for Israel’ clause from the passport.”
In a statement on X, the information ministry referred to a press release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa), reiterating that “Pakistan’s stance on Israel remains unchanged, that is, Islamabad does not recognise Israel, and no military cooperation or engagement exists or is under discussion”.
 






Moreover, the ministry clarified that the passport clause remained intact.
“Directorate General of Immigration and Passports confirms it still reads ‘valid for all countries except Israel’”, said the statement.
Mofa’s stance, as pointed out by the ministry, is that Pakistan does not recognise Israel and steadfastly supports the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
“The claim originates solely from Republic TV, known for sensationalised anti-Pakistan narratives,” the information ministry added. “No international or regional media outlet has carried the assertion.”
The ministry further urged reliance on official statements and verified policy updates and to avoid “unverified or politically charged claims from partisan media”.
‘Decision to send troops to Gaza to be finalised’: defence minister
Earlier this week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said that the decision to send Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and “it is in process”.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
Questioned whether any such move was in the offing or not in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said: “This thing has to be finalised [and] it is in process. The government will decide to pass through the process, and I don’t want to preempt it.”
He said parliament would be taken on board and all institutions would be informed about the move.
The defence minister said if Muslim countries took a decision to participate in the peace force and Pakistan also had to take part, then it would be a “moment of pride for the country to play a role in protecting Palestinians”.
“This is an opportunity that Pakistan should avail itself of if it is available to us.”</p><small>2025-10-31 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31134049bf1e6b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952348/any-external-aggression-will-be-met-with-firm-and-severe-response-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Any external aggression will be met with firm and severe response: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that any external aggression against Pakistan will be met with a “firm and severe” response, a statement from the military’s media wing said on Friday.
His comments come against the backdrop of recent tensions with Afghanistan over Islamabad’s long-standing concern regarding terrorist attacks emanating from Kabul. For its part, Islamabad has demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, in May, the country faced a military standoff — the worst in decades — with neighbouring India. Following an intense, four-day escalation, the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, mediated by the United States.
Addressing a meeting today with students and academics from universities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) Abbottabad district, the DG ISPR asserted, “The armed forces remain committed to defending the country, and any external aggression will be met with a firm and severe response,” as per ISPR.
Lt Gen Chaudhry detailed that “Pakistan has taken effective steps against terrorism and Fitna Al Khwarij.”
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Since the group ended a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022, the country has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces.
The statement further mentioned that during the meeting, Lt Gen Chaudhry also talked about the current security situation, including Pak-Afghan tensions and Marka-i-Haq,“ adding that “students and teachers present paid tribute to martyrs.
The Pakistan Army has named the period of conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq”.
Vice Chancellor Hazara University, Dr Ikramullah Khan, lauded the armed forces’ role and vowed to stand with them, the statement said.
“Pakistan army’s resolve is a metaphor for their love for the country,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.
Khan was of the view that “terrorist elements are aiming to mislead our youth,” emphasising that the situation called for the dissemination of “accurate and reliable information.”
Per the statement, both students and teachers echoed similar views, stating that the discussion with DG ISPR “had helped dispel any false information they had regarding the Pakistan army, as well as the national and provincial situation.”
On October 21, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had said that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response.“</p><small>2025-10-31 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/311148147655d3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952342/islamabad-atc-issues-notice-to-police-in-narcotics-and-terrorism-case-against-journalist-matiullah-jan' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues notice to police in narcotics and terrorism case against journalist Matiullah Jan</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court in Islamabad issued a notice to police on Friday on an application for the provision of documents in a narcotics and terrorism case registered against senior journalist Matiullah Jan.
The case, registered at Margalla Police Station on November 28 last year, accuses the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics.
Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan has drawn strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintain that he is being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November last year.
 
 

At the outset of the hearing today, lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq submitted a power of attorney to Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on behalf of Jan.
He also contended that the journalist had been “portrayed as a terrorist” in the case.
Judge Sipra remarked that the other side needed to be heard as well and issued a notice to police for November 8 on an application by Jan for the provision of case documents and adjourned the hearing until the said date.
Lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who has also represented Jan in the case, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists President Afzal Butt and other journalists were also present in the court during the hearing.
At the last hearing  held yesterday, the ATC had rejected Jan’s acquittal plea.
It should be mentioned that several veteran journalists and human rights activists have demanded the immediate withdrawal of the case registered against Jan.
Jan’s arrest
According to the first information report (FIR) registered against Jan at Margalla Police Station, his car was stopped at a checkpoint in Sector E-9, where he allegedly resisted arrest, rammed his vehicle into a police barrier and snatched a rifle before being subdued.
The FIR invokes Section 9(2)4 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) for possessing 100 to 500 grams of crystal meth and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) for acts of terrorism.
Jan was arrested on the night of November 26, 2024, and initially remanded in police custody. However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had later overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody.
His defence counsels, Advocates Imaan Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha, had subsequently secured his post-arrest bail.
Meanwhile, Jan had written a letter to the Inspector General of Islamabad Police (IG), alleging abduction and torture prior to his arrest.
In the letter, Jan stated that on November 27, 2024, he and fellow journalist Saqib Bashir were abducted from the Pims Hospital parking area by men in police uniforms, blindfolded and taken to an unknown location where they were tortured and illegally detained.
He claimed that police later registered a bogus FIR at Margalla Police Station, accusing him of terrorism and drug smuggling. Jan said his colleague’s sworn affidavit before the Anti-Terrorism Court confirmed their abduction.
Jan also recalled his 2020 abduction, underscoring that such acts violated his constitutional and professional rights, as well as the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021.
He had urged the IG to appoint an honest and independent officer to investigate the case on merit.</p><small>2025-10-31 08:24</small></div><hr>
