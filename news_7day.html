<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18114953cb0dfe3.png?r=154439' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911768/we-will-never-bow-down-to-indian-hegemony-dg-ispr-says' target='_blank'><strong>‘We will never bow down to Indian hegemony,’ DG ISPR says</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said Pakistan “will never bow down to Indian hegemony” as the recent ceasefire with India holds.
“The truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced.
“We will never bow down to Indian hegemony. The sooner they realise this, the better it will be for regional peace and the world,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said to Anadolu Agency.
 


He argued that terrorism, extremism and hatred were India’s internal problems and that the New Delhi government was cracking down on groups including Muslims and Sikhs in the country, which was fuelling more anger, extremism and terrorism.
Earlier, the DG ISPR had said Pakistan is not a violent nation, reaffirming that the country’s top priority was peace as the recent ceasefire with India holds.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
“We are not a violent nation, we are a serious nation. Our first priority is peace,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told RT Arabic in an interview, according to PTV News.
“Great and sensible powers like the United States understand better what the spirit of Pakistan’s people is,” he added.
 






Detailing the ceasefire process, the DG ISPR said the Indian defence ministry’s spokesperson “personally requested a ceasefire”. It was unclear if the request was made to the US, which acted as a mediator, or Pakistan.
“We desire peace and stability, so we said, why not?” the military spokesman was quoted as saying by PTV News.
Lt Gen Chaudhry hailed the “tremendous work” done by diplomats by “engaging the international community with great wisdom and in an extraordinary manner”.
“Pakistan, with great maturity, responded promptly, firmly and effectively, forcing the enemy to face reality,” the DG ISPR asserted, referring to the downing of five Indian air jets in response to New Delhi’s deadly strikes on the night of May 6-7.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, killing over 30 civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets and later also intercepted dozens of its drones.
 
 

India then attacked Pakistani airbases and military targets on the night of May 9, prompting Pakistan to target its military installations using missiles and airstrikes under “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
“The nation and the Pakistan armed forces stood united like an unbreakable wall,” he said.
Recalling the events of May 9-10, when the tensions between the two neighbours reached their peak amid airstrikes, the DG ISPR stated: “The enemy fired more missiles on the night of May 9 and 10 to scare us. India forgot that Pakistan’s nation and its forces neither bow nor can be made to bow.
“On the morning of May 10, we responded, targeting only their military objectives with utmost responsibility and caution,” he added.
The military spokesperson stressed, “Not a single civilian target was harmed; it was an appropriate, just and balanced response.”
‘India rejected logical neutral probe’
During his conversation reported by PTV News, Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that to understand the Pak-India tensions, it was “essential to look into its background”.
“India is hiding behind a false narrative to conceal the truth,” the ISPR official said. He noted that while the Indian media started blaming Pakistan “within minutes of the Pahalgam incident”, its foreign ministry spokesperson admitted two days later that the investigation was underway.
 
 

“Where is the wisdom in making allegations without investigation and evidence?” Gen Chaudhry asked rhetorically.
He highlighted that the government had taken a clear stance that if there was any evidence, it should be given to an impartial institution, and Pakistan was ready to cooperate.
“India rejected this logical offer and, acting unilaterally, fired missiles at our mosques, martyring children, women, and elders,” the DG ISPR said.
“The sacred responsibility entrusted to the Pakistan armed forces is to protect the country’s sovereignty and borders,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that forces had fulfilled the duty and would “continue to do so at all costs”.
 
 

The DG ISPR reiterated the military’s stance that India was “sponsoring terrorism in this region, particularly in Pakistan”.
“India is the real sponsor of ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, whether it is the khawarij or terrorist groups active in Balochistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that the state refers to as Fitna Al Khawarij.
Last month, the military’s chief spokesperson had detailed that a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India was arrested in Punjab’s Jhelum.</p><small>2025-05-18 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18214351d5047c3.jpg?r=214409' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911806/2-dead-11-injured-as-blast-rips-through-market-in-balochistans-qila-abdullah-officials' target='_blank'><strong>2 dead, 11 injured as blast rips through market in Balochistan’s Qila Abdullah: officials</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and at least 11 were injured after an explosion ripped through a market in Balochistan’s Qila Abdullah district on Sunday evening, officials said.
Deputy Commissioner Qila Abdullah Riyaz Khan told Dawn.com, “Two people were killed while 11 were injured in the explosion.”
According to the initial investigation, the explosives were planted in a vehicle, DC Khan said, adding that the bomb disposal squad and law enforcement officials were summoned and an investigation was launched.
“An emergency was declared at the District Health Headquarters in Qila Abdullah, where medical assistance was being provided to the injured,” he said.
In a separate statement given to Dawn.com, Qila Abdullah Levies Risaldar Gulab Khan said, “The blast took place near the Abdul Jabbar Market in the Gulistan area of Qila Abdullah district, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to 11 others.
“After the explosion, Levies personnel and people present at the scene immediately rescued the injured, who were then moved to the District Health Headquarters Chaman for treatment.”
According to the official, officers began an investigation after collecting evidence from the scene.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.

Last week, War Mamond Police Station House Officer Niaz Mohammad said that a suspect allegedly shot dead a 28-year-old married woman, and then killed a 33-year-old man. He added the suspect’s gunfire also hit a 70-year-old woman, who was pronounced dead at the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar, after suffering serious injuries.
 
 

The police officer, who visited the site of the incident, said that the suspect fled after committing the crime, saying the 28-year-old was said to be the relative of the killer. However, he had said that efforts were underway to arrest the suspected killer after registering a case against him.
According to a statement issued today by the HRCP, the organisation strongly condemned the murder of three individuals in the Bajaur district.
“Such acts of violence are a gross violation of the right to life and reflect deeply entrenched patriarchal norms,” the statement said.
 






In a post on X, the organisation urged authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation, ensuring that the perpetrators are held accountable under the law and that the incident is treated as a non-compoundable offence.
“The state must become a party in all such cases,” it said.
In Pakistan, honour killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-05-18 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/182016079d6f528.jpg?r=201630' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911797/fm-dar-to-visit-china-tomorrow-to-discuss-evolving-regional-situation' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar to visit China tomorrow to discuss evolving regional situation</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will undertake an official visit to Beijing from May 19 to 22 to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability, a statement from the Foreign Office said on Sunday.
The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following last week’s ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the Pahalgam attack in Occupied Kashmir — which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.  On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down five Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
China had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.
According to today’s statement, FM Dar will travel to China tomorrow (Monday) at the invitation of the Chinese FM Yi and will hold in-depth discussions there.
“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the FO said.
“The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”
It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China.
Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which was termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.
In March, China extended the repayment period of a $2 billion loan to Pakistan by one year, offering much-needed financial relief and helping stabilise the country’s foreign exchange reserves.</p><small>2025-05-18 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1820002476f6471.jpg?r=200753' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911802/verstappen-wins-emilia-romagna-grand-prix' target='_blank'><strong>Verstappen wins Emilia Romagna Grand Prix</strong></a><br><p>Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won a gripping Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Sunday, holding off the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.
The Dutch driver overtook pole-sitter Piastri on the opening lap and the four-time defending world champion fought off the McLarens for the full 63 laps to claim his fourth win at Imola.
Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton produced a rousing display for the Italian fans, taking his Ferrari from 12th on the grid to finish in fourth with teammate Charles Leclerc adding further cheer for the tifosi as he brought home the second Ferrari in sixth.
Alexander Albon, who started on the fourth fow of the grid, followed his fifth place in Miami with another fifth in Imola, his Williams teammate Carlos Sainz coming home eighth.
Piastri heads the championship with 146 points, 13 clear of Norris and 22 ahead of Verstappen.</p><small>2025-05-18 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/181922472d99adc.jpg?r=200136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911800/3-killed-in-two-separate-shooting-incidents-in-balochistans-panjgur-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 killed in two separate shooting incidents in Balochistan’s Panjgur: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people were killed on Sunday in two separate shooting incidents in Balochistan’s Panjgur district, police said.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Zahid Lango said, “Two people were shot dead in the Gomazin area of Panjgur, while another one was killed in a shooting incident in the Zandian Daz area of Panjgur.”
The bodies were moved to the Teaching Hospital Panjgur and were consequently handed over to the heirs, he said.
The deputy commissioner added that an investigation into the killings was underway and action was being taken to arrest the suspects.
The development comes amid a tense security situation prevailing in the province.
In Kalat on Friday, unknown armed men shot dead two people, including a woman, in the Killi Mulki area.
One person was killed and 10 others injured when a blast struck the convoy of PPP MPA Ali Madad Jattak in Quetta on Wednesday.
Last week, at least six people died and seven others were injured in separate incidents in Quetta, Kharan, Surab and Uthal.</p><small>2025-05-18 15:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/181940300ece243.jpg?r=205610' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911801/saudi-airline-resumes-first-iran-haj-flights-since-2015-official' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi airline resumes first Iran Haj flights since 2015: official</strong></a><br><p>A Saudi airline has resumed flights for Iranian Haj pilgrims to the kingdom for the first time in a decade, the latest sign of the warming ties between the countries.
“Flynas resumed Iranian pilgrims flights from Imam Khomeini (airport) in Tehran on Saturday,” a Saudi civil aviation authority official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The official said flights would also be added from Mashhad in Iran, allowing more than 35,000 pilgrims to travel to Saudi Arabia on the airline. Flynas is a budget airline based in Saudi Arabia, which operates domestic and international routes.
The official stressed that the flights were not commercial and were only for the Haj pilgrimage.
The Haj is due to begin during the first week of June, and pilgrims from across the globe have already begun pouring into Saudi Arabia.

Shiite-dominated Iran and Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia resumed relations in March 2023 under a surprise China-brokered deal after a seven-year rupture.
Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran in 2016 after its embassy in Tehran and consulate in the northwestern city of Mashhad were attacked during protests after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
No Iranian pilgrims were allowed into Saudi Arabia in 2016, the year that ties were ruptured, as the two sides were unable to organise a protocol for them to attend.
In September 2015, a stampede during the Haj killed up to 2,300 worshippers, among them hundreds of Iranians.
Pilgrims from Iran were later allowed to join the Haj but were only allowed to travel to Saudi Arabia on Iranian chartered flights during the Haj season.
But since the March 2023 Iranian-Saudi rapprochement, the regional powers have intensified their contacts.
The two exchanged ambassadors and visits of foreign ministers before the late Ebrahim Raisi made the first visit by an Iranian president to the kingdom in 20 years for a joint Arab-Islamic summit on the Israeli invasion of Gaza in November 2023.
In December, Iran Air resumed operations between Mashhad and Dammam in eastern Saudi Arabia.
And last month, Saudi Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman travelled in a rare visit by a Saudi royal to Iran where he also met supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The moves come as the United States and Iran have held four rounds of talks aimed at hammering out a new accord on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
US President Donald Trump hinted during his tour of the Gulf that the two sides were “getting close” to a deal, but also warned Tehran to move quickly towards sealing an agreement or “something bad will happen”.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Saudi Arabia just days before Trump began his regional tour last week.</p><small>2025-05-18 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1819152880b2787.jpg?r=192230' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911793/govt-achieved-economic-revival-under-pm-shehbaz-will-provide-relief-in-next-budget-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Govt achieved economic revival under PM Shehbaz, will provide relief in next budget: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Sunday that the country has achieved economic revival under the leadership of PM Shehaz Sharif, assuring the provision of relief to the public in the upcoming budget.
The government will present the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on June 2. PM Shehbaz has assured that providing relief to the common man in the upcoming budget was the government’s priority, and all-out resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and middle class.
A delegation comprising the PML-N leader, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Energy Minister Awais Leghari called on Governor Sindh Kamran Tessori in Karachi today, while MQM leaders Farooq Sattar, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Faisal Sabwari, and Nasrin Jalil were also present on the occasion.
Addressing the media after the meeting, Sanaullah said that Pakistan had emerged out of an economic crisis due to the untiring efforts of the economic team comprising the finance minister and PM Shehbaz.
“The country achieved economic revival under the leadership of the prime minister, and now, in the upcoming budget, there will be good news for the common man,” Sanaullah said.
He added the recent conflict with India had shown the world that Pakistan was a responsible nation and that the armed forces and their chiefs deserved the nation’s gratitude for the victory.
Sanaullah also assured that the government will present a budget that will push the country towards economic prosperity.
Speaking on the occasion, MQM’s Sattar said that maximum relief should be given to the common man in the upcoming budget and the burden on the salaried class should be reduced.
“During today’s meeting, we discussed the reforms suggested by the IMF (International Monetary Fund), including increasing agriculture tax on landlords,” he said, adding that if taxes could be imposed on the salaried class, direct taxes could be imposed to expand the tax base, too.
Sattar said the government should improve the urban packages for Karachi and Hyderabad, and expedite the completion of the K-IV water project, which the prime minister had assured will be completed by December 2026.
He added the funds allocated for road infrastructure in Karachi should not lapse and instead be increased for the next fiscal year so that the problems of sanitation and road repair affecting the city are resolved.
Governor Tessori pointed out how India attempted to stop the disbursement of the next tranche of IMF funds during the conflict, “but it was eventually approved due to the efforts of the finance minister.”
He said the MQM leaders briefed the delegation and business leaders on the urban projects in Karachi.
“Pakistan will achieve economic and political stability within the next year, and we will give a message to India when we celebrate the first anniversary of our May 10 victory,” he said.
The PML-N delegation arrived in Karachi and earlier met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and PPP’s Naveed Qamar at the CM House.</p><small>2025-05-18 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1818021170d42e6.jpg?r=180216' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911796/peace-committee-member-killed-in-exchange-of-fire-with-militants-in-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Peace committee member killed in exchange of fire with militants in Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>A peace committee member lost his life during an exchange with militants in the Begukhel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, police said on Sunday.
The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
According to a police statement, “Around 50 militants attacked the Begukhel village with small and heavy weapons on Saturday night in an apparent revenge act.”
The peace committee and local people responded vigorously, according to the statement.
“During the two-hour-long encounter, a volunteer of the peace committee was killed,” it said.
A search operation is underway in the area by the police and security forces, the statement added.
On Thursday, the police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos launched a joint operation against terrorists in rural areas of the district.
Last month, local elders announced that they would fight anti-peace elements side by side with police to effectively eradicate the menace of terrorism from the district.
On April 28, the killing of an elderly man and the injuring of his two relatives and a neighbour by terrorists sparked a fierce gun battle between the assailants and members of a local peace committee.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-05-18 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1817583680b369f.jpg?r=182614' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911795/polish-presidential-vote-tests-whether-pms-european-vision-is-trump-proof' target='_blank'><strong>Polish presidential vote tests whether PM’s European vision is Trump-proof</strong></a><br><p>Poles were voting on Sunday in a presidential election that will decide whether Warsaw follows the pro-European path set by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, or shifts in the direction of nationalist admirers of US President Donald Trump.
Trump’s return to power has energised eurosceptics across Europe, and Sunday’s ballot will be the biggest test of Tusk’s pro-European vision since he came to power in 2023, ousting the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party.
The election pits Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Tusk’s Civic Coalition, against conservative historian Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by PiS.
Trzaskowski has been cast as the frontrunner, likely to face Nawrocki in a run-off, due on June 1, if no candidate wins over 50 per cent. Voting ends on Sunday at 9pm (12am Pakistan Standard Time), with exit polls expected soon afterwards and results trickling in overnight and on Monday.
Also competing are far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen from the Confederation party, Parliament Speaker Szymon Holownia of the centre-right Poland 2050 and Magdalena Biejat from the Left.
State news agency PAP reported that Nawrocki encouraged all Poles to take part in the election after voting in Gdansk, saying it was important because “we are shaping our future”.
Trzaskowski said that “every election is a celebration of democracy” after voting in Warsaw. The electoral commission said voting was proceeding calmly.
Czeslaw Wegorek, a 64-year-old courier who was voting in the northern port city of Gdansk, said he wanted someone focused on the future of the population, “not more quarrels”.
Warsaw resident Barbara Zurawska said that for her, housing for young people was a key issue.
“It’s really hard for young people now. They live with their parents for a very long time, and it’s hard to take out loans and repay them,” she said.
Europe under pressure
The Polish first-round vote takes place on the same day as a second-round presidential run-off in Romania, where George Simion, a nationalist who campaigns to “Make Romania Great Again”, faces centrist Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan.
A victory for two eurosceptic candidates would send shockwaves through the European Union as the bloc grapples with the twin challenges of Russia’s invasion of Poland’s eastern neighbour Ukraine and Trump’s tariffs.
The Polish president has limited executive powers but can veto legislation. That has allowed outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, to stymie efforts by Tusk to undo judicial changes implemented under PiS, which Tusk says hamper democracy.
Trzaskowski has pledged to cement Poland’s role as a major player at the heart of European policymaking and work with the government to roll back PiS’s judicial changes.
Nawrocki’s campaign was rocked by allegations, which he denies, that he deceived an elderly man into selling him a flat in return for a promise of care he did not provide. But Trump showed support by meeting Nawrocki in the White House.
Nawrocki casts the election as a chance to stop Tusk from achieving unchecked power and push back against liberal values represented by Trzaskowski, who as Warsaw mayor patronised LGBT marches and took down Christian crosses from public buildings.
Unlike some other eurosceptics in central Europe, Nawrocki supports military aid to help Ukraine fend off Russia. However, he has tapped into anti-Ukrainian sentiment among some Poles weary of an influx of refugees from their neighbour.
He has said Polish citizens should get priority in public services and criticised Kyiv’s attitude to exhumations of the remains of Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War Two.</p><small>2025-05-18 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18180423b207ecf.jpg?r=182134' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911791/pakistan-to-send-high-level-diplomatic-mission-globally-to-expose-indian-propaganda-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to send high-level diplomatic mission globally to ‘expose Indian propaganda’: state media</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.
“In a telephonic conversation with Chairman Pakistan People’s Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him,” the report said.
The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report added.
“It will also underscore Pakistan’s sincere efforts for peace and stability in the region.”
Yesterday, former foreign minister Bilawal, in a post on X, announced that he was appointed by the premier to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.
 






In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-18 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1813071510dc4ab.png?r=130955' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911773/several-held-in-india-over-alleged-links-to-pakistan-remarks-on-military-officers' target='_blank'><strong>Several held in India over alleged links to Pakistan, remarks on military officers</strong></a><br><p>Indian police have arrested multiple people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation between the two countries, Indian media reported on Sunday.
The development follows a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed as “Operation Sindoor”.
The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll.
Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.
In a social media post on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings.
He wrote: “Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynching, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens.
“The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is importantly [sic] but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy,” Mahmudabad noted.
“The grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united in its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea,” he further said.
 
 

The Haryana State Commission interpreted his remarks as “an attempt to vilify national military actions”, the Hindustan Times reported.
The Haryana State Commission for Women had taken suo motu cognisance of his remarks on Col Qureshi, saying they undermined women officers in the Indian armed forces and fomented communal discord.
ThePrint, in an editorial, said: “The vicious hounding and egregious arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad for expressing his opinion is a shameful insult to our millennia-old democratic tradition.
“His argument about war and domestic politics is a constitutional freedom. As is your right to disagree. Calling it an insult to women or military is senseless.”
Separately, Indian police have arrested travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra along with five others from Punjab and Haryana over alleged espionage for Pakistan, according to Indian media.
Malhotra, a 33-year-old from Haryana’s Hisar district who runs the YouTube channel ‘Travel With Jo’, was detained under India’s Official Secrets Act 1923 for allegedly “transmitting sensitive information to Pakistani operatives”, according to India News Network (INN).
 
 

According to the FIR, she came into contact with the alleged Pakistani operative two years ago and visited Pakistan twice, The Hindu reported.
Dawn.com has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on the claims.
Malhotra had uploaded videos on her YouTube channel of her visits to renowned Sikh sites Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab, with the latest published in March 2025.
According to the Minority Rights Group, Sikhs have a “significant” presence in Haryana and form a majority in Punjab.
The vlogger’s father, who retired from the Haryana electricity department, denied the allegations and said her daughter was being implicated, The Hindu added.
Those arrested with Malhotra included a security guard, a university student and civilians alleged to have “received money or instructions from Pakistani contacts”, according to INN.
Among the suspects are Guzala from Malerkotla in Punjab and her “friend” Banu Nasreena, who were granted Pakistani visas in April 2025, the report claimed.
Also named in the case is Arman from Haryana’s Nuh district, who allegedly provided Indian SIM cards and transferred money on behalf of the operatives.
In another crackdown, Assam Police, acting on army intelligence, arrested seven people and busted a racket allegedly using fake SIM cards to share sensitive information with “Pakistani agents”, Times of India reported.
Other than those seven, 14 were under interrogation.
 
 

Times of India quoted Assam police chief Harmeet Singh as saying that police teams were dispatched to Telangana’s Hyderabad as well as cities in Rajasthan and Assam.
Saddik, Arif Khan, and Sajid were arrested in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur and Alwar, while Akeek was taken into custody at the airport in Assam’s Guwahati, Singh said.
Arsad was arrested at the New Delhi airport, Mofijul in Telangana, Jakariya in Assam’s Bilasipara town, Time of India reported.
Pakistani journalists take reports with a grain of salt
On the other side of the border, Pakistani journalists and commentators have cast doubts on the reports by Indian media, which aired multiple fake news stories during the recent tensions between the two countries.
 
 

A New York Times article yesterday also highlighted how Indian media “amplified falsehoods”, noting that “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war”.
Journalist Hamid Mir, while responding to an Indian user who shared videos of her blog and accused her of being a spy, wrote on his X account that Malhotra “was not spying and only making a video for her YouTube channel”.
“Spies don’t make videos for public use […] they make secret videos for secret use. Pakistan doesn’t need these kind of spies.”
 






Another Pakistani journalist, Ammara Ahmed, wrote: “Jyoti Malhotra deserves a good lawyer and a fair trial.”
 






Journalist Ailia Zehra, who covers politics and human rights, described the entire episode as “ridiculous”.
“What state secrets could a YouTuber possibly have? Ridiculous,” she wrote.
 






Podcaster Shehzad Ghias Shaikh noted: “The message is quite clear, no Indian content creator is to have any interaction with Pakistan or they will be penalised.

With this latest accomplishment, he becomes the first Pakistani in history to complete all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks — commonly referred to as the eight-thousanders — without any oxygen support, a feat achieved by only a handful of elite mountaineers globally.
Sirbaz had earlier become the first Pakistani climber to have summited all 14 mountains with the height of over 8,000m in the world in October last year.
 






Imagine Nepal, the tour organisers of Sirbaz in a statement congratulated the climber, saying, “ We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Mr Sirbaz Khan — our dear friend, client, and partner from Pakistan — on his incredible achievement of summiting Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, without supplemental oxygen this morning, May 18, 2025.
Alpine Club of Pakistan Secretary Karrar Haidri, said, “With this summit, Sirbaz Khan becomes the first Pakistani to climb all 14 highest peaks without oxygen.
“Sirbaz Khan has made the entire nation proud. Completing all 14 eight-thousanders without oxygen is a rare and heroic achievement. He is a symbol of Pakistani resilience, skill, and courage on the highest peaks of the world,” he added.
Sirbaz achieved a landmark in the history of high-altitude climbing by successfully summiting Mt. Kangchenjunga this morning at 5:00am local time (4:15am PKT).
What makes this feat extraordinary is that Sirbaz scaled the world’s third-highest mountain without the use of supplementary oxygen, in true alpine style — marking a defining moment in Pakistan’s mountaineering legacy.
Sirbaz’s journey to this historic milestone has spanned over a decade of determination, discipline, and sheer courage. He has successfully scaled the following 14 peaks over 8,000m — all without bottled oxygen:

Everest (8,848m)
K2 (8,611m)
Kangchenjunga (8,586m)
Lhotse (8,516m)
Makalu (8,485m)
Cho Oyu (8,188m)
Dhaulagiri (8,167m)
Manaslu (8,163m)
Nanga Parbat (8,126m)
Annapurna I (8,091m)
Gasherbrum I (8,080m)
Broad Peak (8,051m)
Gasherbrum II (8,035m)
Shishapangma (8,027m)

This record-breaking summit of Mt. Kangchenjunga not only cements Sirbaz Khan’s place among the greatest mountaineers of all time but also brings immense pride to the people of Pakistan, particularly the mountaineering community of Gilgit-Baltistan, where Sirbaz hails from.
His accomplishment was made in the spirit of pure alpine climbing — minimal gear, no fixed ropes or camps set by Sherpas, and no oxygen support — a style that represents the truest and most demanding form of mountaineering.
Sirbaz’s mission has always been to represent Pakistan on the world’s highest stages and inspire the next generation of climbers to follow his path with the same passion and perseverance.
Sirbaz, 35, hails from the Aliabad area of Hunza in Gilgit-Baltistan and began his climbing career in 2016.
On four of these expeditions, he had been accompanied by late Muhammad Ali Sadpara.
Before setting on the mission to summit Dhaulagiri peak last year, he had said: “I am looking forward to his expedition and reaching closer to the dream of my mentor Ali Sadpara, who had the similar dream of scaling the 14 highest peaks, but tragically lost his life earlier this year during a winter expedition on K2.”
Pakistani climbers including Naila Kiani, Sajid Sadpara, civil society members, and politicians have congratulated Sirbaz for his historical feat.</p><small>2025-05-18 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18140259e593f5a.jpg?r=141104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911778/pakistan-aims-to-bridge-south-and-central-asian-economies-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan aims to bridge South and Central Asian economies: minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan has said that Pakistan aims to emerge as a key transit hub, bridging the economies of South Asia and Central Asia, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
A high-level delegation from Pakistan, led by the federal minister, participated in the Kazan Forum organised under the auspices of the Russian Federation in the capital of Tatarstan.
“Gwadar Port has already started shipment and cargo services, while Pakistan intends to facilitate Central Asia’s access to warm waters,” Radio Pakistan quoted the minister as saying while addressing the closing session.
Aleem said the Mazar-i-Sharif to Kohat Railway Project is expected to cost around $633 million. He spoke about Pakistan’s strategic plans to connect Karachi, Quetta and Gwadar cities with Central Asia and Europe through road networks.
The minister welcomed the holding of the Kazan Forum and reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment to playing an active role in regional development.
On the opening day on Friday, while addressing the session on Cultural Dialogue, the minister emphasised that Pakistan possesses a rich historical and social heritage, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
He welcomed cultural exchanges with Russia and Central Asian states, terming such initiatives a positive and promising step towards achieving a peaceful world and paving the way for harmony.
Aleem underscored the importance of preserving multifaceted cultural heritage and stressed that through mutual dialogue and understanding, the world can become more peaceful, diverse and harmonious.
He appreciated the organisation of the ‘Russia-Islamic World Kazan Forum 2025’ and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to playing an active role in the region, particularly in the communications sector, to enhance trade and strengthen the national economy.
On the sidelines of the forum, the minister held a meeting with the chairman of Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. They discussed matters related to shipping and cargo logistics between Pakistan and Dubai ports.
Aleem highlighted Pakistan’s keen interest in ‘North to South’ land connectivity and noted that the country is modernising its communications infrastructure. He mentioned that in the first phase, the use of M-Tag has been made mandatory for toll collection on motorways and highways.
The chairman of the Dubai ports expressed strong interest in expanding bilateral trade relations and deliberated on various projects, including investing in Pakistan’s M6, M9, and N-25 Highways.
Both sides discussed the broader agenda of the Kazan Forum and expressed their commitment to enhancing future cooperation and strengthening bilateral relations.</p><small>2025-05-18 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/181526163421a56.jpg?r=155921' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911785/pope-leo-urges-unity-for-divided-church-vows-not-to-be-autocrat' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Leo urges unity for divided Church, vows not to be ‘autocrat’</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo XIV formally began his reign on Sunday by reaching out to conservatives who felt orphaned under his predecessor, calling for unity, vowing to preserve the Catholic Church’s heritage and not rule like “an autocrat”.
After a first ride in the popemobile before tens of thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square, Leo was formally installed as the 267th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign monarch of Vatican City at an outdoor Mass.
Well-wishers in the crowd waved US and Peruvian flags, with people from both countries claiming him as the first pope from their nations.
Born in Chicago, the 69-year-old pontiff spent many years as a missionary in Peru and also has Peruvian citizenship.
Crowds chanted “Viva il Papa” (Long Live the Pope) and “Papa Leone”, his name in Italian, as his distinctive, open-topped popemobile weaved around St. Peter’s Square.
Robert Prevost, a relative unknown on the world stage who only became a cardinal two years ago, was elected pope on May 8 after a short conclave of cardinals that lasted barely 24 hours.
He succeeded Francis, an Argentine, who died on April 21 after leading the Church for 12 often turbulent years during which he battled with traditionalists and championed the poor and marginalised.
US Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert who clashed with Francis over the White House’s hardline immigration policies, led a US delegation alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Catholic.
Vance briefly shook hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the start of the ceremony. The two men last met in February in the White House, when they clashed fiercely in front of the world’s media.
In his sermon, read in fluent Italian, Leo said that as leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, he would not shrink before modern challenges and that, at least on social issues such as combating poverty and protecting the environment, he would continue the legacy of Pope Francis.
Leo said the cardinals who elected him had chosen someone “capable of preserving the rich heritage of the Christian faith and, at the same time, looking to the future, in order to confront the questions, concerns and challenges of today’s world”.
Appeal for unity
Francis’ papacy left a divided Church, with conservatives accusing him of sowing confusion, particularly with his extemporaneous remarks on issues of sexual morality such as same-sex unions.
Saying he was taking up his mission “with fear and trembling”, Leo used the words “unity” or “united” seven times and the word “harmony” four times.
“It is never a question of capturing others by force, by religious propaganda or by means of power. Instead, it is always and only a question of loving, as Jesus did,” he said, in an apparent reference to a war of words between Catholics who define themselves as conservative or progressive.
“Brothers and sisters, I would like that our first great desire be for a united Church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world,” he said.
Conservatives also accused Francis of ruling in a heavy-handed way and lamented that he belittled their concerns and did not consult widely before making decisions.
Referring to St. Peter, the 1st century Christian apostle from whom popes derive their authority, Leo said: “Peter must shepherd the flock without ever yielding to the temptation to be an autocrat, lording it over those entrusted to him. On the contrary, he is called to serve the faith of his brothers and sisters, and to walk alongside them.”
Underscoring the unbroken lineage of popes from St. Peter, the choir chanted the traditional hymn “Tu es Petrus”, Latin for “You are Peter”.
Many world leaders attended the ceremony, including the presidents of Peru, Israel and Nigeria, the prime ministers of Italy, Canada and Australia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. European royals also took their place in the VIP seats near the main altar, including Spanish King Felipe and Queen Letizia.
As part of the ceremony, Leo received two symbolic items: a liturgical vestment known as a pallium, a sash of lambswool representing his role as a shepherd, and the “fisherman’s ring”, recalling the first pope, St. Peter, who was a fisherman.
The ceremonial gold signet ring is specially cast for each new pope and can be used by Leo to seal documents, although this purpose has fallen out of use in modern times. It shows St. Peter holding the keys to Heaven and will be broken after his death or resignation.</p><small>2025-05-18 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/181419393c0afb0.jpg?r=144419' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911779/at-least-17-killed-in-building-fire-in-indias-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>At least 17 killed in building fire in India’s Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>At least 17 people died after a fire ripped through a building in the Indian city of Hyderabad, local officials said on Sunday.
The large blaze broke out in the early hours of the day in a three-storey building which houses a jewellery store.
A statement from the fire disaster response emergency and civil defence department in southern Telangana state, where Hyderabad is located, said they had received the call for help just after 6am local time (5:30am PKT).
“The fire broke out on the ground floor and spread to the upper floors. Firefighting, search & rescue operations were carried out simultaneously,” it said.
The statement also listed the names of 17 individuals who lost their lives.
“The suspected cause of the fire is under investigation,” it said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his “deep grief” over the loss of life and announced compensation of 200,000 rupees (around $2,300) to the next of kin of each victim.
“Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana,” Modi said in a statement released by his office.
“Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon.”
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.
Last month, a fierce fire broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
And last year, least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.</p><small>2025-05-18 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1814050408e7385.jpg?r=140744' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911673/hbl-psl-2025-warner-inspired-karachi-kings-upstage-peshawar-zalmi-to-make-playoffs' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025: Warner-inspired Karachi Kings upstage Peshawar Zalmi to make playoffs</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Babar Azam played a masterpiece here at a jam-packed Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday. But the captain’s knock could not help Peshawar Zalmi cross the line thanks to an imposing total put up by Karachi Kings.
Babar’s 49-ball 94 — studded with 10 fours and four sixes — was the standout innings of the high-scoring match in which Zalmi sought to overhaul the 238-run target as the HBL Pakistan Super League X resumed with a bang after a nine-day hiatus due to military clashes between India and Pakistan.
But despite Babar’s show, Zalmi fell short by 23 runs in the end with the victory securing Kings a spot in the playoffs.
 


Zalmi, on the other hand, will now need to beat Lahore Qalandars in their last league stage match to make the playoffs.
The drone strike by India very close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week seems to have only rejuvenated the tournament, with great fanfare and renewed fervor marking the PSL’s resumption.
Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, Inter-Services Public Relations director general Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi were all present at the stadium to witness and encourage the spirited crowd.
Before the start of match, the national anthem was played and tributes were paid to the martyrs of Pakistan’s recent military conflict with India.
The ceremony also featured fireworks as national flags dotted the stadium. Soon, there were fireworks from the Kings thanks largely due to captain David Warner and James Vince.
Kings, who were put into bat, had a disastrous start to their innings when pacer Luke Wood cleaned up Ben McDermott on the very first ball of the match with a slightly short ball that nipped back sharply.
But Vince joined Warner to resurrect the innings and in the process helped Kings cross 50-mark in five overs. After Warner welcomed part-time spinner Saim for a couple of fours on the off-side in the second over, right-handed Vince belted three fours in the fourth bowled by pacer Ali Raza. Vince in the next over struck a six over deep square leg and a four while Warner contributed a boundary as medium-pacer Ahmed Daniyal started off with an 18-run over.
Kings collected 57-1 in the powerplay.
Warner and Vince continued to trouble Zalmi bowlers after the powerplay. While Warner smashed a six off leg-spinner Arif Yaqoob in the eighth over, both the batters took a boundary each off Ali in the next over. Vince completed his half-century off just 29 balls as he pulled Arif for a boundary lifting Kings to a solid 100-1 at the halfway stage.
Ahmed in the 11th over conceded 14 runs as Warner hit him for back-to-back fours while Vince collected a boundary with a straight shot. Warner got to his half-century off 31 balls with a four in the 12th over by Hussain Talat.
Warner in the 13th over thumped Saim for a four with a reverse sweep before lifting him for a six on the on-side. Vince’s straight four made it a richer.
Hussain was walloped for three fours by Warner in the 14th as Kings crossed 150 in 13.4 overs.
Vince’s superb 42-ball 72 — laced with 11 fours and a six — was finally ended in the 15th over by Ali who induced the batter to play a faster ball that nibbled away as wicket-keeper Haris took the catch. The dismissal ended a marathon 162-run partnership off 89 balls.
Wood dismissed Irfan Khan Niazi who was caught by Babar at long-on in the 16th as Kings slumped to 165-3.
After making 86 off 50, Warner was caught by Saim on the mid-wicket boundary off Arif in the 17th over. The southpaw struck 11 fours and two sixes.
From 167-4, Khushdil Shah (43 not off 15) and Mohammad Nabi (26 not out off 10) steered Kings to a massive 237-4 adding 70 runs off just 25 balls.
Zalmi made a brisk start to the chase that included back-to-back fours by Saim off paceman Hasan Ali in the third over, Mohammad Haris (nine) in an attempt to play a lofted shot was caught by James Vince off paceman Hasan Ali in the same over.
At 30-1 in the third over, entered Babar. Saim and Babar helped their team post 59-1 in the powerplay as the former in a ramp shot lifted pacer Abbas Afridi for a six over fine leg.
Both the batters got reprieve. In the fifth over, Babar was dropped by Abbas at third man off fast bowler Mir Hamza in the fifth over while Saim got a life in the ninth over when wicket-keeper Saad Baig failed to grab a high ball off Hasan Ali.
Saim and Babar added 77 off 47 balls before the former was sent back to the pavilion by Abbas in the 11th over, caught by Vince. The left-hander made 47 off 31 balls with the aid of five fours and a couple of sixes.
Tom Kohler-Cadmore played a 15-ball cameo of 20 before getting caught by Warner at point off pacer Mir Hamza in the 17th over. This ended a 62-run stand between Kohler-Cadmore and Babar. Max Bryant (seven) soon followed as the asking rate touched an almost-impossible 22-plus.
When Babar was run out while trying to take a second run in the 18th over, it was all over for Zalmi.
Maaz Sadaqat and Hussain Talat tried hard but it was too little too late as Zalmi ended their innings at 214-5.

• Clashes in exam schedules caused by numerous subjects offered by the board, claims Cambridge representative
KARACHI: With several examples of clash of paper schedules in the current Cambridge exams, students and parents have been demanding a revision in their date sheets as it is putting extra pressure on the candidates who then have to sit for two exams, sometimes even three, in one day.
Besides the mental stress, students have also been complaining of their hands getting tired while sitting for back-to-back exams. Their parents, too, are saying that they drop everything to be available for their children during exam time. They wait in the sitting areas outside exam centres during every paper and when there are two papers, they have to be there for the entire day.
“We are paying lacs of rupees for the exams. The least that Cambridge can do for us is listen to us and see our plight and reschedule the exams where there are any such clashes of papers taking place on the same day,” said one parent.
Some private school associations have also raised their voices over this matter in the hope that the Cambridge management in Pakistan would pay some heed.
Academic and activist Kashif Mirza, who is the president of All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) was of the opinion that Pakistanis are paying billions to Cambridge as these are expensive exams. Cambridge should at least be considerate enough to not put so much stress on the candidates despite taking so much money from them.
 
 

“You also have the poor parents sitting outside exam centres. And when the children are appearing in two or more papers in a day, it means double duty for the parents,” he pointed out.
“Besides, two exams in one day means that a candidate cannot do justice to both the subjects he or she is appearing in,” he added.
“My request to Cambridge under these circumstances is that since they are making so much money here at our expense, they should at least upgrade their infrastructure instead of stressing out the candidates just because they couldn’t come up with a better schedule.
“They should keep a cushion of days in their exam schedules to address the clash of subjects,” he suggested, adding that such issues of paper clashes in exam schedules are usually seen happening in South Asian countries, not in Europe where Cambridge follows a different strategy.
“Cambridge needs an overhaul here. They should design a software, maybe using AI, if they can’t do it themselves, to come up with better exam schedules. In this day and age, students are also sitting for their exams online. Such mechanisms should also be developed and introduced by Cambridge,” said the APPSF president.
Cambridge International’s Country Director Uzma Yusuf, meanwhile, said that they are the biggest exam board in the world, which comes with plenty of responsibility. “We are not deliberately putting undue pressure on students,” she said.
“We are there in some 160 countries of the world. It is a huge responsibility. We are the Cambridge University’s exam board. The clashes in exam schedules happen due to there being so many subjects on offer by Cambridge,” she said.
 
 

“Besides,” she said, “there is a general perception here in Pakistan that every paper is of a duration of three hours only but there are also Cambridge exams which may be of durations of 40 minutes or maybe one hour and 10 minutes.”
“So a student is not sitting in the examination hall for three hours in the morning and coming back for another three hours in the afternoon,” she said.
“Where there may be a clash between papers, a student may sit for his or her morning paper, take a break, rest, have something to eat or drink under centre supervision and then sit for the other paper,” she said.

The matter was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Rafaqat Ali, father of Shakeel Tanoli, had lodged FIR with the Khanna Police Station, Islamabad on June 19, 2022.
A local court of Islamabad had acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan in February.
As per the FIR, a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) allegedly driven by the daughter of the Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan ran over two Savour Foods workers near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway at midnight and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.

Victim’s father says he lodged FIR out of misunderstanding

As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague Hasnain Ali were going home after the work when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
While the judge’s family reportedly reached a settlement with the family of Hasnain Ali, Rafaqat Ali vowed to pursue the case legally.
Rafaqat Ali has now changed his mind and stated in the affidavit that he nominated Shanzay Malik because of misunderstanding.
He further stated that he verified with different sources and found that neither Ms Malik nor anyone from his family was involved in the incident.
“Subsequently, I am withdrawing the appeal in this case and have no objection over her acquittal in the case.”
According to the details brought to the judicial record, the woman fled, leaving behind the vehicle.
The police took the vehicle into custody, which was later given to an official of the Lahore High Court on ‘superdari’ in July 2024 upon assurance that ‘he shall produce the vehicle in the court as and when required’.
In July 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that the luxury vehicle of the Lahore High Court (LHC) involved in hit and run case in which two persons were killed was driven by a woman and was in the use of Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed, who was elevated to the Supreme Court after the incident.
In February this year, judge’s daughter Shanzay Malik was acquitted by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.
Advocate Siddique Awan, counsel for Ms Malik, argued before the court that police could not produce any substantial evidence as the entire story of prosecution was based on secondary facts.
He argued that the case was registered 11 days after the accident, and the police could not give any explanation for the delay. He contended that the police could not produce any video evidence, and the photos submitted in the court did not clearly identify his client.
He also pointed out that Shanzay Malik was nominated only after the plaintiff’s delayed statement in July 2024.
Earlier, reports indicated that Ms Malik had been granted pre-arrest bail after being on the run for more than two years.
Legal proceedings saw the deletion of Section 322 of the Pakistan Penal Code (causing death by rash or negligent driving), which is a non-bailable offence, and replacing it with Section 320 (causing death without intent), a bailable offence.
Rafaqat Ali has challenged the acquittal order before the Islamabad High Court.
Following submission of the affidavit, IHC Justice Mohammad Asif dismissed the appeal against acquittal.

• Experts say drivers often lack patience, refuse to give way to others
• Law enforcement, public awareness stressed to tackle rising accidents
KARACHI: Amid a sharp rise in accidents mostly involving heavy vehicles resulting in deaths of hundreds of people in Karachi in recent months, officers of law enforcement agencies, healthcare providers and civil society members have stressed the need for strict implementation of traffic laws, their awareness among the public and sought urgent reforms in road infrastructure and safety systems in the metropolis.
They were speaking at a seminar, “Road Traffic Accidents in Karachi: Causes and Solutions”, which was organised at the Arts Council of Pakistan by its Medical and Social Welfare Committee here on Saturday.
The event started with a presentation by Ali Suhag, in charge of Sindh Police Accident Analysis Research Centre (SPAARC). He pointed out that education and information about traffic laws were key elements in prevention of accidents, but 98 per cent of people only knew how to operate vehicles and lacked basic knowledge of rights of others on the road, traffic rules and safe and responsible driving practices.
Mr Suhag also highlighted behavioural issues and said that drivers often lack patience and refuse to give way to others, even in emergencies.
 
 

He also criticised the common refusal to wear helmets and gave the example of a case where a man told him that his son avoided wearing helmet because it “ruins his hairstyle”. Such attitudes reflected a dangerous ignorance that must be addressed through consistent education and law enforcement, he concluded.
Dr Sabir Memon of the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma asked citizens to act responsibly and highlighted the global impact of traffic accidents.
“Around 1.3 million people die each year in road accidents worldwide, with most incidents occurring in middle-income countries,” he said.
About Karachi, Dr Memon said that a sharp rise in accident cases had been seen lately. “Previously, we received about 100 cases daily, but now that number has grown to nearly 150 per day,” he said, adding that two-thirds of the victims were motorcyclists, many of whom were young boys and teenagers.
He also spoke about the serious consequences of such accidents and pointed out that many accident victims were sole breadwinners of their families who suffered life-altering injuries and then were unable to return to work.
 
 

Those injuries didn’t just affect individuals; they impacted entire families and caused social and economic loss and burden of healthcare sector, he said.
Speaking on the occasion, DIG-Traffic Pir Mohammad Shah said that while law enforcement was a key issue, public awareness of traffic laws was equally important.  Providing statistics, he said that 55pc of road accident victims were motorcyclists, 32pc pedestrians and the rest involved cars and other vehicles.
He then outlined multiple causes behind road accidents, which included over-speeding, lack of lane discipline and the absence of a proper system to monitor the load carried by heavy vehicles.
He said overloaded trucks without under-run bars, side under-run rails or guards often led to fatal accidents, especially when motorcyclists were run over during collisions.
The officer also pointed out that motorcyclists overtaking from the left side of heavy vehicles was a major contributor to such accidents.
He also raised concerns about the mental and physical fitness of heavy vehicle drivers, which he said was currently under investigation.
DIG Shah noted that the shortage of traffic signals was another major issue. That was primarily due to insufficient funding for the Traffic Engineering Bureau. He added that efforts were underway to make the department more autonomous in the near future.
 
 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Qaisar Sajjad said that up to 207 deaths had been reported in the city so far this year, most of which involved heavy vehicles.
He said lack of law enforcement, poor infrastructure such as broken roads and weak coordination between departments were significant problems. There were also widespread encroachments on roads and footpaths which left no space for pedestrians and created serious hazards, he added.
He emphasised that these issues must be urgently addressed to reduce the rising number of traffic-related fatalities.
Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Foundation also spoke.

The court turned down the application moved by suspect Natasha Danish after hearing arguments from both sides and announced that she will be indicted in the case on June 21.
Initially, the suspect was booked and arrested for recklessly driving the Toyota Land Cruiser and killing 60-year-old Imran Arif and his 22-year-old daughter, Amna, and wounding three others in an accident near Karsaz in August last year.
Later, another FIR was lodged against her after medical reports confirmed that she was under the influence of methamphetamine (ice) at the time of driving.
The applicant, through her lawyer, filed an application under Section 249-A of the criminal procedure code, seeking her acquittal in the case registered under Section 11 (drinking liable to tazir) of the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order (PEHO), 1979.
 
 

The lawyer for applicant argued that the entire case was based on concocted statement and double jeopardy and the case in question was registered after a delay of 11 days, despite the fact that an FIR was already lodged at the same police station for the said incident.
The defence counsel also contended that registration of the second FIR was made in violation of the law and a judgement of the Supreme Court.
A public prosecutor opposed the plea and argued that the prosecution has sufficient evidence to connect the applicant with the offence. He argued that the case was also still at the pre-trial stage.

Imran alias Manu was taken into custody for trying to create public unrest during the recent Indo-Pak border tensions by “posting derogatory words” against the Pakistan Army’s chief, Inter-Services Public Relations director-general and security agencies through his Facebook account, according to an FIR registered at the Tordher police station on Friday.
The police said an inquiry had been initiated against the accused.
They said the accused had been sent to Swabi judicial lockup after appearing in a local court. Also, the Kalu Khan police arrested Zahid Zaman of the Sheikh Jana village in Razaar tehsil on Thursday after booking him under Peca.
The FIR said that Zahid had tried to “create distrust and hatred among the public by using malicious words” against the Pakistan Army’s chief and ISPR DG through his Facebook account.
The police said an inquiry had been launched against the accused, while his Facebook posts had been obtained for use against him.
Meanwhile, a cleric from Tordher village has mysteriously gone missing, with residents declaring him a case of enforced disappearance.
Maulana Fatehullah is a prayer leader in a Jahangira mosque near his village. He allegedly used “inappropriate words against Pakistani officials and praised India” during a recent sermon.
In the video available with Dawn, the cleric said Pakhtuns no longer supported Pakistani officials for pursuing a policy against the former’s interests.
There is no word from the PTI about the detention of its workers.
A senior police official said an action had been initiated under Peca against all those who were “bent on harming the country and its prestigious institutions.”
CHARAS SEIZED: The police foiled an attempt to smuggle charas and ice drug by seizing them in a large quantity from the secret compartment of a motorcycle.
Tehsil Chota Lahor DSP Mohammad Noman told reporters that 8,092 grams of charas and 1,553 grams of ice drug were recovered from detainee Mashal Khan.
Also, drug supplier Niaz Mohammad was arrested after the recovery of three packets of hashish and 533 grams of ice drug along with a gun and a pistol.

The ship snapped all three of its masts as it collided with the New York City landmark late on Saturday, while onlookers enjoying the balmy spring evening watched in horror.
“At this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,” Adams posted on X.
 






Footage shared online showed the Mexican Navy ship Cuauhtemoc, its sails furled and festive lights draped in its rigging, as it tried to pass beneath the bridge, which sheared off the masts and sent them crashing into the East River.
Hundreds of cheering spectators had gathered minutes earlier to bid farewell to the ship, which had been docked at a pier in southern Manhattan since Tuesday.
The Mexican Navy said in a statement that two crew members died in the crash, with a further 22 injured — half of them critically.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on X that she was “deeply saddened” by the two crew members’ deaths.
The ship lost power at around 8:20 pm (7am PKT on Sunday) while the captain was manoeuvring the vessel, forcing it to head for the bridge abutment on the Brooklyn side, New York police chief of special operations Wilson Aramboles told a press conference.
Several sailors at the top of the ship were injured when it crashed into the bridge, Aramboles said.
It is not clear if these sailors are among the dead.
There was “panic on the ship,” Brooklyn resident Nick Corso, 23, who was standing near the water, told AFP.
He had been poised to take a photo, but when he realised what was happening, he switched to video.
“Lots of screaming, some sailors hanging from the masts, looked like panic happening on the ship,” he said.
“I didn’t see anyone fall into the water, but lots of people up top. People ran back and were screaming!” Corso, who does marketing for the entertainment company VeeFriends, said.
“The one thing that stood out to me was the panic on the ship, and there was a guy at the back waving for people to move away from the walkway we were on,” he said.
Bridge reopens
The Mexican Navy said in its statement that no one had fallen into the water, and that no rescue operation had been launched.
The ship had been departing New York at the time, and flags also fluttered in the rigging, while an enormous Mexican flag waved off its stern.
Seconds after the ship left the dock, “suddenly we saw all the lights, how they collided, hit the bridge, and they (the sailors) all fell down,” Arturo Acatitla, a 37-year-old New York resident, told AFP.
“While inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge,” the New York transport department posted on X.
The bridge, which leads from Brooklyn into Manhattan, was closed for some 40 minutes before reopening.
Victims were taken to the hospital, Mexican ambassador Esteban Moctezuma Barragan told a news conference, and sirens could be heard near the scene.
New York Police Department’s Aramboles said the Cuauhtemoc, a barque built in 1982, which had a mast height of 48.2 metres (158 feet), was sailing to Iceland when it crashed.
“With mariachi, folk ballet and a community full of emotion, we celebrated its arrival at Pier 17 in Manhattan,” the embassy post said.
The Cuauhtemoc was damaged in the “mishap,” the Mexican Navy confirmed in a statement on X.
“The Ministry of the Navy reaffirms its commitment to the safety of its personnel, transparency in its operations and excellence in the training of future officers of the Mexican Navy,” it said.
The ship was later moved to near the Manhattan Bridge, an AFP journalist saw.
The New York Police Department advised residents on X to avoid the area due to “heavy traffic” and “a large presence of emergency vehicles.”

The incident is the second deadly ship crash into a bridge in the United States in little over a year, after a vessel smashed into a bridge in Baltimore in March 2024, causing it to collapse and killing six road workers.</p><small>2025-05-18 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1811381185dc612.jpg?r=115110' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911767/fbi-calls-deadly-california-fertility-clinic-bombing-an-act-of-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>FBI calls deadly California fertility clinic bombing an ‘act of terrorism’</strong></a><br><p>A bomb exploded on Saturday outside a California fertility clinic, killing one person in what the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) labelled a terror attack.
The blast tore through downtown Palm Springs, ripping a hole in the clinic and blowing out the windows and doors of nearby buildings, an AFP journalist on the scene reported.
“Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,” Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, told reporters near the site of the fatal explosion.
“This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we’ve had in southern California,” he added.
He confirmed that one person near the clinic at the time of the blast had been killed and that four others were wounded. Work was ongoing to identify the deceased, he added.
Asked whether the clinic was deliberately targeted, Davis answered: “We believe so, yes.”
The city’s mayor, Ron deHarte had earlier told AFP that investigators confirmed a bomb exploded in or near a vehicle outside the clinic.
Eyewitnesses told local media they had seen human remains near the American Reproductive Centres clinic, with aerial footage of the scene showing the building’s roof had collapsed.
Debris for ‘several blocks’
The charred remnants of a vehicle lay in a parking lot, some distance from the apparent epicentre of the explosion.
Debris was blown straight through the building and scattered across the road, while the roofs of a number of nearby buildings had been damaged, indicating the intense force of the blast.
Davis of the FBI described the explosion as “significant” and said debris had been thrown more than two hundred yards (180 meters) from the scene, but declined to comment further on the characteristics of the bomb.
The local ABC affiliate, which cited an unnamed law enforcement source, said the person who died was a suspect in the blast.
Davis told reporters that though the FBI was working to identify the deceased, “we are keeping that close hold in order to protect the integrity of the investigation”.
A statement posted on social media by the clinic said no staff had been hurt, and that its lab — “including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials — remains fully secure and undamaged.”
It said that “a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building.”
Reproductive care, including abortion and fertility services, remains controversial in the United States, where some conservatives believe the procedures should be outlawed for religious reasons.
Violence against clinics providing such services is rare, but not unheard of.
‘Unforgivable’
President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to determine exactly what had happened.
“But let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable,” she said in a statement on social media.
People living near the clinic reported feeling the shaking from the blast throughout the city.
Matt Spencer, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, told the Palm Springs Post he ran outside as soon as he heard the blast, and was confronted with the sight of the burned-out car and what appeared to be a body in the middle of the road.
“In front of the building [the car] was blown clear across four lanes into the parking lot of [Desert Regional Medical Centre],” he told the paper.
“I could see the back of the car still on fire, and the rims, that was the only thing that distinguished it as a car.”
The Centre for Reproductive Rights, a global advocacy group, described the bombing as “horrific” and “unconscionable.”
“The history of violence against reproductive health centres is why clinics need protections and patients must feel safe,” its president, Nancy Northup, said in a statement.</p><small>2025-05-18 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/18094103e509c87.jpg?r=094325' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911693/indian-veterans-to-be-redeployed-as-security-guards-in-held-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>Indian veterans to be redeployed as security guards in held Kashmir</strong></a><br><p>SRINAGAR: Military veterans will be redeployed as security guards in India-occupied Kashmir, New Delhi said on Saturday, a week after reaching a ceasefire with Islamabad.
The government of the occupied state in Srinagar approved a “proposal for mobilising ex-servicemen (ESM) to safeguard vital infrastructure”, according to a government press release.
Around 4,000 veterans have been “identified” as non-combatant volunteers, out of which 435 have licensed personal weapons, it said.
This will help by “significantly enhancing the capacity to respond effectively to localised security situations”, the government added.
 
 

Veterans will work in “static guard” roles, focusing on “presence-based deterrence and local coordination”.
India already has an estimated half a million soldiers permanently deployed in held Kashmir.
But last year, thousands of additional troops, including special forces, were deployed across the occupied territory’s mountainous south following a series of deadly attacks that had left more than 50 soldiers dead in three years.

“We request Army Chief General Asim Munir to keep a vigilant eye on the country’s policymakers who are bent on causing irreparable losses to the country,” said Nasir Khan, vice president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), during a press conference on the amendments held at the Federation House on Saturday. He was accompanied by other FPCCI leaders.
Nasir Khan recalled that the army chief had assured the business community of safeguarding investments in Pakistan. “The enemy is not only on the border — it is also formulating destructive policies that are forcing investors and citizens to flee the country,” he added.
FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon expressed concern over the sweeping powers granted to tax officials under the new ordinance, adding that under the amendments, a Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officer can penalise a taxpayer without due process, depriving the individual of the right to appeal.
He said FBR officials have been given authority to recover amounts without issuing prior notice and to monitor industrial operations directly — moves that, he warned, would open floodgates to corruption.
Mr Magoon questioned whether FBR officials had been granted a “certificate of honesty” to justify such unchecked powers. He criticised SRO55 and SRO69 relating to sales tax, pointing out calculation errors that are causing delays in the filing of sales tax returns. Additionally, he noted that in SRO55, the measurement units have been changed to kilograms, which would create operational complications for businesses.
He also pointed to a contradiction in FBR’s approach: while a faceless system with no human intervention has been introduced for goods clearance, the Inland Revenue continues to create hurdles for taxpayers.
Mr Magoon accused the FBR of pursuing its own policy in contradiction to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which is working to attract investors. “While SIFC aims to create investor confidence, the FBR is actively harassing them,” he stated.
He reiterated national support for the prime minister’s vision to achieve $100 billion in exports, but said the FBR’s actions directly conflict with this goal.
Mr Magoon also hinted at a possible new ordinance that would abolish the captive power option — a move he urged the government to reconsider. He pointed out that industries have invested billions in captive power and called for dialogue with stakeholders before taking such a drastic step.
Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani termed the Tax Ordinance Amendments 2025 regressive and anti-business, warning that they pose a serious threat to Pakistan’s already fragile economy.
He said the ordinance directly contradicts the government’s stated objective of providing a business-friendly environment. Mr Bilwani criticised the lack of consultation, questioning why such critical changes were made without parliamentary debate or industry input.
He also condemned the excessive advance tax demands based on presumed income, calling it a flawed approach that ignores business cycles and seasonal fluctuations. He warned that this would hit small and medium enterprises and export-oriented units hardest, potentially paralysing their working capital and pushing many into default or closure.
He noted that the ordinance criminalises procedural non-compliance, adding that even minor clerical errors or delays caused by technical issues could now result in severe penalties, heavy fines, or even criminal prosecution. He emphasised that the amendments do nothing to broaden the tax base.
“Once again, the burden is being placed on those already in the system, while vast informal sectors, including retail, real estate and agriculture, remain untouched.”
He also criticised the government’s decision to promulgate the ordinance via executive order, bypassing the parliamentary process.
SITE Association of Industry (SAI) Chairman Ahmed Azeem Alvi urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to withdraw the ordinance, warning that its provisions undermine the documented economy, discourage compliance, and risk reversing the progress made in broadening the tax base.
He warned that the ordinance would damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan urgently needs economic stability.

The organisation called for strengthening the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre to function as a dedicated facility for wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and veterinary care.
“A move to transfer the snow leopards from Gilgit-Baltistan to Moscow not only contradicts national and international conservation commitments but also risks setting a highly detrimental precedent for future transfer of threatened and iconic wildlife species from Pakistan,” WWF-Pakistan said in a letter to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination on the proposed transfer of two snow leopards, currently housed at the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, to the Moscow Zoo, Russia.
According to WWF-Pakistan, the snow leopard is listed as a threatened (vulnerable) species on the IUCN Red List (2017), and it receives the highest level of legal protection under Pakistan’s national and provincial wildlife legislation.
 







Body says no ‘compelling conservation rationale’ for transferring these animals

Additionally, the species is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which strictly prohibits international trade except under exceptional, non-commercial circumstances.
It further said there was no compelling conservation rationale for transferring these snow leopards to Russia, a country that already hosts a significantly larger wild population of the species.
WWF-Pakistan recommended that instead of exporting the country’s unique natural heritage, Pakistan should demonstrate global leadership by reinforcing its commitment to conservation and the protection of its remaining wild snow leopard populations.
 
 

It also highlighted the risk that once the snow leopards were transferred, it would be difficult to monitor or ensure the well-being of these animals under Russian jurisdiction.
Remarking on the proposed move, Hammad Naqi Khan, WWF-Pakistan director general, said that approval of this export would undermine decades of conservation progress and significantly damage Pakistan’s standing in the global conservation community.
This moment called for reaffirming stewardship of national biodiversity and strengthening the institutions responsible for its protection, rather than yielding to external pressures that compromised long-term conservation goals.
“We need to uphold Pakistan’s obligations under international agreements such as CITES and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) by prioritising the protection of vulnerable and critically endangered species within national borders,” Mr Khan added.
WWF-Pakistan said it strongly recommended steps to strengthen the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre to function as a dedicated facility for wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and veterinary care, equipped to manage future confiscations and care cases.
It also asked for enhancing the capacity of the Gilgit-Baltistan Parks and Wildlife Department through targeted technical training, adequate financial support, and provision of essential operational equipment.

While incarcerated PTI leaders including ex-ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, ex-governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Senator Ejaz Chaudhry were produced before Judge Manzer Ali Gill, who conducted the hearing inside the Kot Lakhpat jail, the latter was informed that ex-minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was shifted to Punjab Institute of Cardiology for a cardiac complaint before the hearing commenced.
Also, PTI’s former lawmakers Aliya Hamza Malik and Rubina Jamil, social media activists Sanam Javed and Tayyaba Raja, fashion designer Khadija Shah and other suspects out on bail attended the hearing inside the jail.
Senior lawyers Burhan Moazam Malik and Rana Mudassir Umar appeared on behalf of the suspects.
 
 

After being provided with the copies of the charge-sheet, the suspects were informed that they would be indicted on May 24 in the case.
Judge Gill of the ATC-1 later adjourned the proceedings.
Sarwar Road police had registered an FIR against the PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking and vandalising the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander, during the May 9 protests against the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan in a graft case by National Accountability Bureau.
Terrorism charge under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, and various other offences, including waging or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added to the FIR.
Meanwhile, another ATC court extended the pre-arrest bail of former legislator Aliya Hamza Malik till May 26 and two sisters of Mr Khan in multiple cases of attacks on police till May 30.
Ms Malik appeared before the court on the expiry of her bail period while Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan sought one-time exemption from personal appearance.

The objection was raised through an application filed by senior counsel Faisal Sid­diqi on behalf of the SIC after the party had requested the constitutional bench to decide the 26th Amendment issue before hearing the review petitions against the apex court decision of July 2024 in the reserved seats case.
Also through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the SIC had requested the constitutional bench to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions scheduled for May 19 (tomorrow).
Mr Siddiqi, who filed the application seeking reconstitution of bench, had also expressed an intention of challenging the composition of the 11-judge bench during the May 13 proceedings after which the court postponed the proceedings till May 19 to allow the party to file a formal application.

Five major objections to the composition of the 11-judge constitutional bench raised

In the fresh application, the party raised mainly five objections to the composition of the bench hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case.
 
 

It highlighted that the July 2024 judgement was issued by a full court comprising 13 judges. It pointed out that the constitutional bench while taking up the review petitions comprised 13 members but later the strength was reduced to 11 members. It argued that the any judgement can only be reviewed by a bench having same numerical strength that the original bench had. Thus, the existing 11-judge constitutional bench could not review the petitions, the SIC reiterated.
Besides, it argued, since the two dissenting judges of the original 13-judge bench namely Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqil Ahmed Abbasi had not recused themselves from hearing the matter, they could not be excluded from the review bench.
It was a settled law, the SIC added, once a bench was constituted and seized of a matter on the judicial side, it could not be reconstituted in exercise of any administrative powers by the SC unless those members had recused themselves or there was some constitutional or legal bar requiring the reconstitution of the bench.
 
 

Otherwise, it would amount to stifling the independent view of an individual judge, the party argued. “Any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,” the party emphasised.
According to the SIC, if the two dissenting members were excluded by the present CB, then under no provision or principle of constitutional and statutory law, could they be considered a part of the existing bench by fictional irrationality making it a 13-judge bench and then again by fictional irrationality counting their dismissal decision at the time of final adjudication. “There is no principle of the constitution or law that allows judges, by fiction, be considered to be sitting on a bench, hearing and adjudicating a particular case without these judges being actually present during such hearings,” it reasoned.
The SIC further argued that the July 2024 judgement was not delivered under pre-existing appellate jurisdiction as envisaged under Article 191A(3) and thus, the present challenges could not be considered review petitions to be transferred to the existing constitutional bench under Article 191A(5) of the Constitution. The review petitions must be heard and adjudicated by all the same serving judges who were part of the full court that delivered the July judgement, it emphasised.
Also, the SIC argued that since the constitutional bench under Article 191A(6) had not formulated any rules regulating its practice and procedure, the SC Rules, 1980, Order 26 dealing with review jurisdiction would apply to the CB under which the review applications have to be placed before the same bench that had delivered the original decision.
