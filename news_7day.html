<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17155812b5a2fd6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973897/govt-does-not-want-to-politicise-imrans-health-says-interior-minister-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Govt does not want to politicise Imran’s health, says interior minister Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health, while blaming the opposition for doing the same.
The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January.
Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday.
“The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment.
“Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said.

 

“Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted.
Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations.
Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.”
“Our intention was that the check-up be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination.
Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.
There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders, and according to Naqvi, the delegation expressed satisfaction over the treatment.



However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements.
Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.”
He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to.
“I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed. He further said that the name of Kasim, who he said was a cousin, was also given by the party to come along, which was allowed.



“When both things had taken place, they said ‘no, not like this, you must admit him to a hospital for a week and we will not accept anything else’,” Naqvi claimed.
The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it.
“But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.”

According to a handout issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz met IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi at the Vienna International Centre.
“The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for IAEA’s role in the promotion of responsible use of nuclear technology in areas such as cancer diagnosis and treatment, agriculture, nuclear power generation and industrial applications,” the statement said.
“He praised the strong partnership between Pakistan and the IAEA, while observing that Pakistan was not only a beneficiary of the IAEA’s technical cooperation programme but was also contributing to the work of the IAEA through the provision of its experts and conducting international trainings for IAEA member states,” the press release said.
The handout added that IAEA director general acknowledged Pakistan’s “experience and expertise in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and the high quality of its engineers, scientists and technicians”.
“Among other things, he appreciated Pakistan’s contribution to the work of the IAEA in the areas of nuclear safety and security,” the statement said.
It said that Grossi further said that Pakistan was “well placed” to help other member states in the “peaceful applications of nuclear technology”.
He also looked forward to Pakistan’s “active participation” in the Nuclear Energy Summit being organised by France in March 2026, the statement said.
Later, an agreement was signed on the designation of the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology (INMOL) in Lahore as an IAEA collaborating centre.
The statement said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who was also present, and Grossi signed the agreement.







In a post on X, Dar said it was “good catching up” with Grossi.
“We discussed the vital role of the IAEA in advancing peaceful uses of nuclear technology and strengthening global nuclear safety and security,” he said.
“Conveyed my best wishes for his continued efforts in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear technology and sustainable development,” he added.







Grossi said in a post on X on Monday night that he was honoured to welcome PM Shehbaz.
“His visit underscored Pakistan’s commitment to the safe and responsible use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes,” he said.
He further said that he was proud to designate INMOL as an IAEA collaborating centre as “we strengthen our cooperation to expand cancer care, radiopharmaceutical production and nuclear medicine services, among others”.

Rahman, 60, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, takes office facing urgent challenges, including restoring political stability, rebuilding investor confidence, and reviving key industries such as the garment sector after the prolonged turmoil that followed the Gen Z-led uprising that toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in 2024.
An interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus ran the country through the transitional period leading up to the election.

 


Breaking with tradition, the swearing-in ceremony was held under the open sky at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building, instead of the Bangabhaban, the president’s official residence, where such events are usually organised.
President Mohammed Shahabuddin officiated as Rahman and his cabinet took their oaths in the presence of senior political figures, diplomats, civil and military officials, and representatives from invited countries, including China, India and Pakistan.
Rahman’s BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority, returning to power after nearly two decades. The Jamaat-i-Islami, contesting its first election since a 2013 ban was lifted following Hasina’s ouster, won a record 68 seats.
Hasina’s Awami League party was banned from contesting after its registration was revoked by the Election Commission.
Jamaat and its allies, including the National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a prominent role in the movement that toppled Hasina, will form the opposition.
Rahman’s elevation caps a long and turbulent political journey. He returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, arriving shortly before his mother’s death.
Rivals have long criticised his political record, pointing to corruption allegations he denies, but his return energised party supporters and reshaped the BNPs campaign.
In his first remarks after the election, Rahman urged calm and restraint, saying: Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost.
He called on supporters to avoid retaliation, warning: We will not tolerate any kind of chaos.
Earlier today, Rahman and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a deadly 2024 uprising.
The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.



‘Peaceful opposition’
Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround, with the BNP coalition winning 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.

 

Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.
But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.
Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

 

Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.
“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.
“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”</p><small>2026-02-17 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171528375e19534.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973899/usman-tariq-confident-pakistan-can-bounce-back-after-india-drubbing-in-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Usman Tariq confident Pakistan can bounce back after India drubbing in T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Usman Tariq said on Tuesday he was confident that Pakistan can bounce back from their T20 World Cup drubbing against India and seal qualification for the next round.
India’s 61-run romp means Pakistan must beat Namibia in their final match in Colombo on Wednesday to qualify for the Super Eights.
A defeat would eliminate Pakistan, who are third behind the USA on net run rate in Group A.
It would also leave an outside chance for the Netherlands to qualify, but they would need a big win over co-hosts India in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.
“Lifting the team is only difficult when you don’t work on your mistakes committed in the last game,” Tariq told reporters.
“We have worked on our mistakes, so I think it will not be a tough task. “We have a resolve not to commit the same mistakes again.”
Pakistan were criticised for asking India to bat then folding meekly for 114 in 18 overs chasing a stiff 176 target.

 

“We can feel their (fans’) disappointment because the match is watched by the whole nation,” Tariq said.
“So we feel their pain, but I am sure when we play them (India) next, we will put up a better show.”
Tariq dismissed rumours that batting star Babar Azam and pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi could be dropped against Namibia after poor performances against India.

 

“Both Azam and Shaheen have won many matches for Pakistan, so if they did not perform well in one game, we should not write them off,” said Tariq.
Pakistan have faced Namibia only once before in a T20 international.
“Whoever we play, we have the confidence to beat them, and our goal is to play the final and win the cup, which we will try our best to achieve.”
Namibia have lost all three of their group matches.</p><small>2026-02-17 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171509399c03080.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973896/8-muslim-nations-including-pakistan-condemn-israeli-move-to-claim-west-bank-land-as-state-property' target='_blank'><strong>8 Muslim nations, including Pakistan, condemn Israeli move to claim West Bank land as ‘state property’</strong></a><br><p>Eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, on Tuesday condemned the Israeli move to claim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property”, saying that the step reflected an attempt to “impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land”.
Al Jazeera reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.
In a joint statement issued on Tuesday, the foreign ministries of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar strongly condemned the Israeli move.







“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” the joint statement said.
“The ministers affirm that these measures represent a flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as a violation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, foremost among them Resolution 2334,” they said.
“The decision also contradicts the advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice concerning the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which underscored the illegality of measures intended to alter the legal, historical, and demographic status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the obligation to end the occupation, and the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force,” the joint statement added.
The ministers added that this step reflected an attempt to “impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region”.
It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
On Monday, Pakistan had released a separate statement condemning the Israeli move, calling on the international community to reject its actions.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan had also separately criticised the move as illegal while the European Union had called on Tel Aviv to reverse the move.
The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.</p><small>2026-02-17 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17145141e475855.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973895/rainfall-hail-lashes-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Rainfall, hail lashes parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Mild to heavy rainfall, including hail, was reported in several areas of the metropolitan city on Tuesday.
Rainfall accompanied by hail was reported in Gulistan-i-Johar, Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Askari IV and other parts of the city.
Earlier in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) in a weather forecast said that “a westerly wave is affecting the central and upper parts of the country”.

 


It predicted partly cloudy weather with “chances of light to moderate intensity rainfall with thunderstorm” on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature expected to remain between 25-27 °C, while the minimum temperature is expected to fall to 18.6 °C.
According to the forecast, Wednesday (February 18) and Thursday (Feb 19) would be “sunny days”.
For the rest of the province, PMD said, “thunderstorm/rain of light to moderate intensity may occur in Dadu, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Kambar Shahdadkot, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Ghotki, Kashmore, Khairpur districts”.
“Gusty/dust-raising winds [are] also likely during the period,” PMD added.</p><small>2026-02-17 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17131755b923211.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973888/ssgc-assures-uninterrupted-gas-supply-in-karachi-during-sehr-iftar' target='_blank'><strong>SSGC assures ‘uninterrupted’ gas supply in Karachi during Sehr, Iftar</strong></a><br><p>
KARACHI: The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has issued a gas supply schedule for Karachi and the surrounding areas for the holy month of Ramazan.
The announcement by the utility said that gas would be available from 3am to 9am for Sehr and from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for Iftar, with the supply expected to be suspended outside these hours to manage overall demand.
“To ensure improved gas pressure, SSGC would be carrying out gas pressure profiling from 9am to 3:30pm,” it said, “and then during nighttime from 10pm to 3am during Ramazan,” said the utility.
The SSGC added that “an approximate 10 percent annual decline in the country’s gas reserves has widened the gap between gas demand and supply”.
The announcement said that timings had been worked out for providing convenience to people for food preparations for Sehr and Iftar.
SNGPL proposes supply from 3am to 10:30pm
The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has also proposed providing gas from 3am to 10:30pm daily during the upcoming holy month across Punjab.
“We have recommended an uninterrupted gas supply in Punjab from 3am to 10.30pm daily throughout Ramzan,” SNGPL Managing Director Amir Tufail told Dawn.
“However, the final approval will be given by the petroleum division,” he added.
To a question about whether or not the supply would be for cooking hours alone, he said the company will make efforts to ensure supply from 3am to 10.30pm daily during the month of Ramazan.</p><small>2026-02-17 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17113631b8a6283.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973879/ctd-claims-4-suspected-terrorists-dead-after-raid-in-karachis-shah-latif-town' target='_blank'><strong>CTD claims 4 suspected terrorists dead after raid in Karachi’s Shah Latif Town</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Tuesday it conducted a raid in the city’s Shah Latif Town, as a result of which four suspected terrorists died while two cops sustained injuries.
According to information provided by CTD Deputy Inspector General Ghulam Azfar Mahesar, the encounter began when CTD personnel surrounded a house in Shah Latif Town based on the identification of previously arrested suspects.
The men inside opened fire, leading to an exchange of gunfire, the CTD said. Additional police contingents were then called to the scene.
The four alleged terrorists were injured by firing “from their own accomplices” during the crossfire and later died at a hospital, CTD claimed.
Three of the suspects were identified as Jaleel alias Farid, Niaz alias King and Hamdan alias Farid, while efforts were underway to determine the identity of the fourth.
A Kalashnikov and a hand grenade were recovered from the possession of one of the suspected terrorists.
Two CTD officials — Head Constable Muhammad Yousuf and Constable Raja Junaid — were also wounded in the exchange and taken to a hospital for treatment.
According to CTD, three already arrested suspects brought to the scene for pointation were injured during the crossfire as well.
In a statement, the CTD said the suspects belonged to Fitna al-Hindustan’s Bashir Zeb network.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a phrase coined by the state, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy.
When CTD personnel entered the house after the fire exchange, some accomplices had managed to escape under the cover of darkness. A search operation was initiated to apprehend the fleeing suspects, with checkpoints set up in District Malir and other parts of the city.
Suspecting the presence of explosives, the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) was summoned, which cordoned off and evacuated the surrounding area. The BDS confirmed the presence of explosive material inside the house and began neutralisation efforts.

 

According to a BDS statement, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were being prepared in drums within the premises. Detonators, detonating wire and electrical circuits were also recovered.
In early January, the CTD said it had foiled a major terrorist attack in Karachi, arresting three suspects and recovering 2,000 kilogrammes of explosives.</p><small>2026-02-17 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/171321063dba3de.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973886/11-security-personnel-martyred-in-terrorist-attack-on-checkpost-in-bajaur-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 security personnel martyred in terrorist attack on checkpost in Bajaur: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On February 16, a cowardly terrorist attack was attempted on security forces and law enforcement agencies’ joint check Post in Bajaur District by Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision”.
“In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. Due to the blast impact infrastructure at check post collapsed resultantly eleven brave sons of soil, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and [embracing] martyrdom.”
ISPR elaborated that the blast affected residential buildings in the area as well, “leading to the martyrdom of one innocent young girl”.
Another seven people were injured, including women and children, the ISPR said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
“The sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement concluded.
President, PM condemn attack
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs, according to a statement issued via PPP’s media cell.
“The sacrifice made by the martyrs for the country’s defence further strengthens our resolve,” the president was quoted as saying.
He vowed that the complete elimination of terrorists operating in the country with external support remained the state’s “topmost priority.”







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms,” state broadcaster PTV reported.
He extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the recovery of the injured, PTV said.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the premier was quoted as saying.
He said the country remained determined to “root out terrorism from the country”.
Noting the elimination of 12 terrorists, the prime minister lauded the security forces for their “timely action”.
“Under the vision of Azm e Istehkam, security forces are gaining major success in the fight against terrorism,” the premier said.







The attack comes days after an additional station house officer was martyred as terrorists attacked a police station in the War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district.
In December 2025, a major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-17 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17124627c804c28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973884/fire-breaks-out-at-chemical-factory-in-karachis-site-area-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Fire breaks out at chemical factory in Karachi’s SITE area: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A fire broke out at a chemical factory in Karachi’s SITE area on Tuesday, Rescue 1122 said.
Spokesperson Rescue 1122, in a statement, said that the chemical factory was located near Valika Chowrangi and efforts were underway to control the fire.
“A fire brigade truck, along with rescue teams, was immediately dispatched to the site of the incident, as soon as the Rescue 1122 received report of the incident,” the spokesperson added.

 


A contingent of Sindh Rangers personnel was also dispatched to the site of the incident, their spokesperson said in a statement.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in the relief activities and rescue operation along with the fire brigade and rescue personnel,” the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab took notice of the incident. In a post on X, Mayor Wahab said, “KMC fire team is attending to the fire incident reported at a factory in SITE Industrial Area. Will keep everyone posted.”







According to an earlier statement, Mayor Wahab had “directed all departments of the KMC to stay alert”.
He issued instructions to utilise all available resources for the rescue operation. The statement added that the “water board authorities were also instructed to take emergency measures”.
“All possible steps should be taken to control the fire,” the mayor was quoted as saying.
“There will be no compromise made on the safety of human lives,” he added.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, as per a statement, directed Mayor Wahab and the commissioner to supervise the rescue efforts and investigate the cause of the fire.
The incident comes a day after a huge fire erupted in the bushes near the University of Karachi (KU). It was brought under control later.</p><small>2026-02-17 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17132938fbfbe4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973882/phc-orders-reopening-of-kp-roads-blocked-by-pti-supporters' target='_blank'><strong>PHC orders reopening of KP roads blocked by PTI supporters</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and police to ensure the reopening of roads blocked by PTI supporters and protesters in recent days.
The protesting PTI workers have blocked KP’s entry and exit points for the last four days, demanding that the federal government move incarcerated party founder Imran Khan from jail to a hospital for medical treatment.
A two-member bench headed by Justice Ijaz Anwar and including Justice Farah Jamshed took up the set of petitions filed by MPA Sobia Shahid, lawyer Tariq Afghan, Swabi resident Yousaf Ali and Shaoor Khan.
Upon the bench summoning them, KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and Advocate General Shah Faisal Utmankhel appeared in court.
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Anwar inquired about how many days it had been since the roads were blocked.

 

“The roads have been shut for the past three days. Initially, 14 points were blocked, and now protests are underway at six points,” the KP IG replied.
Justice Anwar wondered whether shutting roads was not a violation of the law, pointing out that lawyers for six cases were unable to reach the PHC from Islamabad.
He remarked, “Such is the security situation in the province that even today, 14 have been martyred. These are the conditions, but despite this, there are protests and roads are closed.”
The judge highlighted that the laws guaranteed citizens the right to freedom of movement, but they were still “facing difficulties”. He inquired about the number of first information reports (FIR) registered over the road blockades.
“The traffic situation in Peshawar is the worst in the entire country. In fact, there is no traffic system in this province,” Justice Anwar observed, at which IG Hameed expressed his strong agreement.
“We are now trying to streamline this, and are initiating e-challans,” the police chief assured the court.
Justice Anwar quipped, “When the police want to take action against someone, they do. When they do not want to, then this happens.”
At one point during the hearing, Justice Anwar said it was “unfortunate that the ruling party here is protesting [and] hurting the province’s people”.
Utmankhel assured the bench that “no one would defend any wrong act.”
IG Hameed sought two days for the police to “fix the situation”, but Justice Anwar declined the request, ordering that the roads be opened today.
“Begin today, and do not let anyone block the roads,” he stressed. “The entire country is open, but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is shut. This is against our own people.”
“The motorway should not be closed off under any circumstances,” he added, noting that people could not leave their houses due to the blocked routes.
Protesters had blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway.
“Reopen the roads and ensure the same,” Justice Anwar ordered, telling the KP IG and the chief secretary to submit their reports regarding the matter by tomorrow.
Subsequently, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday.

 

The closure of M-1 — the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country — has put the GT Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway.
Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment.
The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.</p><small>2026-02-17 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09030544ec7c7c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969900/the-shutdown-of-usaid-and-the-deeper-crisis-behind-it' target='_blank'><strong>The shutdown of USAID and the deeper crisis behind it</strong></a><br><p>“Why did you start driving inDrive?”
It’s my go-to icebreaker with drivers in Pakistan. Lately, the answers have been unsettlingly similar. “I used to work in the development sector,” one man told me. “Then I lost my job.”
I’ve heard that line — or a version of it — too many times to dismiss as coincidence.
Since the United States pulled the plug on its aid apparatus, the fallout has been immediate. On the surface, the shutdown of USAID is being framed as just another abrupt policy reversal — a bureaucratic casualty in an era of disruption. But look closer, and it reveals something far more profound: the cumulative weight of domestic and international tensions that have been simmering, both within and beyond the US for decades.
Cycles of aid, cycles of distrust
The first source of strain lies beyond US borders. From its inception as a Cold War instrument, American foreign aid has been shaped by an enduring tension between its declared objectives of development and altruism and its underlying strategic and political calculations.
This duality has long been apparent to the recipient elites and the broader public alike. During the Cold War, many governments acquiesced, in part because Western donors faced little competition and alternative sources of assistance were scarce. That landscape has since changed. As non-traditional donors, most notably China and the Gulf states, have expanded their presence, and as domestic political incentives within recipient countries have shifted, scepticism toward USAID has become more explicit and politically salient.

 

In countries such as Pakistan, where mistrust of American intentions runs deep, US assistance is often perceived less as generosity than as intrusion. What is now framed as a backlash against American aid is better understood as the culmination of a long-simmering tension and a legacy of mutual misperceptions between donor and recipient.
Pakistan’s experience with US foreign aid agency illustrates this dynamic with particular clarity. American assistance to Pakistan has never been linear or predictable; instead, it has unfolded in cycles closely attuned to Washington’s shifting strategic priorities. During the Cold War, aid was channelled primarily through a security-alliance framework aimed at containing the Soviet bloc, with economic assistance tightly coupled to military cooperation. These flows declined sharply after the 1965 war, reinforcing perceptions of US aid as conditional, transactional, and reversible.
Another peak in this equation followed in the 1980s, when General Ziaul Haq aligned Pakistan with the US in opposing Soviet expansion in Afghanistan. Yet with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent imposition of US sanctions on Pakistan’s nuclear programme under the Pressler Amendment, assistance once again contracted. It was only after 9/11 that the aid surged anew, this time framed around counterterrorism and stabilisation. Even at its height, however, much of this assistance remained shaped by security imperatives, short funding horizons, and heavy reliance on contractors, rather than long-term institution-building.
For many Pakistanis, therefore, the shutdown of USAID feels less like an abrupt rupture than the latest turn in a familiar cycle of engagement and disengagement.
The second factor is bureaucratic pathologisation. Like many large organisations, aid agencies are susceptible to institutional dysfunction, and USAID has been no exception. In practice, particularly in contexts such as Pakistan, as commissioner on the Afghanistan War Commission Andrew Wilder has noted, its programmes increasingly came to be structured through a security lens rather than a development one. Key decisions were made in Washington, filtered through multiple layers of contractors, and ultimately deployed on the ground with limited scope for local input.
At the same time, bureaucratic incentives privileged projects with easily quantifiable indicators, favouring what could be measured over what was substantively effective. These patterns were neither accidental nor new, nor are they unique to the US. Over time, however, they eroded both the legitimacy and the perceived effectiveness of USAID, among recipients abroad and critics at home.
These institutional dynamics had tangible consequences on the ground. In Pakistan, USAID funding became heavily concentrated in sectors aligned with stabilisation and security objectives — such as service delivery in so-called “fragile” districts or rapid-impact infrastructure — often at the expense of slower, politically unglamorous investments in local institutional capacity. NGOs and development professionals structured entire career paths around USAID project cycles, only to see those opportunities vanish when priorities shifted or funding was abruptly frozen.
The result was a hollowing out of local expertise and institutional memory. When aid was withdrawn, it left behind far fewer durable institutions than its scale and visibility might have led one to expect.
The mismatch between stated development objectives and the underlying security logic was further compounded by an overreliance on quantifiable metrics to demonstrate impact. This tendency was reinforced by a development ecosystem shaped by the overproduction of economists and political scientists trained as methodological specialists rather than regional experts. Programmes designed in Washington often prioritised what could be easily counted — number of schools built, clinics refurbished, trainings delivered, or kilometres of roads completed — over whether such interventions meaningfully strengthened local institutions.
In Pakistan, this logic was especially evident in sectors such as education, health, and local governance, where projects were assessed primarily through output indicators rather than sustainability or local ownership. Multiple layers of contractors further diluted accountability and blurred responsibility once funding cycles ended. Over time, this produced a paradox: USAID became both omnipresent and poorly understood — associated with large budgets and extensive reporting, but yielding limited and uneven institutional impact. That credibility gap left the agency especially exposed when domestic political support in the US began to erode.
The third major factor behind the dismantling of the aid lies in the domestic backlash within the US against international cooperation. Opposition to foreign aid, multilateralism, and international institutions long predates Donald Trump, reflecting decades of polarisation over globalisation and America’s role in the world. By the time Trump entered office, hostility toward international engagement was already deeply embedded in US politics.
In this context, shuttering a highly visible aid agency became a potent domestic signal; it becomes a way to demonstrate responsiveness to voters who view global commitments as costly, wasteful, or illegitimate. Dismantling USAID was therefore less a recalibration of foreign policy than an act of domestic political theatre.
The US government’s official justification for shutting down USAID frames the move as a response to “China’s exploitative aid model” and a means of advancing American “strategic interests in key regions around the world”.
It is true that China has dramatically expanded its development footprint and largely operates outside the traditional Western aid framework. But that explanation doesn’t hold up to deeper scrutiny. If Washington were genuinely seeking to compete with Beijing in the development arena, the more coherent response would have been reform and reinvestment, not withdrawal.

 

Moreover, Chinese and US aid are not direct substitutes. They target different sectors, rely on distinct instruments, and frequently operate alongside one another in the same countries — Pakistan among them — without displacing each other.
In Pakistan, Chinese assistance has concentrated on large-scale infrastructure and energy projects, while USAID has focused primarily on education and health. Chinese aid typically flows through bilateral, government-to-government channels, whereas US assistance has often bypassed the Pakistani state, working instead through NGOs and contractors. China’s rise may well be sharpening anxieties in Washington, but it does not, on its own, explain why the US would choose to erode its own institutional capacity in response.
A looming domino effect
The shutdown of USAID, then, should not be understood as a one-off policy blunder or an idiosyncratic choice tied to a single administration. Rather, it reflects the convergence of long-accumulating tensions: between the professed ideals and strategic deployment of aid abroad; between development objectives and bureaucratic practices within aid agencies; between international commitments and domestic political incentives at home.
USAID’s collapse is best understood not as the cause of these pressures, but as their most visible manifestation.
The consequences of this decision extend well beyond the fate of a single agency. They reveal the fragility of the broader international aid regime, which ultimately depends on the willingness of a small number of leading powers to absorb the political and financial costs of institutionalised cooperation.
When that willingness erodes, institutions lose both credibility and purpose and eventually collapse. Signs of this erosion are already evident, as other major donors, including the United Kingdom and Germany, begin to scale back their own aid commitments.
What is at stake, then, is not merely the dismantling of USAID, but the gradual unravelling of an international aid regime built on mutual trust and a sustained commitment to lifting the world’s poorest out of poverty.</p><small>2026-02-17 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17133349e1db431.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973880/alleged-serial-killer-shot-dead-by-accomplices-while-fleeing-custody-in-gujranwala-claim-police' target='_blank'><strong>Alleged serial killer shot dead by accomplices while fleeing custody in Gujranwala, claim police</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A suspected serial killer, accused of kidnapping and murdering at least four people, was reportedly killed by gunfire from his own accomplices during an alleged encounter with the Gujranwala police on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the Gujranwala police said that the suspect, who was caught while attempting to flee from Lahore to Karachi via train, had been in the custody of the Gujranwala police on physical remand.
He claimed that the police team was taking the suspect to an area he had identified to recover the murder weapon, when unidentified armed accomplices of the suspect intercepted the police party.
The police spokesperson further claimed that four armed accomplices opened fire on the police in an attempt to free the suspect from custody. “However, the suspect was killed by gunfire from his own accomplices while trying to flee,” the spokesperson added.
The attackers fled the scene shortly afterward, he said. The police later moved the suspect’s body to the Gujranwala District Headquarters Hospital for an autopsy.
The spokesman said that a case was being lodged against the attackers and that the police had started an investigation into the incident.
Earlier on Monday, Gujranwala City Police Officer (CPO) Dr Ghias Gul told reporters at a news conference that police found two unidentified bodies of a 32-year-old woman and her five-year-old son along the bank of a canal near Citi Housing Society on Feb 10.
Both the deceased, he said, had been slain with a sharp-edged weapon. They were later identified, and a case of double murder was lodged on the report of a police official.
The CPO added that the suspect was nabbed by a special investigation team while attempting to flee.
The suspect, he said, had confessed to killing the woman and her two children, including her eight-month-old daughter Mubara. The second child’s body was recovered from the canal after the suspect was identified. The suspect revealed that he had killed the three victims to steal the gold earrings the woman was wearing.
The CPO added that the suspect had also confessed to killing a 13-year-old boy from Mado Khalil in the Ladhewala police precinct on December 20 last year.</p><small>2026-02-17 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17113355bb41234.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973877/bears-continue-to-dominate-as-kse-100-loses-over-1500-points-during-early-trading' target='_blank'><strong>Bears continue to dominate as KSE-100 loses over 1,500 points during early trading</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, lost 1587.06 points by 11:10am on Tuesday.

The opposition on Monday decided to extend their sit-in, which began on Friday, for another day to “see the government’s response” to their demand for access to the former premier, whose health has recently been called into question by a medical report following his examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn, said that as Tuesday was supposed to be a meeting day with Imran, two of the sit-in participants — Salman Akram Raja and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan — would be going to Adiala jail, as their names had been included in the list of those to meet the PTI founder.







“Moreover, we are hoping that the meeting of all sisters or at least one of the family members will be allowed today,” he said. “It will end the rumours about the health of Imran Khan, as they will directly hear from him and will share Khan sahib’s views regarding his health.”
Responding to a question, Yousufzai said that the government should allow the meeting as it may help defuse the current tensions if the medical report regarding Imran was correct.
“It is a fact that during the last two years we have been deceived a number of times, due to which the level of trust has been reduced,” he said.
The spokesperson added that the family needed to meet Imran, after which the three sisters would hold a press conference.
The spokesperson further said he met KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi last night, where it was decided to hold an evening meeting to determine the next course of action.
“During the meeting, we will consider the next phase of our sit-in and movement,” he added.

 

Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s (SC) intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which quoted Imran as saying only 15 per cent vision was left in his right eye.
This prompted a strong response from the opposition alliance, which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
Meanwhile, another protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while KP CM Sohail Afridi led a demonstration at the KP House.
Imran’s party, family ‘reject’ medical report
Imran’s party and family have rejected the report issued by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday, sticking to their demand that he be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors.
In a post on X, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram referred to the statement by Imran’s longtime personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf, who had spoken to the doctors currently treating the ex-prime minister.
Akram noted that Dr Yusuf said “that he neither met Khan nor could he talk to him nor could he examine him or take care of him, therefore he can neither confirm nor deny” the report prepared.
He stated that the PTI “rejects this report and strongly demands that Imran Khan sahib be immediately met by his family and personal physician and that he be immediately treated and examined at Al-Shifa International”.
“To issue such a report by having doctors of one’s choice examine him shows that something is definitely being hidden and the only solution to avoid all this is to immediately have Imran Khan examined at Shifa International on the recommendation of his family and personal physician,” Akram contended.







In her statement posted hours earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said: “We categorically REJECT all the medical reports circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan.”
“[…] as Dr Asim Yousuf stated in his video, there is NO way for us to verify any of this,” she highlighted.
“Now we are even more concerned and worried and our demand remains unchanged: Imran Khan must be urgently transferred to a proper medical facility (Shifa International Hospital Islamabad) where he shall be examined by qualified specialists under Dr Asim Yousuf’s supervision and in the presence of his family,” Aleema demanded.
She added that she and others will be at the Adiala jail at 1:30pm today to attempt to meet Imran.
“We expect the authorities to allow us to meet Imran Khan as this is his legal right. The family will also hold a press conference outside Adiala at 4pm after our meeting with Imran Khan,” the sister said.

Gujranwala CPO Dr Ghias Gul told reporters at a news conference on Monday that police found two unidentified bodies of a 32 years old woman and her five years old son along the bank of canal near the Citi Housing Society on Feb 10.
Both the deceased, he said, had been slain with a sharp-edged weapon. They were later identified as Malaika and her son Muhammad Ahmed and a case of double murder was lodged on the report of a police official.
The CPO said a special investigation team under SP Civil Lines Imran Khan and DSP Hameed Virk was constituted that used modern techniques and traced a suspect namely Haroon Javed who was nabbed while making an attempt to flee to Karachi from Lahore via train.
The suspect, he said, had confessed to have killed the woman and her two children – eight months old daughter Mubara through asphyxiation and threw her body into the canal. The body of deceased girl was recovered from the canal on the identification of the suspect.
The suspect revealed that he had killed three people of a family just to snatch gold ornaments the woman was wearing in her ears.
The suspect belongs to the same area of Alam Chowk where the deceased woman resided.
The CPO said that the suspect had also revealed to have killed 13 years old boy Rehan Ali of Mado Khalil locality in the precincts of Ladhewala police on Dec 20 last.
The suspect, he said, had kidnapped the boy to snatch a bridal dress from him and later murdered him. The boy had been sent by his father to deliver the dress to a customer in a nearby vicinity.
A case of kidnapping of that boy had been lodged with the police against the unidentified suspects on the report of his father Muhammad Imran who ran an embroidery factory in the area.
The CPO commended the police team for tracing and arresting the killer.

“I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.







Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran has long sought a tough posture in negotiations but learned the consequences of that approach last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
Trump suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate.“I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” Trump said.
Washington pushes Tehran to forego enrichment
Prior to the US strikes in June, US-Iran nuclear talks had stalled over Washington’s demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
“We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,” Trump said, referring to the bat-winged US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings.
“I hope they’re going to be more reasonable.”
The remarks contrast with those by the US president on Friday, when he embraced potential regime change in Iran and lamented decades of failed talks.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X that he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal.” “What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araqchi said.
Questions about uranium stockpile
The International Atomic Energy Agency has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-US strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June last year: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against any attack, which would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.
Iran held a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.
Despite Trump’s comments about Iran seeking a deal, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks. Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran’s missile stockpile.
Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and won’t accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table.
Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard.
“I think that there’s an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement … but I don’t want to overstate it either,” Rubio said.
“It’s going to be hard. It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.”</p><small>2026-02-17 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17091933685eb9c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973870/frances-macron-eyes-rafale-fighter-jet-deal-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>France’s Macron eyes Rafale fighter jet deal in India</strong></a><br><p>French President Emmanuel Macron begins a three-day visit to India on Tuesday, with talks focused on artificial intelligence cooperation and a potential multibillion-dollar Dassault Rafale fighter jet deal.
France is seeking to expand its military partnership with New Delhi, with discussions expected on a potential contract for 114 additional French fighter jets.
Macron and his wife Brigitte arrived around midnight on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, for his fourth visit to India since taking office in 2017.
He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Tuesday.
Macron will then travel to New Delhi for an artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday and Thursday.
The visit follows New Delhi’s confirmation last week that it intends to place a major order for Rafale jets, as well as the signing of a landmark free trade agreement between India and the European Union in January.
‘Contract of the century’
New Delhi has sought over the past decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment, turning to other countries while also pushing for more domestic production.
An Indian defence ministry statement last week said the proposed purchase of Rafale jets had been cleared, with “the majority” of them to be manufactured in India.
The statement did not specify the exact number of jets New Delhi would purchase, but a New Delhi defence ministry source said that 114 was likely.
Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential $35 billion deal for 114 Rafales as the “contract of the century” and a potential “crowning achievement” for bilateral ties.
If finalised, the jets would add to the 36 Rafales India purchased for its air force in 2016 and 26 it has ordered for its navy.
Negotiations over the additional aircraft still need to be concluded with manufacturer Dassault Aviation, but the French presidency has voiced optimism that what it calls a “historic” agreement could be reached.
‘Good chemistry’
Modi and Macron will also inaugurate on Tuesday India’s first helicopter final assembly line via videoconference from Mumbai, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Airbus.







The facility in Vemagal, in the southern state of Karnataka near the tech hub of Bengaluru, will manufacture the Airbus H125, the company’s best-selling single-engine helicopter.
France has emerged as one of India’s most important defence and economic partners in the last decade.
“Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation” with India, and to “diversify” France’s economic and trade partnerships, Macron’s office said.
India, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people, is on track to become the fourth-largest economy globally.
This week’s talks are also expected to address global economic uncertainty triggered by tariff policies under US President Donald Trump, as well as China’s influence in the region.
Modi’s office said discussions would focus on “cementing the strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas”.
Bilateral trade between France and India, driven largely by defence and aerospace — India’s commercial fleet includes a substantial number of Airbus aircraft — stands at around $18 billion annually.
French foreign direct investment in India totals nearly $15 billion.
The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.
One sensitive issue remains Ukraine: India has not condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion and has continued buying oil from Moscow.US President Donald Trump has said India had committed to halting the purchases, though that has not been formally confirmed by New Delhi.
“If the Indians stop buying Russian oil, they won’t be blamed for abstaining at the UN,” Jaffrelot added.</p><small>2026-02-17 04:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17083955c74c5a7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973825/witnesses-recount-slow-pace-of-rescue-work-at-gul-plaza' target='_blank'><strong>Witnesses recount slow pace of rescue work at Gul Plaza</strong></a><br><p>• Amid moving scenes, 23 relatives of the deceased testify before judicial tribunal• Say fire tenders ran out of water, no serious effort made to break walls and windows of the building to rescue people trapped inside
KARACHI: Moving scenes were witnessed before the judicial tribunal investigating the Gul Plaza inferno on Monday when 23 relatives of 33 deceased persons narrated their ordeal, pointing fingers at the rescue work, firefighting and slow response by authorities.
In their statements before the single-judge tribunal headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court, they deposed that entry-exit points of Gul Plaza were closed, firefighters arrived late, ran out of water, lacked equipment and skill, while rescue authorities made no efforts to break the walls and windows to rescue people trapped inside.
Many of the witnesses broke into tears while testifying before the commission, which heard them at the Deputy Commissioner South Complex.
One of the witnesses, Haleem, deposed that his father and brother were inside the building when the fire broke out on Jan 17. He said his father lost his life and brother suffered injuries when he jumped out of the building to save his life.
He said firefighters faced a water shortage while the building’s electricity was switched off shortly after the fire broke out.
Witness Mohammad Hanif testified that his two sons were killed in the tragic incident. He said rescue officials made no efforts to break the walls and windows to rescue the people. He said police resorted to baton charge him and other relatives of the people trapped inside when they gathered near the plaza.

 

Another witness, Qaiser, whose wife, son and sister-in-law were killed in the blaze submitted before the tribunal that he had asked the recuse and firefighters to break a wall in order to rescue people, but to no avail.
He maintained that rescue authorities had lacked proper equipment and machinery.
Taj Mohammad, whose father was killed in the incident, blamed the fire and recuse officials for not fulfilling their responsibilities. He said that he, along with a cousin, managed to reach the rooftop of the building, but rescue officials did not brother to reach there in order to save people. One gate of the building was opened and other exit-entry points were closed, he added.
Saima, who lost her son in the incident, submitted that she and her daughter-in-law remained present outside the building for nine days, but the authorities did nothing to rescue their loved ones. She deposed that her other sons also participated in the rescue operation.
Shahnaz, whose son worked at one of the Gul Plaza shops and lost his life, broke into tears during her testimony.
Sanaullah said his sister was killed in the deadly fire and blamed the provincial and local authorities for the tragic incident.
Abdul Hafeez, who also lost his son, informed the tribunal that the firefighters were short of fuel and water.
Ahsan Ahmed, who lost his brother, also deposed that fire tenders were present on the spot but facing water shortage.
Mohammad Hadi said that his son was also killed in the fire, but an assistant commissioner asked him to file an affidavit about the presence of his son in the building at the time of incident.
Later, the tribunal provided the witnesses a questionnaire and asked them to submit it at the next hearing.
The commission sought reply to 17 questions about the arrival of fire tenders and rescue staff, proper equipment for rescue and firefighting, prompt availability of ambulances, whether police facilitate evacuation or create confusion and the roles of district administration and the management of ill-fated building.
The commission will also record the testimonies of various officials of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, Sindh police, Gul Plaza Shopping Mall Association, K-Eclectic and others on Wednesday (tomorrow).

The ruling party’s leaders and workers have closed M-1 at Swabi rest area since last Friday to demand early treatment of their incarcerated leader, Imran Khan, for “vision loss”.
The closure of M-1, the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country, has put the Grand Trunk Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway.
Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.

Businessmen wonder why PTI govt troubling people of KP

Jan Mulk, a businessman, who was travelling from Islamabad to Peshawar on Sunday evening, told Dawn that he left Islamabad at around 4:30pm and reached Attock at around 6:30pm before finding himself caught in a huge traffic jam at Attock crossing.
“Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a long traffic grid lock and there was not even any way to turn back,” he said.
The businessman said that the Attock traffic gridlock forced him to return and spend the night in Islamabad before coming to Peshawar next morning.
“There were women, children and elderly, with a large number of them being on foot due to road closure and unavailability of public transport,” he said.
Mr Mulk said transporters in Attock were charging commuters Rs1,000 for a trip to Rawalpindi.
Khan Zaman Afridi, president of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Transporters Association, told Dawn that road closures had made life difficult for transports.
“Nearly 3,000 vehicles leave Peshawar General Bus Stand on a daily basis but the number has dropped to around 1500 due to road closures,” he said.
Mr Afridi said almost all public transport used the M-1 and now its closure has diverted all the traffic to the GT Road and a usual trip of two to three hours on motorway was taking over 10 hours on GT Road.
“GT Road is not old GT Road and is full of potholes and full of vans, Qingqi motorcycle-rickshaws and push carts, so it is very difficult to traverse and now, the entire motorway traffic has been diverted to it, causing massive traffic snarl,” he said.
Mr Afridi said that due to the road closures, many people had stopped travelling, and commuter arrivals at bus stands had almost halved as only people who had to attend urgent business meetings travelled in compulsion.
“It is ironic that the KP government is inflicting pain on its own people,” he said.
A representative of Faisal Movers told Dawn that his transport company had stopped its Peshawar-Islamabad operations since the start of the M-1 closure.
Junaid Altaf, president of KP Chamber of Commerce and Industry, questioned the rationale for the motorway closure.
“Who are they troubling? Is it the people of KP or residents of Punjab and Sindh who are being affected due to the M-1 closure?”
Mr Altaf said that KP chief minister and his cabinet had been sitting in Islamabad for the past many days, leaving their offices and official duties unattended.
He said that the prolonged closure of Pak-Afghan border points had already ruined the province’s business community and now, the politicians didn’t understand that the trucks stranded on the road to KP carried raw material to factories in the province and prolonged closure was hurting the business community as well as the economy of the province.
“If PTI thinks the people of KP deserve this for voting them to the powers, then it is ok and we deserve it,” he said.
Malik Sohni, president of All Pakistan Agriculture Produce Traders Federation, told Dawn that road closures had resulted in an over 10pc increase in the vegetable prices in the provincial capital.
He said that in the current season, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, okra, garlic, peas and leafy vegetables were transported from Punjab to Peshawar.
Mr Sohni said that as vegetables were perishable, prolonged blockages not only caused spoilage but also drove the prices up.
“Prices automatically go up when fresh supplies don’t reach on time,” he said.

The analysis, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, examined 22 previous studies involving nearly 2,000 adults across Europe, North and South America, China and Australia.
Researchers compared short-term fasting regimens — including the popular 5:2 diet and time-restricted eating plans that confine meals to eight-hour windows — with traditional advice to reduce calorie intake, or no dietary guidance at all, over periods of up to 12 months.
The findings were stark: the fashionable approach made little discernible difference to either weight loss or quality of life when measured against standard dietary advice. Luis Garegnani, the lead review author from the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, said intermittent fasting might be a reasonable option for some individuals, but the current evidence does not justify the enthusiasm observed on social media. While the authors expressed moderate confidence in the findings, they noted some underlying studies used less robust methods.
Nevertheless, the rev­i­ew is likely to pour cold water on a trend that has gained enormous traction online.

A Shangla police official said a terrorist attacked a police party during a search-and-strike operation in the Kabalgram area, resulting in the martyrdom of three policemen. The police retaliated swiftly and eliminated two attackers.
The official added that the operation was ongoing in the area and a large police contingent had been dispatched to the spot.
The martyred personnel were identified as Head Constable Maqbool Ahm­ad and Elite Force constables Saeed-ur-Reh­man and Fida Hussain.
IED blast
Meanwhile, Bannu pol­ice said two people, including a Hafiz-i-Quran boy, were killed when an IED planted on a motorcycle parked outside shops near the Miryan police station exploded with a loud bang. At least 17 others were injured in the explosion.
According to Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson Muha­m­mad Noman, the bodies of the deceased and the 17 injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Police and security forces cordoned off the area immediately after the incident, collected evidence from the site, and launched a search operation.
RPO Sajjad Khan, Dep­uty Commissioner Bannu Muhammad Faheem Khan, ANP Senator Haji Baaz Muhammad Khan Advocate, Dr Pir Sahib Zaman, PTI district president Haji Gul Baaz Khan, and other leaders visited the DHQ Hospital to inquire after the injured. According to the bomb disposal squad, seven to eight kilogrammes of explosive material was used in the blast.

JAKARTA: Indonesia is preparing a total of 8,000 troops for potential deployment to Gaza by June as part of a proposed multinational peacekeeping force but the final decision on deployment rests with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, the country’s army spokesperson said on Monday.
Army spokesperson Donny Pram­ono noted that initially 1,000 soldiers would be ready for deployment by early April.
“The departure schedule rema­ins entirely subject to the political decisions of the state and applicable international mechanisms,” Pra­mono said in a text message.
Indonesia’s foreign ministry clarified on Saturday that its military’s participation in the UN-mandated International Stabilisation Force should not be interpreted as a normalisation of political relations with Israel, a nation Jakarta does not recognise.
The deployment would carry a non-combatant, humanitarian mandate and requires the consent of the Palestinian Authority.
“Indonesia consistently rejects all attempts at demographic change or the forced displacement or relocation of the Palestinian people in any form,” the ministry said, adding that its troops would have no mandate to demilitarise any party.
The deployment plans are being announced as global leaders convene for the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which will be chai­red by US President Donald Trump. Additionally, President Subianto is set to travel to Washington this week to participate in the event.
While the board was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution to oversee the Gaza truce, the European Union insisted on Monday that while it will participate in the meeting, Brussels would not be joining as a member.
European Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the bloc in Washington.
“She will participate in the meeting of the Board of Peace for the specific part dedicated to Gaza. Let me stress that the European Commission, it’s not becoming a member to the Board of Peace,” EU spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.
Some member states have raised concerns that the board could morph into a rival to the UN. “We still have a number of questions regarding several elements in the Board of Peace: one concerning its scope, two concerning its governance, and three, its compatibility with the UN Charter,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.
Meanwhile, Italy aims to play a role in stabilising the Middle East by offering training support while their Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed Rome is ready to participate as an observer.
“We are ready to train a new Gaza police force, and we are also ready to train a Palestinian police force,” Tajani told a news conference in Rome.
Ahead of the summit, President Trump announced that members of the US-led body have pledged more than $5 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction and committed thousands of personnel to international stabilisation efforts.
Trump plans to host the meeting on Feb 19 at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington.

JERUSALEM / ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan denounced the latest Israeli move to convert areas of the West Bank into “state property”, the UN chief called upon Tel Aviv to reverse its new, “unlawful” policy allowing registration of the occupied land in the occupied territory as state property.
Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
Pakistan also denounced the step as a clear violation of international law as well as relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Islamabad urged the international community to reject the decision, said a statement issued by the For­eign Office spokesperson. It added that the occupying power continued to disregard international law and its provocative actions undermined the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region.
“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the spokesperson added.
‘Undermine peace efforts’
Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan also criticised the move as illegal. The measure is “aimed at impo­sing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank” that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the actions “undermine efforts to restore calm and thr­e­aten to exacerbate the conflict,” according to a statement released by the royal court.
The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. “This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. “We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law.”
The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.
Israeli anti-settlement watc­­h­dog Peace Now called the measure a “mega land grab”. Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO’s co-director, told AFP that the move would attribute new resources for land registration.
“There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it,” Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership was likely to be used against Palestinians.
“A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it’s not theirs under this new registration process,” he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right’s annexation agenda.
Changing demography
Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palesti­nian state, but many on Israel’s religious right want to take over the land.
The latest Israeli initiatives come in the wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to rights groups.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a recent statement.
US President Donald Trump has opposed Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, saying stability in the territory helps keep Israel secure.
However, he has held off from dire­ctly criticising the new Israeli measures, despite the international outrage.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967.
Al-Aqsa restrictions
Israeli police said Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Islam’s third-holiest site. Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, adding that thousands of police would also be on duty for Friday prayers.
Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.
The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55.

ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power and Regulatory Authority (Nepra) came under fire on Monday over abrupt changes to the net metering policy, as the National Assembly Stan­ding Committee on Industries and Production questioned the rationale of the move which would “shatter the trust of the investors in the government policies”.
In a meeting held under the chairmanship of MQM’s Syed Hafeezuddin, the parliamentarians and the government officials criticised the policy change from net metering to net billing.
Earlier this month, Nepra drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
According to the committee chairman, the policy will have serious implications for the government’s reputation. When the regulator can honour the commitments made to the independent power producers, it should also respect the response by industries and individuals who availed the net metering policy introduced by the government, he said.
Mr Hafeezuddin said the industrial units opted for this policy and invested in solar power systems, but they have been left in a lurch after the new net billing policy was introduced by the government.

 

Members of the committee and even the industries secretary expressed concerns that the policy change would shatter the trust of investors in government policies as well as discourage industries from adopting clean technologies. The com­m­ittee noted that the premise used by Nepra to change the policy was not based on any “rat­i­onal study” by the power ministry.
“Pakistan needs to promote solar and other clean energy for the industries; it will help reduce the cost of doing business on a long-term basis,” Mr Hafeezuddin added.
Development projects
The key agenda of the NA panel’s meeting was to review and approve the ongoing development projects under the various departments of the industries ministry. After strict scrutiny of the project, the committee turned down a large number of projects, demanding their monitoring reports from the Planning Commission. The delay and cost escalation particularly irked the panel members.
“I know and I understand that Covid and dollar crises, and a change in government had some impact on all matters,” Dr Mehreen Bhutto said, adding that all projects had been delayed by six to nine years and the briefs given to the lawmakers were “always incomplete — why is that the case”.
Committee members, including Abdul Hakeem Baloch and Shahid Usman, contradicted the claims made by the departments under the Ministry of Industries regarding several development projects. Responding to the projects in Hub and Karachi, the chairman reprimanded the officials that he had been to these areas and the ground reality was different.
While Shahid Usman had a different picture of the projects in Gujranwala, Dr Bhutto highlighted that the briefs presented to the committee lacked even basic details.
“There is no mention of rupees in millions or billions in the brief, the details are incomplete,” she added.
The committee members noted that departments opt to go for new buildings and purchase land for projects instead of using the land of non-functioning state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
“It is understandable why the SOEs are making losses,” Mr Hafeezuddin said.
The committee also discussed the case of a former employee of the Engineering Development Board, Engineer K.B Ali, who was transferred back to his parent department but he has approached the court of law and obtained a stay order.
