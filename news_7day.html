A meeting of a parliamentary committee, chaired by Shehbaz Babar, selected Jan after it was convened to appoint the next head of the influential media regulatory authority.
Following the committee’s unanimous approval, Jan’s name was forwarded to President Asif Ali Zardari for final confirmation.
A former Grade 22 officer, Jan has also previously served as the managing director of the state broadcaster PTV.
She was among five shortlisted candidates considered for the post, including Brigadier (retd.) Anwar Ahmed, Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf, and Dr Hamid Khan.

A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
“In Pakistan, the supermoon will rise at 5:51pm PKT on the evening of Jan 3, with an illumination of 99.8pc, and remains visible throughout the nights of Jan 3 and 4,” read the statement.
During the current event, which marks the final supermoon of the cycle that began in October 2025, the Earth–Moon distance will be approximately 362,312 kilometers, making the moon appear about 6 to 7 per cent larger and up to 10 per cent brighter than a typical full moon, it stated.
Supermoons typically occur in sequences of three to four consecutive events, with the current cycle concluding with the January 3 supermoon. The next cycle starts in November 2026.
In 2025, the first of the three supermoons lit up the country’s skies on October 7, followed by another on November 5, called the Beaver supermoon. The last supermoon of the year was visible across Pakistan on December 4 and 5.</p><small>2026-01-02 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02121222e58e180.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964653/ex-imran-aide-shahzad-akbar-says-uk-residence-subjected-to-deliberate-targeted-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-Imran aide Shahzad Akbar says UK residence subjected to ‘deliberate, targeted’ attack</strong></a><br><p>Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar has said that his house in the United Kingdom (UK) — where he has been living in self-imposed exile — was subjected to a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”.
The development comes a little over a week after Akbar said he suffered a fractured nose and other facial injuries after being attacked at his home.
In a post on X on Thursday, Akbar said that his home in Cambridgeshire, England came under attack on December 31, 2025, in a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”.
He said that the perpetrators “criminally damaged the property and attempted to set it on fire, placing lives at immediate risk”.







Akbar maintained it was the second such attack “within one week against my home, myself, and my family, each carried out with clear malicious intent”.
He held that the incidents were not isolated.
“I was physically assaulted in a targeted attack on Dec 24, leaving me with substantial injuries,” Akbar recalled.
He added that UK authorities were actively investigating both events, which are being treated as targeted attacks”.
“The UK has a legal and moral obligation to exhaust all available powers and resources to ensure that it remains a safe country for all, particularly for political dissidents and individuals at risk of persecution,” he further said.
In response to a written query from Dawn regarding Akbar’s statement on the latest incident, a London Counter-Terrorism Policing (CTP) spokesperson’s reply appeared to address last week’s assault on the ex-PM’s aide.
“Officers from CTP London are investigating an assault of a man in his 50s, which happened in the Cambridge area on the morning of December 24.
“The investigation was passed to CTP London due to what appears to be the highly targeted nature of the assault against the victim. At this stage, however, we retain an open mind as to any potential motivation behind the attack. There is not believed to be any wider threat to the public in connection with this incident,“ the spokesperson said.
No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains ongoing, the spokesperson added.
Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, said last week that an unk­nown assailant dressed in “construction or waste-collection attire” attacked him in Cambridge.
“The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me,” Akbar posted on X. “I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.”







The former accountability adviser termed the assault “cowardly” and urged the British government to ensure the safety of dissidents.
“Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out,” he wrote, vowing to continue exposing “corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan”.
This is the third such incident Akbar has reported since November 2023, when a masked individual threw acidic liquid at Akbar’s home in Hertfordshire. While Akbar had initiated legal action alleging Pakistani state involvement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office has “categorically rejected” those claims as “preposterous”.
Recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court, Akbar also faces extradition efforts. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.</p><small>2026-01-02 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0217065295607fb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964674/spectrum-starved-country-it-minister-says-govt-to-auction-600-mhz-spectrum-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>‘Spectrum-starved country’: IT minister says govt to auction 600 MHz spectrum next month</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced on Friday that Pakistan would auction the 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum next month to provide better internet speeds and roll out 5G in the country.
In a meeting last week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the process of auctioning the 600 MHz spectrum within two months.
“The spectrum available for our telecom industry is extremely limited,” said the minister while addressing the media in Islamabad, and added that telcos “provide services in the country using just the 274 MHz”.
“We are a spectrum-starved country,” she said.
“We are a country of 240 million people with only 274 MHz of spectrum,” she stated, adding that “Bangladesh, with about two-thirds of Pakistan’s population, provides 600 MHz.”

         View this post on Instagram            

The spectrum is the range of radio frequencies that carries wireless signals for mobile phones, the internet, TV, and radio. Mobile networks like 3G, 4G, and 5G operate by sending data over specific frequency bands within this spectrum. In South Asia, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka have launched 5G networks nationwide, while Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan have yet to do so.
The federal minister maintained that spectrum availability in Pakistan was the lowest in the region due to the absence of any major spectrum auction for many years.
“It will not only improve our 3G and 4G services, but also introduce 5G in Pakistan for the first time,” she elaborated.
The federal minister emphasised that the internet was “critical infrastructure,” like roads used to be in the past.
“The internet plays a crucial role in the development of the social sector, large-scale economic policies, and national and personal security. Without this [600MHz] level of connectivity, we cannot move forward,” she maintained.
The IT minister said that it is vital to perceive the internet and connectivity as an “enabling tool” that will unlock the country’s “ economic potential and create employment”.
Last week, during a press conference alongside the finance minister, Khawaja said that the government was trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February.
The federal minister said that in the auction, additional bands were being offered in Pakistan for the first time, which would not only improve 3G and 4G quality but also ensure the rollout of 5G services.
She stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.
In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction presented its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600 MHz band.
The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.</p><small>2026-01-02 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02181027cba036e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964665/iranian-official-reacts-to-trumps-statement-on-protests-warns-us-interference-would-mean-destabilising-region' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian official reacts to Trump’s statement on protests, warns US interference ‘would mean destabilising region’</strong></a><br><p>After US President Donald Trump warned Iran on Friday of intervention if authorities in the Middle Eastern country “violently kill” peaceful protesters, a top official of the Islamic Republic said any interference by Washington would mean “destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interests”.
“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
Reacting to his statement, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, posted on X: “With the statements by Israeli officials and Donald Trump, what has been going on behind the scenes is now clear.
“We distinguish between the stance of the protesting shopkeepers and the actions of disruptive actors, and Trump should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interests.”







He added, “The American people should know — Trump started this adventurism. They should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety.”
These statements follow the deaths of several people as Iran’s biggest protests in three years over economic hardship turned violent across multiple provinces.
The clashes between protesters and security forces mark a significant escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protesting on Sunday over the government’s handling of a sharp currency slide and rapidly rising prices.
Iran’s economy has struggled for years since the US reimposed sanctions in 2018, after Trump withdrew from an international nuclear agreement during his first term.
Meanwhile, the senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Larijani, said that US interference in Iranian protests would lead to chaos across the region.</p><small>2026-01-02 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021523292fb9202.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964669/ecp-sends-notice-to-shafiullah-jan-seeks-explanation-over-haripur-by-poll-allegations' target='_blank'><strong>ECP sends notice to Shafiullah Jan, seeks explanation over Haripur by-poll allegations</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday sent a notice to the Adviser to the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Shafiullah Jan, seeking an explanation for his statement blaming the electoral body for irregularities during the Haripur by-elections last year, sources said.
During a press conference on December 19, Jan blamed the ECP for electoral irregularities, and claimed Form 47 was issued from Islamabad instead of the returning officer’s office.
“This was a singular yet bizarre event in the country’s history, when a Form-47 was issued from Islamabad,” adding that “ECP didn’t upload all Form-45s from 602 polling stations in the constituency, nor could the PML-N produce all Form-45s from 602 polling stations.”
Sources said the ECP, in its notice, said “baseless” allegations were made against the commission concerning the conduct of the Haripur by-elections, including the issuance of Form-47 from Islamabad, the non-uploading of Form-45 on its website, and other claims of irregularities.
They further added that the electoral body had reviewed the matter and “is of the considered view that allegations made in the said statement are incorrect, misleading, and not supported by any evidence”.
Sources saud that such statements, when made publicly without any verifiable evidence, create “unnecessary confusion and adversely affect public confidence” in the electoral process.
“It appears to be an attempt to malign the institution.”
Jan has been directed to explain his position regarding the statements he made and provide “concrete and verifiable” evidence to support his claim within the next seven days.
Appropriate action, in accordance with the law, will be taken against Jan if he fails to provide evidence during the stipulated time period, said sources.
In November, by-elections were held for six national and seven provincial assembly seats, in which PML-N secured almost all the seats except one. However, the opposition party PTI alleged rigging and rejected the results.
For the NA-18 (Haripur) seat, PTI-backed independent candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub, wife of former opposition leader Omar Ayub, was defeated by PML-N’s Babar Nawaz.
The seat was vacated by Omar Ayub Khan upon his disqualification by the ECP over convictions in various cases.
The Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), an electoral monitoring body, also reported that by-elections were marred by “recurring violations” of campaigning restrictions and “gaps” in results transparency.</p><small>2026-01-02 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02164422bdcb22a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964672/contaminated-water-kills-9-hospitalises-200-in-indias-indore' target='_blank'><strong>Contaminated water kills 9, hospitalises 200 in India’s Indore</strong></a><br><p>At least nine people have died and more than 200 have been hospitalised in the central Indian city of Indore after a diarrhoea outbreak that officials said was linked to contaminated drinking water, according to a lawmaker and local health authorities.
Kailash Vijayvargiya, a lawmaker, said nine people had died in Indore.
Indore’s chief medical officer, Madhav Prasad Hasani, told Reuters by phone that drinking water in the Bhagirathpur area of the city was contaminated due to a leak and a water test had confirmed the presence of bacteria in the pipeline.
“I cannot say anything on the death toll, but yes, over 200 people from the same locality are undergoing treatment at different hospitals of the city. The final report of the water sample collected from the affected area is awaited,” Hasani said.
Shravan Verma, the district administrative officer, said authorities had deployed teams of doctors for door-to-door screening and were distributing chlorine tablets to help purify water.
“We have found one leakage point that could have contaminated the water and that point has been fixed,” Verma said, adding that officials had screened 8,571 people and identified 338 with mild symptoms.
Indore, in Madhya Pradesh state, has been named India’s cleanest city and has topped the national cleanliness rankings for the past eight years.</p><small>2026-01-02 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0213343429cd6bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964657/islamabad-atc-hands-double-life-sentences-to-youtuber-adil-raja-6-others-for-waging-war-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC hands double life sentences to YouTuber Adil Raja, 6 others for ‘waging war against Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) handed out two life sentences each to YouTuber Adil Raja, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, anchorperson Haider Raza Mehdi, analyst Moeed Pirzada and former army official Akbar Hussain in cases related to riots in the country on May 9, 2023.
The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest.
Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia.
The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws.
According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station.
Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station.
The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences.
They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC.
Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC.
They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences.
In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders.
The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentences handed out to them were to run concurrently.
“The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said.
The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”.
During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused.
Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court.
A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences.
The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023.
The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest.
Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023.
Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases.
“At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”.
“The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-02 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0215411361455cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964671/pakistan-7-other-muslim-majority-nations-express-deepest-concern-over-deteriorating-humanitarian-conditions-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, 7 other Muslim-majority nations express ‘deepest concern’ over deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, on Friday expressed concern at the “deteriorating” humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip — exacerbated by severe weather conditions — and stressed the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), expressed their “deepest concern” at the humanitarian situation in Gaza.







These countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October as a result of the effort, with Israel violating the truce multiple times by carrying out attacks in the Gaza Strip.
Last month, the UN International Organisation for Migration had said that hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were facing flooding of their tents and shelters due to heavy rains, and materials for shelters and sandbags were not being allowed to enter the enclave.
Much of Gaza’s infrastructure has also been destroyed because of the war, and Palestinians are facing grim living conditions.
In their joint statement on Friday, the eight Muslim-majority nations highlighted that severe, harsh, and unstable weather conditions, including heavy rainfall and storms, had exacerbated the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The situation had been further “compounded by the continued lack of sufficient humanitarian access, acute shortages of essential life-saving supplies, and the slow pace of the entry of essential materials required for the rehabilitation of basic services and the establishment of temporary housing”, the statement said.
It added that the “severe weather has laid bare the fragility of existing humanitarian conditions, particularly for almost 1.9 million people, and displaced families living in inadequate shelters.”
“Flooded camps, damaged tents, the collapse of damaged buildings and exposure to cold temperatures, coupled with malnutrition, have significantly heightened risks to civilian lives, including due to disease outbreaks, especially among children, women, the elderly, and individuals with medical vulnerabilities.”
The foreign ministers, in their joint statement, also lauded the “tireless efforts“ of United Nations’ organisations, in particular the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), and other humanitarian international NGOs, in continuing to assist Palestinian civilians and deliver humanitarian assistance under extremely difficult and complex circumstances.
They demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs were able to operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable, and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.
“Any attempt to impede their ability to operate is unacceptable,” the statement said.
The foreign ministers also expressed “full support” for a US-drafted resolution that endorses Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and was adopted by the UN Security Council in November last year. They also reaffirmed their support for Trump’s Gaza plan and their “intention to contribute to the successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, to secure a dignified life for the Palestinian people who have endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. 
They also called for the “urgent need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts”, including the provision of durable and dignified shelter to protect the population from the severe winter conditions.
The joint statement further said that the international community should “uphold its legal and moral responsibilities to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies, including tents, shelter materials, medical assistance, clean water, fuel, and sanitation support.”
The ministers also called for “immediate, full, and unhindered humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip without any interference by either party, through the UN and its agencies, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and hospitals, and the opening of the Rafah Crossing in both directions as stipulated in President Trump’s plan,” the statement read.</p><small>2026-01-02 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02150510d30d45d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964663/female-biker-killed-after-being-hit-by-trailer-in-karachis-landhi-driver-flees' target='_blank'><strong>Female biker killed after being hit by trailer in Karachi’s Landhi; driver flees</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Heavy vehicles’ reign of terror continued in the metropolis on Thursday as a female motorcyclist was killed after being hit by a trailer.
In recent months, the city has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
Quaidabad’s Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammad Ali Shah told Dawn that the driver of a 10-wheeler hit the 20-year-old female motorcyclist on the main Mehran Highway near MN Textile in Landhi.
“She suffered critical injuries and died on the spot,” Shah said.
“The driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the heavy vehicle that was impounded by the police,” he said.
The body was moved to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities.

 

Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said that a 60-year-old man was killed when a trailer truck hit him in Defence Phase 1 near the Akhtar Colony signal on Thursday night.
The statement added that since January 1, three people had been killed in accidents, while 70 others, including 10 children and 20 women, had been injured.
Friday’s development comes as a ban on the daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles in Karachi has been extended till Feb 22.
On Saturday, four people, including two brothers, were killed in three different accidents on the Super Highway, officials said.
The previous week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.</p><small>2026-01-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021335542d653ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964660/regard-taiwan-as-an-inalienable-part-of-china-pakistan-reiterates' target='_blank'><strong>Regard Taiwan as an inalienable part of China, Pakistan reiterates</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reiterated that Pakistan regarded Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.
The statement from FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi came in response to media queries seeking Pakistan’s response to “developments in the Taiwan Strait”.
“Pakistan and China are iron-clad friends and all-weather strategic cooperative partners. We reiterate our consistent support to China on all matters of its core interests, including Taiwan,“ he said.
“We will continue to adhere to the One-China principle and regard Taiwan as an inalienable part of China,” he said.







The FO spokesperson had made similar remarks during yesterday’s weekly press briefing in response to a question regarding the sale of arms to Taiwan by the United States.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan rejects China’s claims.
Although the statement released by the FO on Friday did not make a specific mention of the exact developments it was referring to, it comes after China completed military drills around Taiwan that included live-fire exercises aimed at simulating a blockade of key ports and assaults on maritime targets.
The US State Department on Thursday said the Chinese war games around Taiwan “unnecessarily” spiked tensions in the region, calling on Beijing to “cease its military pressure”.
“China’s military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan and others in the region increase tensions unnecessarily. We urge Beijing to exercise restraint, cease its military pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</p><small>2026-01-02 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02124422624bf6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964646/swiss-face-painful-task-of-identifying-victims-of-deadly-bar-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Swiss face painful task of identifying victims of deadly bar fire</strong></a><br><p>Investigators raced on Friday to identify the victims of a fire that ripped through a bar in the Swiss Alps town of Crans-Montana, turning a New Year’s celebration into one of the country’s worst tragedies.
It is not yet clear what set off the blaze at Le Constellation, killing around 40 people and injuring about 115 others, many seriously.
Bystanders described scenes of panic and chaos as people tried to break the windows to escape and others, covered in burns, poured into the street.
Swiss police warned it could take days or even weeks to identify everyone who perished, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.
“We’ve tried to reach our friends. We took loads of photos and posted them on Instagram, Facebook, all possible social networks to try to find them,” said Eleonore, 17. “But there’s nothing. No response.”
“Even the parents don’t know,” she added.
The exact number of people who were at the bar when it went up in flames remains unclear, and police have not specified how many are still missing.
Le Constellation had a capacity of 300 people, plus another 40 people on its terrace, according to the Crans-Montana website.
Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who took over on Thursday, called the fire “a calamity of unprecedented, terrifying proportions”, and announced that flags would be flown at half-mast for five days.
Local police commander Frederic Gisler said authorities were “in close contact with the victims’ families, whom we are informing in real time, as well as with the various embassies involved”.
“Given the international nature of the Crans resort, we can expect foreign nationals to be among the victims,” he told reporters.
The canton’s chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said significant resources have been deployed “to identify the victims and return their bodies to the families as quickly as possible”.
‘The apocalypse’
The fire broke out around 1:30 am (0030 GMT) Thursday at Le Constellation, a bar popular with young tourists.
“We thought it was just a small fire — but when we got there, it was war,” Mathys, from neighbouring Chermignon-d’en-Bas, told AFP. “That’s the only word I can use to describe it: the apocalypse. It was terrible.”
Authorities have declined to speculate on what caused the tragedy, saying only that it was not an attack.
Several witness accounts, broadcast by Swiss, French and Italian media, meanwhile, pointed to sparklers that were apparently mounted on champagne bottles held aloft by restaurant staff as part of a regular “show” for patrons who made special orders to their tables.
There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire”, Axel, a witness present at the time of the incident, told the Italian media outlet Local Team.
Pilloud said the investigation would look into whether the bar met safety standards and had the required number of exits.
Red and white caution tape, flowers and candles adorned the street where the tragedy occurred, while police shielded the site with white screens.
After the emergency units at the local hospitals filled up, many of the injured were transported across Switzerland and to neighbouring countries.
The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance, while French President Emmanuel Macron said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian broadcaster Rete 4 that around 15 Italians had been injured in the fire, and a similar number remained missing.
The French foreign ministry said nine French citizens figured among the injured, and eight others remained unaccounted for.
Multiple sources told AFP that the bar owners are French nationals: a couple originally from Corsica who, according to a relative, are safe, but have been unreachable since the tragedy.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/02120805447c59c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964655/hrcp-expresses-concern-at-roughing-up-of-youtuber-rajab-butt-during-court-appearance-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern at roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during court appearance in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Friday expressed concern over the roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi earlier this week.
On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises” and registered a case against them.
A video of the incident in question had showed Butt, clad in a shirt with the neckline torn open, attempting to move through a crowd surrounding him.
“The HRCP expresses grave concern over the reported physical assault on YouTuber Rajab Butt within the Karachi city court premises and the alleged involvement of members of the legal fraternity,” the HRCP said in a statement today on social media platform X.







“Violence, intimidation and vigilantism — particularly inside courts — undermine the rule of law and the right to due process,” it said.
The commission urged a “prompt, impartial investigation”, accountability for responsible parties and effective measures to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and court officials.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, had named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt.
Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.
On Tuesday, a group of lawyers had stormed the City Courts police station, manhandled a station house officer (SHO) and then staged a protest sit-in on M.A. Jinnah Road demanding an FIR against Mr Butt.
A day later, police had registered a criminal case against several lawyers, including Solangi, for allegedly assaulting the City Courts SHO after he lodged an FIR against them for assaulting Butt.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended Ashfaq’s practising licence for representing Butt before the court despite a strike called by the local bar.
It said that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. It added Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021158133d39520.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964652/australias-usman-khawaja-to-retire-after-ashes-finale-slams-racial-stereotyping' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Usman Khawaja to retire after Ashes finale, slams ‘racial stereotyping’</strong></a><br><p>Usman Khawaja said on Friday he will retire from international cricket after the fifth and final Ashes clash against England, leaving a legacy as Australia’s first Muslim Test cricketer while lashing out at perceived “racial stereotyping” during his 15-year career.
The 39-year-old will pad up for the last time, should he be selected, when the Test gets under way in Sydney on Sunday, ending months of speculation about his future.
It would be an 88th Test for the classy left-hander, culminating a career where it began after making his debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2011, also against England.
“The number one emotion is contentment. I’m very lucky to have played so many games for Australia the way I have,” Khawaja said.
“I hope I have inspired people along the way.

“I’m a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now, and you can do the same.”

Khawaja immigrated to Australia from Islamabad as a child, battling the odds to become the country’s first Pakistan-born, and first Muslim, national player.
At one point, he was the only Asian first-class player in Australia and is credited as a role model who opened doors for others.
“Usman has made a huge contribution to Australian cricket both through his outstanding achievements as one of our most stylish and resilient batters since his Test debut 15 years ago, and off field, particularly through the Usman Khawaja Foundation,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg.
“On behalf of Australian cricket I would like to thank and congratulate Usman for all he has achieved.”
Khawaja’s foundation helps youths from refugee, immigrant, Indigenous, and poor socioeconomic backgrounds through introductory cricket programs and educational support.
‘Attacked me’
Khawaja, a qualified pilot, has plundered 6,206 runs in Test cricket with 16 centuries, averaging 43.39.
He smashed a career-high 232 against Sri Lanka a year ago, but has not made three figures since.
The current Ashes series has been a rollercoaster ride, with the veteran batsman coming under scrutiny.
He injured his back in the first Test in Perth and was replaced as opener in the second innings by Travis Head who blasted a match-winning century.
Khawaja did not feature in the next match at Brisbane and was omitted from the team for the third Test in Adelaide, only to get a lifeline when Steve Smith dropped out ill just before the toss.

         View this post on Instagram            

He came in at number four and hit 82 and 40 before making 29 and 0 in the fourth Test at Melbourne.
“I’m glad I get to leave on amy own terms, with a little bit of dignity, and go out at the SCG where I love,” he said, while expressing frustration at how he was treated.
“When I did my back (in Perth), I hurt my back and had back spasms and it was something I couldn’t control.
“The way the media and past players came out and attacked me. I could have copped it for a couple of days but it went on for five days.
“The way everyone came out at me about my preparation, ‘he’s not committed to the team. Only worried about himself. Playing a golf competition. He’s selfish, he didn’t train hard enough. He’s lazy’.
“These are the same racial stereotypes (I thought we had moved past).
“But obviously we haven’t fully moved past that. I haven’t seen anyone treated like that in the Australian cricket team before.”
He nevertheless admitted the writing was on the wall during the current Ashes series.
“Going into Adelaide and then not being picked initially for that game was probably a sign for me to say ‘all right, it’s time to move on’,” he said.
Khawaja also played 40 one-dayers and nine Twenty20 internationals.</p><small>2026-01-02 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/021117432bf7e94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964651/canada-asks-air-india-to-probe-incident-of-pilot-reporting-for-duty-under-influence-of-alcohol-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Canada asks Air India to probe incident of pilot reporting for duty under influence of alcohol, source says</strong></a><br><p>Canada’s transport regulator has asked Air India to investigate an incident of a pilot reporting for duty under the influence of alcohol and failing two breathalyser tests, a person familiar with the matter said.
The tests were conducted by Canadian police at Vancouver International Airport, after the pilot was asked to leave the aircraft, the person said.
The incident was labelled as a “serious matter” by Transport Canada in a letter to Air India, and authorities are likely to pursue enforcement action, the person added.
The person requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Transport Canada did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside regular working hours.
In a statement, Air India confirmed the flight from Vancouver to Delhi on December 23 experienced a last-minute delay due to the incident, adding that an alternate pilot was brought in to operate the flight.
“The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,” Air India said.
“Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.”
The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said.
India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India’s aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022.

 

Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny.
This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making.
The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters.
The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.</p><small>2026-01-02 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0208350505e7d59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964544/trump-says-aspirin-caused-bruised-hand-denies-falling-asleep' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says aspirin caused bruised hand, denies falling asleep</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Pres­ident Donald Trump blamed aspirin for large bruises on his hand and denied falling asleep while attending public meetings, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on Thursday.
In the interview defending his health, the US leader also changed his previous statement about receiving an MRI scan in October, saying it was instead a quicker CT scan.
Trump, who at 79 is the oldest person to assume the US presidency, told the Journal “my health is perfect” and expressed frustration with scrutiny of his well-being.
Trump has based much of his political image on projecting vigour whether through his frequent interactions with journalists, constant social media posting, or AI memes depicting him as a superhero.
However, the first year of his second term in office has raised growing questions.
His right hand shows persistent bruising, often covered with thick makeup and at times a bandage, and his ankles have appeared swollen.
On occasion, Trump has clearly struggled to keep his eyes open, including during a televised Oval Office meeting with health representatives in November, a politically sensitive issue for someone who constantly frames his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as “sleepy”.
Bruising and ‘blinking’
The Republican explained the bruising on his hand as the result of aspirin that he takes daily to thin his blood. “I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” he told the Journal.
He said he applies makeup or bandages when his hand is “whacked”. One cut, he said, was caused when his attorney general Pam Bondi hit the back of his hand with her ring while giving him a high-five.
Explanations of his health issues have been inconsistent.
Trump himself told reporters that he underwent an MRI scan in October, but said at the time he had “no idea what they analysed”.
To the Journal, Trump said it was not an MRI, “it was less than that. It was a scan”.
Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, confirmed to the newspaper that a CT scan a procedure that takes far less time than an MRI was done “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues”.

Coins and decorative lapis lazuli stones, dating back to the 2nd and 6th centuries BC, were unearthed during recent excavations.—Dawn

TAXILA: Archaeologists excavating the ancient Bhir Mound have unearthed decorative stones dating to the 6th century BC and rare coins from the 2nd century AD, a discovery officials are hailing as the most significant at the site in a decade.
The finds were made during ongoing excavations at the Unesco-listed site, which is regarded as the earliest urban settlement of the extensive Taxila civilisation.
Experts uncovered fragments of metamorphic decorative stone identified as lapis lazuli, alongside the rare bronze coins attributed to the Kushan dynasty, dramatically pushing forward the material narrative of ancient Gandhara.
Aasim Dogar, the deputy director of the Punjab Department of Arch­aeology who serves as head of the excavation team, confirmed the preliminary analysis of the artefacts.
“The decorative stones are lapis lazuli, a prized semi-precious stone, while the coins belong to the Kushan period,” Mr Dogar said.
The excavation team relied on specialised forensic assistance to date the metal artefacts. Mr Dogar noted that detailed numismatic analysis conducted by specialists from the University of Peshawar confirmed that the coins bear the image of Emperor Vasudeva. Vasudeva is recognized by historians as the last of the ‘great Kushan rulers’ who presided over the region.
According to Mr Dogar, the obverse of the recovered coinage depicts Vasudeva, while the reverse features a female religious deity.
Mr Dogar described this specific imagery as a distinct hallmark of Kushan-era religious pluralism, which often blended various theological traditions.
The artefacts were discovered on the northern side of the archaeological remains, specifically within the B-2 trench — one of 16 distinct trenches currently excavated at the site. Dogar said the surrounding archaeological evidence reveals that these specific remains constituted a residential area.
These latest discoveries affirm that Taxila reached the zenith of its political, cultural, and economic influence under Kushan rule, particularly bet­ween the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.
“Under emperors such as Kanishka the Great, Taxila emerged as a major administrative, commercial, and intellectual centre,” Mr Dogar said.
Mr Dogar added that widespread Kushan patronage of Buddhism during this era led to the construction of stupas, monasteries, and vast religious complexes.
The period also marked the rise of Gandharan art, a distinctive synthesis of Greek, Roman, Persian, and Indian traditions, with Taxila serving as its core hub.
Malik Tahir Suleman, a renowned numismatist, told Dawn that Kushan coins serve as some of the most critical historical sources for understanding ancient South and Central Asia.
“Issued between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, Kushan coins evolved from Indo-Greek imitations into a sophisticated imperial currency system,” Mr Suleman said.
“Struck mainly in gold, copper, and bronze, they reflect the empire’s economic strength and vast trade networks, including links with Roman markets.”
Mr Suleman said Kushan coinage is distinguished by its rich iconography and multilingual inscriptions.
He explained that they often depict rulers in Central Asian attire on one side and a remarkable range of deities — from Helios and Mithra to Shiva, Nana, and the Buddha — on the other.
Beyond the coins, the discovery of the deep-blue lapis lazuli fragments provides vital clues regarding anci­­ent supply chains. Mr Dogar noted that the stone has been valued for mil­­lennia across ancient civilisations.
“Its presence at Taxila points to long-distance trade links, particularly with Badakhshan in present-day Afghanistan, a historic source of lapis lazuli,” Mr Dogar said.

ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.
These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday.
Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows.

 

The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives.
Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan.
In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured.
The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations.
Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance.
Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year.
These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others.

The premier emphasised that looking into domestic energy resources was critical for national economic stability.
He also ordered the digitisation of the entire supply chain for the import and domestic utilisation of oil and gas on a priority basis.
“With the digitisation of the oil and gas supply chain, smuggling of these products will be effectively curbed, which will ultimately benefit the national exchequer,” the prime minister noted.
The meeting was info­rmed that the Oil and Gas Development Comp­any Limited (OGDCL) had discovered significant new oil and gas reservoirs in the Nashpa Block area of Kohat district.
The newly discovered re­s­e­rves are expected to yield around 4,100 barrels of oil per day.
The meeting was also informed that domestic con­sumers experienced improved gas pressure during the current winter season against last year.
Officials said work on RLNG connections had been stepped up, with a target of providing 350,000 new connections by June 2026.
The meeting was further told that pipelines for the Sheva and Batani gas fields had been commissioned, while work on the pipeline from the Kot Palak gas field was underway.
Chairing a separate mee­ting on economic reforms, the PM highlighted that implementation of the government’s economic governance policies was inevitable. He sou­ght proposals from all relevant ministries sugges­ting practical measures and a comprehensive strategy invo­lving minimal duration.

ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners.
The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy.
“We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said.
Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported.
Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day.
Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council.
At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”.
“So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said.
Exchange of lists
Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown.
Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.”
He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added.
India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani.
The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
“Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said.
Dulhasti power project
The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.

 

Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations.
“No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.”
The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension.
Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart.
Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.”
He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

The PTI earlier said that it will not engage in negotiations with the federal government. Party Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
“Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News Capital Talk on Thursday.
He said the efforts at the level of leaders like him and PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Malik Amir Dogar, would continue, but until confidence among the top leaders is established, the political situation would not see a breakthrough.
Sanaullah added that confidence-building measures would be possible only when social media accounts propagating a hate campaign against the army and its leadership are shut down.
“The PTI leadership can’t evade responsibility [for these accounts] … They have to disown them,” he said, adding that PTI could instead initiate propaganda against political parties.
He further said that the PTI should withdraw its call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, as it would be a “failure” and would further “damage the situation”.
In response to Sanaullah, Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.
“If these five leaders meet the conflict can be resolved,” added Dogar, without specifying which five leaders he was referring to.
‘Outright rejected negotiations’
Separately, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while speaking on Dawn News Dosra Rukh, denied any contacts with the government regarding negotiations.
“We have outright rejected the negotiations,” he said, adding that Imran Khan had stated the PTI would not negotiate with a Form-47 government.
“The decision on whether to hold negotiations with the government rests with Achakzai and Abbas, as they welcomed it in the statement issued by the TTAP after the national conference,” he said.
In response to another question on PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar’s statement regarding meetings with Imran Khan, Akram said: “PTI is dealing with frustration due to his statement, and this is clearly visible outside Adiala prison, where a crowd gathers every Tuesday. FIRs are lodged, people are arrested, yet workers gather the following week.”
Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.</p><small>2026-01-02 02:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/020722450d022a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964638/new-york-mayor-mamdani-vows-to-enact-democratic-socialist-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>New York Mayor Mamdani vows to enact democratic socialist agenda</strong></a><br><p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s mayor on Thursday, vowing during a public swearing-in ceremony on the steps of City Hall to enact an aggressive agenda aimed at making the nation’s largest city more affordable for working people.
Mamdani, a member of his party’s left-wing democratic socialist faction, was elected last November in a prominent victory that could influence this year’s midterm elections that will determine control of the US Congress. Some Democrats have embraced his style while Republicans portray him as a foil on the national political stage.
The 34-year-old campaigned heavily on cost-of-living issues and was sharply critical of Republican US President Donald Trump, whose approval rating has fallen over the past year amid economic concerns.
Many of New York’s 8 million residents — some with hope, some with trepidation — expect him to be a disruptive political force.
In a speech following his public swearing-in, Mamdani promoted core campaign promises of universal childcare, affordable rents and free bus service.
“We will answer to all New Yorkers, not to any billionaire or oligarch who thinks they can buy our democracy,” he said. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist.”







‘Tax the rich’
The programme for Mamdani’s inauguration included remarks by US Senator Bernie Sanders and US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, fellow democratic socialists at the vanguard of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.
Sanders, whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, defended Mamdani’s agenda.
“Making sure that people can live in affordable housing is not radical,” Sanders said. “It is the right and decent thing to do.”
The crowd of several thousand cheered loudly when Sanders called on America’s millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes, breaking into a chant of “tax the rich”.
Even with temperatures well below freezing, the city set up a viewing area along Broadway to allow thousands more to watch a livestream of the ceremony, which included musical performances.

 

Mae Hardman-Hill, 27, volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign and said it felt like his political momentum was growing.
“I’m a native New Yorker. I’ve watched the city like you just become less and less affordable, less and less livable,” Hardman-Hill said. “I’m really excited for … regular people to get some power back again.”
Prior to the public ceremony, Mamdani was privately sworn in as New York City’s mayor in the first minutes of the New Year on Thursday at the historic City Hall subway station, which was decommissioned decades ago and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.
Reflecting his Muslim faith, he used the Holy Quran for his swearing-in, a first for a New York City mayor.
Republicans blast Mamdani
Hours after Mamdani took office, the lead group tasked with electing Republicans to the US House of Representatives sought to portray him as a “radical socialist”.
“Every time Mamdani opens his mouth or swipes his pen, he tattoos the Democratic Party’s failures onto every House Democrat facing voters in 2026,” spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement that signaled the sizable role Mamdani is likely to play on the national campaign stage.
Mamdani, a former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for the Democratic Party around the country ahead of November midterm elections.
Dean Fuleihan, the incoming deputy mayor, told the Financial Times that Mamdani will move ahead with plans to increase taxes on millionaires to pay for his campaign promises and balance New York’s budget.
He added that he doesn’t expect rich people to leave the city as a result of potentially higher taxes.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul has said she opposes raising personal income taxes but is considering raising corporate taxes to pay for a potential budget shortfall amid federal cuts.
In one early reversal, Mamdani said on Wednesday that he would no longer seek to end mayoral control of New York City’s public school system, the largest in the US, naming veteran educator Kamar Samuels as chancellor.
Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 per cent of the vote in November, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.
Inauguration of a new era
The Uganda-born Mamdani has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.
Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg’s first term in 2001.
As mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilisation programme, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan’s upscale Upper East Side.
Bankers and others in New York, the nation’s financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election many have explored how to work with him.</p><small>2026-01-02 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/020725203fe1f0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964543/traders-question-inflation-figures-despite-relief' target='_blank'><strong>Traders question inflation figures despite relief</strong></a><br><p>• Vegetable price slump offsets costlier staples• Tomato glut eases prices, hurts growers• Flour, milk and meat rates climb
KARACHI: Traders appear dissatisfied with the official inflation numbers, despite the fact that prices of many items have declined compared to rising trend in other items.
Consumers have found some relief in vegetable prices, with tomatoes leading the decline. Tomato prices have dropped to as low as Rs30 per kg in various cities, although this relief for consumers has hit growers hard.
In Karachi, several pushcart vendors are seen offering 2.5kg to 3kg tomatoes for Rs100, owing to heavy arrivals from producing areas.
According to the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the last week of December 2025, the national average price of tomatoes ranged between Rs30 and Rs130 per kg across different cities.
Consumers are also benefiting from improved onion supplies from producing areas, thus dropping the national average price to Rs60-140 per kg from Rs110-180 per kg in the first week of January 2025.
The national average price of new potatoes has also plunged to Rs30-100 per kg, compared to Rs80-150 per kg a year ago, in various cities.

 

During October 2025, in contrast, consumers had paid Rs600-700 per kg for tomatoes in various parts of the country, while onion prices had reached Rs220 per kg.
Pulses prices have largely remained stable. The national average price of gram pulse decreased to Rs220-350
per kg from Rs330-450 per kg over the past year.
The average prices of moong, masoor and mash stood at Rs340-470, Rs240-330 and Rs360-530 per kg, respectively, compared to Rs350-470, Rs260-370 and Rs440-590 per kg in the first week of January 2025.
Fresh milk prices in the country edged up to Rs170-260 per litre from Rs150-240 a year back.
The price of a 20kg wheat flour bag jumped to Rs1,810-2,650 from Rs1,580-2,200 after an increase in wheat rates whose 10kg bag price soared to Rs1,052 from Rs806 over the past year. The average price of fine flour rose to Rs132 per kg from Rs111.
The national average price of 1kg ghee pouch, 2.5kg ghee pack and five-litre cooking oil also increased to Rs560-590, Rs1,400-1,588 and Rs2,850-3,110, respectively, from Rs545-585, Rs1,370-1,500 and Rs2,695-2,945 a year earlier.
The price of beef with bones and mutton (average quality), which were Rs700-1,300 and Rs1,550-2,400 a year ago, has soared to Rs900-1,450 and Rs1,700-2,550 per kg, respectively.
Prices of Basmati broken rice have slightly surged to Rs140-300 per kg from Rs130-280, while prices of Irri 6/9 rice
in Sindh and Punjab remained unchanged at Rs110-200 per kg during the last one year.
Zaid Bin Haris at Sherman Securities said the food index rose 3.2pcYoY, due to increase in prices of wheat (up 20.8pcYoY), chicken (up 16.11pcYoY) and meat (up 13.56pcYoY).
Mr Haris attributed the rise in wheat prices to higher retail rates, prices, supported by a new government wheat policy raising its minimum support price (MSP) to assist flood-affected farmers. He added that chicken and meat prices increased YoY due to higher feed costs and weak enforcement of price controls, keeping market prices above official rates.
‘Highly disappointing year’
Separately, All Karachi Tajir Itehad Chairman Atiq Mir termed 2025 as a “highly disappointing year” in which trading and business activities shrank by 60pc, alongside rising food prices, unemployment and declining business confidence and investment.
In a statement, he further said no new industrial units were set up during the year, which led to increased capital flight amid an uncertain business environment.
While painting a bleak outlook for 2026, Mr Mir said the government appeared non-serious in providing a business-friendly environment, citing rising prices of power, gas, LPG, petrol and diesel, along with a number of taxes and duties.

Police sources said tickets for the musical night were sold at Rs5,000 for families and Rs2,000 for individuals. However, tickets were allegedly sold beyond the venue’s capacity and adequate arrangements for spectators were not made.
As a result, the area reserved for spectators became overcrowded. A large number of ticket-holders also gathered outside the venue in an attempt to gain entry.
Security guards of the housing society stopped the gathering and did not allow them to enter the concert venue, prompting protests by the ticket-holders.
It has yet to be established how the protest turned violent and which side took the first step in disrupting law and order. A police contingent was deployed at the venue for security and crowd control, but it reportedly remained a silent spectator until the situation worsened.
During the protest, a physical confrontation broke out between the ticket-holders who were denied entry and the security guards. Both sides pelted stones at each other, while the guards also used batons to disperse the crowd.
The use of force further angered the gathering, which then began damaging property.
Police intervened when the situation went out of control and used force along with anti-riot gear to disperse the protesters. During the police action, a couple of protesters were picked up and taken to police installations.
Videos that went viral on social media showed some youngsters throwing stones at the guards and damaging property. In the clips, guards can also be seen chasing and manhandling some of the youths.
The housing society management had arranged the musical concert and sold tickets in different categories. Some participants alleged that despite purchasing tickets, they were not allowed entry, which became the initial cause of the disturbance.
Sources said the society management was planning to register an FIR, but no official complaint had been lodged so far. 
According to sources, the management told the police that they would come to lodge a complaint, but it remains unclear when this will happen.
