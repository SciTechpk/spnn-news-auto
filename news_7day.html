Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc and claimed at least 63 lives across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.
“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and glacial melting,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.
According to the data released by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division at 4pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage with falling water inflow and outflow at the former, and rising flows at the latter.
There was a low-level flood at Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm. While the water inflows and outflows were falling at Tarbela and Guddu, they were rising steady at Sukkur.

In view of the situation, the PDMA issued a warning for an expected high-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma during the next 24 hours.
“Activate flood monitoring and early warning systems,” the advisory said. It also ordered authorities to strengthen embankments, establish relief and medical camps, as well as stockpile essential medicines and food.
According to NDMA’s website, 15 people have died across the country in the last 24 hours as a result of the rains, while 53 have been injured. Eleven of these deaths were reported from Punjab.
Since June 26, 193 people have lost their lives in rain-related incidents across the country and 544 others have been injured, the website data said.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 114 deaths and 437 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 40 fatalities, Sindh 21, Balochistan 16 and one death each in Azad Kashmir and Islamabad.
In a statement, the PDMA urged residents living alongside the rivers to evacuate the areas with their cattle. “The Punjab government will fully take care of you and your livestock,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia was quoted as saying.
Alerts had been issued to the Sargodha and Dera Ghazi Khan commissioners as well as the deputy commissioners of Mianwali, Layyah, Bhakkar, Kot Addu, Rajanpur and Muzaffargarh.
It directed the local administration, the agricultural, health, wildlife, livestock and transport departments, and Rescue 1122 to remain alert and be fully prepared. The PDMA stressed to ensure ample fuel stock for rescue operations.
 


Flood level at Kalabagh has been moderate since at least 6am, according to data issued by the PDMA earlier today.
In a statement, the authority said that the water levels at the Ravi, Chenab, and Sutlej rivers were normal, as well as those at Dera Ghazi Khan’s irrigation system.
“The water level in Mangla Dam is 47 per cent and 79pc in Tarbela, whereas the water levels in Indian dams on Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi are up to 36pc,” said the statement.
Rains continue in Lahore, expected in south Punjab & Sindh
Meanwhile, rains continued in Lahore, with the city recording as much as 111mm of rainfall at Nakhuda Chowk, according to the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa).

Yesterday, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and left dozens dead.
This year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik was quoted as saying by APP.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza, in a statement, directed the Lahore Electric Supply Company to ensure uninterrupted power supply. He advised citizens to avoid electric cables and poles, as well as areas where water accumulates.
 






Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed and Vice-Chairman Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmad visited various low-lying areas of Lahore, including Nakhuda Chowk, Bhaati Gate, Circular Road, Akbari Gate, Delhi Gate and Kotwali.
The Wasa top officials were briefed on the water drainage operations, a statement by the agency said. Ghufran ordered the teams to speed up their efforts and ensure that the machinery was fully functional.
 






Over 1,000 rescued along Potohar plateau: PDMA
Amid the ongoing situation, the PDMA DG directed the administration to stay on high alert.
“PDMA Control Room and District Emergency Operation Centres are monitoring the situation 24/7”, said DG Kathia in a statement, urging the public to take necessary precautionary measures, avoid unnecessary travel, and steer clear of electric wires and poles.
Detailing the PDMA’s rescue efforts in a statement, he said that “more than 1,000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.
“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” Kathia claimed.
The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.
 


DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.
Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.
Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.
According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.
Widespread monsoon rains expected across KP from July 20-25: Met Office
Another spell of monsoon rains accompanied by wind and thundershowers across most parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from the evening of July 20 to July 25, according to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
According to the Peshawar Regional Met Office, a new monsoon weather system is expected to enter the province during the said period. The system is likely to be further intensified by an incoming westerly wave, which may result in widespread rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds in multiple districts.
The areas likely to be affected include Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral (Upper & Lower), Dir (Upper & Lower), Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan (Upper & Lower), Kolai Pallas Kohistan, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, and North and South Waziristan (Upper & Lower).
The KP PDMA warned that the rains may include scattered heavy to very heavy downpours in some areas, along with lightning and strong winds, which may pose risks of urban flooding, landslides in hilly terrain, and disruption in daily routines.
Through a letter to all deputy commissioners, the PDMA has advised the authorities across the province to remain alert and take precautionary measures during the forecast period. The public and tourists too have been advised to take precautionary measures.

A police investigative report released on Wednesday found that the evidence so far indicated that the actor’s death — whose body was discovered in a Karachi apartment on July 8 — was accidental or due to natural causes.
“No traces of any sedative, psychiatric, narcotics or any poisonous substances are found,” according to the contents of the report prepared by experts associated with the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences of Karachi University (KU) and obtained by Dawn.com.
The Gizri police had sent the samples of the 42-year-old actor’s hair, lung and liver collected by Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Doctor Bakhtawar Khan on July 8. The KU lab performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) technique to analyse the said samples, the report said.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the police have received the report of the late actor’s body samples.
The senior officer hinted at the possibility that medico-legal officers and doctors would likely call it a “natural death”.
The South DIG said the investigators have also obtained the “medical history of the late actor from a private hospital in Clifton in the recent past”.
South-DIG Raza said that investigators have also received a DNA report from Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology Laboratory at the KU. Sharing findings of the forensic lab, the senior officer said the report stated that there was a “human blood on a stain section taken from shirt and trousers of Humaira Asghar.”
However, the DIG said it was a “meager amount of blood that might have been caused by biting insects.” He said as per concerned procedure, the MLOs and doctors would determine the exact cause of death in light of these findings of the both labs of the KU.
He said the police would submit the reports to the doctors and they expected that they would give their final version about cause of death on Monday.
Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore last week following a sparsely-attended funeral.
Earlier in the month, police formed a special investigation team to probe the actor’s death, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment on July 8.
The notification calling for the formation of the investigation team had directed them to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed had confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
 
 

The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing arts, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1820134994a36f5.jpg?r=201650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925029/pakistan-records-annual-current-account-surplus-of-21bn-state-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan records annual current account surplus of $2.1bn: State Bank</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday announced that Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $2.1 billion during the current fiscal year.
Due to the widening trade gap and higher external debt servicing, the country posted a current account deficit of $103 million in May compared to a $47m surplus in the preceding month and $1.2bn in March.
According to SBP data, the current account saw a surplus of $2.1bn, compared to a deficit of $2.1bn during the previous fiscal year.
 






Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted the developments in a post on X, stating that the surplus was the highest in 22 years.
“[The] country’s current account for June 2025 closes in $328m surplus, taking full-year surplus to over $2.1bn,” he wrote.
Schehzad added that remittances surged by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach a “historic” $38bn.
He added that in the current fiscal year, textile exports increased by 7.4pc year-on-year to $17.9bn, while IT (information technology) and IT-enabled services exports climbed to $4.6bn — a year-on-year increase of 44pc.
“Last, but not the least, [the] Pakistan Equities Market (KSE-100) crossed 140,000 points, making a historic mark in its history, with market value crossing Rs 16.8 trillion (close to $60bn),” he wrote.
 






Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the current account surplus, calling it “very welcome”.
“Foreign exchange reserves have exceeded $19bn due to government measures,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from his office.
“The main reason for the stability in current account surplus is a significant increase in remittances and exports,” he added. “Improving financial and economic indicators show that the country’s economy is on the path of stability.”
Commending his team, the PM said that the government is taking priority steps to provide a business and investment-friendly environment in the country, according to the statement.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18193444c66bbfe.png?r=193650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925022/fo-says-pakistan-has-dismantled-terrorist-outfits-amid-us-designation-of-group-blamed-for-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>FO says Pakistan has ‘dismantled’ terrorist outfits amid US designation of group blamed for Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying that the country has “effectively and comprehensively dismantled” terrorist outfits.
The statement follows the US State Department’s decision on Thursday to designate a little-known group  called The Resistance Front (TRF) — responsible for the Pahalgam attack — as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.
The April 22 attack — which resulted in the deaths of 26 people — sparked a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
According to a BBC News report in June, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
The US State Department claimed that the little-known group was a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
“TRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,” the State Department said in a statement.
In a statement today, the FO said, “Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities.
“Pakistan has effectively and comprehensively dismantled concerned outfits, arrested and prosecuted the leadership, and deradicalised its cadres,” it added.
“Pakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy.”
The FO highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, including the apprehension of Mohammad Sharifullah, who was the “mastermind” of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport.
The statement further said that the investigations into the Pahalgam incident were “still inconclusive”.
“While the issue under consideration pertains to US domestic laws, India has a track record of exploiting such designations to push anti-Pakistan propaganda with a view to divert international attention from its irresponsible and rogue behaviour, including ongoing human rights atrocities, especially in occupied Kashmir,” it added.
The FO’s statement also urged the international community to “adopt objective and non-discriminatory policies” to address terrorism.
“Terrorist organisations like Majeed Brigade must also be listed as [an] alias of BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army),” the FO asserted.
In 2022, an anti-terrorism court awarded a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart­ment.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog, in 2022 removed Pakistan from a list of countries under “increased monitoring”, also known as the “grey list”, after four years.
“It has two concurrent action plans. After a lot of work by Pakistani authorities, they have largely addressed all of the action plan items,” then-FATF president Raja Kumar said.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181855368e515e3.jpg?r=185602' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925023/13000-to-15000-pakistani-students-go-to-uk-for-permanent-residence-every-year-senate-panel-told' target='_blank'><strong>13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to UK for permanent residence every year, Senate panel told</strong></a><br><p>Around 13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to the United Kingdom for permanent residence every year, a Foreign Office (FO) official told the Senate on Friday.
“Every year, 13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to the UK for permanent residence,” a FO representative told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis in a meeting chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada.
“Pakistani students prefer to settle in the UK rather than return to the country,” the official added.
“These students are willing to work even for minimum wage.”
According to the official, Pakistani students then become part of the UK labour market.
The FO representative told the panel that there are currently 1.8 million Pakistanis living in the UK.
“Pakistani citizens face difficulties [in the UK] due to lack of English proficiency,” the official added.
Earlier in the week, UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
On Wednesday, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK.
In May, a British government official said that the government may restrict visa applications from students living in countries — including Pakistan — that are considered most likely to claim asylum in a move designed to bring down annual net migration.
The move came after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party was punished in local elections in England last week by voters angry over issues, including illegal immigration.</p><small>2025-07-18 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18175156c0eda2b.jpg?r=183205' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925017/pakistan-beat-india-3-0-in-asian-mens-u-16-volleyball-championship-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan beat India 3-0 in Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship semi-final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday beat India 3-0 in the Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship semi-final being held in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand.

“Stellar performances from Junaid, Faizan, Irfan, and Talha powered the Green Shirts into the Final and one step closer to glory,” the association said.
With this victory, Pakistan qualifies for the final, where they will face Iran on July 19 at 3:30pm PKT.
On Wednesday, Pakistan secured a place in the semi-finals of the Asian U-16 Volleyball Championship and booked their berth in next year’s FIVB U-17 World Championship after defeating Indonesia in straight sets in the quarter-final.
The national side had registered another 3-0 victory with set scores of 25-23, 25-20, 25-20. Key contributions came from Junaid, Faizan, Talha, and Saran, who were instrumental in maintaining Pakistan’s unbeaten run in the tournament.
 


“This win is not just about reaching the semi-finals; it’s about proving that Pakistan’s youth has the strength and skill to compete at the highest levels,” Pakistan head coach Kafiatullah had said. “Qualification for the FIVB U-17 World Championship is a moment of national pride.”
Earlier in the group stage, Pakistan had overcome South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Chinese Taipei to advance to the knockout round.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181505518810c8c.jpg?r=150613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925001/2-martyred-2-injured-as-gunmen-attack-balochistan-constabulary-convoy-in-mastung-govt' target='_blank'><strong>2 martyred, 2 injured as gunmen attack Balochistan Constabulary convoy in Mastung: govt</strong></a><br><p>A Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries on Friday when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a blast that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.
According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.”
“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.
Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.
He continued, “Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished.”
“A formal investigation into the attack has been launched, and the elements involved will be brought to justice,” he added.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing Fitna-Al-Hindustan — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
 






Earlier today, the spokesperson said that one Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others were injured in the incident.
“According to initial reports, the acting DSP’s vehicle was targeted,” Rind said in a statement.
The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.
Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.
The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.
On July 16, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an attack on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.
In a separate incident on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate. The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.
On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1817453032ae157.jpg?r=174657' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925019/first-batch-of-300-pakistani-agriculture-graduates-complete-training-in-china' target='_blank'><strong>First batch of 300 Pakistani agriculture graduates complete training in China</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday announced that the first batch of 300 Pakistani agriculture graduates had completed their hands-on training in China’s Shaanxi province as part of a joint agriculture training initiative.
Last July, it was announced that 1,000 students would travel to China for modern agricultural vocational training at the government’s expense. The first batch of students was sent to China at the beginning of the academic year 2024-25, while the next batch would be sent to Chinese agricultural universities after learning Chinese in Pakistan.
In a post on X, the PM said it was “very heartening” to hear that the 300 students completed their training “in important areas of water saving irrigation, seed production, animal husbandry, agriculture production and prevention of post-harvest losses”.
“My special thanks to the Chinese leadership, [the] Shaanxi Government and the two universities,” PM Shehbaz said, referring to North West Agriculture and Forestry University and Yangling Vocational and Technical College.
“Appreciation for [the] Ministry of National Food Security, HEC (Higher Education Commission) and Pak Embassy Beijing for their hard work in ensuring the success of this initiative,” he wrote.
 






The Chinese Embassy also published a post on X congratulating the graduates on completing their training.
“May these talented youths play an important role in promoting Pakistan’s agricultural modernisation and [Pakistani and Chinese] agricultural cooperation!” the embassy wrote.
 






Earlier this year, PM Shehbaz reiterated the government’s determination to transform the country’s agriculture sector on modern lines, emphasising that the sustainable development of this key sector of the economy is inevitable.
In the Pakistan Economic Survey released in June, the overall agriculture sector, which accounts for nearly 24 per cent of GDP, posted modest growth of 0.6pc in fiscal year 2024-25, falling well short of the 2pc target and significantly below the announced growth of 6.4pc.
Major crops such as wheat, cotton, and maize contracted by 13.5pc, a sharper decline than an estimated 4.5pc.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18162937d2d0756.jpg?r=162946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925009/security-forces-foil-infiltration-bid-by-terrorists-on-pak-afghan-border-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces foil infiltration bid by terrorists on Pak-Afghan border: state media</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run PTV News reported on Friday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“Pakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by Khawarij along the Pak-Afghan border,” PTV News reported, citing security sources.
Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
PTV said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, Khawarij tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.
“The Khawarij advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,” the state broadcaster said.
All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.
Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, PTV added.
“Security sources say that India is giving full support to the Khawarij separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,” PTV News said.
ASI, constable injured in quadcopter attack: police
A police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP’s Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.
“The injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,” DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was “crucial for combating terrorists in the district”.
The DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.
“National unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,” the DPO said “Police alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.”
Earlier this month, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an “Indian proxy”, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.
On July 9, security forces killed eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.
Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1816122610859c8.jpg?r=171237' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925010/body-of-policeman-swept-away-in-jhelum-floods-found-laid-to-rest-with-honour' target='_blank'><strong>Body of policeman swept away in Jhelum floods found, laid to rest with honour</strong></a><br><p>The body of a police constable, who was carried away by flash floods during a rescue operation to evacuate stranded residents in Jhelum district, has been recovered after 24 hours and he was laid to rest with honour, the district police said on Friday.
Punjab government declared a state of emergency and imposed section 144 in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding across the province. Data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) showed 61 people were killed and 268 injured, while more rains are expected in the coming days.
Dozens of villages were inundated in Jhelum district after unabated rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday, and a rescue operation was launched by the district administration to evacuate residents stranded amid flash floods.
During the rescue operation in Chotala area, six police constables were boarding a tractor trolley to evacuate local residents when the vehicle overturned due to raging floodwaters.
Consequently, constable Haider Ali Hussain was swept away, while others managed to survive. His body was recovered by Rescue 1122 divers after an extensive search operation.
Jhelum District Police Officer Tariq Aziz Sindhu told Dawn.com: “During the rescue efforts, the water flow suddenly intensified, and while saving citizens, he (police constable) lost his own life.”
He said the policeman went missing in the floodwaters and an operation was launched to locate and retrieve him with the assistance of drone surveillance and diving efforts. He paid tribute to the “ultimate sacrifice of the martyred constable”.
Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Syed Meisam Abbas said the severe flash floods in Jhelum, Sohawa and Pind Dadan Khan tehsils were successfully handled with the rescue mechanism directly monitored by the chief minister.
Abbas added that no residents were killed, except for the police constable. He said rescue officials, police, civil defence, and army personnel with assistance of helicopters made concerted efforts to rescue over 450 residents and their cattle from risky situations.
The constable’s funeral was held at Police lines Jhelum and was attended by police officers and provincial adviser Dr Azhar Mahmood Kiyani.
Inspector General of Punjab Police Usman Anwar issued a message on X, expressing his grief over the incident. “The brave constable attained martyrdom while helping flood victims, and his services would long be remembered by the police department,” the police chief said.
In a post on X, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kiyani, who was monitoring the flood situation in his home district, paid homage and announced a financial compensation under the police martyrs’ package. He also appreciated the role of the district administration and rescue teams.
 






Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif, in a post on X on Thursday, expressed her “heartfelt appreciation to the brave officers of Jhelum Police for their extraordinary courage, swift response, and selfless commitment during the recent flash floods”.
“Rescuing over 400 stranded individuals in such perilous conditions is nothing short of heroic. Their unwavering dedication to public service is a testament to the strength and resilience of our law enforcement. They have proven themselves [as] the true guardians of our community,” she added.</p><small>2025-07-18 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18162519192cd44.png?r=163039' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925004/coas-munir-libyan-armed-forces-chief-agree-on-defence-industrial-collaboration-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir, Libyan armed forces’ chief agree on defence industrial collaboration: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and Libyan Armed Forces’ Commander in Chief Lt Gen Saddam Khalifa Haftar agreed on their countries’ collaboration in the defence industry, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.

“Both leaders agreed to undertake defence industrial collaboration and exchange of technical expertise to address contemporary security challenges,” the ISPR stated.
It noted that the meeting “encompassed discussion on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional dynamics, security challenges and matters pertaining to defence cooperation”.

In May, Libya’s capital of Tripoli witnessed the worst clashes in years after the killing of a major militia leader. The fighting calmed down two days later after the government announced a ceasefire, residents said.
President Asif Ali Zardari had visited Libya during his previous tenure in May 2009. He met with then-Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi in Tripoli, where they vowed to bolster bilateral ties and agreed to boost economic cooperation between the two countries.</p><small>2025-07-18 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18162054cc2d10e.jpg?r=162252' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925007/three-sri-lankan-elephants-killed-in-blow-to-conservation-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Three Sri Lankan elephants killed in blow to conservation efforts</strong></a><br><p>At least three wild elephants were found dead across Sri Lanka on Friday, officials said, a day after six young rescued elephants were returned to the jungle under a conservation drive.
Wildlife officials said one elephant was run over by a passenger train in the island’s northeast, while two others were found shot dead in the central and eastern regions.
Elephants are protected by law and considered sacred due to their significance in Buddhist culture, but farmers often kill them to protect their crops.
Human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka has resulted in the deaths of nearly 200 elephants and 55 people so far this year.
“We have launched investigations into the shootings of the two elephants, it looks like the work of local farmers,” a police spokesman in the capital Colombo said.
The train accident occurred in Gallella, the same area where seven elephants were killed by a locomotive in February, the worst incident of its kind in Sri Lanka. It happened despite speed limits on trains passing through elephant-inhabited forest areas.
A Sri Lanka railway official said an “internal investigation has been launched to establish if the driver had violated the speed limit”.
Wildlife authorities released six elephants, aged between five and seven, back into the jungle on Thursday after rehabilitating them under a conservation programme that began in 1998.
The Elephant Transit Home in Udawalawe, about 210 kilometres southeast of Colombo, cares for rescued animals and eventually returns them to the wild. The sanctuary is a major tourist attraction and holds 57 elephants that had been abandoned, injured, or separated from their herds.
Sri Lankan authorities believe the transit home’s strategy of rewilding rescued elephants, rather than domesticating them, has been successful.
The home has returned 187 elephants to the wild since 1998.
Conservation efforts have become increasingly urgent due to the escalating conflict between wild elephants and farmers.
Official figures from Sri Lanka’s wildlife department show that 4,835 elephants and 1,601 people have been killed in the worsening conflict since 2010.</p><small>2025-07-18 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18155355c11cdb1.jpg?r=160513' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925002/one-billion-africans-being-harmed-by-cooking-pollution' target='_blank'><strong>One billion Africans being harmed by cooking pollution</strong></a><br><p>One billion Africans have to cook on open fires or with fuel that is hazardous to their health and the environment, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.
The problem, which its report says can be easily solved, causes as much greenhouse gas emissions every year as the aviation industry.
Two billion people across the world still cook on open fires or with rudimentary stoves fed by wood, charcoal, agricultural waste or manure, the IEA report found.
“It is one of the greatest injustices of our time, especially in Africa,” IEA head Fatih Birol told AFP, where four out of five households rely on open fires and burning wood.
These fuels pollute the air both indoors and outdoors with fine particles that penetrate the lungs and cause multiple respiratory and cardiovascular problems, the report said.
It also adds to the destruction of forests, natural sinks that trap carbon and help fight global warming.
 






The IEA estimates that 815,000 premature deaths occur each year in Africa alone due to poor indoor air quality, largely resulting from a lack of access to clean cooking methods.
Women and children suffer the most, spending hours each day searching for fuel and keeping the fire going.
This takes time away from paid employment or education, the report said.
‘Can be easily solved’
A landmark IEA summit on the issue, held in Paris in May last year, raised $2.2bn in public and private sector commitments, as well as political pledges from 12 African governments.
Since then $470 million has been distributed, with concrete results already being seen, Birol insisted, citing a stove factory under construction in Malawi and an affordable stove programme developed in Uganda and Ivory Coast.
The IEA report assesses the progress made a year after the summit and sets out a roadmap for African countries to be able to use clean cooking methods at low cost before 2040.
Since 2010, nearly 1.5bn people in Asia and Latin America, particularly in Brazil, India, and Indonesia, have gained access to modern cooking stoves and fuels.
But the challenge remains immense in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of people without access to clean cooking methods continues to grow.
“For once and for ever, this problem can be solved with an annual investment of $2bn per year,” Birol said.
He stressed that the figure “is about 0.1 per cent of global energy investment, which is nothing”.
Alternative solutions are well known: electricity from solar panels, renewable gas and especially liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a fossil fuel, which, while not ideal, is preferable than the loss of carbon sinks due to tree felling, Birol said.
The IEA said this would prevent 4.7m premature deaths in sub-Saharan Africa by 2040 and reduce the continent’s greenhouse gas emissions by 540m tons per year, as much as the equivalent of the annual emissions of the global aviation sector.</p><small>2025-07-18 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18123841bf5bdfd.jpg?r=124041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924987/pakistans-muhammad-asif-to-face-indian-cueist-in-ibsf-world-masters-final-today' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s Muhammad Asif to face Indian cueist in IBSF World Masters final today</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani cueist Muhammad Asif is set to face India’s Brijesh Damani in the final of the International Billiards & Snooker Federation (IBSF) World Masters Snooker Championship 2025 in Bahrain’s Manama city on Friday.

On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry chaired a meeting on the ferry service today to review the “technical and financial aspects of ferry operations”, a statement by his ministry said.
“Five private companies presented their proposals,” the statement added.
 
 

“The interest of the private sector in ferry service has increased,” Chaudhry said, adding that various routes were under consideration. “The ferry service will promote regional connectivity and trade.”
“The movement of passengers and goods from Gulf countries will become easier,” he noted, adding that the service will highlight Gwadar on the international maritime map.
The ministry also stated that the meeting included instructions to conduct further evaluations of the submitted proposals. “Authorities were directed to ensure that all regulatory, technical, and logistical considerations are fully addressed ahead of the ferry service launch,” it said.
During the meeting, the maritime minister held a phone call with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and discussed provincial cooperation. Bugti “assured full cooperation in the ferry service project”, according to the ministry.
In a statement on X, the Balochistan government said, “The meeting discussed important matters related to the development of Gwadar, public facilities, and increasing employment opportunities for the youth.”
CM Bugti was quoted as saying that the provincial government was giving “serious consideration” to the ferry service from Gwadar to Oman, which will “facilitate pilgrims and ease travelling for the local population”.
“Assuring full cooperation from the Balochistan government, the chief minister stated that this initiative will prove to be a milestone in strengthening regional connectivity,” the statement read.
 






The Balochistan government also vowed to provide cooperation and support at every level for the full operationalisation of Gwadar Port.
“All proposed development projects of the Gwadar Port Authority will be fully supported so that Gwadar Port can play a central role in the national economy,” the statement affirmed.
The statement also said that 1.2 million gallons of clean drinking water will be provided daily to Gwadar citizens through a desalination project that will be established under the Gwadar Port Authority, calling it a “significant step toward a lasting solution to the long-standing water issue”.
 
 

CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The government is committed to providing world-class training to the youth.”
The youth will be taught various skills under the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, while the provincial government’s program to train and provide overseas employment to 30,000 youths will be supported by the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, the statement added.
Today’s development comes after Chaudhry visited the Gwadar port on Wednesday to review various ongoing development projects.
 






The country has recently increased efforts on the commercialisation of the Gwadar Port, which was built more than a decade ago but remains a non-starter, turning the multi-billion-dollar infrastructure facility into a white elephant instead of becoming a transhipment hub.
Earlier this year, the government sought the private sector’s support in routing their cargoes through the port, seeking detailed proposals to enhance trade.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued directives for devising short- and medium-term strategies to operationalise Gwadar Port effectively within six months. He emphasised the importance of comparing Gwadar’s trade costs with other regional ports.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18151705c4b237c.png?r=151908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925000/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-baloch-others-on-15-day-physical-remand-again' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC sends Mahrang Baloch, others on 15-day physical remand again</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days, marking yet another extension of their detention.
In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
On July 8, a Quetta ATC handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention. The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch.
Today’s hearing was taken up by ATC Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, while Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch and Advocate Shoaib Baloch, appeared in court.
On the request of the police, the judge handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody on a further 15-day remand.
Advocate Shoaib Baloch told Dawn.com that Dr Mahrang’s lawyers opposed the 15-day physical remand and told the court to ask the investigation team what was achieved in the previous 10-day remand.
“No response was given by the investigation team, and zero progress was made,” the counsel said. “Despite this, the court ordered a 15-day remand.”
Tight security arrangements were made today for the activist’s appearance in court.
On Tuesday, international human rights organisation Amnesty International called upon Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.
It called on CM Bugti to drop all charges and overturn detention orders against Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.
Subsequently, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch appealed to the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.
The petition alleged that her “repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion” and labelling her as a “sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
The same month, the Kech chapter of the BYC launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club in protest of the leadership’s arrests.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18111357c38bf91.jpg?r=111408' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924804/crisis-of-protection-child-rights-violations-surge-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa' target='_blank'><strong>Crisis of protection: Child rights violations surge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is witnessing an alarming rise in violations of child rights, with a recent report revealing 402 incidents in just the last six months, a figure that already surpasses the 392 cases recorded in 2024.
According to a report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission (KPCPWC), children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuse and neglect, ranging from disappearance, forced labour and corporal punishment to sexual violence and murder.
The report documented 40 cases of missing children, 26 reports of children running away from home, 40 incidents of sexual abuse, 17 cases of child labour, 16 reports of forced begging, 14 incidents of corporal punishment, 13 cases of physical torture, seven cases of child murder, and two incidents of child pornography.
Of the total 402 documented cases, 286 involved boys, while 116 were related to girls.
‘A child protection emergency’
Nadia Khan, a member of the National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC), voiced deep concern about the province’s limited capacity to protect its vulnerable youth.
“We only have one functional child protection unit in Peshawar, while the province is home to over four million children,” she said.
“This should be treated as a child protection emergency. We need long-term, child-centric policies that ensure sustainable protection.”
Her concerns are echoed by data showing that only 19 out of 36 districts currently have operational child protection units, leaving nearly half the province without institutional safeguards.
Need for community role
While government inaction remains a critical issue, some argue that the responsibility doesn’t lie solely with the state.
“We can’t blame the government alone,” said Maham Afridi, a programme lead at the NCRC. “Our society must also play its part.
“There is an urgent need to engage communities, spread awareness and include religious leaders who hold influence and can support awareness efforts.”
Meanwhile, parents of children expressed their own fears and worries.
“I don’t take my 12-year-old daughter outside alone with me anymore,” Aftab Awan, a 46-year-old resident of Peshawar, told Dawn.com. “People stare at my daughter, and that makes me uncomfortable.”
Cultural barriers
Deep-rooted cultural and social stigmas are a major reason why child abuse cases often go unreported in Pakistan, says prominent social activist Rakhshanda Sajid.
“In many communities, issues related to child abuse are seen as a matter of family ‘honour’. People choose silence over justice, fearing shame or social backlash,” Sajid said.
“There’s a fear of disgrace, and often, the victims themselves are made to feel guilty or ashamed. This toxic mindset prevents justice and allows abuse to continue unchecked.”
 
 

Sajid also criticised the prevailing belief that family matters should not be interfered with, even in cases of abuse.
“Many still think that disciplining a child through harsh means is part of good parenting. These outdated beliefs normalise violence and make it harder for children to speak up,” she emphasised.
She urged both the government and civil society to launch widespread awareness campaigns to change public perceptions and empower victims to come forward and seek support.
“We must break the silence and challenge the harmful norms that protect abusers and isolate victims.”
Government vows reforms
In response to the growing crisis, Minister for Social Welfare Qasim Ali Shah stated that new laws to address child rights violations were in the pipeline.
Shah told Dawn.com that there were some legal challenges related to street children’s custody, stating that laws regarding custody would be introduced in the coming days.
“To study the case of such children, we must have custody for 15 days or one month,” he added.
“We are moving towards legislation that will directly address the protection needs of our children,” the minister said.  “We will make Peshawar and the province beggar-free.”
In late June, the KP government inaugurated a separate helpline for the first time for child protection cases. Simultaneously, a centre for continuing professional development was inaugurated, Shah said.
“The centre aims to discuss better policymaking regarding effective child protection,” he said.
Along with the commission, concerned departments and members of civil society, as well as social workers, will also take part in the discussions.
Komal Murad, programme manager at KPCPWC, confirmed plans to expand services across the province.
“We’re working to establish child protection units in more districts,” she added.
Murad told Dawn.com that in 36 districts, there were currently only 19 child protection units, adding that more child protection units would be established in the upcoming days.

“Accessibility is key to prevention and intervention.”

A law with limited implementations
Back in 2010, the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act was enacted to safeguard child rights.
Imran Takkar, A known child rights activist, told Dawn.com that while the laws were brilliant, “what we need is the implementation”.
He added that investment was needed to gain results out of laws, but noted that the government seemed “too slow” regarding the availability of funds.
As per law, child protection courts were to be formed in all 36 districts of the province, Takkar said, but added that “we see only eight as of yet in more than a decade”.
By law, he said, a chief must be appointed to the child protection commission, adding that “since 2014, no chief to the commission has been appointed besides several advertisements”.
Despite repeated announcements, implementation remains slow and fragmented.
Nauman Mohib Kakakhel, a high court lawyer and legal expert, said that there were no loopholes, scarcity of trained personnel, or poor inter-departmental coordination at the NCRC, but a lack of implementation has allowed countless children to fall through the cracks.
“The only thing lacking is the concerned department’s interest to work on it on a full scale,” Kakakhel added. He urged that it was the job of the child protection unit to serve the child, saying, “We see meetings over child protection but with minute implementations.”

The interior ministry said a plane carrying the men took off Friday morning bound for Afghanistan, adding that all the deportees were under expulsion orders and were convicted by the criminal justice system.
The government of Europe’s top economy was forging ahead with a “policy change”, said Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who was hosting several European counterparts for a migration meeting.
“Deportations to Afghanistan must continue to be carried out safely in the future. There is no right of residence for serious criminals in our country.”
Berlin has had only indirect contact with the Taliban authorities through third parties with Friday’s operation executed with the help of Qatar, said the German interior ministry.
Germany had stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.
But expulsions resumed last year for the first time since the Taliban came to power, when the previous government of Social Democrat chancellor Olaf Scholz expelled a group of 28 Afghans convicted of crimes.
Rights concerns
Human rights group Amnesty International strongly criticised the renewed deportations to Afghanistan saying the situation in the country was “catastrophic”.
“Extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, and torture are commonplace,” the group said in a statement.
At the beginning of the month, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, accusing them of crimes against humanity over the persecution of women and girls.
Merz told a press conference on Friday that Germany wants to be an “attractive country for immigration”, to attract the best talent and fill gaping labour shortages,
The previous government’s policies had however left local administrations with too large a burden to carry, Merz said.
His government had “initiated corrections” to put migration policy on the right course, he said, including tightening border controls and limiting family reunifications rights for some refugees.
Merz said that policing Germany’s borders with its neighbours was only a “temporary” solution and a durable solution was needed at the European level.
Migration summit
Dobrindt was meeting his French, Polish, Austrian, Danish and Czech counterparts, as well as European Commissioner for Home Affairs Magnus Brunner, in southern Germany on Friday.
The objective of the meeting is to “strengthen European migration policy,” Dobrindt told the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.
A debate over resuming expulsions has flared as migration has risen up the political agenda in tandem with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The AfD scored a historic election result of over 20 per cent in February — its highest score at a national level — leaving the party nipping on the heels of Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc.
The controversy over immigration was fuelled by a series of deady attacks last year where the suspects were asylum seekers — including several from Afghanistan.
Germany’s new government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), has promised to expel more foreign criminals alongside a crackdown on irregular migration.
As well as carrying out deportations to Afghanistan, Dobrindt has said he was in contact with authorities to enable deportations to Syria, which have been suspended since 2012.</p><small>2025-07-18 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18141254f332e71.png?r=141718' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924997/iran-says-europeans-have-no-grounds-to-trigger-sanctions-snapback' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says Europeans have no grounds to trigger sanctions snapback</strong></a><br><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told his European counterparts on Friday that they have no grounds for reactivating UN sanctions after they threatened to do so in the coming months unless there is progress in nuclear talks.
“If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they (have) absolutely no moral (or) legal grounds,” Araghchi said on X.
 






He added that “any new round of talks is only possible when the other side is ready for a fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial nuclear deal.”
The remarks came after Araghchi held a conference call with his British, French and German counterparts and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
The European diplomats told Araghchi of “their determination to use the ‘snapback’ mechanism — which allows for the reimposition of all international sanctions against Iran — in the absence of concrete progress” towards a new deal on Iran’s nuclear programme “by the end of the summer”, the French foreign ministry said.
French officials have previously indicated that this means by the end of August.
Last month, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the Europeans would be “justified” in seeking a snapback of UN sanctions lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, later abandoned by US President Donald Trump.
“Without a firm, tangible, and verifiable commitment from Iran, we will do so no later than the end of August,” he told reporters.
Last week, Araghchi urged the Europeans to play “a constructive role” on the nuclear issue.
“The threat of sanctions does not help diplomacy,” Araghchi told French newspaper Le Monde.
There has been much speculation about the status of Iran’s nuclear programme since Israel and the United States bombed key facilities last month.
A clause in the 2015 agreement allows for UN sanctions on Iran to be reimposed through a snapback mechanism in the event of non-compliance.
But the deal expires in October, giving the parties to it a fast-approaching deadline to invoke the clause.
Iran and the United States held several rounds of nuclear negotiations through Omani mediators before Israel launched its 12-day war on June 13. Trump’s decision to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities effectively ended the talks.
Since the end of the hostilities, both Tehran and Washington have signalled willingness to return to the table, though Tehran has said it will not give up its right to the peaceful use of nuclear power.
An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in matter of state, said on Monday that there would be no new nuclear talks with the United States if they were conditioned on Iran renouncing uranium enrichment.</p><small>2025-07-18 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1811114145e58eb.png?r=111354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924970/lightning-strikes-kill-33-people-in-indias-bihar' target='_blank'><strong>Lightning strikes kill 33 people in India’s Bihar</strong></a><br><p>Lightning strikes during monsoon storms in eastern India this week killed at least 33 people and injured dozens, officials said on Friday.
The deaths in Bihar occurred during fierce storms between Wednesday and Thursday, a state disaster management department statement said, with the victims mostly farmers and labourers working in the open.
More heavy rain and lightning are forecast for parts of the state.
Bihar state’s disaster management minister, Vijay Kumar Mandal, told AFP that officials in vulnerable districts had been directed to “create awareness to take precautionary steps following an alert on lightning”.
The state government announced compensation of 4 million Indian rupees ($4,600) to the families of those killed by lightning.
India’s eastern region, including Bihar, is prone to annual floods that kill dozens and displace hundreds of thousands of people during the peak monsoon season.
South Asia’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
 
 

The region is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
In May, Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.
At least 34 people died over four days in early June in India’s northeastern region after heavy floods caused landslides. Another four lost their lives in Bangladesh.
At least 243 died by lightning in 2024 and 275 the year earlier, according to the state government.</p><small>2025-07-18 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18092806a82e774.jpg?r=092812' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924871/reko-diq-paid-175m-royalties-to-balochistan-government' target='_blank'><strong>Reko Diq paid $17.5m royalties to Balochistan government</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Reko-Diq Mining Company (RDMC) has paid more than $17.5m in royalties to the Balochistan government, its officials said on Thursday.
The details were shared during a media briefing on the Reko-Diq project’s progress.
Communications Manager Samia Ali Shah said payments tallied as of June 2025 include $17.5m in royalties to the Balochistan government and nearly $3.8m to the federal government on account of employees and others parties’ income taxes collected by the company.
Ms Shah explained that the Balochistan government holds a 25 per cent partnership in the project without making any direct investment. The overall venture is a 50-50 partnership between the government of Pakistan and RDMC.
The briefing also highlighted the company’s efforts in local workforce development.
Present at the event were trainees who had just returned to Pakistan after completing 18 months of training in Argentina, sponsored by the company.
“The young talent going for training abroad comprises 14pc females,” Ms Shah said, adding the project has long-term benefits for the region.

According to Rescue 1122 sources, some locals dared Shabeer (66), a retired railway employee, to swim across the big and deep canal, setting a Rs1,000 bet on the arduous task for the elderly man, who was not even a trained swimmer.
The old man accepted the challenge and jumped into the canal.
Quoting eyewitnesses, the sources said, as the old man started drowning, the onlookers kept laughing and recording videos of him, instead of trying to save him. They also uploaded the video clip on social media.
When the old man disappeared in the water, someone called Rescue 1122 for help. By the time a rescue team reached the spot the old man had already drowned, they said.
The Rescue 1122 divers retrieved the body and handed it over to the victim’s family.
As the video went viral, many social media users condemned those who instigated the elderly man to jump into the deep canal and did not even help him when he was drowning, demandingtheir arrest. 
So far, Uch Sharif police have not taken any action over the tragic incident.
WOMAN MURDERED: A man allegedly axed his sister-in-law to death and seriously injured his niece over her marriage issue at Chak No 95 on Multan Road in the limits of Thingi police station in Vehari district.
According to police and Rescue 1122, the suspect, Ali, brought a marriage proposal of his relative for his niece, Fatimah, but his wife Pakeeza, opposed it.
On Thursday, Ali began quarrelling with his sister-in-law Pakeeza (mother of Fatima) over the marriage issue and in a fit of rage attacked her with an axe, leaving her dead on the spot.
He also attacked his niece, injured her and fled the scene.
On receipt of an emergency call, a Rescue 1122 team reached the spot and shifted Fatima to the hospital. The police shifted Pakeza’s body to the hospital for autopsy.Police have yet to register a case against the fleeing suspect.

The Journal story says the letter featuring a sketch of a naked woman and Trump’s signature was part of a collection of notes for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.
The newspaper says it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.
Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker “was told directly by (White House press secretary) Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network.
“Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway,” he said.
“President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. (Rupert) Murdoch, shortly. The press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist.”
 
 

The Republican president was already facing a firestorm over his past relationship with Epstein, and claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with federal sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for sexual abuse by his wealthy contacts.
He was previously required to register as a sex offender in Florida after pleading guilty to two felony prostitution-related charges.
Later on Thursday, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release transcripts of grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, “subject to court approval”.
‘Another wonderful secret’
The alleged letter — which Trump denies writing — is raunchy, as were others in the collection, the Journal reported. It contains several lines of typewritten text, contained in an outline of a naked woman drawn with a marker.
“The future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair,” the Journal reported.
“The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’”
Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the figure, telling the Journal: “This is not me. This is a fake thing.”
“I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”
Murdoch, who controls the NewsCorp global media company, was in Trump’s suite on Sunday at MetLife Stadium outside New York City for the FIFA Club World Cup final.
Epstein row
The Trump-supporting far-right has long latched onto the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a still-secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up.
Trump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office in January, but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.
The Justice Department and FBI said in a memo made public earlier this month that there is no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful people.
 
 

They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.
That could change if grand jury testimony or evidence are released.
On Thursday, US media reported that a federal prosecutor who handled Epstein’s case, who is the daughter of a prominent Trump critic, was abruptly fired.
Maurene Comey, whose father is former FBI director James Comey, was dismissed on Wednesday from her position as an assistant US attorney in Manhattan, the reports said.
Comey also prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell, the only former Epstein associate who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.
Maxwell is the person who compiled the leather-bound book of letters for Epstein in 2003, The Journal reported.
“The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.
 






Meanwhile, Democratic lawmaker Pat Ryan wrote: “I think we now know EXACTLY why Donald Trump refuses to release the Epstein files.”

The event, hosted by the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, was held to celebrate the new CJ’s appointment.
Justices Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Khadim Hussain Soomro, Mohammad Azam Khan and Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas were present on the occasion.
 
 

However, senior judges Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz were not in attendance.
Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar, who are among the five-judge group that lodged the challenge before the Supreme Court, are already on leave. Justice Mohammad Asif is also availing summer vacations.
Speaking on the occasion, IHC CJ Dogar highlighted the steps taken for swift disposal of cases, saying that specialised benches had been constituted for speedy disposal of cases related to those who are already behind bars.
Justice Dogar said that cases related to overseas Pakistanis will also be given priority, while special attention was being paid to reducing the IHC and district judiciary’s backlog.

• Claims opposition didn’t raise issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers
• Bhachar rejects assertion, says no return to house until MPAs’ suspension withdrawn
LAHORE: Negotiations between the trea­­sury and opposition benches in the Punjab Assembly made headway during the third round of talks on Thursday, with both sides reaching an agreement on parliamentary conduct and activation of key house committees.
However, a deadlock persists over the reinstatement of 26 suspended opposition lawmakers and the withdrawal of fines imposed on them — an issue the opposition insists is non-negotiable for their return to the house.
The 26 PTI lawmakers in question were suspended for 15 sittings following their protest during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech on June 27.
Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehm­an told reporters after the meeting on Thursday, “This was the third sitting of the negotiation committee, and today’s session was productive. We have reached a consensus with the op­­­position (on certain issues),” he said.
He added that in future, there would be no use of abusive language, sloganeering or disruptions during assembly proceedings. “When the opposition leader speaks, there will be no sloganeering. Similarly, there will be no disruptions during the chief minister’s speech. The house will operate according to the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee,” he noted.
Mr Rehman also said the Ethics Com­m­ittee would be made functional and tasked with reviewing any violations of the assembly’s rules of procedure after each session.
He claimed the opposition had not raised the issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers. However, the assertion was rebutted by opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar. Speaking to the media separately, he said, “We will never enter the house without our suspended colleagues.”
Mr Bhachar confirmed that both sides had exchanged proposals and agreed on reactivating the Advisory Committee and the Ethics Committee.
He emphasised that the house would be run under the framework of the Ethics Committee and Rule 223 of the Rules of Procedure, indicating a move towards more structured parliamentary proceedings.
Regarding the heated exchanges that have plagued recent sessions, Mr Bhachar said the government acknowledged the opposition’s right to protest but stressed that abusive language is not a good practice. “We have never called it good either. Abu­sive language will not be tolerated,” he said.
Despite these agreements on parliamentary decorum, the core demand of the opposition remains the reinstatement of their sus­p­ended members and the withdrawal of fines.
“No one asked us for an apology, nor did we apologise,” Mr Bhachar said, warning: “If our people are not reinstated, the opposition will hold an assembly outside the (provincial) assembly.”
He stressed the opposition’s unwavering stance: “We are in the opposition; it never backs down from protest. If the government wants the opposition to come into the house, then they can reinstate [our members].”
He questioned the rationale behind any expectation of an apology. “Why would we apologise when our members are suspended and fined?” he asked. “Fines have not been waived and our people are still suspended. Until they are reinstated, we will not return to the house.” He also underlined a key constitutional right, stating: “No member can be deprived of their right to vote.”
Meanwhile, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, who is abroad on a private trip, participated in the negotiating committee meeting via an audio link. He congratulated all members of the committee on the successful talks and reiterated the negotiation committee’s decision, particularly the agreement on not using indecent language.
He was quoted as saying that “the decisions of the Ethics Committee will be supreme” and urged that “the act of use of abusive language should not be repeated”.
The speaker affirmed that “the opposition has the right to protest, but according to the Constitution”.

Without any evidence, New Delhi had blamed Islamabad for the April 22 attack, which saw 26 people killed in the Baisaran hill station, and used it as a pretext to launch military strikes against Pakistan.
According to a recent BBC News report, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
Thursday’s statement from the State Department seemed to echo India’s viewpoint, which has claimed that the little-known newly-formed group was actually a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
India also blames the LeT for orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks and several other attacks on military forces. The US earlier designated LeT as an FTO in December 2001.
One of the first mentions of the group came in 2020, when then-Indian army chief M.M. Naravane accused Pakistan of creating a “new terror group” in occupied Kashmir.
“I would rather call it Terror Revival Front. It is another terrorist organisation by another name. This is a terrorist organisation supported by its proxies across the border. They will be dealt with appropriately,” he was quoted as saying. Pakistan’s Foreign Office had rejected the allegation at the time.
“These actions taken by the Department of State demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” the statement said.
In a recent interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that Pakistan was ready to cooperate with India against this group.
At the time, Mr Thapar had claimed that New Delhi’s attempts to have the group designated as a terror outfit by the United Nations had been blocked by China, on Pakistan’s behalf.

• ANP’s Shahida Waheed wins draw on women seat
PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday withdrew its candidate in favour of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for a seat reserved for non-Muslims, paving the way for JUI-F to become the largest opposition party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly with 18 lawmakers.
As a result, JUI-F’s candidate Gorpal Singh will now be notified as MPA-elect on the said seat by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Shahida Waheed was declared the winner through a draw against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) candidate for a seat reserved for women. She will also be notified by the ECP as MPA-elect.
 
 

Both developments took place at the office of Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Saeed Gul in Peshawar on Thursday, where senior party leaders were present.
PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam and JUI-F’s Maul­ana Attaur Rehman attended the event along with their respective candidates, Gorsaran Lal and Gorpal Singh. The PML-N delegation formally withdrew its candidate in support of JUI-F’s nominee.
Similarly, delegations of ANP, led by MPA Nisar Baz and candidate Shahida Waheed, and PTI-P, led by MPA Arbab Waseem and candidate Somi, were also present for the draw. Following the draw, ECP officials declared Ms Waheed the winner.
Both PML-N and JUI-F were allo­­t­ted one seat each, reserved for non-Muslims, on the basis of the seven general seats won by each of them. The ECP had decided to allot the remaining seat through a draw.
Similarly, both ANP and PTI-P were awarded one seat each reserved for women and the remaining seat had to be allotted through a draw between candidates of these parties.
Following the notifications, JUI-F and PML-N will each hold nine of the total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP Assembly. PPP holds five, while ANP and PTI-P will now hold two and one, respectively.
For the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, JUI-F will hold two, while PML-N and PPP will have one each.
The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly, including 18 MPAs of JUI-F, 17 of PML-N, 10 of PPP, four of ANP, and three of PTI-P. Presently, Dr Ibadullah of PML-N is the leader of the opposition in the KP Assembly. PTI-backed lawmakers maintain their tally of 92 members.
