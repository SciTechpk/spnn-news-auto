<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961017/fragile-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Fragile peace</strong></a><br><p>THE ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains ‘fragile’, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has described it.
Mr Sharif, who was speaking at a multilateral forum in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on Friday, also observed that the international community should press the Afghan Taliban to fulfil their commitments vis-à-vis preventing terrorists from using their soil to attack others. At the same forum, Turkish President Recep Erdogan again offered his good offices to maintain an “extended ceasefire” between Islamabad and Kabul.
Meanwhile, a recent resolution adopted by around 1,000 Afghan clerics at a gathering in Kabul, calling for prohibition of cross-border movement of fighters, is a step in the right direction.
Yet the effectiveness of this decree will only be proved if there is a visible drop in the number of terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan carried out by Afghanistan-based militants.

 

According to reports, the clerics pledged that Afghan soil would not be used against other countries, while calling for “necessary measures” towards those who violate the edict. They also observed that Afghan Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada had prohibited Afghan nationals from participating in military activity abroad.
The resolution is most likely referring to Mullah Akhundzada’s 2023 decree in which the Taliban head declared cross-border attacks, including those targeting Pakistan, as “haram”. Yet the Taliban chief’s prohibition has not been heeded by terrorists, who continue their bloody campaign against Pakistan.
The resolution seems to be an attempt by the Afghan side to rebuild trust with Pakistan, and prevent bilateral ties from deteriorating further. The call was issued by independent clerics, not by the Taliban authorities, though as an Afghan participant of the Kabul conclave told this paper, Mullah Akhundzada “does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us”.

 

The number of Afghans participating in cross-border attacks has risen, so perhaps the resolution is also an attempt to quell this trend. But the question remains: what about Pakistani terrorists based in Afghanistan who are involved in cross-border attacks? Will the Taliban regime take concrete action against them?
If the realisation has dawned in Kabul and Kandahar that giving free rein to terrorist groups such as the TTP to attack Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan regionally and globally, then it would be a case of ‘better late than never’.
We hope these are not mere words, and that there is a sincere will on the Afghan side to address the issue of terrorism.
The Foreign Office has cautiously welcomed the resolution.
Continued bilateral tension and conflict is in the interest of neither state. Therefore, the mediation efforts of friendly states must continue. Once the terrorism issue is resolved, both states can start work on building a fruitful relationship.

While the Foreign Office has described the envoy’s presence as interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs and a breach of diplomatic protocol and Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, several diplomats and former envoys argue that observing open court proceedings does not, in itself, amount to meddling.
Former ambassador to India Abdul Basit, when asked whether the move could be construed as interference, said that “in the strict sense of the word”, it could not. He added that there was no provision in the Vienna Convention that bound diplomats to stay away from public court proceedings.
However, he noted that diplomatic practice “would strongly suggest that diplomats in their host countries usually keep themselves away from internal politics”. But this doesn’t mean “they cannot interact with opposition politicians, which they do all the time, including our diplomats around the world”, Mr Basit added.

The summoning of Norway’s envoy over attending a court hearing has ignited debate over how far diplomats can go in observing sensitive domestic proceedings under the Vienna Convention

A senior European diplomat also insisted that mere observation of open court proceedings could not be labelled as interference.
Citing Article 3(d) of the Vienna Convention — which outlines the functions of a diplomatic mission and includes “ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State” — the diplomat said it was not a breach of protocol for an envoy to attend open proceedings in a host country.
Diplomatic immunity protected envoys from the jurisdiction of host-country courts but did not prevent them from observing public proceedings out of professional interest, the diplomat added.
The Vienna Convention also emphasises freedom of movement (Article 26) and does not explicitly prohibit attendance at public events, including court hearings, as long as diplomats do not interfere with proceedings or undertake actions that could be seen as official intervention in domestic affairs.
The diplomat said the Norwegian ambassador attended as a silent observer, sought no meeting with any judge and made no public comment about the case, which could not be viewed as an attempt to influence the judiciary or interfere with the judicial process.
“When foreign observers monitor elections in Pakistan, do they interfere in the electoral process?” he asked, arguing that independent observation strengthened transparency. “Observers should be welcomed if there is nothing to hide and the trials are fair,” he said.
‘Serious error of judgement’
However, former ambassador to the European Union Naghmana Hashmi took a different view, saying Article 41 was explicit in requiring diplomats not to interfere “in any way” in the internal affairs of the host country.
“If I were to analyse the actions of the Norwegian ambassador, I would say that it certainly falls under a violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention. He should not have gone there. I think it is a very, very serious error of judgement,” she said.
Ms Hashmi acknowledged that the envoy did not make public statements or speak to the media, but she argued that the diplomat’s presence created an impression that he had been asked to attend by individuals facing accusations in a sensitive case.
She pointed out that no other ambassador was seen attending the hearing, adding that the envoy was also seen on television shaking hands and speaking with the accused within the Supreme Court premises.
“The Norwegian government may not be expressly saying that, but the perception certainly is that Norway is supporting the accused, which in any case is totally unacceptable,” she said. Ms Hashmi maintained that amb­assadors generally do not sit in court proceedings in other countries, particularly in cases linked to internal affairs and national security. Dip­lo­matic conduct, she said, was gov­ern­­ed by international law and established norms that must be respected.
‘Fair trial is a human right’
A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the right to a fair trial was a human right and alleged violations could not be termed an internal matter.
The diplomat cautioned against setting new precedents by summoning an ambassador for observing proceedings in open court, and questioned whether the move was intended as a signal to the rest of the diplomatic community in Pakistan.
Former ambassador Muhammad Ayaz Wazir said attending court proceedings was not interference in itself, but added that any public comment on a pending case would be inconsistent with an envoy’s role.
“He is not only an individual but a representative of a government. His words would therefore be attributed to the authority he represents,” he said, adding that much depended on how the host government viewed a particular case. “It is my personal view, as I am not privy to the government’s current policies on various issues,” he said.
Another former ambassador said there was “no issue” with a foreign diplomat at­­­tending court or parliamentary proceedings, calling it part of normal diplomatic reporting and observation. He described the summoning as “intimidatory tactics” to discourage outside interest in the human rights situation in the country.
The Vienna Convention and diplomatic conduct
The Vienna Convention on Diplo­matic Relations (1961) is a cornerstone treaty of international law go­­verning diplomatic relations bet­ween sovereign states.
It sets out the privileges, immunities and obligations of diplomatic missions, and is intended to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without intimidation or undue hindrance from the host state.
The convention was adopted on April 18, 1961, and entered into force on April 24, 1964. It has achieved near-universal acceptance, with almost 200 states party to it. By codifying long-standing customs and practices, it provides a detailed framework for diplomatic engagement and has been central to maintaining channels of communication even amid serious disagreements between states.
While the purpose of diplomacy is to preserve communication and manage differences, actions perceived as offending the host country can cause tension and lead to a formal protest, including summoning an ambassador to the foreign ministry to convey concern. In rare cases, disputes escalate to the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic representation.
Some of the key provisions of the convention include:
Article 9: The host country can declare a diplomat “persona non gr­­a­ta” and expel them, no reason ne­­ed­­ed, typically used in serious breaches.
The declaration of persona non grata is a mechanism frequently employed in diplomatic disputes. Specific instances where ambassadors or other diplomatic agents have been declared persona non grata are often the result of bilateral tensions or breaches of the conduct expected under the convention.
High-profile cases often make it to public knowledge, typically in the context of espionage, interference in domestic affairs or other diplomatic indiscretions.
Article 22: Diplomatic missions are inviolable. The host country can’t enter without permission.
Article 26: Diplomats have freedom of movement and travel in the host country, with some security exceptions.
Article 27: Diplomatic missions can communicate freely with their government, using diplomatic bags that aren’t to be opened or detained.
Article 29: Diplomats can’t be arrested or detained. Their private residences are also protected.
Article 30: Diplomatic archives and documents are inviolable, wherever they are.
Article 31: Diplomats have immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the host country. Civil immunity applies except in specific cases (e.g. private property disputes).
Article 41: Diplomats must resp­ect the laws of the host country and not interfere in its internal affairs.
These provisions aim to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without fear or hindrance, promoting smooth international relations.

NAROWAL: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday maintained that the deadly riots on May 9, 2023 was a ‘joint venture’ between ex-spymaster Faiz Ham­eed and PTI founder Imran Khan, vowing that the process of acc­o­untability for ‘enemies’ of Paki­stan, whether they were civilian or in uniform, would continue.
The minister also asserted there were still other charges against Hameed on which legal proceedings would be initiated soon.
He made these remarks after the former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence was sentenced to a 14-year jail term in a case related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, Mr Asif claimed both the ex-spymaster and the ex-premier were partners in the ‘plan to destroy Pakistan and its army’. “Faiz Hameed and Imran Khan were equally involved in planning what happened in Mianwali, Lahore, Peshawar, and in front of GHQ on May 9,” he said.
“Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power cannot be considered Pakistanis whe­ther they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he added.
Calling the May 9 riots an ‘attack on the sanctity of the armed forces’, he said the same institution had restored national pride through Operation Bunyanul Marsoos against India in May, earning Pakistan international acclaim.
“God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said.
Nawaz’s ouster, parliament’s role
The minister alleged Hameed was in charge of ‘Project Imran’, blaming him for the ouster of prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. “The removal of Nawaz Sharif, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s [Khan] coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed. Nawaz Sharif was kept in prison during the 2018 elections. Imran [Khan] had put Nawaz Sharif, his family members and other politicians in jail through Faiz.”
He claimed Mr Khan was made the prime minister through rigging under Hameed’s supervision and alleged that they played a ‘dangerous game’ with the country during the next four years. He said the ex-spymaster facilitated the ‘imprisonment of political opponents’.
While terming the period a ‘shameful chapter’ in country’s history, the defence minister said parliament was converted into an ISI ‘subsidiary’. “During the Faiz’s tenure [as ISI chief], the agency used to dictate legislation to parliament.”
He claimed that after Hameed’s transfer, the ‘project’ started to slowly ‘unravel’, but as a corps commander he continued to facilitate Mr Khan. “Faiz used to plan mischief in Pakistan, and the PTI provided the manpower to execute those plans.”
‘Conspirators still active’
While admitting that the current system of governance a ‘hybrid system’ involving cooperation bet­ween the government and the military, the defence minister said the stability was brought through this.
But, he added, conspirators were again attempting to prop up the PTI founder and bring him back to power, adding that ‘all these seeds were sown by Faiz’. He said 3,000 to 4,000 Afghans were brought to and settled in Pakistan to cause mischief in the country. “These Afghans were accommodated in the homes of citizens.”
He accused PTI leaders of bribing the Taliban, alleging that party wanted to hold talks with Pakistan’s ‘enemies’.
About the recent conviction of the ex-spymaster, the minister noted that Hameed still had the right to appeal at relevant forums, including the army’s court of appeals and high court.

A ninth person was hurt by bullet fragments, the mayor said.
Streets around campus remained blocked and packed with emergency vehicles hours after the shooting and law enforcement officials heightened security around the city as police continued their manhunt.
“The individual responsible is still at large,” Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters at a 9:30pm (7:30am PKT) press conference. Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said the suspect had not been identified.
Officials said they are looking for a male dressed in black and were releasing a video of the suspect, who O’Hara said may have been wearing a mask. He said officials had retrieved shell casings from the scene of the shooting, but that police were not prepared to release details.
Officials said the gunman escaped after shooting students in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering building, where exams were taking place at the time.
“We are a week and a half away from Christmas. And two people died today and another eight are in the hospital,” Smiley said earlier in the evening. “So please pray for those families.”
Brown is on College Hill in Providence, Rhode Island’s state capital. The university has hundreds of buildings, including lecture halls, laboratories and dormitories.
“This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has,” Brown’s president Christina Paxson told reporters, confirming all or nearly all of the victims were students.
As news of the shooting spread, the school told students to shelter in place.
Brown student Chiang-Heng Chien told local TV station WJAR he was working in a lab with three other students when he saw the text about the active shooter situation a block away. They waited under desks for about two hours, he said.
Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee vowed that the shooter would be brought to justice. “We’re going to make sure that we catch the individual that brought so much suffering to so many people.”
The search for the suspect was hampered in part because downtown Providence was crowded with holiday shoppers and thousands of people attending concerts, local media said. Federal law enforcement and police from surrounding cities and towns were assisting in the search, officials said. According to local news reports, venues across the city were bringing in extra security.
President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he had been briefed on the situation, which he called “terrible”.
“All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt.”
Compared to many countries, mass shootings in schools, workplaces, and places of worship are more common in the US, which has some of the most permissive gun laws in the developed world. The Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more victims have been shot, has counted 389 of them this year in the US, including at least six such shootings at schools.
Last year the US had more than 500 mass shootings, according to the archive.</p><small>2025-12-14 03:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14080833a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961026/afghan-girl-wins-relief-in-college-admission-case' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan girl wins relief in college admission case</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Pesh­awar High Court has temporarily restrai­n­­ed the admission committee for public-sector medical colleges from excluding an Afghan female student from the ongoing admissions process over her inability to produce an Afghan passport and visa.
A bench comprising Ju­­stice Ijaz Anwar and Jus­tice Wiqar Ahmad issued notices to the responden­ts, including the vice chancellor of Khyber Medical Uni­versity and the cha­­ir­­man of the admission committee, seeking their replies to a petition filed by the student, Ruby, an Afg­h­­an refugee holding a Proof of Registration card.
The petitioner has asked the court to declare the requirement to submit a passport and visa before admission as contrary to the admissions policy, illegal and discriminatory.
She has also sought court directives for the respondents to call her for an interview after the final merit list is displayed and, if she secures a place on merit, to grant her admission to the relevant MBBS or BDS programme.
She has also requested the court to restrain the respondents from altering the merit list on the basis of her failure to produce a passport and visa at this stage. The bench fixed Dec 30 for the next hearing.
Advocate Mian Zakir Hussain appeared for the petitioner and told the court that his client was an Afghan national regis­te­r­­ed with the Commis­sio­n­erate of Afghan Refu­ge­­es along with her family.
He said his client had completed her SSC and HSSC and then appeared in the MDCAT, securing good marks.

ISLAMABAD: Overturning a lower court order for a DNA test to ascertain the parentage of a petitioner, the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy — recognised as an entitlement to personal sanctuary — requires protecting individuals from undue intrusion into their private lives.
“The unnecessary public challenge to the paternity of a person inherently res­ults in societal embarrassment, humiliation, and severe psychological stigma,” observed Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar while accepting an appeal filed by petitioner Khalid Hameed.
On Nov 3, 2022, a special judge of the Anti-Corruption Court, Pakpattan, had ordered the respective circle officer to conduct DNA tests of the petitioner and one Mohammad Haneef, holding that the real dispute in an inheritance matter centred on the petitioner’s paternity.
The directive was challenged through a revision petition before the Lahore High Court, which rejected the plea on Dec 6, 2022.
The controversy involved several res­pondents allegedly involved in forgery and corruption pertaining to a material alteration of the petitioner’s parentage in educational records, purportedly to deprive him of his rightful inheritance.
The Supreme Court said challen­ges to paternity must not be taken light­­ly, as compelling a DNA test without ade­quate grounds inherently casts serious aspersions on the character and moral integrity of the mother — a course the top court has previously declared impermissible.
Such judicial directives, when lacking proper legal basis, amount to an unwarranted intrusion into the sanctity of family life and a woman’s reputation, which should never be tolerated under the gui­se of legal process, observed Justice Kak­ar, who was heading a two-judge bench.
“This protection extends to personal data, communications, family life, and all facets of the personal sphere against un­­w­arranted interference by the state or pri­v­a­te entities,” the six-page judgement said.
Justice Kakar observed that any de­­m­and for a DNA test, particularly to determine parentage, encroaches upon fundamental privacy rights, as genetic information contains comprehensive data about lineage and physical characteristics. These fundamental rights, the jud­gement said, safeguard bodily integrity and ensure an individual’s autonomy to refuse unsolicited medical procedures.

 

The right conferred under Article 14 does not concern any premises, home or office, but the person — the man or woman wherever he or she may be, Justice Kakar underscored. He said that obtaining someone’s DNA without due process fundamentally violates rights to privacy, autonomy, and liberty, as it involves extracting extre­mely sensitive personal information.
While intrinsically linked to the rig­hts to existence and autonomy, the right to privacy has evolved into an independent fundamental guarantee under Article 14, representing the ultimate honour of the human person and the essence of individuality, the judgement stated. It protects a zone of choice and self-determination, enabling individuals to make intimate decisions without fear of surveillance or unauthorised disclosure.
“The inviolability of privacy is direc­tly linked with the dignity of man,” Jus­tice Kakar remarked, adding that preserving human dignity requires safeguarding privacy from invasion and unlawful intrusion. The judgement warned that such encroachment carries the serious risk of misuse or unauthorised dissemination of an individual’s genetic blueprint, potentially causing grave personal and professional harm.
The right to liberty under Article 9, it said, goes beyond protection from physical detention and encompasses freedom from arbitrary or purposeless restraints on personal autonomy that are inconsistent with public interest or statutory provisions.
A judicial order for DNA testing without consent or legal justification, therefore, is not a mere procedural flaw but one that causes profound adverse effects on an individual’s life and dignity.

The NRE Step-I will be conducted by the National University of Medical Sciences (NUMS) in Rawalpindi, in accordance with the policy of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC).
A total of 7,076 graduates registered with the PMDC for the exam, including 6,989 medical graduates and 87 dental graduates, according to council data.
According to a statement from the PMDC, the examination will take place at four venues.
In Islamabad/Rawa­lpindi, 2,358 medical and 43 dental candidates will appear; in Lahore, 3,562 medical and 30 dental candidates; in Karachi, 499 medical and four dental candidates; and in Peshawar, 570 medical and 10 dental candidates.
The candidates are graduates who obtained their medical and dental degr­ees from various countries and are seeking licensure to practice in Pakistan. Under PMDC policy, no foreign graduate is eligible for provisional or permanent registration to practice independently until they pass the examination.

 

“PMDC has consistently ensured a transparent, standardised, and internationally aligned examination system to assess the professional competence of returning graduates,” a PMDC spokesperson said. “Candidates who will successfully clear both steps of the NRE will be issued registration certificates, in accordance with the relevant provisions of law.”
All preparations for the examination were completed, with candidates required to report to their centres by 10am for the exam commencing at 12 noon. The PMDC stated that any candidate found violating standard operating procedures (SOPs) would be barred from the examination.
In its statement, the PMDC also advised parents sending their children abroad for medical or dental education to enroll them only in recognised, accredited, and PMDC-approved institutions.
The council warned that non-compliance with its policies could result in consequences for prospective candidates.
It further advised parents and students to exercise “utmost caution and refrain from enrolling in substandard or poor quality medical and dental colleges”.

A division bench comprising Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan will take up the matter for further proceedings on Monday (tomorrow).
In a detailed written order issued on Dec 9, the IHC held that the question regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree fell squarely within the scope of a writ of quo warranto — his right to hold public office.
The two-member bench ruled that the petition was maintainable and set aside the office objection earlier raised by the registrar.
The bench had also gra­nted Justice Jahangiri thr­ee days to respond to the facts unearthed till date.
The registrar’s office served the notice at the judge’s chamber due to time constraints. Sources said court staff of Justice Jahangiri received the notice and submitted it to his chamber. They added that Justice Jahangiri dec­ided to appear before the bench at the next hearing.
While Justice Jahangiri along with four other IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — had earlier app­eared before the Sup­reme Court as well on the same matter, it is not yet clear whether his fellow judges will accompany him in the IHC on Monday.
However, lawyers are expected to attend the proceedings to express solidarity with him. According to for­­mer president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association Riasat Ali Azad, he, along with scores of lawyers, will be present in the courtroom during the hearing.
Fake degree controversy
The petition, filed by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a judicial determination on whether Justice Jahangiri lawfully holds the office of a high court judge in view of allegations concerning his LLB degree obtained from the University of Karachi (KU).
According to the order, the bench observed that the petitioner had challenged the judge’s eligibility to hold office rather than alleging misconduct.
As such, the matter did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of Article 209 of the Constitution, which governs proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council.
During the hearings, IHC Chief Justice Dogar consistently observed that the petition raised a direct question of qualification, whether the respondent fulfilled the statutory requirements to hold judicial office, which could be examined through a writ of quo warranto. The bench also noted that the SC had already directed the IHC to proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
The court order referred to a report submitted by KU through the Higher Education Commission (HEC), which highlighted several discrepancies in the academic record of the degree in question.
According to the report, a candidate named “Tariq Mehmood” obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, university records showed that the same enrolment number had already been issued to another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, in 1987.
The report further stated that the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name “Tariq Jahangiri”, while the inquiry revealed that the judge had also been assigned a separate enrolment number (7124) for the same degree programme. The committee observed that this violated university rules, which allow only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree.
According to the inquiry findings, the existence of multiple identities, duplicate enrolment numbers, and conflicting transcripts rendered the academic credentials “invalid”, although the committee stopped short of declaring the degree “bogus”.
The report also noted that the candidate had been debarred for three years in 1988 on grounds of using unfair means but later appeared in examinations under a different name.
The university alleged collusion with staff and impersonation of other enrolled students, following which the results were cancelled and a three-year ban was imposed, effective until 1992.
In its order, the IHC bench reproduced and relied upon several SC judgements — including Abrar Hassan vs Government of Pakistan, Malik Asad Ali vs Federation, and Sindh High Court Bar Association vs Federation — to conclude that a writ of quo warranto could be issued against a judge in matters relating to eligibility.
The bench also referenced the SC’s direction in Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri vs Mian Dawood.
It noted that the apex court had explicitly ordered the IHC to proceed with Mr Dawood’s petition. “Keeping in view the stance of the petitioner that Respondent No. 1 [Justice Jahangiri] possesses an invalid/fake LLB degree, as well as a careful perusal of the report submitted by the University of Karachi through [the] HEC, we deem it appropriate to issue notice to Respondent No. 1 to submit his reply within three days,” the order stated.

Soon after the crash, rescue and security personnel reached the site as locals reached the spot. Security forces cordoned off the area and launched an investigation to ascertain the nature and origin of the drone.
Police claimed the Sheikh Landik police post had been targeted repeatedly, with at least 14 terrorist attacks within a month.
Afghan girl killed in blast
A minor Afghan girl was killed and a bridge was destroyed after a powerful IED blast occurred on the Wana-Karikot Road in Lower South Waziristan on Saturday, police officials said.

 

Lower South Waziristan DPO Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir said the explosion took place near a bridge, causing severe structural damage.
According to sources, the bridge collapsed due to the intensity of the blast, disrupting traffic in the area. The explosion also caused partial damage to a nearby house and a private vehicle parked close to the site.
Police said that at the time of the blast, the minor Afghan girl was present on the roof of her house. The force of the explosion caused a portion of the roof to collapsed, leaving her critically injured.
Local residents rushed to the scene and shifted the injured girl to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Wana for emergency treatment. Hospital officials said she was in a critical condition upon arrival and later succumbed to her injuries despite efforts by doctors to save her.
Following the explosion, police cordoned off the area, collected evidence from the site, and launched an investigation to trace the perpetrators and determine the nature of the explosive device.

Three other US soldiers were wounded, the US military’s Central Command said.
In a statement, Central Command said the attack by a lone gunman occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement” in the central Syrian town of Palmyra.







“Partner forces” killed the attacker, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wrote in a social media post.







IS did not immediately claim responsibility, but a senior US official said initial assessments indicate the militant group probably carried out the attack. It took place in an area not controlled by the Syrian government, the official said.
The soldiers’ names will be withheld until 24 hours after the next-of-kin notification, the US military said.
Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a security source as saying two Syrian service personnel were injured, without providing further details. The source told SANA that American helicopters evacuated the injured to a US base in Syria’s Al-Tanf region near the Iraqi border.
Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria, condemned the attack.
“We mourn the loss of three brave US service members and civilian personnel and wish a speedy recovery to the Syrian troops wounded in the attack,” Barrack said in a statement.
“We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.”







The attack came barely a month after Syria announced it had signed a political cooperation agreement with the US-led coalition against IS, which coincided with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to the White House.
The coalition has carried out air strikes and ground operations in Syria targeting IS suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. Syria last month also carried out a nationwide campaign arresting more than 70 people accused of links to the group.
The US has troops stationed in northeastern Syria as part of a decade-long effort to help a Kurdish-led force there.</p><small>2025-12-13 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13223733930cf4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960926/trump-appears-in-newly-released-photos-from-jeffrey-epsteins-estate' target='_blank'><strong>Trump appears in newly released photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate</strong></a><br><p>Congressional Democrats released 19 new images from the estate of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, including photos of now-President Donald Trump, as the deadline for an extensive release of documents related to the disgraced financier nears.
Trump is featured in three of the photos shared by House Oversight Committee Democrats, who said they are reviewing more than 95,000 images produced by the estate.
In one black-and-white photo, Trump is seen smiling with several women — whose faces are redacted — on each side of him. A second image shows Trump standing beside Epstein, and a third, less-clear image shows him seated alongside another woman, whose face is also redacted, with his red tie loosened. It was not clear when or where the photos were taken.
“Everybody knew this man,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost — there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him. So that’s no big deal.”
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Trump’s administration “has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have.
“It’s time for the media to stop regurgitating Democrat talking points and start asking Democrats why they wanted to hang around Epstein after he was convicted,” she said.
Trump fanned Epstein conspiracies
The Epstein scandal has been a political headache for Trump for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters. Many Trump voters believe Trump administration officials have covered up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscured details surrounding his death, which was ruled a suicide, in a Manhattan jail in 2019.
The Justice Department said in July that there was no evidence to justify investigating any third parties in the Epstein case, and that it had found no “client list” or people who might have been involved in sex trafficking, or any evidence that Epstein had blackmailed anyone.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that just half of Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein case, well below his overall 85 per cent approval rating in his own party.
Trump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and early 2000s, but Trump says he broke off ties before Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges.
Trump has consistently denied knowing about Epstein’s abuse and sex trafficking of underage girls.
Other men also shown
Democratic former president Bill Clinton, former Trump aide Steve Bannon, Bill Gates and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also appear in the batch of images.

A spokesperson for the committee, which is led by Republican Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, said Democrats were politicising the investigation by “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump”.
Democrats said the tens of thousands of photos include “images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” and “photographs of women and Epstein properties” and more will be released in the coming days.
“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world,” Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the oversight committee, said in a statement. “We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.”
The congressional Democrats said they redacted the women’s faces to protect the identities of Epstein’s victims.
The committee is continuing to obtain and release documents even as the US Department of Justice is expected to publicise unclassified Epstein files from its federal investigation late next week.
Trump signed into law last month an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill led by Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California and Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky that compels the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. December 19 will mark the end of that window.</p><small>2025-12-13 17:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1321254130ff3b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960921/president-zardari-directs-ppp-to-prepare-for-local-body-polls-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari directs PPP to prepare for local body polls in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday tasked PPP lawmakers and members with commencing preparations for the local body polls in Punjab.
The local body polls are likely to be held in Punjab next year after some amendments to the local government law. Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.

 

In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021. The elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but this was not possible because the provincial government kept amending the local government law repeatedly.
President Zardari arrived in Lahore on Friday evening and met party leaders today at Bilawal House, directing them to enhance their public interaction.
Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider, MNA Makhdoom Murtaza Mahmood, PPP Lahore leader Faisal Mir, PPP South Punjab Coordinator Abdul Qadir Shaheen, MPA Alamdar Qureshi, Malik Muzaffar, Zaki Chaudhry and Ali Zaki were among those present in the meeting.
“President Zardari asked the party to start preparation for local body polls in Punjab,” Shaheen told Dawn after the meeting.
He said the president tasked all lawmakers, ticket holders and party office bearers to enhance their public outreach so the party’s narrative of “serving the people” could be effectively disseminated.
Shaheen added that the president also appreciated the party’s performance in the south Punjab and said he would visit the region next month.
“There is a need to strengthen PPP in Punjab,” Zardari was quoted by him as saying.
Governor Haider also briefed the president on the political situation in the province. He and other leaders apprised the party co-chairman of the challenges being faced by the PPP in Punjab.
Shaheen said the president was also informed that PPP candidate Dost Muhammad Khosa for the National Assembly by-poll in DG Khan had won, but was declared the losing candidate through “massive rigging”.
In the by-election for NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-2), Khosa secured 49,262 votes, while his PML-N rival Mahmood Qadir Khan won the seat with 82,413 votes.
“The party will challenge the victory of the PML-N candidate in the election tribunal on Monday,” Shaheen said.</p><small>2025-12-13 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1321225249cd7f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960923/pcb-extends-bid-deadline-for-new-psl-franchises-amid-international-interest' target='_blank'><strong>PCB extends bid deadline for new PSL franchises amid international interest</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi announced on Friday an extension of the deadline for submitting bids for the two new franchises in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), citing growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond.
In a post on X , Mohsin said the original deadline of December 15 had been pushed back by one week to December 22, to accommodate the surge in inquiries.
“Witnessing growing interest from Europe, USA, the Middle East and beyond in acquiring new HBL PSL teams, we have decided to extend the bid submission deadline by one week to 22 December 2025,” he wrote, while quoting an earlier PSL announcement about a promotional roadshow in New York.
“Good luck to everyone excited to welcome our new franchise owners to the HBL PSL family,” Mohsin added.
The announcement came on the very day the PCB hosted a high-profile PSL roadshow in New York City, featuring current Pakistan players including T20 captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Saim Ayub, Shan Masood and Saud Shakeel, along with legends Wasim Akram and Ramiz Raja, and singer Ali Zafar.
The event followed a similar roadshow at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London last week, as part of efforts to attract global investment ahead of the league’s expansion to eight teams for its 11th edition in 2026.
The addition of two new franchises marks the PSL’s first major structural growth since 2018, when Multan Sultans joined as the sixth team.
The auction for the new teams is expected to follow shortly after the bidding process concludes.
Mohsin, who also serves as Pakistan’s Interior Minister, has been vocal about elevating the PSL’s global standing, including recent pledges for transparent bidding and infrastructure development.
The league’s expansion is seen as a step towards enhancing its commercial appeal and competitiveness on the international T20 circuit.</p><small>2025-12-13 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13194529275d195.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960899/information-minister-accuses-pti-of-promoting-character-assassination-politics-of-hatred' target='_blank'><strong>Information minister accuses PTI of promoting ‘character assassination, politics of hatred’</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI of promoting “character assassination and politics of hatred” in the country.
He also blamed the opposition party for “conspiring to mislead the young generation”.
“There had been a tradition of decency and respect in Pakistan’s politics before the PTI. PML-N President Nawaz Sharif always promoted a culture of tolerance in the country. But contrary to this, the PTI promoted character assassination and politics of hatred,” Tarar said at a book launch ceremony in Lahore on Saturday.
Recalling the 2013 elections, the minister said when PTI founder Imran Khan, who has been in jail for over two years in multiple cases, got injured after falling from a crane, Nawaz Sharif immediately cancelled his public rallies as a “gesture of sympathy”.
“Politics of hatred and division have ruined Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) over the past 12 years under the PTI rule as well. The PTI government in KP has no performance to show. Not a single hospital in KP can be compared to Lahore’s Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute and Research Centre (PKLI) during this period,” he lambasted.
The information minister further said the PTI caused severe damage to the country and its economy and that the slogan of “change” was used to bring destruction.
“The international institutions are now acknowledging improvement in Pakistan’s economy,” he claimed.
He added Nawaz’s core mission was providing relief to the people.
“The Sharif family played a vital role in promoting industrial development in the country, while development projects bear the hallmark of Nawaz’s leadership,” he said, adding that the elder Sharif introduced the politics of public service in Pakistan and that every major development project carried his name.
The minister further claimed that the national economy had gained stability under the leadership of the Sharif brothers.

The development came as PM Shehbaz was in Ashgabat to attend an international forum. On Friday, the premier met a host of leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov and Putin.
“Great interactions with world leaders. Pakistan shining at the global stage,” said Information Minister Ataullah Tarar on X on Friday night, sharing a video of PM Shehbaz shaking hands with Putin as the two stood in what appeared to be a hallway.
He also termed the meetings with Putin, Erdogan and Pezeshkian “warm and cordial exchanges”.







Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media Mosharraf Zaidi also shared the same video, saying PM Shehbaz had “productive meetings with his peers from all the countries” that attended the forum.
“The customary warmth in relations was in ample evidence as the prime minister shared the day with President Erdogan, President Putin and a host of other key world leaders,” he said.







The same video was also shared by the Russian embassy in Pakistan.







However, RT India, appeared to have shared a different video, which has since been deleted from X.
In a clarification issued late on Friday night, it said, “We deleted an earlier post about Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif waiting to meet Vladimir Putin at the Peace and Trust forum in Turkmenistan. The post may have been a misrepresentation of the events.”
RT India is the newest branch of Russia’s state-funded global media network. Putin had launched the RT India news channel last week during a visit to New Delhi.







According to Indian media, the original RT India post stated that PM Shehbaz waited for Putin for 40 minutes before “growing tired and gate-crashing” the Russian leader’s meeting with Erdogan.
“He left ten minutes later,” Times of India and Hindustan Times quoted the original post as saying.
Meanwhile, Russia’s RIA news agency reported that PM Shehbaz had later joined the talks between Erdogan and Putin, which had lasted 40 minutes behind closed doors.
In a remark on the situation, Tarar told Dawn: “No need for any comment on an Indian outlet which posted a fake story then deleted it, calling a misrepresentation of facts.”</p><small>2025-12-13 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1319144969153e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960900/pm-shehbaz-says-economy-out-of-the-woods-key-indicators-show-wonderful-performance' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz says economy ‘out of the woods’, key indicators show ‘wonderful’ performance</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the country had exited a period of economic turmoil and jeopardy, with its key indicators now showing “wonderful” performance due to the government’s efforts.
The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of an economic free fall has eased, but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path, marked by weak growth, heavy debt, and limited relief for households.
Projections by the Fund, released early on Tuesday alongside the statement announcing a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that the country’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026.
Addressing the launch ceremony of the National Regulatory Reforms in Islamabad, the prime minister said the national economy was in a very difficult situation when the current government took the reins.
“Through our outstanding teamwork, excellent planning and untiring efforts, I can say today with a sense of relief and achievement that Pakistan is economically out of the woods; our mega indicators are wonderful,” he said, pointing to the news of the recent release of the $1.2bn IMF tranche.







The premier said the government was now focused on and discussing how to move forward and grow the economy with foreign investment in “attractive areas of mutual benefits” such as agriculture, information technology, and mines and minerals.
“We have a very young population, a youth bulge. We are offering them vast opportunities for vocational training and with international certification. They will find productive jobs not only in Pakistan but abroad, making Pakistan richer and prosperous.”
He termed the launch of the regulatory framework as a “quantum jump” that would facilitate the business community, industry, agriculture and foreign direct investment, adding that it would also eliminate the “immense waste of time and resources” in the country that led to corruption and nepotism.
“We are able to now announce and let the nation know … that the government is fully aware of the challenges of the day and they are ready to walk with them with the speed they want us to walk,” the premier added.
PM Shehbaz also thanked the British government for its support.
The prime minister said that the United Kingdom had been a great partner in the country’s progress.
He also said that Pakistan had a “wonderful relationship” with the United States and was looking forward to a “wonderful time of mutual cooperation”.
Earlier, Special Assistant to PM for Industry and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said today was more than a policy moment as it also marked a turning of the page.
He said that, among the many reforms the government was undertaking, one stood out as foundational: the transformation of Pakistan from a regulatory state into a developmental state.
Khan added that the regulatory reform was not an isolated effort, but part of a wider transformation guided by three pillars: tariff rationalisation, regulatory modernisation, and export-led industrial revival.
“Under the new national tariff policy, we are moving towards predictability, competitiveness and phasing out of arbitrary duties,” he added.
UK Minister for International Development and Africa Baroness Jenny Chapman also highlighted the full potential, prospects of entrepreneurship, availability of natural resources and Pakistan’s place at the centre of global trade.
Terming the reforms as a positive achievement, she said these were the ambitions that both the UK and Pakistan shared.
“The links between our people play a huge part in the flow of trade and investment between our two countries as well. Trade is now at 5.5bn pounds a year. We’ve got a new trade dialogue and we’re supporting Pakistan’s efforts to work with the 1.6 million-strong Pakistani diaspora in the UK to unlock private capital,” she added.</p><small>2025-12-13 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13190431d467d97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960898/us-ukraine-to-discuss-ceasefire-in-berlin-before-european-summit' target='_blank'><strong>US, Ukraine to discuss ceasefire in Berlin before European summit</strong></a><br><p>Germany will host US and Ukrainian delegations over the weekend for talks on a ceasefire in Ukraine, before a summit with European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Berlin on Monday, a German official said.
A US official said President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans.
The choice to send Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia regarding a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress after nearly four years of war since Russia’s 2022 invasion.
The White House had said on Thursday Trump would send an official to talks only if he felt there was enough progress to be made.
Show of support for Ukraine
“Talks on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine are taking place in Berlin this weekend between foreign policy advisers from, among others, the US and Ukraine,” a German government source said on Saturday when asked about the meetings.
On Monday, Merz is hosting Zelenskiy and European leaders for a summit in Berlin, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe as Kyiv faces pressure from Washington to sign up to a peace plan that initially backed Moscow’s main demands.
Britain, France and Germany have been working in the last few weeks to refine the US proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces.
Merz said in a speech on Saturday that Europe had to brace for a fundamental shift in its relations with the US while facing a growing threat from Russia.
“The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe, and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists as we knew it. And nostalgia won’t change that,” he told a party congress in the southern city of Munich.
“The Americans are now very, very aggressively pursuing their own interests. And that can only mean one thing: that we, too, must now pursue our own interests.”
Attacks cause blackout in Odesa
The European Union has sought to shore up Ukraine’s position by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.
Ukraine meanwhile has battled to contain Russian advances on the battlefield and the frequent bombardment of its energy and water supplies going into winter.
The southern Black Sea port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered blackouts on Saturday after a large missile and drone attack on the electricity grid that left more than a million households without power, officials said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, said “peace is not far away” and that he hoped to discuss a peace plan with Trump.
Erdogan had told Putin on Friday that a limited ceasefire in the war, focused on energy facilities and ports in particular, could be beneficial.
“The Black Sea should not be seen as a battleground. Such a situation would only harm Russia and Ukraine,” Erdogan said in comments released by his office on Saturday.
Russia attacked two Ukrainian ports on Friday, damaging three Turkish-owned vessels including a ship carrying food supplies, Ukrainian officials and one ship-owner said, days after Moscow threatened to cut Ukraine off from the sea.

Addressing the ceremony, Bilawal said, “These National Games were not merely a competition of speed, strength or skill; they were a celebration of Pakistan itself.
“From Gilgit-Baltistan to Gwadar, from Khyber to Karachi, from Lahore to Larkana, every athlete who competed here carried the colours of their province but stood united under one flag,” he said.
He said that Sindh was “proud” to have hosted the sporting event.
“To our athletes, you are the pride of Pakistan. Whether you return home with medals or memories, you return as ambassadors; ambassadors of discipline, perseverance and national unity.
“You have shown us what Pakistan’s youth can achieve when given the opportunity and encouragement,” he said.







“Sport teaches us teamwork, courage, respect for rules and resilience in the face of challenge. These are not just sporting values, they are national values,” Bilawal said.
Talking about the May conflict with India, the PPP Chairman said that the army, airforce and navy demonstrated professionalism, coordination and strength.
“Pakistan emerged victorious with its sovereignty defended and its honour upheld. This victory was not only a military victory, it was a national one. It reflected the unity of our people, the discipline of our forces and the unbreakable bond between the nation and those who stand guard over it,” he said.
“As these National Games conclude, may the friendships formed here endure, may the lessons learnt here guide us and may the unity displayed here continue to define our federation,” he concluded.</p><small>2025-12-13 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13174501cd1fef6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960896/fans-vandalise-india-stadium-after-football-star-messis-abrupt-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Fans vandalise India stadium after football star Messi’s abrupt exit</strong></a><br><p>Angry spectators broke down barricades and stormed the pitch at a stadium in India after football star Lionel Messi, who is on a three-day tour of the country, abruptly left the arena.
As a part of a so-called GOAT Tour, the 38-year-old Argentina and Inter Miami superstar touched down in the eastern state of West Bengal early Saturday, greeted by a chorus of exuberant fans chanting his name.
Hours later, thousands of fans wearing Messi jerseys and waving the Argentine flag packed into Salt Lake stadium in the state capital Kolkata, but heavy security around the footballer left fans struggling to catch a glimpse of him.
Messi walked around the pitch waving to fans and left the stadium earlier than expected.

Frustrated fans, many having paid more than $100 for tickets, ripped out stadium seats and hurled water bottles onto the track.
Many others stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents.
“For me, to watch Messi is a pleasure, a dream. But I have missed the chance to have a glimpse because of the mismanagement in the stadium,” businessman Nabin Chatterjee, 37, told AFP.
Before the chaos erupted, Messi unveiled a 21-metre (70-foot) statue which shows him holding aloft the World Cup.
He was also expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium.
Another angry fan told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that people had spent “a month’s salary” to see Messi.

“I paid Rs 5,000 ($55) for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians. The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame,” Ajay Shah, told PTI.
Javed Shamim, a senior police official in the state, told reporters that the event’s “chief organiser” had been arrested, without giving any further details.
“There is total normalcy,” he said, adding that authorities would look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets.
State chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was “disturbed” and “shocked” at the mismanagement.
“I sincerely apologise to Lionel Messi, as well as to all sports lovers and his fans, for the unfortunate incident,” she said in a post on X, adding that she had ordered a probe into the incident.
The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the “organisation, planning, or execution” of the “private event”.
“Furthermore, the details of the event were neither communicated to the AIFF, nor was any clearance sought from the Federation,” a statement said.

This was stated at the 56th meeting of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC), chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, held on Saturday.
Earlier, the AGP had informed the forum, at the 55th meeting of the NJPMC, that the issue of enforced disappearances has largely been addressed through the recent amendment to Section 11EEEE of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, which requires the production of a detained person before a magistrate within 24 hours.
The AGP had assured the committee that a comprehensive mechanism to redress complaints of non-compliance with this legal requirement is being considered by the government and will be presented to the committee in its next meeting.
Today, the NJPMC deliberated on key policy issues while reviewing the implementation status of the decisions taken at the previous meeting. The committee unanimously reiterated its commitment to strengthening institutional capacity, accelerating access to justice, and ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of justice.
The meeting, convened at the Supreme Court of Pakistan building, was also attended by the chief justices of all high courts, while the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Pakistan attended the meeting on special invitation.
Commercial Litigation Corridor
On the Commercial Litigation Corridor (CLC), the committee reviewed the recommendations of the sub-committee constituted to address protracted litigation and injunctive orders in commercial, revenue, and fiscal cases.
The sub-committee’s report highlighted key reforms, including the establishment of dedicated benches, the curtailment of frivolous litigation, the constitution of a screening committee at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) level, the avoidance of coercive revenue targets for state-owned enterprises, and improvements in tribunal structures. The report, which was shared with the high courts for input, was unanimously endorsed.
The forum also decided to implement the recommendations and instructed the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) to share them with the FBR for implementation.
The LJCP was further instructed to approach the FBR with a request to establish a mechanism for taxation and revenue case management at each high court, on the pattern of the Supreme Court.
Timeline for disposal of cases
On the timelines for disposal of different categories of cases, the committee lauded the disposal of 558,474 cases out of 1,253,425 of specified categories within the notified timeframe during the preceding quarter, saying it was reflective of the strong commitment of the high courts.
The forum placed on record its special appreciation for the Lahore High Court (LHC) for deciding a record number of 465,455 cases in the notified categories.
Likewise, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) was commended for the initiatives undertaken to prioritise inheritance cases and implement the double docket regime.
The committee also asked the high courts to dispose of the oldest succession cases, up to the year 2019, within 30 days.
Attendees of the meeting appreciated the high courts for establishing model trial courts for the disposal of chronic civil and criminal cases.
The LHC disposed of 6,246 civil and 22,594 criminal cases; the Sindh High Court (SHC) 1,108 and 8,368; the PHC 308 and 332; the Balochistan High Court (BHC) 235 and 374; the Islamabad High Court (IHC) 99 and 21.
District judiciary and jail reforms
The NJPMC asked a special committee to finalize its recommendations on District Judiciary Reforms within 30 days, for consideration at the next meeting. For this purpose, the LHC chief justice was asked to convene a meeting of the reform committee in Lahore.
Referring to jail reforms, the LJCP Secretariat confirmed that the reports of the sub-committees and the consolidated action plan had been shared with the chairpersons of the Provincial Justice Committees.
Use of AI in judiciary
Following extensive consultations with experts, a draft titled National Guidelines for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial Institutions in Pakistan was presented before the committee, highlighting the finalisation of the National Judicial Automation Committee (NJAC).
The draft guidelines shall be finalized and placed before the NJPMC for approval at the next meeting.
E-filing of cases
Under the digital transformation roadmap and the launch of e-filing of cases, the committee approved the immediate initiation and implementation of e-filing in all district courts as the first phase of the National E-Court Project.
It was further decided that the high courts would review existing rules, including the relevant parts of Schedule I of the Code of Civil Procedure, or invoke their rule-making powers, as has been done by the SHC, to enable electronic filing of cases.
Family support and mediation centres
The committee appreciated the concept of establishing one-window, integrated family and women facilitation centers within judicial complexes, a proposal presented by the National Commission on the Status of Women and approved in principle, subject to the Government’s commitment to provide the necessary funds.</p><small>2025-12-13 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13145901d994583.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960891/indonesia-flood-death-toll-passes-1000-rescuers' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia flood death toll passes 1,000: rescuers</strong></a><br><p>Devastating floods and landslides have killed 1,003 people in Indonesia, rescuers said on Saturday as the Southeast Asian nation grapples with relief efforts.
The disaster, which has hit the northwestern island of Sumatra over the past fortnight, has also injured more than 5,400, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said in its latest toll.
The deadly torrential rains are one of the worst recent disasters to strike Sumatra, where a tsunami wreaked havoc in 2004 in Aceh province, which lies at the northern tip of the island.
The final toll is expected to rise, with the disaster agency reporting 218 people are still missing.
With vast tracts of territory hit, 1.2 million residents have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters.
Frustration has grown among flood victims, who have complained about the pace of relief efforts.
President Prabowo Subianto said on Saturday the situation has improved, with several areas which had been cut off now accessible.
“Here and there, due to natural and physical conditions, there have been slight delays, but I checked all the evacuation sites: their conditions are good, services for them are adequate, and food supplies are sufficient,” Prabowo said after visiting Langkat in North Sumatra province.
Costs to rebuild after the disaster could reach 51.82 trillion rupiah ($3.1 billion) and the Indonesian government has so far shrugged off suggestions that it call for international assistance.</p><small>2025-12-13 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13142239b452fc6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960889/cdf-field-marshal-munir-says-pakistan-army-fully-focused-on-internal-external-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir says Pakistan Army fully focused on internal, external challenges</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Saturday that the Pakistan Army remained fully focused on both internal and external challenges, including hostile hybrid campaigns, extremist ideologies, and divisive elements seeking to undermine national stability.
According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), he made the remarks while visiting the Gujranwala and Sialkot garrisons, where he was “briefed on the formation’s operational readiness and key initiatives for strengthening combat preparedness”.







During the visit, CDF Field Marshal Munir witnessed field training exercises and advanced simulator training facility, “lauding the formation’s high professional standards and overall state of readiness”.
“Emphasizing the significance of technological adaptability, he noted that modern warfare demands agility, precision, situational awareness and swift decision-making,” the ISPR handout said.
While interacting with officers and soldiers, the CDF lauded their high morale and steadfast commitment to national security while underscoring the importance of rigorous and mission-oriented training, it added.
“He emphasised that Pakistan Army remains fully focused on both internal and external challenges, including hostile hybrid campaigns, extremist ideologies, and divisive elements seeking to undermine national stability,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-12-13 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13134306dbb917e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960888/1-killed-9-injured-as-speeding-bus-collides-with-trailer-on-m4-near-khanewal' target='_blank'><strong>1 killed, 9 injured as speeding bus collides with trailer on M4 near Khanewal</strong></a><br><p>A bus hostess was killed while nine other passengers were injured when a speeding bus collided with a trailer on the Pindi Bhattian-Faisalabad-Multan Motorway (M4) near Khanewal late on Friday night.
According to a statement by motorway police, the Lahore-bound bus, which was headed to Multan, collided with a trailer near Khanewal. Police said that the bus hostess succumbed to her injuries on the spot, while nine passengers were injured.
The statement said that the accident occurred due to the driver’s “negligence and sleepiness”.
It added that the injured, four of whom were in critical condition, were shifted to the Khanewal District Headquarters Hospital.
Meanwhile, dense fog again forced motorways to close temporarily early on Friday, which reopened after 11am once visibility improved.
The National Highway and Motorways Authority (NHMP) temporarily closed the entry of traffic at several points; M2 from Lahore to Kot Momin, M3 from Faizpur to Darkhana, M4 from Pindi Bhattiyan to Faisalabad, M11 from Lahore to Sialkot, and M5 from Multan to Sukkur.
Heavy fog also descended on national highways, causing low visibility in Manga Mandi, Phool Nagar, Jamber, Patoki, Mian Channu, Khanewal, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Ahmadpur Sharqia, Taranda Muhammad Panah, Rahim Yar Khan, and Sadiqabad.
The spokesperson for the motorway police, Syed Imran Ahmad Shah, in a statement said that travellers should ensure they follow lane markings on the road to avoid accidents.
He said that people should travel during the daytime as heavy fog was causing a sharp reduction in visibility on the roads. He said that drivers should use fog lights and avoid travelling at night for their safety.</p><small>2025-12-13 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1311430214594c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960883/analysts-say-us-package-to-keep-pakistans-f-16s-combat-ready-through-2040' target='_blank'><strong>Analysts say US package to keep Pakistan’s F-16s combat-ready through 2040</strong></a><br><p>The $686 million defence package offered to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump’s administration this week will transform the country’s ageing fleet of F-16 fighter jets into a modernised force capable of operating securely and efficiently alongside contemporary air forces, according to defence experts and officials.
At its core, the upgrade will allow the F-16s to operate safely and effectively for at least another decade and a half by extending their service life, strengthening secure communications, enabling real-time sharing of tactical data, and ensuring sustained maintenance through comprehensive parts, training, and support.
Enhanced mission planning and testing tools included in the package will also improve pilot proficiency and overall mission effectiveness. Beyond specific equipment, a substantial portion of the package is devoted to spare parts, maintenance, engineering, and logistics support.
This includes replacement components, repair parts, technical documentation, engineering assistance, and logistics services. Training for pilots and maintenance personnel, along with simulators and technical manuals, is also included to ensure sustained proficiency as systems evolve.
According to analysts, the equipment the US has agreed to provide will make Pakistan’s F-16s fully networked, interoperable, and operationally viable well into 2040.
The Brussels-based International Crisis Group (ICG) has described the package as “a continuation of a long-standing relationship,” highlighting “the need to maintain Pakistan’s F-16 fleet for regional stability, despite India’s concerns over its use against New Delhi”.
ICG analyst Praveen Donthi told Al Jazeera that “extending support for Pakistan’s jets remains a core part of US-Pakistan ties, with continuity from the Biden to the Trump administration”.
He added that the package includes advanced technologies and new avionics to keep the jets combat-ready until 2040 — a move India views as potentially strengthening Pakistan’s offensive capabilities.
According to Janes, a leading global provider of defence and security analysis, “the inclusion of Link-16 in the Fighting Falcons of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) would allow the aircraft to access networked information from command centres and ground units, enhancing their combat capabilities”.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia specialist, has said in interviews with several news outlets that while “the optics of the deal might suggest leverage” and could serve as a pressure point in US-India trade and defence negotiations, the package “has a logic of its own,” rooted in long-standing US support for Pakistan’s American-made aircraft.
Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) places the deal in a broader strategic context.
In a report released earlier this year, it said that between 2020 and 2024, more than 80 per cent of Pakistan’s weapons imports came from China, reflecting Islamabad’s growing reliance on Beijing for major defence platforms.
Chinese J-10 fighter jets played a prominent role in the May conflict, and Pakistan continues to diversify its air power in ways that reduce dependence on the United States.
A letter by the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) sent to Congress on December 8 regarding the sale stated that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations”.
The letter noted that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
It added that the updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns”.
The letter also emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addressed regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”</p><small>2025-12-13 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130818091008059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960720/un-expert-decries-imrans-detention-calls-on-authorities-to-ensure-compliance-with-international-standards' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Imran’s detention, calls on authorities to ensure compliance with international standards</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.
Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.”
The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions.
“I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement.

 

“Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.”
“Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison.
Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled
Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account.
“According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool.
“You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.”







Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers.
However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach.
“The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform.
Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters.
“I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-13 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/131024594f67f2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960881/trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-draws-legal-challenge-from-us-states' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee draws legal challenge from US states</strong></a><br><p>A coalition of unions, employers and religious groups filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to block US President Donald Trump’s bid to impose, open new tab a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers.
The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.
Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organisations.
They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa programme.

 

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement, said Trump’s administration engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas”.
The programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in speciality fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.
Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programmes say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour.
But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.
Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.
Trump’s order opens a new tab and bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment.
The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
Trump, in his unprecedented order, invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals who would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B programme have undercut its integrity and that the program threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.
He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B programme threatens the country’s economic and national security.
The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa programme and cannot, under the US Constitution, unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.
“The proclamation transforms the H-1B programme into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.
The groups argue that agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US State Department, likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.
India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.</p><small>2025-12-13 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1310195338be2f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960879/thailand-vows-to-keep-fighting-cambodia-despite-trumps-ceasefire-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand vows to keep fighting Cambodia, despite Trump’s ceasefire claim</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s leader vowed to keep fighting on the disputed border with Cambodia as fighter jets struck targets on Saturday, hours after US President Donald Trump said he had brokered a ceasefire.
Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted on Facebook that the Southeast Asian nation would “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”.
Trump, who brokered a ceasefire in the long-running border dispute in October, spoke to Anutin and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”.
Neither of them mentioned any agreement in statements after their calls with Trump, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire.
“I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke,” Anutin said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the continued fighting.
Hun Manet, in a statement on Saturday on Facebook, said Cambodia continues to seek a peaceful resolution of disputes in line with the October agreement.
Since Monday, Cambodia and Thailand have been exchanging heavy-weapons fire at multiple points along the 817km (508 mile) border, in some of the heaviest fighting since the five-day clash in July.
Trump halted that fighting, the worst in recent memory, with calls to both leaders.
Trump, who has repeatedly said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, has been keen to intervene again to rescue the truce.
Thailand suspended it last month after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine, one of many that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia.
Cambodia, which nominated Trump for the peace prize in August, rejects the landmine allegations.
On Saturday, a Thai Defence Ministry spokesman, Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, told a press conference that clashes had taken place across seven border provinces and Cambodia had fired heavy weapons, “making it necessary for Thailand to retaliate”.
Cambodia’s Information Ministry said Thai forces had struck bridges and buildings overnight and fired artillery from a naval vessel.
Thai leader Anutin dismissed comments by Trump that a “roadside bomb” that wounded Thai soldiers was accidental, saying the incident was “definitely not a roadside accident”.
Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he had asked the US and Malaysia, which has been a mediator in peace talks, to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.</p><small>2025-12-13 05:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130904326642004.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960858/media-bodies-slam-govt-ad-ban-for-dawn-outlets-as-tool-to-gag-press' target='_blank'><strong>Media bodies slam govt ad ban for Dawn outlets as tool to gag press</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Several media bodies on Friday condemned the government’s unannounced restriction on advertisements to Dawn Media Group’s TV and radio outlets — imposed after curtailing ads to its flagship newspaper — and called on the authorities to immediately rescind the ban.
In a statement, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said Dawn is among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation. Attributed to CPNE’s president and secretary general, the statement recalls Dawn Media Group has been providing unbiased information since the creation of Pakistan.
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also spoke out against the stoppage of government ads to Dawn Media Group outlets, saying it is ‘dismayed’. “For the last 13 months, Daily Dawn was suffering from [the] curtailment of government advertising, but now the news channel and radio [channel] owned by Dawn Media has also been subjected to denial of government advertising, which is not only unjust but also [an] attack on freedom of expression,” a press release from the body read.
The APNS noted the step has been taken to “force the media group to change its editorial policy” and opined that since these ads were paid for through the treasury, they ‘should not be used as [a] tool to strangle the dissenting voices’. “The APNS expresses its solidarity with [the] Dawn Media Group in this hour of financial stifling and urges … the federal and provincial governments to review their unconstitutional decision and restore government advertising to Dawn Media Group,” it concluded.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) slammed the ban on ads for Dawn outlets as well, saying it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”.
“In an age when fake news on social media is widespread, the role of traditional media becomes even more critical,” the PBA stated. It urged the government to immediately withdraw the advertising ban “in the interest of free and responsible journalism”.
The Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, also criticised the restriction. The JAC includes office-bearers of Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, APNS, CPNE, Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors and PBA.
In its statement, the JAC said the government is using official advertising as a tool to pressure media organisations. It noted that Dawn Media Group has remained the main target of this ‘undemocratic’ measure.
It said the group had faced the withdrawal of government ads for a long time due to its editorial stance and impartial reporting, and that the same restrictions are now being applied to its TV and radio platforms as well. It demanded that the government immediately restore advertising.

WASHINGTON: International troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as next month to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force, two US officials told Reuters, but it remains unclear how Hamas will be disarmed.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) would not fight Hamas. They said lots of countries had expressed interest in contributing and US officials are currently working out the size of the ISF, composition, housing, training and rules of engagement.
An American two-star general is being considered to lead the ISF but no decisions have been made, the officials said.

 

Deployment of the force is a key part of the next phase of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan. Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year war began on October 10 and Ham­as has released hostages and Israel has freed detained Palestinians.
“There is a lot of quiet planning that’s going on behind the scenes right now for phase two of the peace deal,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told rep­o­r­ters on Thursday. “We want to ens­ure an enduring and lasting peace.”
Indonesia has said it is prepared to deploy up to 20,000 troops to take on health and construction-related tasks in Gaza.
“It is still in the planning and preparation stages,” said Rico Sirait, spokesperson of Indonesian Defence Ministry. “We are now preparing the organisational structure of the forces to be deployed.”
Demilitarising Gaza
The Security Council authorised the ISF to work alongside newly trained and vetted Palestinian police to stabilise security “by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” However, it remains unclear exactly how that would work.
US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz noted on Thursday that the ISF was authorised by the Security Council to demilitarise Gaza by all means necessary - which means use of force. “Obviously that’ll be a conversation with each country,” he told Israel’s Channel 12, adding that discussions on rules of engagement were under way.
Hamas has said the issue of disarmament has not been discussed with them formally by the mediators - the US, Egypt and Qatar - and the group’s stance remains that it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established.
Support for UNRWA
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of eight Muslim and Arab countries issued a statement of support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees on Friday.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar affirmed “the indispensable role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in protecting the rights of Palestinian refugees and caring for their affairs”.







The statement follows a report by Reuters that the Trump administration has discussed slapping a terror designation on UNRWA.
