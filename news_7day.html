Money that provides healthcare to some of the poorest and most in-need people across the world has been dramatically slashed this year, led by the administration of US President Donald Trump.
The new study published in the prestigious Lancet journal also pointed to recent steep aid cuts announced by the UK, France and Germany.
After reaching an all-time high of $80 billion in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the total amount of global health aid will sink to $39bn this year, the US-led team of researchers estimated.
That would be the lowest level since 2009.
Such a dramatic change will result in the world entering a new “era of global health austerity”, the authors of the study warned.
 
 

Sub-Saharan African countries such as Somalia, the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Malawi will be hit worst because most of their health funding currently comes from international aid, according to the study.
The funding cuts will have a major impact on the treatment and prevention of a range of diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, it added.
 
 

The US slashed its global health funding by at least 67 per cent in 2025 compared to last year, according to the research. The UK cut its funding by nearly 40pc, followed by France with 33pc, and Germany with 12pc.
The researchers at the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation called for the world to urgently ramp up health aid. They also warned that nations would likely need to find other sources of funding.
The study was released as AIDS experts meet in Rwanda’s capital Kigali for an international conference on HIV science.
The US foreign aid cuts alone are estimated to result in the preventable deaths of more than 14m people by 2030, according to a different Lancet [study][3] published earlier this month.
For comparison, around 10 million soldiers were killed during World War I.</p><small>2025-07-16 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16094807af4a8ce.png?r=095503' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924499/aurangzeb-traders-begin-talks-to-ease-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb, traders begin talks to ease tensions</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to preempt countrywide unrest, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday constituted a high-level committee to hold consultations with traders on budgetary measures aimed at documenting the economy.
The multi-stakeholder committee will conduct a 30-day consultation process to develop a consensual and actionable proposal, which will be submitted to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
According to sources present at the meeting, officials from various ministries clarified that the new tax amendments are primarily intended to curb large-scale sales tax fraud. The committee will only consider trader concerns that are deemed genuine and substantiated, the officials added.
Traders were firmly told that the government remains committed to documenting the economy and discouraging cash-based transactions. Several trade associations have already called for strike actions in protest against the new measures.

Committee tasked with addressing concerns over tax reforms and documentation efforts within 30 days

An official statement announced that the decision was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, which brought together representatives from Pakistan’s business community, chambers of commerce, and trade organisations. The session primarily addressed trader concerns over Section 37A and other provisions introduced in the Finance Act 2025.
The committee will be led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, and will include Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, the Prime Minister’s Trade Coordinator Rana Ehsan Afzal Khan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial, and nominated members from the business community.
Business leaders expressed concerns about the impact of the new legislation on routine commercial transactions. In response, Mr Aurangzeb assured full transparency and cooperation from the government, reiterating that the reforms aim to combat widespread tax evasion, not to harass legitimate businesses.
The traders also shared their reservations and proposals, prompting the government to promise a considerate and inclusive approach. It was mutually agreed that efforts would be made to avoid placing undue hardship on the business community during the implementation of the reforms, the official announcement added.
Under the Finance Act 2025, a new Section 37A has been inserted into the Sales Tax Act 1990, empowering the FBR to constitute a three-member committee that can authorise the Commissioner to issue an arrest warrant against individuals involved in tax fraud, provided the tax loss exceeds Rs50 million.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South, Syed Asad Raza, told Dawn.com that he held a meeting with the representatives of popular food delivery and ride-hailing services to address the misuse of rider services for drug delivery.
“Delivery companies informed the police that certain individuals had been caught using counterfeit uniforms, helmets, and branded delivery bags to pose as legitimate riders while carrying out unlawful activities, such as delivering illicit drugs,” the DIG said.
To counter this, he said, the stakeholders agreed to tighten security protocols, including rider screening, background verification, and stricter registration procedures.
“Briefings for riders will also be conducted more regularly to ensure compliance with legal and safety standards,” DIG Raza said.
The management of the companies assured law enforcement of support in identifying and cancelling the accounts of unverified or unregistered riders.
“In addition, they said patterns of repeated suspicious orders from specific locations will be monitored to detect and disrupt illegal operations,” he said, adding that the authorities have also agreed to identify individuals using fake identities or posing as company employees for illicit deliveries.
In March, police and heads of educational institutes agreed on a joint strategy against the growing menace of narcotics in Karachi.
In May, the Islamabad High Court imposed a ban on all direct courier and food deliveries to students in the federal educational institutions amid concerns that drugs were being smuggled into campuses through food orders and courier packages.</p><small>2025-07-16 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16120605d0d0056.jpg?r=131905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924569/2-cops-shot-dead-by-terrorists-in-kps-dera-ismail-khan-police' target='_blank'><strong>2 cops shot dead by ‘terrorists’ in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan: police</strong></a><br><p>Two policemen were gunned down in a “terrorist” attack on Wednesday in Kulachi area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.
Speaking to Dawn.com, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, “The two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.”
The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.
Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.
“Weapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,” according to the spokesperson.
Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.
He saluted the “sacrifices made by the brave sons” of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.
Naqvi vowed that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”.
“KP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,” he noted.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a series of attacks across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.
On June 21, KP Police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
On June 3, terrorist attacks on two police stations in KP’s Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-07-16 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16121428ef8eb7a.png?r=122016' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924568/us-lawmakers-warn-pakistan-over-transnational-repression-hint-at-possible-sanctions' target='_blank'><strong>US lawmakers warn Pakistan over transnational repression, hint at possible sanctions</strong></a><br><p>The US Congress may soon urge President Donald Trump’s administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested on Tuesday.
“One of the biggest disappointments — regardless of who is in the White House or at the State Department — is the absence of sanctions,” said Smith, who co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (TLHRC), during a congressional hearing on Pakistan.
Smith recalled that the only individual ever sanctioned under US religious freedom laws was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following the 2002 Gujarat riots. “We are going to call on the Irfa office to consider imposing [sanctions] — especially in light of the terrible acts committed against people of various faiths,” he said.
The Irfa office, based at the State Department, enforces the International Religious Freedom Act, which authorises the US government to designate and penalise countries that engage in or tolerate severe religious persecution.
“That’s it. We’ve got 18 sanctions here, and we are going to impose them on you,” Smith declared during the hearing on Pakistan’s current political and human rights situation.
 


Amnesty International’s advocacy director for Europe and Central Asia, Ben Linden; PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari; law firm Perseus Strategies’ Managing Director Jared Genser; and Afghanistan Impact Network founder Sadiq Amini provided their testimonies during the hearing.
Although the TLHRC does not directly recommend sanctions, Smith’s remarks were widely seen as a signal that such measures may be under consideration if current trends persist.
His Democratic counterpart, Congressman James McGovern, echoed the concern. “A vibrant Pakistani community in Massachusetts engages me all the time, and quite frankly, they are worried about the signals coming from our government right now,” he said.
Speaking about the political climate in Pakistan, McGovern added: “They need to know that people are watching. They need to know we don’t like what we are hearing.”
The bipartisan hearing focused on civil liberties and political freedoms in Pakistan, highlighting reports of repression, persecution of minorities, and efforts to silence dissidents abroad.
 
 

Amnesty’s Ben Linden opened his testimony by raising concerns over the situation in Balochistan.
“Dr Mahrang and other Baloch detainees should be freed,” he said, referring to the rights activist who has been in prison for more than three months over cases on allegedly “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”.
A day ago, a campaign letter by Amnesty International called upon Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.
Linden warned that recent crackdowns on PTI supporters should be seen in the context of a broader assault on fundamental rights.
“Ahmadis and other religious minorities are being targeted while local authorities fail to protect them,” he said. “Vaguely worded blasphemy laws are being weaponised by majoritarian religious groups, while the accused have few means to defend themselves.”
In 2024 alone, over 300 new blasphemy cases were registered — most against Muslims. “Several of the accused were killed extrajudicially,” Linden said, calling the trend “a tragedy”.
 
 

He also condemned the recent blocking of US-based YouTube channels critical of Pakistan’s military, describing the move as “totally unacceptable”.
However, Jared Genser of Perseus Strategies stressed that Washington could not afford to disengage entirely.
“We don’t act that way with any regime. We have to engage. The key is for President Trump and Secretary [of State] Marco Rubio to say very clearly: we want a strong relationship with Pakistan, but this is what needs to be done to get there. And that includes releasing [ex-prime minister] Imran Khan and other political prisoners,” Genser said.
He noted: “We need to talk about the tragedy that Pakistan is today in terms of human rights. The Pakistani diaspora is a ray of hope.”
McGovern concurred: “We need to talk. We need to engage. And we need to be talking about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan … but also how you do it.”
The hearing also addressed last week’s White House meeting between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Bukhari, a former close aide to Imran, told the panel: “President Trump wanted to meet someone who is calling the shots. That’s why he met the army chief.”
 
 

Bukhari claimed nearly 200 politically motivated cases had been filed against Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi. He alleged that “fundamental rights had been suspended” in Pakistan, the media silenced, and judicial independence undermined through “coercive” amendments.
Sadiq Amini, founder of the Afghanistan Impact Network, focused on what he called Pakistan’s “duplicity” in its relationship with the United States, claiming that ex-prime minister Imran was “used” to mislead Trump during his first term.
“After the announcement of his South Asia strategy, [Imran] Khan rushed to Washington with a message of peace from the Taliban — a message that was actually a carefully crafted deception by his Russian counterparts. He convinced President Trump to pursue a peace deal with the Taliban, which only empowered them.”
He argued that the peace process ultimately failed, leading to the US withdrawal and the rise of a “gender apartheid regime” in Kabul.
 
 

Amini further alleged that Imran, as prime minister, acted as a spokesperson for the Taliban, promoting them as an indigenous movement serving Afghan interests.
He warned that Pakistan’s leadership could not win US trust by imprisoning a few individuals like Imran or former spy chief Faiz Hameed. “Pakistani leaders, both military and civilian, complain about the Taliban threat. But even now, they say the Taliban is good for Afghanistan but bad for Pakistan. That’s a blatant display of duplicity.”
He also denounced Pakistan’s detention and deportation of Afghan refugees as “shameful and inhumane”, and called on the US to reassess Islamabad’s commitment to democracy.
In earlier remarks, TLHRC Co-chair Smith warned that the US “cannot stand by” while military influence allegedly subverts civilian rule in Pakistan.
Earlier on Tuesday, US lawmakers also heard disturbing accounts of harassment faced by Pakistani dissidents in the US. Multiple speakers alleged that within 48 hours of a protest outside the Pakistani Embassy in Washington on June 14, “family members of critics were abducted in Pakistan.”
Lawmakers, including Democratic representatives Jimmy Panetta, Suhas Subramanyam and Greg Casar, expressed support for safeguarding the civil liberties of Pakistani Americans.
In March, Panetta and Republican Congressman Joe Wilson had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations.
A month before that, US Congressmen Joe Wilson and August Pfluger had written to Rubio, urging him to engage with Pakistan to secure Imran’s release.
 
 

During the commission’s hearing, speakers also urged Congress to oversee foreign surveillance operations on US soil and to press technology companies to resist censorship demands from foreign military courts.
Established in 2008 and named after Holocaust survivor and former House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Lantos, the TLHRC holds bipartisan hearings to guide US human rights policy.
Tuesday’s session underscored longstanding concerns about Pakistan’s democratic trajectory and signalled growing interest in potential policy responses — including targeted sanctions.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed its deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy. Its annual report for 2024 also highlighted a troubling dec­line in civic freedoms, deteriorating law and order, and a marked strain on federalism.
Rights tracker Civicus Monitor has listed Pakistan’s status as “repressed” and added the country to its human rights watchlist for 2025 due to a narrowing civil space.
Washington DC-based organisation Freedom House ranked Pakistan as “partly free” in political rights and civil liberties in its latest annual report, with the country losing three points from the year prior.</p><small>2025-07-16 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16113325948d948.jpg?r=113945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924514/west-bank-seeing-largest-displacement-since-1967-un' target='_blank'><strong>West Bank seeing largest displacement since 1967: UN</strong></a><br><p>GENEVA: The UN warned on Tuesday that mass displacement in the West Bank had hit levels not seen since the start of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territory nearly 60 years ago.
The United Nations said an Israeli military operation launched in the north of the occupied territory in January had displaced tens of thousands of people, raising concerns about possible  “ethnic cleansing”.
The military operation “has been the longest since … the second Intifada”, in the early 2000s, said Juliette Touma, spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
“It is impacting several refugee camps in the area, and it is causing the largest population displacement of the Palestinians in the West Bank since 1967,” she told reporters in Geneva via video from Jordan, referring to the six-day Arab-Israeli war that led to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank.
The UN rights office meanwhile warned that mass forced displacement by an occupation force could amount to “ethnic cleansing”.
Since Israel’s military launched its operation “Iron Wall” in the north of the West Bank in January, rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan said that “about 30,000 Palestinians remain forcibly displaced”.
Israeli security forces had during the same period issued demolition orders for about 1,400 homes in the northern West Bank, he said, describing the figures as “alarming”.
He pointed out that Israeli demolitions had displaced 2,907 Palestinians across the West Bank since October 2023.
Another 2,400 Palestinians — nearly half of them children — had been displaced as a result of Israeli settler actions, he added, lamenting that the combined result was the “emptying large parts of the West Bank of Palestinians”.
“Permanently displacing the civilian population within occupied territory amounts to unlawful transfer,” Kheetan said, stressing that depending on the circumstances this could be “tantamount to ethnic cleansing” and could “amount to a crime against humanity”. Kheetan said 757 attacks by Israeli settlers had been recorded in the West Bank during the first half of the year, a 13 percent increase on the same period in 2024.
The attacks injured 96 Palestinians in the occupied territory in June alone, he told reporters, stressing that this was the highest monthly injury toll of Palestinians from settler attacks “in over two decades”. Violence in the West Bank has surged since October 2023.
Since then, at least 964 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, according to the UN. During that same period, 53 Israelis have been killed in reported attacks by Palestinians or in armed clashes — 35 of them in the West Bank and 18 in Israel.

(Hint: It’s not skills)</strong></a><br><p>I met Saima a few years ago while researching the relationship between women’s employment and empowerment in Lyari. At 26, she lived in Agra Taj — a Kutchi-dominated pocket of Lyari where most women worked as domestic help, earning anywhere between Rs5,000 to Rs10,000 a month. Saima, however, stood out. She held a job at Carrefour, one of the multinational department stores in Karachi’s upscale Dolmen Mall, and brought home Rs45,000 a month — more than four times what most women (and even many men) in her neighbourhood earned. Her relative success may be one of the reasons why she was the subject of a great deal of scorn from her neighbours and extended family members.
Saima spoke about how she navigated the city and managed her body in public spaces. One of the greatest perks of her job was the pick-and-drop service, which significantly eased her stress — especially in a context where overcrowded and infrequent buses were a bane for most women in her neighbourhood. This was also important given that her shift ended at 11pm —  a time generally considered unacceptable for a young woman to travel alone in the city.
However, the journey from Lyari to Clifton also involved her shifting her habitus as she moved between two distinct social contexts. Saima described the careful calculation of her bodily conduct throughout her commute to maintain an image of respectability, which also ensured that she could keep going to work. In Lyari, Saima wore an abaya [a loose over-garment] over her uniform, but when she arrived in Clifton, she removed it, saying that wearing it there would have made her appear out of place.
Wearing an abaya may have marked her as working class in a context where she was pressured to appear upwardly mobile and modern, and vice versa; not wearing it may have made it seem like she was showing off among her neighbours and relatives, who were already resentful of the fact that she was earning much more than most of them. When Saima returned to her neighbourhood late at night, she avoided the main road, choosing instead to slip through narrow side streets — dodging not just the prying eyes of the men hanging around, but also the loose talk of those quick to judge.
While I am not romanticising the service sector work that Saima was part of — which remains exploitative in many ways — her better-paying job at Carrefour, coupled with its pick-and-drop service, opened doors that were otherwise firmly shut for women from her neighbourhood. It offered her a rare space of relative freedom and a pathway to upward social mobility as compared to most other women in Agra Taj.
While she was spared the daily grind of public transport that burdens most working-class women in Karachi, the real pressure began when she returned home. Her late-evening shifts and a job that involved interacting with ghair mard (unrelated men) and dressing in a more ‘Western’ and ‘modern’ style drew criticism in her neighbourhood, where such work was seen as dishonourable. The tactics Saima adopted, from changing her dress to altering her routes, helped her maintain her respectability as she navigated a variety of spatial contexts.
 
 

Without these careful negotiations, she risked social exclusion — either within her own community or at her workplace. Worse still, the mounting pressure on her and her family could have forced her to quit her job altogether. Her ability to travel in the city and to work in a place like Carrefour were, hence, constantly under threat. In fact, at the time of our interview, Saima was engaged to be married, but her fiancé and future in-laws had already made it clear: she would not be allowed to work outside of the home after marriage. For this reason, Saima was trying to delay her wedding for as long as possible.
Saima’s story illustrates just how difficult it is for women, particularly those from the middle and lower socio-economic classes, to engage in ‘decent work’, which, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), is work that offers fair wages, safe and healthy working conditions, job security, social protection, and opportunities for career development. Her case study helps us understand some of the reasons why the female labour force participation rate in Pakistan is so low (despite increasing education levels), and why, when women do engage in paid labour, it is most often restricted to low-paid, insecure jobs, largely in the informal sector. Similar trends can be observed across South Asia and, indeed, across the Global South more generally.
Women’s employment in Pakistan: A stagnant trend
At just around 24 per cent, Pakistan has one of the lowest rates of female labour force participation in the world. The country ranks 147 out of the 148 countries included in the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report in terms of economic participation and opportunity. While the rate increased steadily from 1990 (when it was just 11pc) to 2015 (when it reached 24pc), this growth has stagnated over the past decade, with significant dips during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar trends have been observed across the region.
This is despite the fact that education rates for women and girls have been steadily increasing in the country (and across the region), with women born after 1990 receiving approximately twice as many years of schooling as those born before 1965, and with women comprising slightly more than half (52pc) of those enrolled in higher education in the country.
Clearly, education on its own is not enough to increase female labour force participation. We also know that, out of the 24pc of women who are engaged in paid employment, the vast majority are concentrated at the lowest rungs of the employment ladder, confined to precarious, feminised forms of work in the informal economy, including domestic labour, low-paid teaching jobs, and home-based work. So, what is preventing women from accessing ‘decent work’?
Restrictions on mobility
Saima’s story is a powerful example of how restrictions on mobility remain one of the biggest barriers women face in accessing decent employment. These restrictions come from a variety of sources including their own families, their husbands and in-laws if they are married, their community and neighbours, along with the ever-present fears of sexual harassment when they venture outside.
While practices of purdah vary across communities, there is an overarching belief that a woman’s rightful place is within the home. If she must step outside, she is expected to be ‘properly covered’ and to minimise interaction with unrelated men. These expectations are deeply rooted in notions of honour, or izzat (respect), which — though shaped by local norms — generally link a family or community’s reputation to the control and conduct of women’s bodies. Women like Saima must constantly engage in exhausting calculations to uphold this izzat. Those deemed ‘unrespectable’ risk social censure, which can lead to further restrictions on their mobility — and, in many cases, violence.
 
 

Moreover, restrictions on women’s mobility often increase during times of conflict when group boundaries are tightened as a result of insecurity. In conflicts around the world, women’s bodies often become markers of the community’s identity. This is true across religious and ethnic groups (as we have seen so clearly during the genocide in Gaza where Palestinian women’s lingerie was proudly displayed by Israeli soldiers as a marker of their victory), but it is particularly true in South Asia.
Hence, while there are some exceptions to this rule, women’s mobility, and hence their ability to engage in ‘decent work’, tends to decrease during conflict to protect them from being defiled by men of ‘the other’ community. In the same vein, members of marginalised, religious, and ethnic groups often place tighter controls of women’s mobility due to collective insecurity. In general, safety and security often serve as the perfect covers for patriarchy to tighten its control.
Similar patterns can be observed amongst migrant communities, whether these communities have migrated due to conflict or because of environmental and economic pressures. In my research on Muslim women in Delhi, I found that those women who had recently migrated to the city often faced tighter restrictions on their movements by their husbands and in-laws due to heightened insecurities.
A study published in 2019 by the Collective for Social Science Research in Karachi also found that women whose families had recently migrated were less likely to engage in paid employment outside of the home due to moral panics about the ‘bad environment’ of the city including the fear that they would mingle with men from ‘other’ communities.
Even in more settled communities (those whose families had been living in the city for generations), women’s mobility is often restricted to their immediate locality both because of patriarchal community and family restrictions, but also because of a lack of decent public transport, and the need to stay close to home to fulfill domestic responsibilities. For this reason, many of the women in Saima’s neighbourhood worked as part-time domestic workers in nearby localities, as teachers in low-cost private schools where their salaries ranged from Rs 1,500 to Rs3,000 per month, or extremely low-paying home-based work.
The impact of marriage
Another noteworthy part of Saima’s story was related to her marriage. While some studies demonstrate that a woman’s likelihood of engaging in paid employment increases after marriage, in Pakistan, marriage seems to have the opposite effect. Studies conducted over the past two decades show that a woman is 7pc less likely to participate in the paid labour force after marriage.
From my own anecdotal experience, I imagine the number is even higher. While ideas about izzat and honour are certainly part of the explanation, increased domestic responsibilities (particularly after childbirth) as well as the persistence of the ‘male breadwinner model’ along with discriminatory employment practices are also likely part of the explanation.
As we know very well, women carry the vast bulk of unpaid domestic and care work in the world, and this is particularly true in South Asia where the discrepancies in time spent on unpaid work between women and men are amongst the highest. In Pakistan, it is reported that a woman spends 11 hours on unpaid labour for every hour performed by a man. Many women cite domestic responsibilities, particularly after having children, as the main reason for leaving their jobs or not seeking employment outside the home. If they do work outside of the home, it is mostly part-time and in areas close to their residence, which limits the opportunities for accessing a ‘decent job’ if one lives in a low-income locality.
Another important reason for women’s low labour force participation — whether women never seek paid employment or whether they withdraw from work after marriage — is the idea that the man should financially support the family while the women is responsible for domestic/ care work. This idea is still deeply entrenched not only in the minds of men but in the minds of women as well, and in fact, might be getting stronger rather than weaker over time.
 
 

A study that tracked attitudinal changes using the World Values Survey found that 70pc of people (women and men) born before 1970 believed that when jobs are scarce, men should have more rights to jobs than women. What is even more worrying is that this number went up to over 80pc amongst those born since the late 1980s indicating an increase in conservative beliefs around gender roles. Many women I interviewed in Lyari also stated that they only worked out of majboori (necessity) because their husbands were unemployed or did not earn enough on their own to care for the family. Considering the kinds of employment women are most likely to be engaged in, the fact that they resented having to work outside the home is not surprising.
Patriarchal attitudes such as notions around izzat or the male breadwinner model are prevalent across genders. However, because men typically hold greater power in society and within households, their views tend to exert a stronger influence on women’s agency than women’s own beliefs do. For instance, studies show that husbands’ attitudes toward women working outside the home have a greater impact on female labour force participation than women’s own attitudes.
Too often, interventions aimed at women’s empowerment and gender equality have focused almost exclusively on women — placing the burden of change disproportionately on their shoulders. But perhaps one reason so many gender-related indicators have stagnated — or even regressed — over the past two decades is that women have already changed as much as they can on their own. For gender equality to be fully realised, including the equal right to decent work, men will have to change too. here is an urgent need to shift focus toward men and masculinities, and to challenge entrenched ideas about gender roles more broadly, if we are to dismantle the structural barriers limiting women’s economic participation.
At the root of women’s low labour force participation and limited access to decent work lie deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes. They promote the idea that a woman’s primary source of fulfilment is motherhood, encouraging her withdrawal from the workforce after marriage. Such ideas also fuel discriminatory practices in the workplace, where women are seen as less committed or reliable due to their family responsibilities.
 
 

Moreover, they contribute to a lack of political will to support women’s employment through essential measures like affordable and safe public transport, accessible childcare, and both maternal and paternal leave — policies that are crucial for enabling women to participate in decent work and for encouraging shared household responsibilities.
This is why attitudinal change must be placed at the heart of the gender equality agenda. It also helps explain why education alone has not been enough to guarantee women’s labour force participation. We must ask: What kind of education are children receiving? Are they being encouraged to question traditional gender roles, or are girls simply being educated to become better wives and mothers? Are boys and men being taught that they, too, must change? Of course, this is easier said than done.
Cultural change is a complicated, slow and difficult process, but it’s also central to removing the barriers to women’s empowerment. Apart from adding gender to school curricula, governments should engage in public education campaigns through the media and community organisations to challenge conservative ideas around gender.
Until and unless women and men’s attitudes towards gender roles, including femininity and masculinity begin to change, women like Saima will continue to face barriers to accessing and maintaining decent forms of employment, that is, if they are allowed to work outside the home at all.</p><small>2025-07-16 06:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6876f23962325.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924504/psx-slips-as-strike-worries-prompt-sell-off' target='_blank'><strong>PSX slips as strike worries prompt sell-off</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Stock Exchange (PSX) came under pressure on Tuesday, with the benchmark KSE-100 index snapping its upward streak as investors opted for profit-taking amid mounting concerns over sweeping taxation measures and a nationwide strike call by trade and industry on July 19.
The session opened on a positive note, driven by continued bullish sentiment from the previous day, as heavyweight banking stocks led early gains. According to Topline Securities Ltd, the index surged to an intraday high of 1,245 points before sentiment turned sour in the second half.
Selling pressure intensified as investors sought to lock in gains, triggering a broad-based sell-off. The index swung sharply during the session, touching an intraday low of 676 points before settling at 135,939.87 — down by 562.67 points or 0.41pc. The day’s movement reflected a tug-of-war between optimism and caution.
United Bank Ltd, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Allied Bank Ltd, Pakistan Services Ltd, and Engro Holdings were among the top contributors, adding a combined 564 points to the index. However, losses in Meezan Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Hub Power Company, and Oil and Gas Development Company pulled the index down by 350 points.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation stated that the market closed lower due to institutional profit-taking in overbought stocks, foreign outflows, and concerns over high corporate taxation and the expanded powers granted to FBR officials. He added that rupee volatility and fears that tax waivers on sugar imports could breach the $7bn IMF bailout conditions also weighed on investor sentiment.
Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Ltd, described the session as one of consolidation. “Early optimism driven by yesterday’s rally quickly faded as profit-taking at peak levels reversed momentum,” he noted.
Market watchers identified the 135,000 level as initial support, bolstered by strong corporate earnings and foreign inflows. If breached, the next key support lies at 132,000, where attractive valuations and prospects of monetary easing could revive interest.
Trading activity remained strong, with volume rising by 4.47pc to 879.11 million shares, while traded value increased by 4.20pc to Rs38.60bn. Bank of Punjab led the volume chart with 61.3 million shares changing hands.

This marks the third consecutive month of positive growth, attributed largely to a significant cut in the key interest rate to 11pc. The LSM sector showed positive growth from December 2023 to May 2024 but slipped back into negative territory in June 2024. On a year-on-year basis, LSM declined by 2.65pc in August, followed by a 1.92pc drop in September.
It registered a marginal growth of 0.02pc in October before contracting again by 3.81pc in November, 3.73pc in December, 1.21pc in January and 3.51pc in February. A slight recovery was noted in March, with production increasing by 1.79pc.
On a month-on-month basis, LSM showed a significant growth of 7.93pc in May.
The LSM sector recorded a negative growth of 1.21pc during the first 11 months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year. In FY24, LSM contracted by 0.03pc against a 0.92pc growth in the preceding year.
The food group declined by 2.32pc in 11MFY25 on a YoY basis. Wheat and rice milling rose by 5.96pc and starch and its products by 0.76pc, primarily due to better crop harvests. However, production of vegetable ghee declined by 1.06pc, tea blended by 3.75pc and cooking oil by 0.02pc.
The textile sector grew by 2.79pc in 11MFY25 on a YoY. Cotton yarn production increased by 8.22pc and cotton cloth by 0.72pc. These two categories make up more than 80pc of the textile sector.
Garment exports recorded a 5.20pc growth on a YoY basis, largely because foreign buyers diverted orders from Bangladesh to Pakistan.
Coke and petroleum products grew by 4.74pc in 11MFY25. Petrol production rose by 2pc, high-speed diesel by 9.65pc and kerosene by 25.90pc. However, LPG production declined by 2.18pc and jet fuel oil by 10.62pc. The automobile sector registered a significant growth of 43.94pc in 11MFY25 on a YoY basis. This was driven by a 39.35pc increase in jeeps and cars, followed by 173.95pc growth in LCVs, 100.04pc in trucks and 72.63pc in buses.

During the day-long intermittent showers, Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) workers remained busy clearing the rainwater accumulating in underpasses and on major roads of the city.
Several feeders of the Lahore Electric Supply Company tripped due to the rain in different areas.
The district administration of Lahore implemented a comprehensive and coordinated strategy to meet the challenges of the monsoon season to prevent any hardship for citizens.
Following the latest downpour, the administration and Wasa mobilised their resources, with all assistant commissioners and field staff deployed in different city areas with essential machinery to ensure uninterrupted drainage of rainwater.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza has ordered the immediate clearing of rainwater from all low-lying areas and affected roads.
The administration has also issued rain advisories, urging people to avoid unnecessary travel and maintain a safe distance from electricity poles and wires.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has predicted cloudy weather in the cities of Punjab on Wednesday.
It says there are chances of heavy rains in the upper reaches of rivers, including Lahore. The PDMA’s provincial control room and the district emergency operation centres have also been alerted.

Sources familiar with the meeting said a final decision on the retail price is expected in the next few days. However, it was emphasised during the meeting that the price should remain close to Rs 170 per kg. The PSMA chairman assured that sugar prices would decline within a day or two.
While the government claimed the PSMA has agreed to supply sugar at an ex-mill price of Rs165 per kg, the actual retail price for consumers remains unannounced. Observers noted that Monday’s agreement yielded substantial profit margins for mills, leaving consumers to bear the brunt of high retail rates.
Previously, for the 2023-24 crushing season, the ex-mill price was set at Rs140 per kg during the sugar export period under an agreement between the government and the industry. However, retail prices have surged nationwide, ranging between Rs180 and Rs200 per kg, while wholesale rates hover around Rs159.

TCP cuts import tender volume to 50,000 tonnes

According to a statement from the Ministry of National Food Security, the meeting “addressed the implementation of the government-notified ex-mill price of sugar and ensured its smooth availability in the market.” It added that the impact of the new ex-mill price is expected to be reflected in retail markets within the next two to three days.
The meeting also discussed enforcement mechanisms and steps to guarantee uninterrupted sugar supply across the country. PSMA representatives welcomed the government’s move and assured full cooperation in stabilising prices.
Mr Tanveer reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing relief to the public, stressing that hoarding and profiteering would not be tolerated. He said an effective mechanism had been developed to curb artificial price hikes and ensure consistent supply. “Public interest remains our top priority,” he said, adding that the ministry would maintain close coordination with the sugar industry to uphold price stability.
Import tender volume cut
Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report, the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has scaled back the volume of white refined sugar it seeks through an international tender to 50,000 tonnes, down from an initial range of 300,000-500,000 tonnes.
European traders said the deadline for submitting price offers has been extended to July 22, from the earlier date of July 18. The shipment is now expected to arrive in two consignments of 25,000 tonnes each, to be loaded between Aug 1 and 15. All sugar procured must arrive in Pakistan by Aug 30. The federal cabinet had approved the import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar on July 8 to ease pressure on domestic prices.

The three-member ben­ch was headed by Nisar Ahmad Durra­­ni, with Shah Mohammad Jatoi and Justice (retd) Ik­­ram Ullah Khan as members.
However, PTI has criticised the election watchdog alleging that it did not de-seat the PML-N president for submitting a “fake” consent affidavit, claiming that PTI MNA Adil Khan Bazai had joined the PML-N. The party claimed that a genuinely elected public representative and a staunch supporter of Imran Khan had been disqualified unjustly.
A three-member ECP bench declared Mr Dasti’s seat vacant after finding him guilty of submitting a fake degree. The bench ruled that the MNA had committed an offence pu­­nishable under the Elec­tion Act, recommending legal action against him.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Dasti, elected from NA-175 during the current tenure of the National Assembly, was a powerful voice against the ruling party in the House. Earlier this year, ECP had sent Mr Dasti’s educational credentials to the Karachi education board for verification.
Meanwhile, PTI Cent­ral Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram lashed out at the electoral watchdog for not de-seating the PML-N president over the allegedly fake affidavit regarding MNA Adil Khan Bazai.
He asserted that such desperate and “illegal” ac­­tions could neither sile­nce the voice of the people nor prolong the government’s grip on power, adding the rising tide of public dissent would soon sweep away their “unconstitutional” rule.

• PMD officials rebuff administration’s claims of ‘cloudburst’
• Many areas remain without power for over 30 hours
HYDERABAD: When those charged with keeping the city dry cannot even keep their own offices from being flooded, how can they be expected to ensure proper drainage for the rest of the city?
This was the question many citizens seemed to be asking themselves on Tuesday, in the aftermath of a deluge that left many parts of the city inundated and virtually paralysed.
On Monday, the second most populous city in Sindh witnessed a total collapse of all utility services, including electricity and water, for up to 30  hours.
Rainwater finally started receding from settlements, roads and streets by late Tuesday night.
 
 

Mayor Kashif Shoro said claimed that 99pc areas of Hyderabad city had been cleared of rainwater.
He told Dawn on Tuesday evening that only 1pc areas were those pockets of low lying areas where water was being collected for disposal as it could not be drained out in mainstream drainage system.
Absent officials
During and in the aftermath of the deluge, Rescue 1122 personnel remained inactive for want of supervision by relevant officials, who were also missing from the scene. Resultantly, hundreds of thousands of people kept waiting for relief work until late in the night.
The divisional commissioner, a BS-20  officer, was also conspicuous by his absence at such a critical juncture.
Even on Tuesday, rainwater remained accumulated in Commissioner House as well as Shahbaz Building – where administration officers sit to discharge their duties – which speaks volume of the performance of both divisional and district administrations.
Cloudburst or no?
The head of the civil administration – the local deputy commissioner – attributed the crisis to ‘severe cloudburst’ in Hyderabad, only to be met with a strong rebuttal from the chief meteorologist, in addition to flak from social media users.
“It was in no way a cloudburst either by definition or by phenomenon”, Amir Hyder Leghari of Pakistan Meteorological Department Sindh told Dawn.
Rainwater from most part of city, rather old city areas, is drained on a gravity based system comprising a series of nullahs into two Phuleli canals unlike Latifabad where rainwater is pumped for disposal. These drains have not been desilted.
Power situation
Ironically,  the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) blames the  Hyderabad Electric  Supply Company (Hesco) for its failure to ensure uninterrupted power supply. However, the Hesco chief holds weather responsible for the collapse of its system.
In many areas power supply, could not be restored even 30 hours after it was suspended at about 4:20pm on Monday.
Hesco’s role, undoubtedly, is critical in every monsoon season, and even this time around, a considerable part of Hyderabad remained without power after trees fell on its feeders at different places following a powerful dust storm. No one from the HMC, administration or Hesco had bothered to trim the trees ahead of monsoon.
On its part, Hesco claimed on Tuesday evening that “100pc power supply has been restored in the city”, adding that six grid stations still remained offline.
According to Hesco’s spokesman Sadiq Kubar, said that 12 towers had fallen down during the dust storm and rainfall.

The order came during the hearing of a case seeking the formation of such a commission Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while hearing the case, ordered  that the commission should complete its work within four months.
However, he allowed the commission to seek an extension from the court, if  required.
While concluding the hearing, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan  said the court’s primary task was to determine whether there were  sufficient grounds to form a commission.
 
 

Satisfied with the  arguments, he ordered the government to form the commission within 30  days and instructed that it must submit its findings within four months.  Any request for an extension must be brought before the court.

IHC judge concerned by ‘disappearance’ of woman believed to be a central figure in a number of related cases

The judge also expressed concern over the disappearance of a woman who is the elusive central figure linked to an ongoing blasphemy-related case.
During the proceedings of this case, Komal Ismail had been identified as ‘Iman’, a shadowy figure who was allegedly involved in ‘trapping’ a number of those accused of blasphemy.
Earlier this month, Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan had ordered her CNIC to be blocked over her failure to appear before the court.
On Tuesday, an official from the National Cyber Crimes  Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the bench that four SIMs were registered under her identity, but all these numbers had became inactive after November.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq noted that while the petition in the case had been filed on September 14, and Komal went missing in November.
The officer also said that Ms Ismail had not left the country and was believed to be still in Pakistan. Her name has been placed on the Exit Control List (ECL), and efforts to trace her are ongoing.
The judge observed that the matter directly concerned Komal’s personal safety. “Her life may be in danger. What action can the agency take in such a situation?” he asked.
Advocate Hadi Ali Chatha informed the court that earlier, it had asked for WhatsApp data of three mobile numbers, but telecom companies had responded that WhatsApp data is not covered under Call Detail Records (CDRs), and even standard CDRs are only available for the past year.
The judge remarked that if an intelligence agency has the capability to retrieve such data, the commission should be empowered to request its assistance, adding, “This is a matter of people’s lives”.
The court also reviewed the conduct of the investigation.
Naik Muhammad, one of the accused, had claimed he was trapped by a woman named ‘Iman’.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq questioned the thoroughness of the investigation, observing that officials had merely retrieved five images from Naik Muhammad’s phone and built a case without establishing whether ‘Iman’ had ever contacted him.
Advocate Chatha also revealed that the complainant in the case, Shiraz Farooqi, had remained in contact with the accused just a week before filing the complaint. When questioned by the court, Farooqi denied the claim, calling it “a complete lie.”

• NLC accused of PPRA rule violations, acting as middleman
ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday directed the planning division’s secretary to conduct an inquiry into additional expenditures and submit a report within a month.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar stressed that the planning division should serve as a role model for other ministries. The committee’s member Sanaullah Mastikhel voiced concerns that development funds were being withheld from lawmakers who refused to compromise their integrity.
A case involving the lapse of Rs220 million from the planning division’s development budget also came under scrutiny. The amount had reportedly been earmarked for an event that was cancelled due to the prime minister’s absence. PAC members questioned why such a large sum had been allocated for a single event. Planning Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra clarified that the funds were intended for a social sector project that the prime minister was meant to inaugurate.
MNAs Riaz Fatyana and Sanaullah Mastikhel objected that the planning ministry suffered from poor planning. Mr Fatyana questioned the role of the Planning and Development division, noting that nearly 45 per cent of the country’s population lives below the poverty line.
PAC also reviewed irregularities in the disbursement of funds to district administrations during the census. Audit officials revealed that out of Rs8.69 billion allocated to 157 districts, the leftover funds remained unaccounted for. Mr Sumra noted that accounts for 11 districts were still pending, prompting PAC to order that complete financial records from all remaining districts be collected.
A separate audit found that 219 out of 126,000 tablets purchased for the census were untraceable. The planning secretary said only 24 devices remained missing. PAC decided to close the audit on that matter.
In a separate session, the committee reviewed an audit report on the National Logistics Corp­oration (NLC), focusing on Rs3.2bn in irregularities related to steel procurement.
Audit officials said steel initially contracted at Rs108,000 per tonne was later procured at Rs298,000 per tonne. NLC officials responded that the revised rates were board-approved and aligned with market trends. Audit authorities also flagged a procedural violation in extending a one-year contract with Faizan Steel to three years instead of the permissible two six-month extensions.
The committee also reviewed the Bara Kahu Bypass project, where contractual flaws reportedly led to a Rs2.47bn loss for NLC. The project, awarded without tender under emergency conditions, was initially estimated at Rs6.51bn but ballooned to Rs8.82bn.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has yet to approve the additional cost. NLC attributed the overrun to court stay orders and design changes, such as an extension in the length of a bridge.
Committee members observed that the NLC violated Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules with impunity. “Had any other division or private firm committed such violations, the matter would have been referred to NAB or the FIA,” Mr Mehmood said. The committee condemned the practice of awarding development projects to NLC without tendering and at inflated costs, often 120pc higher than standard estimates. It was also observed that NLC acted as a middleman by subletting projects to third parties at lower rates.

Talking to Interior Min­ister Mohsin Raza Naqvi, who met him in Tehran on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said the Jewish state was trying to create division among Muslim countries and stressed that unity and harmony among Islamic nations was needed to foil machinations by Israel and its allies in the West.
“Muslim countries must wake up to the need for unity and form a united front against the Zionist regime,” the Iranian president said, according to a communication received through the media wing of the interior ministry.
President Pezeshkian stated that Iran attached great importance to its relations with Pakistan, emphasising that “we will never forget the support extended by  Pakistan” during the war with Israel.
 
 

President Pezes­h­kian ex­pressed satisfaction over the current state of relations between Iran and Pakistan. He underlined the importance of diplomatic exchanges and constructive dialogue to expand bilateral cooperation.
The Iranian leader said there were many avenues to expand collaboration between Tehran and Islamabad. Mohsin Naqvi congratulated President Pezeshkian on Iran’s victory in the war thrust on it by Israel.
Mr Naqvi praised Iran’s Supreme Leader and the entire nation for standing up to Israeli aggression.  He added that the prudent leadership of Ayatollah Khame­nei played a decisive role in the war. “It is a source of pride for the Muslim Ummah.”
He said Pakistan had condemned the attack on Iran at every forum, recalling “our parliament was the first to pass a resolution condemning the imposition of war on Iran”.
The interior minister conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s best wishes to President Peze­sh­kian.
Iran’s Interior Minister Eskandar Mo­me­ni, Presi­dent Pezesh­kian’s Special Assistant, the Ambassador of Iran in Islamabad, and Pakistan’s Ambassador in Tehran were present on the occasion.
Naqvi calls on ex-FM
Mohsin Naqvi later called on Iran’s former foreign minister Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, who is currently serving as Senior Adviser on International Affairs to Ayatollah Khamenei.
The two leaders discussed matters of mutual interest and the regional situation. Mr Naqvi conveyed good wishes from Pakistan’s political and military leadership to Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mohsin Naqvi said Pakistan and Iran have always stood by each other in war and peace. “No enemy can create rift between Pakistan and Iran,” he added.

The data shows South Asia has reached its highest-ever immunisation coverage for children, according to new data released by WHO and Unicef for 2024. This marks a milestone in the region’s drive to protect every child from vaccine-preventable diseases, the UN agencies say.
The new data shows strong government commitments, investments, and partnerships have propelled South Asia to achieve its highest-ever immunisation coverage.
In 2024, 92pc of the infants in the region received their third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine, a crucial global indicator of vaccination progress.

Pakistan may become the only country in the world having poliovirus, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal tells Senate

This marks a two percentage point increase since 2023. During the same period, the proportion of children receiving their first dose of DTP increased from 93pc to 95pc.
These figures show a strong bounce back, surpassing pre-Covid levels — reflecting efforts of the South Asian governments to prioritise children’s health.
Additionally, there was a 27pc reduction in the number of children who did not receive a single dose of the vaccine, also known as zero-dose children, decreasing from 2.5 million to 1.8 million in a year.
“This is a proud moment for South Asia. More children are protected today than ever before, thanks to tireless frontline health workers, strong government leadership, donors’ and partners’ support and the unwavering trust of families,” said Unicef Regional Director for South Asia, Sanjay Wijesekera.
“But we cannot forget the millions of children who are under-vaccinated or unvaccinated. Now is the time to push further, especially into the most rural areas, to give every child his or her right to healthcare in the earliest years of life,” he said.
 
 

However, while the region made leaps in immunising children in 2024, more than 2.9 million children remain un- and under-vaccinated and, therefore, unprotected. With this in mind, Unicef and WHO have urged governments in South Asia to sustain political commitment and increase domestic financing for immunisation.
‘Only country with poliovirus prevalence’
In a separate development, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal told Senate on Tuesday Pakistan might become the only country having poliovirus as in Afghanistan polio vaccination drive face no hurdles and people there are not refusing to vaccinate their children against the crippling disease.
Replying to a calling-attention notice in the Senate, the health minister said that apart from Kandahar, there is door-to-door campaign being held across Afghanistan.
“In Kandahar announcements are made at mosques and people are called to come and get their children administered polio drops in mosques,” he said.
The calling-attention notice was moved by Senator Abdul Shakoor Khan who said that polio cases are being reported and there are misconceptions regarding the disease and suggested that religious scholars must be involved to play their role for curbing the disease.
 
 

Mr Kamal said that Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries of the world where polio cases are being reported.
He said he himself went to Balochistan to discuss the issue of polio. Last year, he said, 79 cases of polio were reported and this year only 14 cases have been reported so far out of which five cases have been found in Bannu where there were people who had refused to get their children vaccinated.
He said there is a perception that there is resistance against polio drive in Afghan­istan, but the fact is that an extensive polio drive is going on in Afghanistan to eradicate the disease.
He said that earlier police were being used to ensure administration of polio vaccine in Pakistan, but he has stopped it and now influencers of the area are being used to convince the people that they should save the lives of their children and get their children vaccinated.

• Files have now been sent back to IHC; legal experts believe he can’t give reasons now as SC judge
ISLAMABAD: More than three years after then Islamabad High Court (IHC) chief justice Athar Minallah struck down Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the decision has found itself in a legal limbo as the judge has yet to issue detailed reasoning for his verdict.
In his order dated April 8, 2022, Justice Minallah declared illegal the provision — introduced by the PTI government — which expanded the definition of defamation to include criticism against institutions and state authorities and proposed an imprisonment of five years.
“The criminalisation of defamation, protection of individual reputations through arrest and imprisonment and the resultant chilling effect violates the letter of the Constitution…,” Justice Minallah had noted in his short order.
As per standard legal practice, a judge issues a short order, outlining the verdict, and gives a detailed order later elucidating their reasoning for reaching the conclusion.
However, Justice Minallah never issued the detailed reasoning. In November 2022, he was made a Supreme Court judge.
The judge kept the case files with him for writing a detailed order and did not return them to the IHC registrar despite his elevation to the top court.
 
 

According to court officials, the files were returned recently without any detailed order.
The move has created a legal ‘grey area’ as the IHC is once again hearing a set of petitions filed against amendments introduced to Peca earlier this year by the incumbent government.
Some petitioners, who challenged the fresh amendments, relied on Justice Minallah’s 2022 short order to substantiate their case against criminalisation of defamation.
However, in the absence of detailed reasoning, legal experts term such citation as weak.
While a court official told Dawn the case files might be handed over to a bench for rehearing, legal experts think otherwise.
According to former law minister Farooq H. Naek, a short order is a “perfect judgement”, but in the absence of detailed reasoning, the judgement can be labelled as weak.
He wondered why the files were not returned to the IHC registrar by Justice Minallah for three years.
Legal expert Mohammad Akram Sheikh told Dawn the Supreme Court thoroughly discussed the validity of short orders in a judgment authored by former chief justice Moham­mad Ajmal Mian in 1997.
He pointed out that a short order announced and signed by a judge is considered a valid judicial order.
According to Mr Sheikh, Justice Minallah, now being a Supreme Court judge, cannot give reasoning for his judgement passed in the IHC.
In February 2022, the PTI government had promulgated a presidential ordinance amending the Peca.
The controversial ordinance modified the definition of a ‘natural person’ to include “company, association or body of persons whether incorporated or not, institutions, organisations, authority or any other body established by the government.”
Essentially, it enabled any per­son to lodge a complaint over criticism of a civic body or any government entity or institution.
Two factions of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, Pakistan Broadcasters Asso­cia­tion and other activists challenged the ordinance.
Justice Minallah, in his short order, “allowed” the petitions and struck down Section 20, which dealt with the defamation of a ‘natural person’.
Subsequently, the court decl­ared the ordinance “unconstitutional” and “invalid” and declared it void.

• Says measures implemented to expand tax base, plug leakages
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday urged the leading US rating agency — Moody’s — to improve Pakistan’s credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions. Pakistan has been postponing the launch of international bonds since July 2021 due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and resultant poor credit rating and relying mostly on time deposits from friendly nations to meet external liabilities and stay afloat.
Moody’s had upgraded Paki­stan’s credit rating by one notch to Caa2 from Caa3 (downgraded in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.
On Tuesday, Mr Aurangzeb led Pakistan’s economic team, including Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmed, and senior officials from relevant ministries, and held a virtual engagement with Moody’s Rating Agency.
The rating agency was provided an in-depth briefing on Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook, reform agenda, and financial stability.
During the session, the minister apprised the Moody’s team of the significant strides Pakistan has made in stabilising its economy and laying the foundations for sustainable and inclusive growth, said an official statement. He underlined the successful completion of the final IMF review under the Stand-By Arrangement, including the disbursement of the second tranche and progress under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), as key milestones that have restored confidence in Pakistan’s economic management.
The minister highlighted a series of structural reforms undertaken by the government to anchor long-term stability. These included prudent fiscal measures in the recently announced budget, tariff and trade liberalisation geared towards export-led growth, and concerted efforts to rationalise expenditure. The ongoing discussions with the United States on preferential tariff access were also noted as making encouraging headway.
The meeting further outlined Pakistan’s re-engagement with global financial markets, including the successful arrangement of $1 billion in financing from the Middle East, plans for an inaugural Panda bond, and Pakistan’s intent to explore the Eurobond and other international debt markets as credit ratings improve.
The statement claimed that the Pakistani team presented evidence of macroeconomic recovery, including a reduction in inflation, a cut in the pol­i­­cy rate, stabilisation of the exchange rate, a current account surplus, and a surge in foreign exch­a­­nge reserves. Impro­vements in remittance infl­ows and export performance were also cited as signs of resilience and renewed investor confidence.
The Moody’s team was provided an overview of Pakistan’s reform journey, with emphasis on improving the tax-to-GDP ratio through technology-driven tax administration reforms and robust enforcement measures.
The finance minister emphasised that under the direct oversight of the prime minister, who chairs regular meetings on tax reform, the government was impl­e­m­e­nting measures to expand the tax base, plug leakages, and enh­ance compliance. He noted that the Rs2 trillion revenue delta achieved this year had come thro­ugh autonomous efforts, and the government was committed to reaching a tax-to-GDP target of 13 to 13.5pc in the next few years.
He also addressed queries from the Moody’s team and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to staying the course on macroeconomic reforms, including in areas of privatisation, restructuring of state-owned enterprises and rightsizing of government.
Senator Aurangzeb expressed optimism that the improving macroeconomic indicators and reform momentum would be positively acknowledged by rating agencies.

The prime minister was accompanied by senior cabinet members, including Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, and Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that the president and the prime minister agreed that no one will be allowed to harm peace in the country in the name of ‘political rally and sit-in’.
It was decided that PTI protesters will not be allowed to enter the federal capital and will be stopped by any means necessary.
A suggestion also came during the meeting that a specified place away from the central parts of the capital could be allocated for the protest of the main opposition—PTI, which is coming out for its main demand of the release of its jailed founder Imran Khan.
The source said that Presi­dent Zardari, widely regarded for his political acumen despite PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s formal leadership, is known for securing support from non-allied parties during critical political moments.
According to the source, the president assured the prime minister of his cooperation in making efforts to win the maximum number of Senate seats from KP.
Earlier this month, the Election Commission of Pakistan had finally announced the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, setting July 21 as the polling date.
The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise will see elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.
Experts believe the outcome will hinge on how PTI-backed and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) members vote. If the opposition remains united and PTI-backed members strictly follow party discipline — with JUI-F support — the ruling coalition may win only one general seat.
However, the scenario would shift dramatically if some PTI members defect and JUI-F strikes a deal with the ruling coalition. In that case, the coalition might bag around five seats, potentially gaining a two-thirds majority in the upper house of Parliament. JUI-F already holds five seats in the Senate.
Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).

• ECP allows PML-N to count independent ‘notified’ later among its tally, rejects similar plea from PTI-P
• ANP also denied relief, told allocation is calculated on basis of general seats, not by-election
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan has decided to allow the PML-N to retain a general assembly seat while rejecting a similar request by the PTI-Parliamentarians, saying it was not supported by the law.
In its decision on a case about the allocation of reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, announced on Tuesday, the commission provided relief to the ruling party that had sought a greater share in the KP Assembly reserved seats on the basis of the additional general seat handed to the PML-N, which was initially declared to be held by an independent candidate.
The announcement followed a Peshawar High Court order, asking the ECP to redistribute reserved seats in the provincial assembly. With the addition of one more seat, the PML-N is eligible for an extra reserved seat in the KP Assembly and holds the same number of seats as the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F).
 
 

After the PML-N received the general seat, the ruling party and the JUI-F hold the same number of seats in the KP Assembly, and the former is entitled to get at least one more reserved seat in the provincial assembly.
The ECP had determined the quota of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims on the basis of party position as it stood on Feb 22 — the legal deadline for the issuance of victory notifications.
In its decision, the commission accepted the plea that Malik Tariq Awan — an independent candidate — who joined the PML-N a day after the allocation of reserved seats did not get three days to join a political party. Interestingly, a similar plea by the PTI-Parliamentarians has been rejected by the ECP.
The ECP order referred to proviso of Article 51(6)(e), read with Article 106 of the Constitution, which provides that the calculation of quota for the reserved seats shall be made on the basis of total number of general seats won by political party, which shall include the independent returned candidate or candidates who may duly join such political party within three days of the publication in official gazette.
Mr Awan was declared an independent returned candidate on Feb 22, 2024. The commission, after the passage of around one and a half years, now reached the conclusion that Mr Awan joined the PML-N on Feb 23, which was within three days of the victory notification.
The commission held that he was eligible to be considered as a member of for an additional seat on the basis of the same grounds was rejected by the ECP. The ECP order conceded that PTI-P won two KP Assembly general seats in the Feb polls, but it could not recalculate the reserved seats at the request of the party because it would be an ‘unending process’ if such a request was entertained.
The order said that at the time of calculation of quota, one seat was duly notified for PTI-P from PK-73 (Peshawar-III).  Subsequently, another candidate of the said party from PK-103 was notified on Feb 27 after the calculation and allocation of reserved seats to the political parties.
Without explaining if the commission can punish a political party for belated issuance of a victory notification, the ECP said recalculation of quota for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims at belated stage after allocation of reserved seats to the political parties was not supported by the Constitution and law.
“The rationale for calculation of quota for the reserved seats on the basis of party position on 22-02-2024 was to avoid unending controversies. For example, if a political party succeeds in getting more seats as a result of recounting or by-election or decision of the tribunal, the quota will be revised again and again and it will be an unending process which is against the spirit of Constitution and Law as enshrined in Articles 51(6) & 106 of the Constitution and Section 98 & 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Rule 92 of the Election Rules, 2017,” it noted, while dismissing PTI-P’s plea for another reserved seat.
The commission directed the office to take follow-up action in light of the order and submit the case to the commission accordingly.
ANP by-election seat
Meanwhile, the Awami National Party (ANP) had secured one general seat from PK-75 Peshawar-IV during the General Elections 2024, which was notified on Feb 22. Subsequently, the ANP secured another seat from PK-22 Bajaur-IV, held on July 11, and the returned candidate was notified on July 25.
The order said in accordance with the Constitution and applicable legal provisions, the quota for allocation of reserved seats is calculated on the basis of general seats and not on the basis of subsequent by-elections.
“Results of by-elections cannot be included as it is not the spirit of Constitution provided under Article 224(2) of the Constitution read with Section 98 of the Elections Act, 2017.
In case, this petition is accepted it will be un-ending processes which will result recalculation/fluctuation of seats from time to time after each and every by-election or decision of the tribunal,“ the commission observed while rejecting ANP’s plea for another seat.

Filing a plea before the SHC, petitioner Malik Shahzain Ahmed sought compensation and an inquiry into the incident.
He cited the ministry of aviation, Civil Aviation Authority, Airport Security Force, Federal Investigation Agency and AirSial as respondents, and sought directive for effective implementation of mandatory standard operating procedures (SOPs) and documentation procedures.
The petitioner submitted that he is a resident of Korangi, Karachi, and frequently travels within the country for work-related assignments as he is a professional civil engineer.

Seeks compensation for financial and mental distress caused by airline’s negligence; urges high court to order implementation of SOPs

He stated that on July 7, he had purchased a ticket of AirSial to travel from Lahore to Karachi, but due to alleged gross negligence and procedural failure of the airline, he was “wrongfully and unlawfully boarded on an international flight of the same airline to Jeddah despite lacking valid passport, visa and international travel clearance”.
The petitioner also submitted that such a reckless conduct of the private airline resulted in his prolonged detention and interrogations at the Jeddah Airport and eventually he was deported back to Lahore by the Saudi immigration authorities without any assistance or representation of the respondent airline.
He further maintained that after returning to Lahore, he was again compelled to purchase a new ticket to reach Karachi.
He said he sent a formal legal notice to the airline for legal intimation and initiation of appropriate action, but no response had been received so far. He alleged that the airline has failed to offer any apology, remedy, or compensation and instead attempted to suppress the incident and such action was amount to gross violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Constitution.
The counsel for petitioner, Nawaz Dahri, submitted that besides violation of constitutional provisions, such an act has also caused immense mental distress, financial loss and reputational damage to him as well as exposing him to criminal liability abroad.
He also argued that the regulatory authorities have also failed to perform their statutory duties in order to prevent such gross misconduct and their inaction has caused violations.
The lawyer maintained that actions of respondents have also violated various laws and regulations including Rules 272 and 273 the Civil Aviation Rules 1997 requiring passengers’ verification, the Pakistan Immigration Ordinance 1979, barring international travel without valid documents and the Montreal Convention 1999 and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 9 binding the air carrier to ensure secure and lawful travel procedures.
He further submitted that the petitioner was also facing threats and intimidation not to pursue the matter in question publically and legally while his client was subjected to unlawful detention, loss of dignity, deprivation of liberty and financial injury.
The counsel argued that the conduct of the private airline has posed a serious threat to the aviation safety standards and inaction on the part of aviation authorities has undermined public confidence in aviation institutions.
He also contended that no alternative remedy was available with the petitioner but to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of the SHC primarily to safeguard his fundamental rights.
The lawyer further maintained that the petitioner had been able to demonstrate infringement of fundamental rights, meriting the exercise to move the SHC.
The petitioner pleaded for a full transparent inquiry into the incident and to fix responsibility upon delinquent officials or persons and sought compensation for damages.
He also sought directives for the respondents to suspend the license of the airline and effective implementation of mandatory SOPs and documentation procedures.

• Central govt debt soars to Rs76tr                     
KARACHI: Bank lending to the government has exceeded Rs44 trillion, while lending to the private sector accounts for just 21 per cent of total advances, highlighting the growing imbalance in the country’s credit landscape.
According to the latest data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), government borrowing from banks surged by Rs8.5tr in FY24 alone. In stark contrast, private sector lending fell to a mere Rs46bn in FY23, rose modestly to Rs513bn in FY24, and stands at around Rs742bn so far in FY25.
As of May, the government’s holdings of market securities stood at Rs44.889tr, of which 78.9pc (Rs35.440tr) were held by scheduled banks and 21.1pc by non-bank entities.
Notably, the corporate sector is increasingly parking its liquidity in government securities, a trend that underscores the diminishing appetite for or opportunity in real-sector investment. Corporate holdings in government papers have now reached Rs9.5tr — capital that, in a healthier economy, would be channelled into industrial expansion and job creation.
This shift toward risk-free government paper has profound economic implications. Private sector credit stagnation has contributed to an average GDP growth of just 1.7pc over the past three years — far below the level needed to absorb Pakistan’s growing labour force and meet the rising costs of housing, health, and education for over 250 million citizens.
The government has acknowledged the lacklustre performance of the agricultural sector, with wheat farmers, in particular, being hit by a 21% drop in wheat prices this year, further eroding rural incomes and disincentivising production.
SBP data up to May 31 shows that scheduled banks’ largest exposure is in Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), totalling Rs24.7tr, while the corporate sector has invested Rs5.05tr in PIBs. Ijara Sukuk (Islamic bonds) have attracted over Rs6tr, with more than 88pc held by scheduled banks. Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) saw total investments of Rs9.084tr — Rs5.399tr by banks and Rs3.685tr by corporates.
Meanwhile, the central government’s total domes­tic debt rose to Rs53.468tr and external debt to Rs22.585tr by May. This brought the total government debt to Rs76.045tr, up Rs7.131tr from Rs68.914tr in June 2024.

The surge in lending last year was driven by a government policy announced in the FY25 budget, which imposed an incremental tax of up to 15pc on banks that failed to maintain a minimum ADR of 50pc. The move was aimed at encouraging private sector credit and boosting economic growth, which had remained below desired levels.
The policy triggered an aggressive response from banks. Some major institutions reportedly advised large depositors to withdraw funds or face penalties as banks scrambled to meet the new threshold. In a bid to comply, banks significantly increased lending to Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs), with loans reaching a record Rs1tr by December 2024 — 130pc higher than the total credit stock of NBFIs at the time.
According to a State Bank report, this sharp increase was a strategic manoeuvre by banks to manage surplus liquidity and meet the mandatory ADR by year-end. Despite achieving the target, the government eventually withdrew the 50pc ADR condition and still imposed an additional tax on banks.
Following the removal of the requirement, banks shifted back to risk-free avenues, primarily investing in government securities. This shift pushed the investment-to-deposit ratio (IDR) to 103pc by June 2025.

The new petrol price is Rs272.15 per litre and Rs284.35 for HSD.
The press release did not mention any changes in the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil.
According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol was projected to rise by about two per cent to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD was likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.
Diesel fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters had already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.
Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.
Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.
Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p><small>2025-07-15 19:04</small></div><hr>
