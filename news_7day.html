Special Court (CNS) Judge Rajesh Chander Rajput convicted accused Nakawa Edihi of the offence punishable under Section 9 (1) 7 (b) of the CNS Act, 1997 (as Amended in 2022).
According to state prosecutor Abdul Hannan, the accused arrived in Pakistan in January after allegedly concealing 11 capsules containing 144 gram of cocaine in her stomach. She was apprehended by an Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) team at the Jinnah International Airport.
However, when she appeared before the court for framing of formal charges, she voluntarily pleaded guilty and prayed for mercy. On her admission, the court recorded her statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), in which she confessed to the offence.

Court takes a lenient view in handing down jail term after accused pleads guilty

“I have heard the accused have thoroughly gone through the record of the case. During framing of formal charge, accused has admitted her guilt of attempt to import 11 capsules having 144 gram of ‘cocaine’ concealed in her body cavity to Pakistan,” the judge noted.
Reasoning for lesser punishment, the court observed that the accused has repeatedly pleaded guilty by “detailing her poor financial circumstances and from her demeanor”.
“This court has concluded that her admission of guilt was voluntarily and free from any coercion whatsoever from any corner,” it added.
In her statement before the court, the accused deposed that she was a single mother of two minor children and was facing financial constraints to meet her daily expenses as she was also a diabetic patient hence, she committed this crime.
She further claimed to be the first offender and nothing was available in the investigation papers to suggest that she was a previous convict.
The court also imposed a fine of Rs50,000, on default she would have to serve additional imprisonment for five days.
According to prosecutor Hannan, a Nigerian national, Stephen Chubuike, was in contact with the prime accused. Later, he was apprehended and bail was granted to him as nothing was recovered from his possession.
However, at the hearing, he failed to appear before the court as a result the court cancelled his surety bond and issued non-bailable warrant for his arrest.
A case was registered at the ANF Clifton station under Section 9(1) 7(b) of the CNS Act, 1997 (as Amended in 2022).

• Traffic police using new number plates campaign as a ‘trap for bribery’, alleges Monem Zafar
• Muttahida urges review of fees, seeks mobile camps to ease process
KARACHI: The criticism by the opposition parties against a government move to replace vehicle number plates with new Ajrak-themed designs and allow traffic police to issue hefty fines against ordinary people gained momentum as they demanded that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) stop law enforcers from taking extreme action and waive the fees for the new number plates.
On Sunday, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) organised a “bike rally” and hundreds of motorcyclists took to the streets, protesting against the PPP government and accusing it of “enabling corruption and creating new opportunities for law enforcement officials to demand bribes”.
The protesters also questioned the priorities and policies of the provincial government, accusing it of “failing” to provide basic necessities and essential public services while focusing instead on vehicle registration plates.
The bike rally kicked off from Five Star Chowrangi in North Nazimabad and concluded near Fresco Chowk, off Burns Road, drawing a large crowd, with the majority of participants being young riders.
Addressing the participants, the JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar strongly lambasted the PPP government over its “wrongful” approach and priorities aimed at “minting money”, instead of bringing some ease to Karachiites.
“The Karachiites are facing multiple daily life crises. They are facing acute water shortage, the roads in the city are broken, garbage has become a big issue and health risk in a large number of areas. There are only 400 buses for 35 million people, infrastructure has gone, load-shedding is still a problem in several towns, but the PPP government has chosen number plates to keep its focus on,” he added.
In this backdrop, he said, bikers were halted at every nook and corner of the city, and the number plates campaign was being used as a “trap for bribery” by the “corrupt” elements in the traffic police.
He urged the government to reconsider its decision and immediately halt the campaign, warning that failure to do so would provoke a strong public protest from the people of Karachi.
The growing controversy over the fresh campaign of the government and the imposition of a new fee for culturally-themed plates has started attracting criticism from almost all political parties in Karachi.
Muttahida demands review of fee
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has directed its Sindh Assembly members to urgently meet with the provincial Excise Minister to address the public’s concerns.
In a statement, the MQM-P central committee highlighted that over 3.3 million motorcycles and 2.3 million vehicles are registered in Karachi, yet their owners — despite applying and paying online — are not receiving number plates on time.
“Complaints remain unresolved, and citizens face harassment from traffic police for not displaying plates, even though they have already paid the required fee during registration,” it said.
The party demanded that mobile camps be set up on main roads for plate distribution and that plates be couriered directly to applicants, to eliminate long queues and exploitation by agents.
It has also called for a review of the plate fees and rebates for those who have already paid under the old system.
Afaq calls it ‘Ajrak tax’
Separately, Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM-Haqiqi) chairman Afaq Ahmed strongly condemned the Sindh government’s decision to issue new Ajrak-themed number plates for motorcycles, charging Rs1,850 per vehicle.
Calling it a discriminatory “Ajrak tax,” he warned that such policies could lead to dangerous ethnic divisions within the province.
“We do not want Sindh’s division, but if this injustice continues, a strong public reaction is inevitable,” he said.
He also accused the Sindh government of treating Karachi like a “colony”, “exploiting” its resources while “denying” residents basic infrastructure, transport, education and law enforcement.
He demanded equal compensation for victims of traffic accidents in Karachi, similar to that provided in interior Sindh.

• Legislation says shift necessitated by ‘changing dynamics of national security’; allows for countrywide deployment of Federal Constabulary
• Force to have dedicated division for special protection and riot control
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the Frontier Constabulary (FC), a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary to maintain law and order, supplement the law enforcement agencies, and address the diverse security needs in a coordinated manner.
Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance, the Law and Justice Division issued an official notification to this effect. According to the ordinance, the Frontier Consta­bulary was originally established to maintain law and order in frontier and border areas, ensuring the security of these critical regions, and preserving public peace in remote territories.
However, the changing dynamics of national security, the increasing frequency of emergencies, natural disasters, civil unrest, and other emerging threats necessitated a more adaptable and versatile force to respond to such challenges.
“As the Senate and the National Assembly are not in session and the President of the Islamic Repu­blic of Pakistan is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate act­ion,” the ordinance said. The ordi­nance called the Frontier Cons­tabulary (Re-organization) Ordi­nance, 2025, came into force at once.
A former interior secretary told Dawn that the ordinance gave complete and legitimate authority to the federal government to use FC across the country and for any purpose, in the name of security.
He said the Frontier Consta­bulary was first deployed in Kara­chi about 25 years ago and then it was used in the federal capital. Later, it was deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan for the protection of the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) and major dam projects.
Before this ordinance, the use of force by the government for VIP security often attracted criticism, but now, under the name of protecting “escort”, the force can be freely used for the personal security of the elite.
The ordinance said that the force would be headed by an inspector general to be appointed by the federal government. The FC, it said, be used as a reserve force, to perform specialised duties in aid of the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, provincial police forces, and other security and law enforcement forces and agencies.
The Federal Constabulary shall be under the overall command of the inspector general, who shall be assisted by additional inspectors general, deputy inspectors general, and assistant inspectors general and such other officers of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), as may be appointed in the prescribed manner. It shall comprise two divisions, namely the Security Division and the Federal Reserve Division.
The structure of the Federal Constabulary shall comprise wings, companies and platoons, commanded by officers of the rank of superintendent of police, assistant superintendent of police, or deputy superintendent of police, inspector, sub-inspector, and assistant sub-inspector, respectively.
 
 

The FC’s Security Division shall comprise the existing strength of the Frontier Constabulary and shall consist exclusively of the personnel appointed through the traditional system as prescribed by regulations.
There shall be a dedicated division for anti-riot and special protection in the Federal Constabulary called the Federal Reserve Division. The Federal Constabulary shall have the powers as enshrined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the Police Order, 2002 (Chief Executive’s Order No. 22 of 2002) and any other law for the time being in force.
Shifting all powers
In addition to such powers, the federal government may, by general or special order, confer or impose upon any member of the Federal Constabulary any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed on a police officer of any class or grade by any enactment for the time being in force.
The ordinance also shifts all powers and assets of the Frontier Constabulary to the Federal Constabulary, as it said: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force all members and employees of the Frontier Constabulary serving in the defunct Frontier Constabulary immediately before the commencement of this ordinance, immediately after the commencement of this ordinance shall stands transferred to the Federal Constabulary reconstituted under this ordinance on same terms and conditions as applicable to them before commencement of this ordinance.”
“All assets and liabilities of the Frontier Constabulary, of whatever nature and wherever situated, shall, upon commencement of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance stand transferred to and vest in the Federal Constabulary,” it added.
“All rules, regulations, notifications, and orders made or issued under the Frontier Constabulary Act, 1915, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance, shall be deemed to have been made or issued under the corresponding provisions of the Federal Constabulary,” the ordinance said.

Bitcoin scaled a record high of $121,207.55 in the Asian session on Monday, before pulling back slightly to last trade 1.6 per cent higher at $121,015.42.
Starting today, the US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide the digital asset industry with the nation’s regulatory framework it has long demanded.
Those demands have resonated with US President Donald Trump, who has called himself the “crypto president” and urged policymakers to revamp rules in favour of the industry.
“It’s riding a number of tailwinds at the moment,” said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, citing strong institutional demand, expectations of further gains and support from Trump as reasons for the bullishness.
“It’s been a very, very, strong move over the past six or seven days, and it’s hard to see where it stops now; it looks like it can easily have a look at the $125,000 level,” he said.
The surge in bitcoin, which is up 29pc for the year so far, has sparked a broader rally across other cryptocurrencies over the past few sessions, even in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs.
Ether, the second-largest token, scaled a more than five-month top of $3,050.90, while XRP and Solana gained about 3pc each.
The sector’s total market value has swelled to about $3.78 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Earlier this month, Washington declared the week of July 14 as “crypto week”, where members of Congress are set to vote on the Genius Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.
The most significant bill is the Genius Act, which would create federal rules for stablecoins.
Elsewhere, prices of crypto-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong similarly surged.
Spot bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera all scaled record highs, while the three ether ETFs managed by the asset managers were up roughly 2pc each.</p><small>2025-07-14 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/141059065b833b7.jpg?r=105913' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924084/six-dead-27-injured-as-multan-bound-bus-crashes-on-motorway-near-chakri' target='_blank'><strong>Six dead, 27 injured as Multan-bound bus crashes on motorway near Chakri</strong></a><br><p>CHAKWAL: Six people, including four women, lost their lives while 27 others sustained injuries as a bus carrying them crashed on Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M2) near Chakri Interchange on Sunday noon.

A bench consisting of Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Fazal Subhan has accepted a petition filed by the firm, M/S Shamsi Builders Karachi, which has been in litigation with the authority since 2010, with multiple directives to the petitioner, Galiyat Development Authority (GDA) and KP Culture and Tourism Authority (KPCTA).
KPCTA, while terminating the lease agreement, had cited certain reasons stating that the firm had allegedly submitted faulty site plan not in consonance with GDA Building Bylaws and Act, which inflicted heavy losses on the exchequer.
The bench, in its 14-page detailed judgement, directed that the petitioner should be afforded a single opportunity for preparing and submitting a map of construction in accordance with the prevalent GDA regulations within 90 days.

The issue has been lingering on for the last 15 years

“Then an application shall be made along with proposed map to the director general of KP Culture and Tourism Authority. The department shall forward the map to GDA within 30 days of being submitted. GDA shall either approve the map within 30 days further or convey to the petitioner any reservation or objection which may be made on such building plan within same period of 30 days,” the bench ordered.
It directed that the petitioner should remove all such objections and submit a fresh building plan to GDA within 30 days thereafter in respect of which GDA should pass a written order within further 30 days either approving or disapproving the map by giving express reasons.
“If this time the map is disapproved by GDA finally or petitioner fails in removing valid objection conveyed to him in writing then KP Tourism Authority shall be at liberty to cancel the agreement again after affording opportunity of hearing to petitioner,” the bench ordered.
The bench observed that perusal of record revealed that passing termination order, petitioner had not been served with any notice nor afforded an opportunity of hearing. “He had been condemned unheard and therefore, the impugned order is not sustainable on this score,” it added.
The petitioner’s counsel Syed Tanveer Ashraf stated that in early 2007, the then Sarhad Tourism Corporation (STC) had invited bids for granting a 30-year lease of a four-kanal plot in main bazaar, Donga Gali, Abbottabad, to develop a tourism complex consisting of rooms, suites, restaurants and related facilities.
He said that the petitioner was declared successful bidder after which a lease agreement was executed with him on June 1, 2007. He added that in Dec 2007, the lease was amended to include an additional seven marlas increasing the lease land to four-kanal and seven marlas.
He stated that STC had earlier cancelled the lease through a letter on Feb 18, 2010, stating that no constriction had been initiated or completed within the two-year grace period, which ran from June 1, 2007 to June 1, 2009.
He said that the petitioner had challenged that order in PHC, which accepted his plea in May 2010, but GDA refused to approve the site/building plan. The counsel stated that it again served a notice on the petitioner in May 2011, warning it of termination of the lease in case the site plan was not approved within a month. He added that the petitioner again filed a petition in the high court, which clubbed it with 22 other petitions related to Galiyat areas.
In the meantime, he said, respondents including GDA produced a letter that the lease had been cancelled, following which the court disposed of that petition on June 15, 2023, observing that it had become infructuous.
He stated that the petitioner then field the present petition, challenging cancellation of the lease agreement by KPCTA.
The bench observed that the main reason for cancellation was that the petitioner had not been able to approve his building plan from GDA and couldn’t raise construction of the plot in accordance with the terms of his lease earlier granted to him.
Referring to the lease deed, the bench observed that the timeline would have started once the master plan had been approved by the lessor. It observed that it was an admitted fact that the petitioner had submitted construction plan eight times but the same had not been found favour with the relevant branch of GDA and every time it was objected by GDA.
The bench observed that since the master plan had not been approved so the time had not started running against the petitioner justifying termination of the lease deed.

The deputy commissioner is leading the ongoing operations.
During a visit to Thoya Fazil, the deputy commissioner inspected encroachments on the right of way along the irrigation department’s road and directed the departments concerned for their immediate removal.
The district administration also inspected illegal housing schemes built dangerously close to the River Indus, with the encroachments in direct violation of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa River Protection Act, 2014.
Water levels have already reached some residential structures in the affected areas, posing serious threats to life and property. In light of the imminent danger, the administration has issued 24-hour evacuation notices to residents and ordered the demolition of unsafe constructions.
So far, 18 houses have been vacated in a housing society, and one illegal swimming pool has been sealed.
Citizens have been advised to refrain from buying or selling plots or initiating construction activities in unauthorised housing societies located near or within river channels.
A spokesperson for the district administration said: “We are utilising all available resources to safeguard public life and property. Clearing encroachments, cleaning canals and drainage systems, and proactive flood management measures are our top priorities during the monsoon season.”

The rally, which had been scheduled about a week ago and jointly organised by local politicians, elders, traders, and peace activists, later turned into a massive gathering. It was held on the main Khar-Nawagai Road outside Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar.
The rally was held three days after the killing of Maulana Khan Zeb, a renowned peace campaigner and central leader of Awami National Party, who was killed along with a policeman during an attack on his vehicle by unidentified assailants near the rally venue on Thursday.
The participants of the rally were carrying white flags and white banners inscribed with various slogans in support of peace, such as ‘We want peace in our area’, ‘Peace is our life’, and ‘Peace is our right’. They also chanted slogans against lawlessness and violence in the district.

Speakers pay tributes to efforts of Maulana Khan Zeb for restoration of peace

Some participants also held photos of Maulana Khan Zeb, Rehan Zeb Khan and other prominent deceased politicians, social activists and tribal elders, who were killed in the district during the last few years.
Besides strict security arrangements by police, cold drinking water and cold drinks were also set up by locals and non-governmental welfare organisations for the participants of the rally, believed to be the largest such gathering in the district.
The special assistant to prime minister on tribal districts, MNA Mubarak Zeb Khan; MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman, Mohammad Nisar Khan and Anwar Zeb Khan; former lawmaker Guldad Khan; PML-N leader Shahabuddin Khan; PPP leader Sayed Akhunzada Chattan; JI local emir Sahibzada Haroon Rashid; JUI-F local chief Maulana Abdur Rasheed; Maulana Wahid Gul; Haji Sardar Khan; ANP local chapter president Gul Afzal Khan; Khar tehsil council chairman Haji Said Badshah; PTI leaders Dr Khalilur Rehman and Najibullah Khan Mamund; ANP provincial council member and elder brother of Maulana Khan Zeb Sheikh Janzada; PML-N leader and chief convener of Bajaur Amaan Pasoon Malik Gul Kareem Khan addressed the rally.
They expressed concerns over lawlessness and targeted killing incidents in the district, describing the current law and order situation as the ‘worst’ since the 2008 military operation. They said that the district had witnessed a number of military operations in different names since 2008.
They said that poor law and order not only made life insecure for residents of the district but also disrupted their daily routine.
“The present poor law and order situation and increasing targeted killings are not only creating an environment of fear and insecurity among people but also impacting trade, business and other activities,” they added.
They complained that people of all walks of life of the district had been crying for solid efforts to end lawlessness in the region, but both federal and provincial governments and relevant authorities failed to fulfil their responsibilities of ensuring a peaceful environment for them like rest of the country.
Speakers said that a number of people had been killed in different violence-related incidents over the past several years. However, they alleged that authorities concerned had yet to arrest any culprit. They said that people of Bajaur, once known for peace and beauty before 9/11, were tired of burying their loved ones and wanted an end to lawlessness and targeted killings.
Calling the rally the beginning of their efforts for peace in the district, they said that such peaceful gatherings would continue to pressure government to restore peace in the region. They urged provincial and federal governments to take serious and result-oriented steps to restore peace in the district.
They said people of Bajaur would stage a massive protest demonstration in Islamabad if they didn’t see concrete efforts to end lawlessness in the region. The participants of the rally also condemned the killing of Maulana Khan Zeb and termed his murder a great loss to Bajaur, especially peace narrative.
Calling him the champion and ambassador of peace, they said that his efforts for peace would always be remembered. They said that the rally showed that people from all walks of life were on the same page for restoration peace in the district.
All bazaars, trade and business centres remained closed across the district. Public transport vehicles also remained suspended on Sunday.

Alcaraz’s bid for a third straight title at the All England Club ended with a 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4 loss on Centre Court, leaving him to digest his first Grand Slam final defeat.
“It’s always a bad feeling losing matches. It’s a little bit worse when you lose in a final,” said Alcaraz, who narrowly beat Sinner in a five-set humdinger at the French Open last month.
“I’m just proud about everything I’ve done in the last four weeks on grass at London. I leave Wimbledon, the court, with my head held really high because I did everything that I could.
“I played against someone who played an unbelievable game. So I’m just a little bit sad about losing, but with my head held really high.”
Alcaraz said his rivalry with Sinner was great for the pair and also for tennis, which has had to endure the retirements of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray in recent years with fellow great Novak Djokovic in the twilight of a glorious career.
The young duo have now shared eight of the last nine Grand Slam titles, with each winning four.
“Every time we play each other, I think our level is really high. We don’t see a level like this. I don’t see any player playing against each other, having the level that we’re playing when we face each other,” Alcaraz added.
Extra Attention
“This rivalry, it’s becoming better and better. We’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, finals of Masters and the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better.
“I’m just really grateful for that because it gives me the opportunity to just give my 100 per cent every practice, every day, just to be better. The level that I have to maintain and I have to raise if I want to beat Jannik is really high.”
Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill admitted that while the Italian did not take any of his rivals for granted, he does pay extra attention to Alcaraz.
“Jannik watches more Carlos matches than he does anybody else because he’s fascinated with the improvements that are coming in his game, and he’s pushing us as coaches to make sure that he’s improving as a tennis player,” Cahill said.
Sinner, who ended Alcaraz’s 24-match winning run across all events and 20-match streak at Wimbledon, was most pleased with ending his own run of five successive defeats against the Spaniard.
“When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy,” said Sinner, who narrowed his win-loss record against Alcaraz to 5-8.
“At the same time in the past, I felt I was close. I never pushed myself down. I keep looking up to Carlos because even today I felt like he was doing a couple of things better than I did. So that’s something we’ll work on and prepare ourselves because he’s going to come for us again.
“There’s not only Carlos, but everyone. We have a big target on us so we have to be prepared. Then we’ll see what’s happening in the future.”
Alcaraz said he had no doubt that Sinner would learn from his near 5-1/2-hour loss at Roland Garros, where the Italian squandered three championship points, and hit back.
“I know he’s a really nice player and a huge champion. Champions learn from their losses,” Alcaraz said.
“I knew from the beginning he was going to learn from that final and not make the same mistakes. The way he played today, it was really high.
“I wasn’t surprised at all.”</p><small>2025-07-14 05:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/141017512a7d841.png?r=101801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924120/can-public-sector-take-a-leaf-from-charity-schools-playbook' target='_blank'><strong>Can public sector take a leaf from charity schools’ playbook?</strong></a><br><p>“A mother squabbled with the gatekeeper in a school in Punjab, fighting for admission for her daughter,” narrates the CEO and President of The Citizen Foundation (TCF), Zia Akhtar Abbas. TCF had just taken over a boys-only government school in the boondocks of Punjab, but the mother held her daughter’s hand firmly and argued for a seat.
In Punjab, a Learning and Educational Achievement in Punjab Schools (LEAPS) study asked villagers what they wanted most from the government. The top answer was jobs, but the second, even ahead of clean drinking water and healthcare, was access to a secondary school. “That’s why, whenever we open a school in the most remote areas, we often see a line of people waiting outside,” said Mr Abbas.
Begging contracts
Education is a supply problem in Pakistan, according to the CEO of the world’s largest independently run network of private schools. While there are pockets of society where culture (for girls) or circumstances (in cases of extreme poverty for boys) prevent children from going to school, parents from every class want to see their children go beyond them.
 


The poorest of the poor are families whose children, coated in hazardous golden paint, stand in the midday heat begging for alms. Because of poverty and greed, these children belong to an economic system that profits from a child’s existence. Parents of children who have begging contracts are the most difficult to convince because the meagre earnings of today are more important than the investment of tomorrow.
“But kudos and credit to parents belonging to the indigent households all over Pakistan who are making massive financial and opportunity cost choices to send their kids to school,” says Mr Abbas, acknowledging the bleak reality of Pakistan’s poverty.
‘Out-of-school children equal Australia’s population’
Pakistan has around 75 million children of school-going age, and slightly more than a third — about 25 million — are out of school, a number comparable to the entire population of Australia. Of the remaining roughly 50m who are enrolled, 46m attend non-state schools. This highlights another challenge: widespread distrust in government schools and the quality of education they offer.
Ask your maid or driver and they will tell you that they would rather send their children to a more expensive, bottom-of-the-barrel private school than to a government school. Government schools often have multiple grades crammed into the same room, leaving even the most well intentioned, well-trained teachers at their wits’ end. Entire schools sometimes operate with just two or fewer teachers, turning the task of imparting an education into an exercise in futility.
The value proposition of schools becomes evident in secondary school, where children learn to read and write. However, that is when the pressure of circumstances comes in the form of impossible choices. Do we keep this child in school, or do we get them, especially the boys, to pursue a vocation? “It is very hard to keep boys engaged when they get into grade eight because they know that eventually, they can’t pursue this all the way to university,” says Mr Abbas sadly.
Cost per child
Educating a child at a TCF school costs approximately Rs 4,300 per month, including non-cash expenses such as depreciation. Parents can pay as little as Rs50 per child, based on their means, roughly up to five per cent of their household income, so they have a stake in their child’s education. No child is ever turned away because they can’t pay. Even after these contributions, TCF faces a funding gap of around Rs 3,600–3,700 per child each month.
The cost to the government per child in a state-run school is about 2x to 3x higher than at TCF, partly due to accounting differences and inflated enrollment figures. Official records may list 80 students at a government school, yet only 20 may actually attend.
Offering more jobs than the army, the federal and provincial education sector is the biggest employer in Pakistan. This has resulted in inflated costs and youths who are only marginally employable.
At the heart of the problem is treating school jobs as a means of garnering votes. Poor performance needs to stop having legal cover, he asserts. Instead, power and money need to devolve to the grassroots level and be invested in strong school leadership to utilise government schools in reducing the out-of-school children problem.
‘Walk on water’
TCF is tax-exempt in the UK, Canada, the UAE, the US, and several other European countries and raises about $55 million a year internationally, accounting for around 45pc of total donations.
“For a Pakistani charity to not only gain tax-exempt status but also earn trust and credibility, the standards are exceptionally high — you have to walk on water,” says Mr Abbas. In areas such as governance, transparency, and corporate compliance, there is zero margin for error.
In a country that ranks high in corruption, TCF has remained untouched by scandal despite its significant cash flow from donations; in its 2024 annual report, TCF stated that it had received Rs11.8 billion in donations. How do we ensure that there is no embezzlement?
“If every member of TCF has dard or the pain of each cent being a token of trust from a donor, then you manage the organisation in a very different way,” says Mr Abbas, explaining the culture of ‘owners not donors’ instilled in TCF. If a donor built a school 20 years ago, they still receive a report, even if they’re no longer funding the school.
From day one, the founders created a very clear separation between governance and management to ensure an oversight that kept TCF away from the shadow of corruption. In some cases, they have returned money to donors if they felt that there were strings attached or that they could not justify the promises made, ensuring they are not dependent on any single entity. When USAID pulled out, it was ‘seismic’ for the NGO community in Pakistan, he says, as a cautionary tale of dependence.
Female quotient
About 66pc of TCF’s education budget goes towards teacher compensation, transportation, and training, delivering over 110 hours of professional development each year — double what the public sector can provide.
Tackling the problem of transportation, TCF operates 700-800 vehicles that travel 75,000km daily to transport female teachers and students to and from school. For many, this commute time amounts to one to two and a half hours daily, but it ensures the safety and access necessary for female attendance.
Research shows that for every additional 500 meters a girl has to walk to school, female enrollment drops by 15pc. Unlike boys, girls face far greater safety and cultural barriers, so TCF builds small schools embedded within communities to maintain a 50:50 gender ratio.
TCF is one of the largest private-sector employers of women, as 85pc of its 23,000 employees are female. Female school leaders become powerful figures in their communities, often being the only prominent women in positions of influence amidst a male-dominated local leadership, which in turn affects the culture of the locality.
The success stories
“At every top university in Pakistan that I have attended, whether it’s IBA, GIK, or elsewhere, when I speak to a group of students, afterwards, three or so will often come up to me and say, ‘sir, I’m actually from TCF’,” says the CEO of a network of over 2,000 schools.
One out of every five children attending TCF goes on to university, according to TCF data, and around 61pc are employed. For both boys and girls, the incomes that they earn are many multiples higher than their household incomes when they exit the TCF system.
The mother, at the start of the story, was able to fulfil her desire for her daughter’s education and secure admission to the TCF school. “Once given a chance, these street-smart, resilient, and eager children fully invest in their journey. We’re seeing tremendous success — and so are the donors and parents who believe in them,” says Mr Abbas.</p><small>2025-07-14 05:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/14100441b8a9a02.jpg?r=100948' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923994/syrian-israeli-officials-hold-rare-meeting-in-baku' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian, Israeli officials hold rare meeting in Baku</strong></a><br><p>DAMASCUS: A Syrian and an Israeli official met face to face in Baku on Saturday on the sidelines of a visit to Azerbaijan by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a diplomatic source in Damascus said.
The meeting marked a major step for the two countries which have been foes for decades, and comes after Israel initially cold-shouldered Sharaa’s administration as jihadist because of his past links to Al Qaeda.
“A meeting took place between a Syrian official and an Israeli official on the sidelines of Sharaa’s visit to Baku,” the source said.
Israel is a major arms supplier to Azerbaijan and has a significant diplomatic presence in the Caucasus nation which neighbours its arch foe Iran. Sharaa himself did not take part in the meeting, which focused on “the recent Israeli military presence in Syria,” the source added.
After the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria to prevent key military assets falling into the hands of the interim administration headed by Sharaa.
It also sent troops into the UN-patrolled buffer zone that used to separate the opposing forces in the strategic Golan Heights, from which it has conducted forays deeper into southern Syria.
Sharaa has said repeatedly that Syria does not seek conflict with its neighbours, and has instead asked the international community to put pressure on Israel to halt its attacks.
His government recently confirmed that it had held indirect contacts with Israel seeking a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement which created the buffer zone. Late last month, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was interested in striking a peace and normalisation agreement with Syria.
A Syria government source quoted by state media responded that such talk was  “premature”. But during a visit to Lebanon this week, US special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said:  “The dialogue has started between Syria and Israel”.
After meeting Sharaa in Riyadh in May, US President Donald Trump told reporters he had expressed hope that Syria would join other Arab states which normalised their relations with Israel. “(Sharaa) said yes. But they have a lot of work to do,” Trump said.
During his visit to Baku, Sharaa held talks with his counterpart Ilham Aliyev, the two governments said. Azerbaijan announced it would begin exporting gas to Syria via Turkiye, a key ally of both governments, a statement from the Azerbaijani presidency said.

Australia prioritises its sovereignty and  “we don’t discuss hypotheticals”, Conroy said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “The decision to commit Australian troops to a conflict will be made by the government of the day, not in advance but by the government of the day,” he said.
The Financial Times reported on Saturday that Elbridge Colby, the US under-secretary of defence for policy, has been pressing Australian and Japanese officials on what they would do in a Taiwan conflict, although the US does not offer a blank cheque guarantee to defend Taiwan.
Colby posted on X that the Department of Defence is implementing President Donald Trump’s  “America First” agenda of restoring deterrence, which includes  “urging allies to step up their defence spending and other efforts related to our collective defence”.
China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te rejects China’s sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan’s people can decide their future.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking in Shanghai at the start of a six-day visit to China that is likely to focus on security and trade, said Canberra did not want any change to the status quo on Taiwan.
Conroy said Australia was concerned about China’s military buildup of nuclear and conventional forces, and wants a balanced Indo-Pacific region where no country dominates. He said China was seeking a military base in the Pacific, which was not in Australia’s interest.
Goal is no war
Talisman Sabre, Australia’s largest war-fighting exercise with the United States, opened on Sunday on Sydney Harbour and will involve 40,000 troops from 19 countries, including Japan, South Korea, India, Britain, France and Canada.
Conroy said China’s navy might be watching the exercise to collect information, as it had done in the past.
The war games will span thousands of kilometres from Australia’s Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island to the Coral Sea on Australia’s east coast, in a rehearsal of joint war fighting, said Vice Admiral Justin Jones, chief of joint operations for the Australian Defence Force.
The air, sea, land and space exercises over two weeks will  “test our ability to move our forces into the north of Australia and operate from Australia,” Jones told reporters.
“I will leave it to China to interpret what 19 friends, allies and partners wanting to operate together in the region means to them. But for me… it is nations that are in search of a common aspiration for peace, stability, a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said.

• Parallel drawn between Dogra regime and Modi govt actions
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s top leadership on Sunday reaffirmed the country’s unwavering support for the Kashmiri’s people right to self-determination and their resistance against oppression, marking Kashmir Martyrs’ Day with renewed pledges of political, diplomatic and moral backing.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, paid tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of Kashmiris in their decades long struggle against Indian rule.
Both leaders vowed that Pakistan will continue to support Kashmir cause until the region achieve self-governance in accordance with UN resolutions.
President Zardari commended Kashmiris for their “steadfast bravery and sacrifices” against Indian control and called upon international bodies and human rights groups to address the alleged state terrorism and rights violations in the occupied region.
PM Shehbaz echoed these sentiment, emphasising the “ongoing sacrifices made by Kashmiris in their fight for self-determination”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to supporting their cause “politically, ethically, and diplomatically”.
Naqvi condemns ‘oppression’
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the 22 Kashmiri martyrs of July 13, 1931, who, he said, “faced bullets with courage and dignity in reverence of the call to prayer (Azaan).”
He described the day as “harbringer of free conscience against a system that sought to silence the oppressed”, drawing parallel between the Dogra regime and the current violence of Modi’s government.
He accused the Modi government of “oppressive actions against Kashmiris,” including “the genocide of Kashmiri youth, extrajudicial killings, and silencing of journalists”.
Naqvi also referenced former US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate on Kashmir, saying, “US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate opened a door to peace, but India closed this door, proving its warlike mindset through its rejection of dialogue.”
AJK PM’s warning
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar-ul-Haq, in an interview with a local news channel, said the sacrifice of the martyrs “formed the bedrock of the Kashmiri freedom movement, a fight that will endure.”
He urged the international community to recognise the Kashmiris’ “legitimate right to self-determination” and called for renewed efforts to resolve the conflict through peaceful dialogue.
Anwar-ul-Haq warned that “India’s brutality shows no signs of abating,” and cautioned that continued aggression would “only harden the resolve of Kashmiris, escalate their struggle for freedom, and provoke a fierce and uncompromising response from Pakistan’s armed forces”.
He also accused India of fuelling unrest in Balochistan, calling for international accountability.

Mr Urubko, with his wife Maria Cardell, arrived at base camp on Saturday and scaled the killer mountain without using supplementary oxygen.
Karim Shah Nizari, a friend of the climbers, told Dawn that the duo successfully opened a new route via Diamir Face on Nanga Parbat. According to the Russian media, they scaled the mountain fast and light and returned safely to the base camp after the summit.
With this achievement, Mr Uru­bko has made 28 ascents of the eight-thousanders, with seven new routes opened and two first winter ascents, including Makalu in 2009 and Gash­erbrum II in 2011. He has also scaled all 14 highest mountains in the world without using supplementary oxygen.
Nanga Parbat is more southern and western than Pakistan’s four other eight-thousanders peaks, including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I, and Gasherbrum II. Nanga Parbat, also known as the killer mountain, is situated in the Himalayas. During the ongoing season, at least 24 climbers, including five Pakistani nationals, have summited the peak.
Injured Polish climber
Meanwhile, a rescue team brought  to Camp 1 an injured Polish climber who sustained a leg injury on Broad Peak on Sunday.
Waldemar Kowalewski suffered a fracture above Camp II on Saturday when a snow avalanche hit the trio during their rotation.As a result of the incident, Mr Kowalewski suffered a leg fracture at an altitude of 6,500 metres, while his two colleagues Jarek and Hassan surviving without any injuries. After the accident, a rescue team was dispatched to bring the Polish climber down to the base camp.
According to Karrar Haidri, the vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the injured mountaineer had been brought down to Camp 1 on Sunday and the rescuers were assessing the safest option for further descent. According to organisers, Pakistan Army helicopters will airlift the Polish climber from the Broad Peak base camp to Skardu today (Monday).

• No international party participated in bidding
ISLAMABAD: The government’s ambitious plan to auction old and defunct public sector generation plants under Genco Holding Company Limited (GHCL) — aimed at curtailing operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure — is in serious trouble, compelling authorities to consider handing over the scrap to Wah Industries of the Ministry of Defence.
Sources said the first round of auction, which appeared to be a success on the sale counter, could not generate any proceeds so far in almost four months amid management’s inability to secure binding contracts while the second round failed to take off even on the scheduled bidding date.
“Frustrated by repeated failures and lack of credible bids in subsequent auctions, the Energy Task Force led by Lt Gen Zafar Iqbal decided earlier this month to make a major policy shift and hand over all remaining power plants to Wah Industries through a government-to-government (G2G) arrangement by the end of the current month”, said the sources.
Last year, the government had decided to close down old, redundant and defunct public-sector Genco plants and auction their obsolete machinery and equipment (excluding land) via an open international bidding process.
The Task Force on Energy Reforms that was holding separate negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) gave the GHCL management three-month target for the auction and close of transaction. On March 18, the first phase of nine old power plants was put up for auction through open bidding. Only seven plants received qualified bids amounting Rs9.05bn against a reserve price of Rs8.07bn.
However, no international bidder participated in the bidding process. As per the contract requirements, the bid money was must to be paid either 100pc in advance or through four installments within three months.
Among the seven awarded plants, six contracts were bagged by M/S Daraza Builders while the contract for the 20MW Multan Cantt plant was awarded to M/S Malik Bashir Traders.
At the 147MW Kotri Power Plant, Genco-I or JPCL signed a contract worth Rs1.88bn with M/S Daraza, which deposited the required 10pc performance guarantee but no further payment has been received to date. Surprisingly, Genco-1 top management did not issue any delay notices or invoke interest penalties — despite clear contractual clauses.
Genco-II (CPGCL) returned a bid security of over Rs96m to M/S Daraza for the 50MW Sukkur Plant without contract finalisation.
At the 57.2 MW Quetta Power Plant, a second-phase bid of Rs601m was submitted by Perfect Tel Company. Payment delays continue, allegedly with the tacit support of Genco-II (CPGCL) and GHCL top brass.
Procedural lapses have also been reported in Genco-III (NPGCL) whose management is internally under scrutiny for delaying contracts of key plants. For example, contract for TPS Multan Cantt plant (20MW) was signed in June 2025 with M/S Malik Bashir Traders — three months after the auction, raising concerns over NPGCL’s intent.
Contracts for NGPS Multan (260MW) and GTPS Shahdara (85MW), both awarded to M/S Daraza, are only now being signed — with delays of over 3.5 months. Contract for GTPS Faisalabad (247 MW) remains unsigned amid speculations of interest-based gains.
Meanwhile, LPGCL (Genco-IV) signed a Rs2.133bn contract with M/S Daraza for the Lakhra Power Plant in May 2025. Although the first installment was paid, the second was delayed by 18 days.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday threw months of painstaking negotiations into disarray by announcing that he would hammer the 27-nation bloc with the sweeping tariffs if no agreement is reached by Aug 1.
“The United States has sent us a letter with measures that would come into effect unless there is a negotiated solution, so we will therefore also extend the suspension of our countermeasures until early August,” von der Leyen told journalists.
“At the same time, we will continue to prepare for the countermeasures so we’re fully prepared,” she added.
The move by von der Leyen will spur hope that Trump’s latest threat — in which he also targeted Mexico — has not killed off the progress made in negotiations so far between Brussels and Washington.

27-nation bloc also announces ‘political agreement’ with Indonesia on trade deal

Brussels has readied duties on US goods worth around 21 billion euros ($24 billion) in response to the levies Trump slapped on metal imports earlier this year.
But it announced in April it was holding off on those measures to give space to find a broader trade agreement with the Trump administration.
‘Hand remains outstretched’
EU trade ministers are set to meet on Monday in Brussels to discuss the bloc’s response to Trump’s latest move — and crucially, how strong a line to take with Washington.
Germany’s finance minister Lars Klingbeil said on Sunday that “serious and solution-oriented negotiations” with the US were still necessary, but added that if they fail, the European Union would need “decisive countermeasures to protect jobs and businesses in Europe”.
“Our hand remains outstretched, but we won’t accept just anything,” Klingbeil told the daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has unleashed sweeping stop-start tariffs on allies and competitors alike, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a global economic downturn.
But his administration is coming under pressure to secure deals with trading partners after promising a flurry of agreements.
So far, US officials have only unveiled two pacts, with Britain and Vietnam, alongside temporarily lower tit-for-tat duties with China.
EU-Indonesia ‘political agreement’
Meanwhile, the European Commission president and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday announced a “political agreement” to conclude a long-awaited free trade deal.
“We’re living in turbulent times, and when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together. So today we’re taking a big step forward in this partnership,” von der Leyen told journalists in Brussels.
“I am very pleased to report that we have just reached a political agreement on an ambitious Free Trade Agreement,” she said.
A European Commission statement called Sunday’s agreement a “decisive milestone” towards striking the deal — which is to be concluded in September by EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic and Indonesia’s chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto.
“There’s a lot of untapped potential in our trade relationship. And therefore, this agreement comes at the right time, because the new agreement will open new markets,” von der Leyen said.
Prabowo called the announcement in Brussels a “breakthrough”.

LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), one of the country’s largest state-owned entities with a portfolio of almost $70 billion, has found itself mired in red tape in the absence of key decision-making officials.
The failure to fill two vacant slots on its governing body despite the passage of nine months, has hampered its operations.
This bureaucratic paralysis is particularly worrisome, given that Wapda is currently tasked with executing three of the biggest hydroelectric projects in the country’s history — the dams at Diamer-Bhasha, Dasu and Mohmand.
In addition, the authority effectively serves as the operative wing of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), which distributes water among federating units and ensure national irrigation supplies.
Ironically, Irsa too is embroiled in litigation over the composition of its board, with the appointment of a permanent member from Sindh being the focus of the dispute.
The Wapda Act envisions a governing body, comprising three permanent members — for water, power and finance — and a regular chairman heading the authority, which looks after hundreds of billions of rupees allocations every year.
Currently, the body is without permanent members for water and power, and their functions are being “looked after” by two senior officials — Syed Ali Akhtar Shah and Muhammad Arfan, respectively.
The former previously served as General Manager Water (South), while the latter is also the CEO of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Company.
‘Look after’ charge
By its very definition, ‘look after’ charge implies that the current holder of the post cannot take “financial and administrative decisions” of any consequence — much like a caretaker government.
In June, when former chairman retired Lt-Gen Sajjad Ghani stepped down, the sole permanent member, Naveed Asghar Chaudhry, was given additional charge of that role too. Mr Chaudhry’s original designation is member for finance, and he is a permanent appointee on that post.
This means that, effectively, the four-member board is currently operating with one permanent officer and two who have been given ‘additional charge’.
Mr Chaudhry also served as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022, after retired Lt-Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then passed the role to Lt-Gen Ghani three months later.
According to a former director general of human resources at Wapda, “This is administrative chaos with a huge national cost”. For instance, the authority at present cannot meet even its quorum requirements – a legal necessity for taking any decision.
For quorum to be complete, the chairman and at least one regular member are required to be present, but these posts are currently held by the same person.
In such a situation, any decision taken by the board can potentially attract audit objections or legal challenges.
Blame game
Dawn made several attempts to contact Muhammad Moeen Wattoo, the incumbent federal minister for water resources, over the course of two weeks.
However, both the minister and his spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the composition of Wapda’s governing body.
But insiders told Dawn that the tenure of the two members for water and power expired in November last year.
Sources claimed the ministry was also informed of this in advance, and an advertisement to fill both posts was sent to the ministry for approval in October 2024. However, the ministry has not advertised the posts, nor allowed Wapda to do so, they said.
The outgoing members, meanwhile, were reportedly instructed to remain in their posts. This arrangement continued till March 13, 2025, when they eventually relinquished their posts on verbal instructions from on-high, after the ministry inquired about the expiry of their tenures. After that, the authority gave ‘look after’ charge of the two vacant posts to two senior officers.
Wapda sources claimed they kept pressing the ministry for the appointments, but to no avail. It was in the midst of this confusion that the previous chairman abruptly quit on June 20.
Following his exit, the ministry handed his responsibilities to the only surviving permanent member (finance) of the authority.
The ministry, however, shifted the blame for blocked appointments onto the PM’s Office. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the water resources ministry told Dawn that selection boards were named to hire these officers and sent the PMO, but there had been no response.
The ministry was subsequently told that the names of the selection board members had been sent for “vetting” and the process is still ongoing.

• Boat ‘Handala’ with 15 activists on board carrying medical and food  supplies
• No breakthrough in talks for temporary ceasefire
SICILY/GAZA: A Gaza-bound boat carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid left Sicily on Sunday, over a month after Israel detained and deported people aboard a previous vessel, as Israel struck 150 times across Gaza in the past 24 hours, killing more than 40 Palestinians, most of them civilians, amid a deadlock in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.
The Handala boat, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, left the port of Syracuse shortly after 12pm carrying about 15 activists.
Several dozen people, some holding Palestinian flags and others wearing keffiyeh scarves, gathered at the port to cheer the boat’s departure with slogans of “Free Palestine”.
 






The former Norwegian trawler — loaded with medical supplies, food, children’s equipment and medicine — will sail for about a week in the Mediterranean, covering roughly 1,800 kilometres (1,120 miles), in the hope of reaching Gaza’s coast.
The boat will make a stop at Gallipoli, in southeastern Italy, where two members of the hard-left France Unbowed party (LFI) are expected to join.
The initiative comes six weeks after the departure of the Madleen, another ship that left Italy for Gaza transporting aid and activists, including Greta Thunberg.
Israel authorities intercepted the Madleen about 185 kilometres west of Gaza’s coast.
“This is a mission for the children in Gaza, to break the humanitarian blockade and to break the summer silence on the genocide,” said Gabrielle Cathala, one of the two France Unbowed party members set to board the boat on July 18.
“I hope we will reach Gaza but if not, it will be yet another violation of international law” by Israel, she added.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes on Sunday killed more than 40 Palestinians, most of them women and children, including at a market and a water distribution point, as talks for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stalled.
Delegations from Israel and the Palestinian group have now spent a week trying to agree on a temporary truce to halt 21 months of devastating fighting in the Gaza Strip.
But on Saturday, each side accused the other of blocking attempts to secure an agreement at the indirect talks in the Qatari capital, Doha.
On the ground, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said at least 43 people were killed in the latest Israeli strikes, including 11 when a market in Gaza City was hit.
Elsewhere, eight children were among the 10 victims of a drone
strike at a water point in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, Bassal said.
Khaled Rayyan told journalists he was woken by the sound of two large explosions after a house was hit in Nuseirat.
“Our neighbour and his children were under the rubble,” he said.
150 targets in a day
The Israeli military said in a statement its air force struck 150 times across Gaza in the past 24 hours. It released aerial footage of what it said were fighter jet strikes attacking what it claimed Hamas targets around Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, showing explosions on the ground and thick smoke in the sky.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing many areas mean journalists are unable to independently verify tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency and other parties.
Talks to seal a 60-day ceasefire and Israeli prisoner release were in the balance on Saturday, as Israel and Hamas accused each other of trying to block a deal.
Hamas wants complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, but Israel had presented plans to maintain troops in more than 40 per cent of the territory.
A Palestinian source said Israel wanted to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into the south of Gaza in preparation for forcibly displacing them to Egypt or other countries.
Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 57,882 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in Israel attacks. The UN considers the figures reliable.

• KP CM claims party will decide after three months ‘whether to continue with politics’
• Days after founder eschewed talks, Gandapur claims Imran ready to sit with powers that be
LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by PTI founder Imran Khan, which is expected to climax on Aug 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment.
At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’.
Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of  Imran Khan and his spouse, CM Gandapur said that the 90-day countdown had already begun.
However, the mixed messages left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether.
At the press conference, the KP CM appeared to surprise even his party colleagues when he said, “The protest campaign had started last night and would reach its crescendo in 90 days for a final showdown”.
The KP CM did not mention any date, but when quizzed by reporters, he reiterated the party’s position that the protest campaign would be taken to its peak by Aug 5 using political means.
“We have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country… if [political means] do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward,” he said, adding that he had given himself three months to prepare for the protest.
“We will either do or die,” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”.
Dissent from Aliya
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik was conspicuous by her absence from the presser. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, Ms Malik questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.
“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”
“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Mr Raja.
Some PTI workers also said that it appeared as if the party had let them off the hook for the Aug 5 protest. Some voices also questioned why the party leadership had yet to announce a proper plan for the movement, given that Aug 5 was just a few weeks away, and wondered whether this meant the protest plan had been postponed.
‘Door open for talks’
Even though the idea of dialogue was shunned in a tweet from Imran Khan’s official X account last week, the KP chief minister, apparently on behalf of the former premier, once again offered the military establishment to engage in dialogue with the party.
“Now we are giving an open offer (to the establishment) to hold dialogue with us or we will get to ‘tread on our own path’ with clear timeline and targets”.
He also criticised the powers that be for indulging in politics. Reiterating that the establishment had hijacked the system, the KP CM said the PTI would hold dialogue with the powers that be and went on to add that “they can let the (puppet) politicians sit beside them”.
“We no longer want to waste time talking to the ruling politicians, who carry no power to make a decision,” he added.
While the PTI has consistently been demanding talks with the establishment, these overtures have not received a positive response from the concerned quarters thus far.
The KP CM also blamed state institutions for a spike in terrorism in Balochistan and KP.
“When it is asked about making and breaking governments, it simply says the institution is apolitical,” he quipped, while asking the establishment to accept its mistakes and rectify them. He said the army was earning a ‘bad reputation’, and asked where it wanted to take the country.

Amid reports of a possible change of PTI-led government in KP, a PML-N source told Dawn that Mr Kundi has planned a meeting of opposition leaders at Governor House soon.
The Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) has opposed any change of provincial government through a presidential order, Governor’s Rule, but did not rule out a constitutional and parliamentary way like a ‘no-confidence motion’, JUI-F leader Maulana Ghafoor Haideri said on Sunday.
The source said Gover­nor Kundi and Amir Muqam discussed the possible change in KP as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a committee to seek the support of oppo­sition leaders in the province to achieve the goal.
 
 

Meanwhile, Mr Kundi visited the residence of former PTI leader and incumbent adviser to the PM Pervez Khattak to condole the death of his sister.
A few days ago, the governor also met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Mr Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently, followed by the issuance of a press release stating that the PM tasked Mr Kundi with starting a campaign to form a new government in KP and hold consultations with opposition members of the provincial assembly. Both Mr Kundi and Mr Muqam had been tasked with meeting JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultations.
Last week, Opposition Leader in the Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Assembly Dr Ibadullah visited Governor Kundi. The meeting, which was also attended by PPP’s KP chapter president Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha, discussed overall political situation in the province.
Media reports said that Dr Ibad had briefed the governor on the ongoing coordination and mutual engagement among members of the opposition parties.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the recent outreach by independent members of the provincial assembly and discussed the upcoming Senate elections.

The two sides met for more than two hours on the weekend. The meeting, chaired by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan,  was also attended by Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.
The meeting was a follow-up to Friday’s huddle, where both sides agreed to resolve issues through talks after days of acrimony and recriminations.
The PTI lawmakers were suspended for 15 sittings after their protest during the speech of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on June 27.
In addition, 10 members of the provincial assembly were fined Rs200,000 each for “damaging public property”, while disqualification references were also filed against them.
A number of treasury members had also moved for their opposition colleagues’ disqualification. It was these applications which were the subject of Sunday’s discussions.
‘Not a deadlock’
Speaking to the media after Sunday’s meeting, Mr Bhachar acknowledged the talks had not been fruitful so far.
He clarified that neither side had apologised for any verbal altercations, noting that “insults came from both sides.”
He emphasised that more meetings will take place and “no agreement has been reached on any point,” particularly concerning the Rules of Procedure of the House.
“A deadlock means walking away. Until there is no agreement, discussions will continue,” he stated.
He confirmed that discussions on the fines and suspension of the 26 members would also continue.
The PTI leader also talked about the persisting concerns of his party, including legal cases against opposition members and the imprisonment of Imran Khan, which “will not end immediately”.
He said PTI will move forward after consulting with the parliamentary party.
The meeting came a day after PTI’s top leadership, including Khyber Pakh–tunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, arrived in Lahore to support the penalised lawmakers.
Mutual respect
PML-N leader Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman said the two-and-a-half-hour-long talks had been “good”, but nothing was finalised yet.
Mr Rehman, who’s also Punjab’s finance minister, emphasised the importance of upholding the assembly’s dignity.
“There is much to discuss with the opposition,” Mr Rehman said, adding the people of Punjab were watching these negotiations.
He acknowledged public pressure from constituencies to end “hooliganism, verbal abuse,  and violent culture” within the assembly.
He indicated that PTI would consult with its parliamentary party, and the government would also hold consultations before the two sides reconvene for future talks.
“Our goal is not to de-seat anyone,” he said, adding negotiations among elected representatives “should lead to a point of agreement”.
He revealed that four or five agenda points were discussed and agreed upon during Sunday’s meeting.
Regarding the reference against the suspended members, Mr Rehman said the speaker had sent the reference as per articles 62 and 63.
He compared the speaker’s move to the reference against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif under Articles 62 and 63, which led to the loss of his premiership.
He also mentioned a harassment complaint received by the speaker, clarifying the current discussions were about assembly rules and not a compromise.
He hoped the situation inside the assembly matters would soon improve.
“The assembly rules and law stipulate how punishment and reward are meted out,” he said, adding both opposition and government should play a role in running the House smoothly.
Bilal Yasin, another PML-N lawmaker, also addressed the media.
He said PML-N leaders have trained party workers to engage in political dialogue with politicians.
Mr Yasin said CM Maryam also wants things to “move forward”.
However, he added that being CM Maryam, should be treated with respect whenever she entered the assembly.
Similar respect was also “obligatory” for the opposition leader.
He said protest was a democratic right, but agitations should be “within some limits”.

These commissions — focusing on constitutional, electoral, judicial, administrative, and anti-corruption reforms — have submitted their reports. Now, the task of building political consensus on their recommendations rests with the seven-member National Consensus Commission, which began its work on Feb 15 under the leadership of the chief adviser. The commission’s mandate is to facilitate dialogue and agreement among political parties on proposals that could fundamentally reshape the nation’s governance framework.
One of the more contentious issues to have surfaced in recent discussions is whether Bangladesh should adopt a proportional representation (PR) system for future parliamentary elections. Political parties are divided. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has publicly supported the idea and submitted proposals to that effect. Other parties have expressed similar interest, viewing PR as a route to more inclusive governance. But the BNP has strongly opposed it. 
Interestingly, despite the divide over PR, there is reported convergence on other structural reforms, such as the establishment of a bicameral legislature with a 100-member upper house and the assignment of the deputy speaker’s role to the opposition.
To assess the feasibility of PR, one must return to the constitution. Article 65(2) provides that members of parliament shall be elected from single-member territorial constituencies by direct election. This enshrines the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model as the basis of Bangladesh’s electoral process. Any move to introduce PR for the lower house would require a constitutional amendment under Article 142, which demands a two-thirds majority vote in parliament — a hurdle that is currently insurmountable in the absence of an elected legislature.

PR systems allow for greater representation of women, religious minorities and other under-represented groups

Furthermore, the reform commissions themselves have not advocated for PR in the lower house, provided that the bicameral parliamentary model is implemented. The Constitution Reform Commission has proposed retaining the direct election model for the lower house while suggesting that the proposed upper house could be constituted through a proportional representation system (pages 51-52 of its report).
Meanwhile, the Electoral Reform Commission, despite extensive consultations, refrained from making any recommendation on this issue, citing sharp political disagreement (pages 84-87 of its report). The Electoral Reform Commission recognised that any change in the method of election would require a consensus that simply does not exist at this stage.
The absence of any recommendation in favour of PR for the lower house has legal and procedural consequences. The mandate of the National Consensus Commission is confined to building agreement on the proposals previously submitted by the major reform commissions, as it was established specifically to foster consensus around those earlier reform recommendations. Since the relevant commissions have not proposed PR for the lower house, this issue technically falls outside the scope of the current dialogue. More importantly, the Constitution Reform Commission has in fact proposed preserving the existing direct electoral system for the Jatiya Sangsad. It would therefore be institutionally inconsistent and procedurally misplaced for the National Consensus Commission to entertain a proposal that contradicts the reform roadmap already submitted.
This, however, does not mean that the conversation about PR is unwarranted. As a theoretical model, PR has several merits. It promises to reduce the distortions produced by FPTP, under which a party can win an overwhelming majority of seats with a far smaller share of the popular vote. It offers a more inclusive framework, potentially giving smaller and emerging parties a fair chance at representation. It can encourage coalition politics, reduce political alienation, and better reflect the diversity of public opinion. In principle, PR systems also allow for greater representation of women, religious minorities, and other underrepresented groups. Unlike the existing system, which reserves seats for women through indirect party nominations, a well-designed PR system could enable women to be elected directly from party lists. 
Many countries that have adopted PR, such as Sweden, Nepal and South Africa, have seen marked improvements in the descriptive and substantive representation of marginalised groups. Yet any electoral system must be judged not in isolation but within the context in which it is to operate. Bangladesh’s political culture is highly polarised. Its democratic institutions remain fragile. Electoral processes have been repeatedly marred by violence, boycotts, and allegations of irregularities. In this context, PR might introduce new complexities rather than resolve existing ones. Far from encouraging stable coalition governments, it could lead to fragmented parliaments filled with single-issue or regionally entrenched parties, making coherent governance difficult.
Another concern is institutional capacity. Implementing PR would require significant administrative reform, voter education, and legislative clarity. Public understanding of how votes translate into seats would need to be built through large-scale civic education programmes. Without careful preparation, the transition could create confusion and mistrust, further damaging an already strained electoral system.
Even among civil society, support for a blanket introduction of PR in the lower house is limited. Recently, 60 eminent citizens publicly called for a PR-based upper house to enhance inclusion and accountability. However, they were cautious about replicating that model for the lower house, fearing legislative gridlock and excessive fragmentation. Their view aligns with the Constitution Reform Commission’s recommendation: preserve direct elections in the lower house but use PR for the proposed upper chamber to ensure a balance between local representation and proportional fairness.
That, perhaps, offers a way forward. Bangladesh could consider a mixed electoral system in the future, combining FPTP and PR models. Such systems are used successfully in countries like Germany and New Zealand, where some parliamentary seats are filled by direct constituency vote and others by party list based on national vote share. Alternatively, Bangladesh could introduce PR incrementally, first at the local government level or in a newly created upper house, allowing for institutional adaptation and political learning.
For now, however, the road to a PR system in parliamentary elections remains closed— legally, politically, and procedurally. The current constitution does not allow it. The reform commissions have not endorsed it. The political consensus required to amend the constitution is absent. And the mandate of the National Consensus Commission technically does not extend to issues beyond the submitted reform proposals.

The intelligence agency said in a statement that the operation had sought the arrest of the agents of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), who it believes were behind the killing of SBU colonel Ivan Voronych in Kyiv on Thursday.
“This morning a special operation was conducted, during which the members of the Russian FSB’s agent cell started to resist, and therefore they were liquidated,” the statement on the Telegram messaging app said.
Russian authorities made no immediate public comment on Sunday’s operation, which mirrored past assassinations of senior Russian military officials by Ukraine during the three-year-old war — a source of embarrassment for Moscow’s vast intelligence agencies. The SBU said two people — a man and a woman — were suspected of having killed Voronych. It did not say how many suspected FSB agents had been killed on Sunday.
According to the SBU, the alleged assassins were told by their handler to surveil their target and track his movements. They were eventually given the coordinates of a hiding place where they found a pistol with a suppressor, the SBU said.
It said they had tried to  “lay low” after Thursday’s killing, but were tracked down by the SBU and police.
The agency’s remit covers security and counterintelligence, but since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine it has also played a prominent role in special operations against Moscow, including assassinations and sabotage attacks.

Of 24 sewage samples tested, 13 were negative while 11 were positive for poliovirus, an official of the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the NIH said. 
The progress, especially in high-risk areas, was hailed as a sign of successful eradication efforts. 
“Environmental Surveillance (ES) results continue to reflect encouraging progress, particularly in high-risk regions.” the official said. 
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), positivity rates have declined from 14 positive ES sites in January to seven in June 2025. 
Of these seven positive sites in June, four are from south KP. Notably, all six sites in Peshawar tested negative for the first time in over two years.” 
Similar progress was reported across other provinces. 
“Balochistan also reported a marked reduction, with only four positive ES sites in June, down from 19 in January. In the Quetta Block, six out of seven samples tested negative,” the official said. 
“In Punjab, the number of districts with positive detections decreased from seven in January to five in June. In Sindh, the number of positive ES sites has also declined compared to previous months.” 
Officials attributed the declining numbers to intensified surveillance and immunisation campaigns. 
“Thanks to high-quality campaigns with rigorous vaccination schedule, polio cases and positive environmental samples nationwide have declined,” the official said. 
To build on this momentum, several targeted immunisation drives are scheduled. 
A special campaign will run from July 14 to 18 in Diamer and three districts of KP, targeting 158,497 children. A similar drive in Rawalpindi and Islamabad next week aims to immunise 161,422 children. 
A cross-border effort with Afghanistan will take place from July 21 to 25, targeting 378,122 children in bordering union councils to synchronise with Afghanis­tan’s sub-national polio campaign. 
Also, a campaign using a combination of fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine and oral poliovirus vaccine will be conducted in seven districts of Baloc­histan from Aug 4 to 11, aiming to vaccinate approximately 600,000 children.

The Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2024, also known as the Constitutional Package, is legislation that takes away the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
 
 

The party last October decided to take legal action against its lawmakers, who had voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment in violation of the party’s policy.
Expulsion notices — dated July 12 and available with Dawn.com — were issued to MNAs Aurangzeb Khan Khichi (NA-159, Vehari IV), Muhammad Ilyas Choudhry (NA-62, Gujrat I), Usman Ali (NA-142, Sahiwal II), Mubarak Zeb Khan (NA-8, Bajaur), and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146, Khanewal III).
“[During] the PTI … parliamentary party meeting held on September 2, 2024 [in] Islamabad, … it was unanimously resolved that [the] PTI parliamentary party will not support the proposed amendments [to] the Constitution and will oppose the bill when it is moved in the National Assembly or is put to voting at any stage,” the notice read.
“You voted in favour of the bill and, therefore, you violated the directions and instructions of the PTI parliamentary party [that] were binding on you as a parliamentarian especially when you had won the election with support of [the] PTI and had taken oath that you would follow instructions of [the] PTI and that you would stand loyal to the party.”
The document recalled that show-cause notices were issued to the five MNAs in November to prove that they had not “defected” from the party, but they did not respond. Moreover, personal hearings were held for the MNAs, but they did not offer any explanation or defence, the notice read.
Two of the notices, addressed to Khichi and Mubarak Zeb, noted that they had defected and joined the PML-N. The remaining three notices took note of the fact that the recipients were sitting on treasury benches and “attended meetings of that [ruling] party”.
“Thus, you having voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2024, have violated the party’s instructions and directions which were binding on you,” the notice read.
“Therefore, you are hereby declared to have violated your commitment, oath and loyalty to the party. You have acted contrary to the instructions of the party … and joined another parliamentary party in the National Assembly. You are therefore expelled from the party (PTI) forthwith. Needless to add that you also stand disqualified on account of aforesaid conduct.”

Pakis­tan had secured a three-year aid package deal in July 2024. The programme, approved by the IMF two months later, is set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici noted that the country’s performance under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) had been “strong so far”, according to a press release issued by the SDPI on its guest lecture in Islamabad.
Binici termed the EFF’s successful first review — also encompassing agreement on the federal budget blueprint — by the IMF Executive Board in May as a key milestone.
 
 

“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici was quoted as saying.
He stressed that structural reforms remained central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen tax equity, improve the business climate and encourage private-sector-led investment.
Addressing economists, researchers and policy experts, the SDPI statement said, Banici reaffirmed the Fund’s continued support for the country’s economic and climate reform agenda.
In March, Pakistan unlocked a new $1.3 billion arrangement with the IMF under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation.
Binici noted that the RSF was designed to help countries like Pakistan bolster resilience to climate-related vulnerabilities and meet international climate commitments, the SDPI press release said.
 
 

The IMF official mentioned that the key areas of reform under the RSF included enhancing public investment planning, promoting efficient and sustainable use of water resources, improving institutional coordination for disaster preparedness and financing, along with expanding the availability and transparency of climate-related data.
Binici stressed that “support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory”.
The IMF official also shed light on the evolving economic landscape across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region and Pakistan. He stated that growth across the Mena region, as well as in Pakistan, was expected to strengthen in 2025 and beyond.
However, he cautioned that “elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continue to generate exceptional uncertainty and weigh on the global economic outlook”, underscoring the urgent need for prudent and forward-looking policy actions.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri welcomed the IMF representative’s outreach, noting the importance of informed economic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in Pakistan’s journey toward sustainable development.
The lecture concluded with an interactive discussion on fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, external buffers and the role of international institutions in fostering inclusive growth, the statement added.
 
 

The IMF had also praised Pakistan’s implementation of the $7bn EFF as strong in March after both concluded the programme’s first biannual review on a positive note.
In May, an official said the IMF Executive Board found that Pakistan had “met all of the targets” under the package and made progress on some of the reforms.</p><small>2025-07-13 12:04</small></div><hr>
