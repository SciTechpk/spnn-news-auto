<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/102030001b419a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960333/australia-begins-enforcing-world-first-teen-social-media-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Australia begins enforcing world-first teen social media ban</strong></a><br><p>Australia on Wednesday became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticised by major technology companies and free-speech advocates.
Starting at midnight (1300 GMT on Tuesday), 10 of the largest platforms including TikTok, Alphabet’s YouTube and Meta’s Instagram and Facebook were ordered to block children or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($33 million) under the new law, which is being closely watched by regulators worldwide.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it “a proud day” for families and cast the law as proof that policymakers can curb online harms that have outpaced traditional safeguards.
“This will make an enormous difference. It is one of the biggest social and cultural changes that our nation has faced,” Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday.
“It’s a profound reform which will continue to reverberate around the world.”

In a video message, Albanese urged children to “start a new sport, new instrument, or read that book that has been sitting there for some time on your shelf,” ahead of Australia’s summer school break starting later this month.
Some of those below the cut-off age of 16 were anxious about adjusting to life without social media, but others were less concerned.
“I’m not really that emotional about it,” said 14-year-old Claire Ni. “I’m kind of just, like, neutral.” Luna Dizon, 15, said she still had access to her TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat accounts, but worried about “culture shock” once the ban took full effect.
“I think eventually, without (social media), we’ll learn how to adapt to it,” she added.

While the government has said the ban would not be perfect in its operation, about 200,000 accounts were deactivated by Wednesday on TikTok alone, with “hundreds of thousands” more to be blocked in the next few days.
Many of the estimated 1 million children affected by the legislation also posted goodbye messages on social media.
“No more social media … no more contact with the rest of the world,” one teen wrote on TikTok.
“#seeyouwhenim16,” said another.
Others said they would learn how to get round the ban.
“It’s just kind of pointless, we’re just going to create new ways to get on these platforms, so what’s the point,” said 14-year-old Claire Ni.
Ban has global implications
The rollout caps a year of debate over whether any country could practically stop children from using platforms embedded in daily life, and begins a live test for governments frustrated that social media firms have been slow to implement harm-reduction measures.
“I’m happy that they want to protect kids, and I’m happy that we have a chance to see how they do it and see if we can learn from them,” said European Union lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, who wants to see greater protection for the bloc’s children.
Albanese’s centre-left government proposed the landmark law citing research showing harms to mental health from the overuse of social media among young teens, including misinformation, bullying and harmful depictions of body image. Several countries from Denmark to New Zealand to Malaysia have signalled they may study or emulate Australia’s model.
At a school in the German city of Bonn, students spoke favourably of a ban.
“Social media is highly addictive and doesn’t really have any real advantages. I mean, there are advantages, such as being able to spread your opinion, but I think the disadvantages, especially the addiction, are much worse,” said 15-year-old pupil Arian Klaar.
Julie Inman Grant, the US-born eSafety Commissioner who is overseeing the ban, told Reuters on Wednesday a groundswell of American parents wanted similar measures.
“I hear from the parents and the activists and everyday people in America, ‘we wish we had an eSafety commissioner like you in America, we wish we had a government that was going to put tween and teen safety before technology profits,’” she said in an interview at her office in Sydney.
‘Not our choice’: X says will comply
Elon Musk’s X became the last of the 10 major platforms to take measures to cut off access to underage teens after publicly acknowledging on Wednesday that it would comply.
“It’s not our choice - it’s what the Australian law requires,” X said on its website.
Australia has said the initial list of covered platforms would change as new products emerge and young users migrate.
Companies have told Canberra they will deploy a mix of age inference - estimating a user’s age from their behaviour - and age estimation based on a selfie, alongside checks that could include uploaded identification documents.
For social media businesses, the implementation marks a new era of structural stagnation as user numbers flatline and time spent on platforms shrinks, studies show.
Platforms say they earn little from advertising to under-16s, but warn the ban disrupts a pipeline of future users. Just before the ban took effect, 86% of Australians aged eight to 15 used social media, the government said.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10181844be9ac76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960329/collapse-of-two-buildings-in-moroccos-fez-kills-19' target='_blank'><strong>Collapse of two buildings in Morocco’s Fez kills 19</strong></a><br><p>Two four-storey buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez, killing at least 19 people, according to a provisional toll reported by the country’s official news agency on Wednesday.
“Sixteen other people were wounded, with varying degrees of severity,” the Maghreb Arabe Press (MAP) agency reported, adding that search operations were still ongoing to “save other people who may be buried under the rubble”.
The two adjacent structures, which housed eight families, collapsed overnight in the major northern city’s Al-Moustakbal neighbourhood, in the Al-Massira area, according to MAP.
Images from the pre-dawn scene showed first responders carrying a corpse in a grey body bag to waiting emergency vehicles, as residents gathered to watch the rescue efforts.
Other workers, using jackhammers and pickaxes, tried to dig through the rubble, occasionally assisted by mechanical excavators. Local authorities have indicated that the toll could rise in the coming hours.
MAP reported that safety officials had conducted “necessary preventative measures”, including securing the surrounding area and evacuating neighbouring buildings. The agency added that the injured were taken to Fez’s University Hospital Centre.

The accident was one of the deadliest of its kind in recent years. In February last year, five people died in the collapse of a house in Fez’s old city.
Nearly a decade ago, in 2016, there were two deadly building collapses within the span of a week. One was a home in the western city of Marrakech that killed two children, while the other was a four-storey building that killed four people and injured two dozen more.
In 2014, three buildings in the western city of Casablanca collapsed, killing 23 people.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10195300ab4b82f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960330/pti-announces-national-conference-claims-pakistan-faces-serious-issues' target='_blank'><strong>PTI announces ‘national conference’, claims Pakistan faces ‘serious issues’</strong></a><br><p>The PTI announced on Wednesday that it would hold a “national conference” later this month, where a “national agenda” would be presented.
The development comes days after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Since then, a war of words continued between the leaders of the ruling PML-N and PTI over the presser, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition. He insisted  that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman, while the opposition party emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”.
The announcement was made by PTI leader Asad Qaiser after a meeting of the party’s parliamentary group at the Parliament House.
Speaking to the media outside Parliament, he said the conference was scheduled for December 20-21.
When asked about the conference’s agenda, the former speaker said the country was “facing serious issues” of instability and uncertainty.
“Being an opposition alliance, it is the responsibility of the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to invite political parties, bar associations, civil society, media and other stakeholders to get together for brainstorming and finding a way forward,” said Qaiser while speaking to Dawn.
Elaborating further, the senior PTI leader said the situation was tense on the country’s international borders and commercial activity, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had declined.
“Multinational companies have been leaving Pakistan. TTAP is the only platform from which a message can be given that things can be streamlined. In the conference, we will provide a solution for ongoing issues and outline the way forward,” he added.
The PTI, earlier this week, said that excluding the party founder from politics would only weaken the political system. Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock.
However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran.
Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply, marked by protests that frequently escalated into violence amid state repression.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1019520980c55a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960312/war-of-words-between-pti-and-ruling-coaltion-continues-pml-ns-ikhtiar-wali-says-things-have-reached-point-of-no-return' target='_blank'><strong>War of words between PTI and ruling coaltion continues; PML-N’s Ikhtiar Wali says ‘things have reached point of no return’</strong></a><br><p>The war of words between members of the PTI and ruling coalition continued on Wednesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in recent days after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6, in response to Imran’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Politicians from various parties have rallied behind the armed forces since, chastising the PTI. Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution calling for a ban on Imran and his party, terming them “anti-state”.
‘Things have reached a point of no return’
Earlier today, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that “things have reached a point of no return”.
Addressing a press conference, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.”
“All doors to talks are now closed,” Wali said.
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour, and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what [else] can be done”.
Wali alleged that “PTI, in its four years in power, had done nothing,” challenging the party to “show at least one university, hospital or dam” they built.
“It was a blessing from God that the Centre, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan have remained safe from the PTI’s dirty politics,” he remarked, warning that the government “will now set KP free as well.”
‘Common sense should prevail’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then […] We sat in Parliament, believing that our voices will be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties will be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years.
But, he continued, “at some point, common sense should prevail”.
Seemingly referring to the bar on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he added: “If you keep parents in jail, […] how can the children sit together with you? And if you don’t understand this, then probably the public will make you understand.”
He again stressed that the use of force would not yield any results. “Common sense should prevail.”
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” In this connection, he also claimed that Imran had the support of at least 70 per cent people in the country.
“Don’t enrage the people of Pakistan,” he warned, adding that “we haven’t done anything in violation of the Constitution”.
He emphasised that meetings with Imran should be allowed, pointing out that the high court had also issued an order, directing that meetings with the former prime minister be permitted.
“If you create hurdles [in this regard], then we don’t know what your intentions are. But if you get a response from the other side, the country and democracy would suffer a loss,” he warned, adding that whether the government did not want the PTI to sit in Parliament.
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
‘Meeting necessary for dialogue’
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside Parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan.
“How can we negotiate without his permission?”
Referring to the PTI’s sit-in outside the Adiala jail the previous night for Imran’s visitation rights and the alleged use of force by authorities to disperse the protesters, he said the leg of PTI parliamentary leader in the National Assembly Shahid Khattak “had been broken”.
He warned, “If the public rises, everything will burn down. Before destruction strikes, we should move towards dialogue.” And for that, he reiterated, meetings with the PTI founder should be allowed.
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “national conference” on December 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.“
Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adialia jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
Moreover, he demanded that merit should be considered in cases concerning Imran, further stating: “We are united; we will not be afraid.”
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addresses a press conference, assailing the PTI its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give General Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?”
The senior minister stressed that PTI’s narrative “hinged only on the release of Imran and the party coming back into power,” adding that “they did not care about the common people.”
PTI’s ‘venomous rhetoric should be recognised abroad’: Aun Chaudhry
Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakistanis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these groups,” Chaudhry said.
“I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong,” he urged.
“Our country is progressing towards success, but this group is creating such an environment,” the minister said.
He continued: “It’s tweeting against the military leadership, sometimes against the government, who is getting it done? Who is the mastermind behind it? Whoever is behind it does not want peace in this country. They don’t want this country to progress.”
“Don’t you think about the martyred soldier and his orphaned kids? Don’t you pay heed that the soldier sacrifices his life and leaves his own kids as orphans so that other kids don’t become orphans? So that we can enjoy a sound sleep?” the minister questioned.
“We have a secure border and a secure future because our armed forces are backing us,” Chaudhry added.

Qureshi was hospitalised last month at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute for gallbladder stone complications, where he underwent a successful procedure to remove the stone.
Umer said he was discharged from the hospital after his condition improved, while tests were conducted, and their reports would be released in 15 days.
The PTI leader has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023, riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023.
In July 2024, the PTI leader was indicted by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.
The same month, he was transferred from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi to Kot Lakhpat on a police request. It had stated that frequent transportation of the PTI leader from Rawalpindi to Lahore was not feasible for the authorities as well as for the jailed ex-minister.</p><small>2025-12-10 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10172717da931a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960324/controversial-social-media-posts-case-sc-to-hear-imaans-plea-on-ihcs-denial-of-relief-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial social media posts case: SC to hear Imaan’s plea on IHC’s denial of relief tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court (SC) will take up on Thursday (December 11) the application of lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, seeking an early hearing of her plea for a stay in the trial of the controversial social media post case.
On December 4, Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were facing trial before the additional sessions judge and Peca (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016) special judge in the controversial tweets case. On December 1, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) denied the couple ad-interim relief of staying the trial. They appealed the IHC order before the SC through their counsel, Faisal Siddiqi.
In their subsequent application from December 4, the petitioners pleaded that the criminal trial against them was at its concluding stage and therefore, extreme urgency in the matter was required. The application also pleaded that the petitioners filed a criminal revision before the IHC to question the trial proceedings in view of violations of due process as prescribed under CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in the absence of the petitioners.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge SC bench also consisting of Justices Salahuddin Panwhar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim will hear the plea.
The application argued that the petitioners have a clear prima facie case because the recording of evidence in their absence was not only a violation of Section 353 (evidence to be taken in the presence of the accused) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), but also their due process and fair trial rights under Article 10A of the Constitution.
“As the criminal trial is at its concluding stage, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioners because the prosecution would not be prejudiced if the trial is delayed for two weeks,” the application argued.
However, the criminal revision application filed by the couple before the IHC would be rendered unnecessary, due to the lack of ad-interim relief to stay the trial.
Mazari and Chatha would suffer irreparable loss, not only because the criminal revision application would become infructuous, but because of the violations of due process and principles of fair trial in the trial proceedings.
“It is obvious and apparent that this unfair trial is leading to a criminal conviction of the petitioners,” the application stated.
“The November 29 order of the additional sessions judge and Peca special judge clearly showed that the trial was at the stage of recording a statement under Section 342 (power to examine the accused) of the CrPC, and there was a clear and present danger that this trial would lead to the criminal conviction of the petitioners. Thus, the present criminal appeal will become infructuous,” the application argued.
“In terms of Section 7 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, it is expressly stated that any application pleading urgency will be fixed for hearing within a period of 14 days,” the application pleaded.
It further argued that this is a criminal appeal involving the liberty of the petitioners and therefore should be treated urgently as per the SC’s policy on urgent applications, the application pleaded.
“Failing an urgency being allowed by this court, the interest of justice will seriously be prejudiced and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioners in the form of possible criminal convictions,” the application argued.
The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chatha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case, in which both denied the charges.
The complaint had accused Mazari of having disseminated and “propagated narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for re-posting some posts of his wife.
According to the appeal, the complainants disclosed no specific allegations and cherry-picked a few posts made by the petitioners on social media platform X, as far back as 2021.</p><small>2025-12-10 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10130334680927a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960310/russian-bombers-join-chinese-air-patrol-near-japan-as-tokyo-beijing-ties-strain' target='_blank'><strong>Russian bombers join Chinese air patrol near Japan as Tokyo-Beijing ties strain</strong></a><br><p>Japan has scrambled jets to monitor Russian and Chinese air forces conducting joint patrols around the country, the Japanese defence ministry said late Tuesday, amid rising tensions between Tokyo and Beijing.
Two Russian Tu-95 nuclear-capable strategic bombers flew from the Sea of Japan toward the East China Sea to rendezvous with two Chinese H-6 bombers, and performed a “long-distance joint flight” in the Pacific, the ministry said.
Four Chinese J-16 fighter jets joined the bombers as they made a round-trip flight between Japan’s Okinawa and Miyako islands, it added. The Miyako Strait between the two islands is classified as international waters.
Japan also detected simultaneous Russian air force activity in the Sea of Japan, consisting of one early-warning aircraft A-50 and two Su-30 fighters, the ministry said.
Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said in a post on X on Wednesday that the Russian and Chinese joint operations were “clearly intended as a show of force against our nation, which is a serious concern for our national security.” 
Japan’s fighter jets “strictly implemented air defence identification measures,” Koizumi added.
Russian news agencies reported that the Russian-Chinese joint flight near Japan lasted for eight hours, citing Moscow’s defence ministry.
South Korea’s military also said on Tuesday that seven Russian planes and two Chinese planes had entered its air defence zone.
Japan said on Sunday that Chinese carrier-launched fighter jets aimed radar at Japanese military aircraft a day earlier, an claim Beijing disputed.
Beijing’s rising military actions near Japan follow Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comment last month that Tokyo could respond to any Chinese military action against Taiwan that also threatened Japan’s security.
China and Russia have been ramping up military cooperation in recent years elsewhere, conducting joint operations such as an anti-missile training on Russian territory and live-fire naval exercises in the South China Sea.</p><small>2025-12-10 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1016294163663c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960320/ppp-alleges-pml-n-pti-colluding-after-na-proceedings-end-early-during-ppp-led-agenda-item' target='_blank'><strong>PPP alleges PML-N, PTI ‘colluding’ after NA proceedings end early during PPP-led agenda item</strong></a><br><p>The PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings on Wednesday, after the speaker ended the session early when PTI’s Iqbal Afridi pointed out a “lack of quorum” ahead of an agenda item regarding the renaming of Islamabad International Airport.
The last item on the day’s agenda was a calling-attention notice from First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and other PPP lawmakers, intended to draw the defence minister’s attention to the delay in naming the New Islamabad International Airport after former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in recognition of her services to democracy and the country.
However, as the day’s proceedings continued, acting speaker Ali Zahid, who belongs to the PML-N, ended the session abruptly during the question hour while PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel was speaking.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi pointed out the lack of quorum while Patel spoke, prompting the speaker to have the members counted.
“63 members are present, the house is not in order,” Zahid said, ending the session early.
With their mics switched off, PPP lawmakers staged a noisy protest on the floor of the house.
Addressing the media after the session’s abrupt end, PPP MNA Shazia Marri termed the move “a conspiracy” against the PPP, alleging that “it appeared as if the PML-N and PTI were colluding.”
“This reeks of a conspiracy […] the session ended at 11-11:15, not even an hour had passed, and we are now standing here holding a press conference.”
Addressing the media, she said, “Qadir Patel also went to the speaker and spoke to him,” she said, adding that “now that we are standing here with you, it does feel like a conspiracy and intentional”.
“PTI is already quite non-serious[…]however, we were not expecting this from PML-N,” the PPP leader lamented.
The PPP leader, in a veiled warning to the coalition partner, said that “given the state of the country, […] the PML-N ought to be more careful”.
“Meting out such treatment to a party that is mature and sensible is unacceptable,” she said.
Separately, Patel, while speaking to the media afterwards, alleged that PML-N leaders were “sitting in the lobby” while the quorum was called, also terming it a “well-thought-out conspiracy.”
“My question had not yet been completed during the question hour, so how was a member allowed to point out a lack of quorum?” he asked.
“If the location of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Airport has been changed, then why can the name not be changed?”
“Shaheed Benazir does not need any praise; these people are small-minded, and they will remain as such,” Patel said.
Patel vowed that, in case the government does not respond, “the party will decide its future course of action during its next meeting”.
‘Petty tactic’
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Aseefa expressed disappointment “at the behaviour of acting NA speaker,” terming the move a “petty tactic.”
“It has become a mockery to constantly suspend the session despite having quorum. Many had heard the speaker was given instructions to avoid my calling attention notice. A very petty tactic,” the first lady said.







The New Islamabad International Airport (IIAP) was inaugurated by then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on May 2, 2018.
In February this year, PPP leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor, Faisal Karim Kundi, in a letter to the prime minister, had requested that the airport be renamed to honour the former prime minister, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Governor Kundi emphasised that the old Islamabad airport was originally named Benazir Bhutto International Airport on June 21, 2008, following her assassination in December 2007,” the report said.
“However, in April 2018, the Aviation Division renamed the newly constructed airport as New Islamabad International Airport, removing Bhutto’s name,” it added.</p><small>2025-12-10 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10165926f14aff3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959555/gardening-going-wild-for-strawberries' target='_blank'><strong>GARDENING: GOING WILD FOR STRAWBERRIES</strong></a><br><p>Growing up in Karachi in the 1990s, it was unthinkable for most of us to have access to fresh strawberries. All one came across were artificial strawberry flavours and essence, which were generously used in chocolates, biscuits, ice creams, desserts, jams, jellies and custard, to name a few convenience products.
Pushcart fruit vendors selling strawberries were unheard of and only a lucky few would find fresh strawberries at any of the handful of supermarkets that existed in the city in those days.
To our family’s delight, my father would sometimes purchase a can of strawberries from the then-renowned chor bazaar, a flea market where smuggled items were also available. The only fresh strawberries that we were exposed to in those times were the ones we saw being consumed on television. It is no surprise, then, that these factors added to our eagerness to not only consume fresh strawberries, but also to grow them.
Fast forward to the 2020s and, during its fruiting seasons, different sizes and varieties of strawberries are available at bargain prices throughout Karachi and across the country. A host of different berries, including strawberries, are being grown across Pakistan, especially in colder regions such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. These fruits have proved to be economically beneficial for local growers as well.

In 1990s Karachi, fresh strawberries were nearly impossible to find. Today, they are everywhere and you can even grow them at home

The bright red, aromatic, bite-size, juicy fruit, which is globally adored, is scientifically known as Fragaria x ananassa and hails from the popular Rosaceae family. Technically, strawberry is not a berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit. Botanically, the red and juicy fleshy part that we love to eat is a swollen stem and not a fruit. Scientifically, the seeds that we see on the strawberry are the fruits. The red part, or the stem, is an enlarged receptacle, while the seemingly minute seeds, or the fruits, are known as achenes.

It warrants mentioning that a gardener can use either the seeds or the strawberry runners — the long stem that grows from a mother plant — to grow strawberry plants. To add to the confusion, the achenes, or strawberry fruits that are generally mistaken as seeds, contain a single strawberry seed within. Every strawberry that we gulp down contains roughly 200 achenes and, therefore, an equal number of edible seeds that are nutritious.
In ideal conditions, seeds usually germinate when the temperature is around 10 to 18 degrees Celsius. Even then, its germination rate is comparatively lower than growing runners. Usually, the seeds are sown during the months of November to January. However, as the winters ahead are almost non-existent, this can affect the germination rate of the seeds and, eventually, plant growth. This is one of the reasons why one seldom finds stores selling strawberry seeds here.
Despite these hindrances, gardeners who want to grow the strawberry plant using seeds should prepare a well-drained potting mix, which has been boosted with a fine layer of compost. The seeds should be sprinkled gently on the soil surface and covered with a thin layer of compost. Water should be very carefully sprayed, so it does not disturb the original sowing positions of the seeds. The container should be placed in a cool, dry area and covered with plastic to ensure moisture retention. Even with a diminished germination rate, strawberry seeds can take between two to four weeks to germinate, depending upon the weather and the quality of the seeds.
Strawberry growers and small-scale farmers mostly opt for strawberry runners to grow a crop instead of seeds. One of the best aspects of growing a strawberry plant via runners is that it requires a temperature between 20 to 25 degrees Celsius for optimum growth. This range is ideal for growers in Pakistan.



This is one reason why consumers often come across online vendors selling strawberries grown from runners in dozens and even batches of hundreds. These runners are small strawberry plants, about three to six inches long, and sellers wrap them in newspaper before shipping, to keep them dry and prevent damage.
Green runners are more viable and have better survival chances to grow into a strawberry plant. Gardeners can also opt for runners that have completely dried, which are usually brown to black in colour. These are likely to be dead. If the roots are still intact, rehydrating these runners with water may help in bringing them back to life.

The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
“The Basant festival will be held in Lahore from Feb 6 to 8, 2026,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told Dawn on Wednesday.
The festival would be “completely safe, regulated, and strictly monitored,” she added.
In a post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said, “CM Punjab Maryam Nawaz has approved the revival of our beloved Heritage Basant Festival on February 6th, 7th and 8th, celebrated across Lahore after 25 years, a tradition rooted in history and admired worldwide.“
On CM Punjab’s directions, a city-wide campaign to install safety antennas on all motorbikes would start tomorrow, she said, adding that “every motorbike in Lahore will have an antenna for safety before and during Basant.”
“Spring returns to the city of heritage and festivals. Lahore’s skies will speak in colour again, reclaiming our glory for the world,“ she added.







Bokhari said, “Strict conditions have been imposed to prevent any potential loss of life during the three-day Basant festival.”
Last week, the Punjab government lifted the ban on Basant celebration thro­ugh an ordinance — the Punjab Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025.
Under the ordinance, police officers of the rank of sub-inspector were empowered to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants on credible information.
The ordinance has been submitted to the Punjab Assembly for enactment.
Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Historically, in the 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh held an annual Basant fair and introduced kite flying as a regular feature. The association of kite flying with Basant soon became a tradition centred in Lahore, which remains the regional hub of the festival throughout Punjab even today. However, the festival has also traditionally been celebrated in other parts of Punjab, including Indian Punjab. Over time, the festival began to be celebrated across the country.
During the festival, the city sky is filled with colourful kites of all shapes and sizes flown from rooftops. The kites are controlled with strings usually embedded with thin shards of glass, which help cut the threads of competing kites more effectively.</p><small>2025-12-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10160900cc242aa.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960316/machado-will-be-in-oslo-for-nobel-peace-prize-nobel-institute-says' target='_blank'><strong>Machado will be in Oslo for Nobel Peace Prize, Nobel institute says</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela’s Maria Corina Machado is safe and will be in Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in a statement on Wednesday.
Earlier, the organisers said the Venezuelan opposition leader, who lives in hiding, will not attend Wednesday’s Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and the award will be accepted by her daughter.
Machado has only been seen once in public since going underground in August last year, amidst a tense showdown with President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuela’s attorney general has said the 58-year-old would be considered a “fugitive” if she left the country to accept the award.
It was not known in the hours before the ceremony whether Machado was in Norway for the event due to start at 1pm (5pm PKT). The Nobel Institute finally confirmed that she would not be there.
“It will be her daughter Ana Corina Machado who will receive the prize in her mother’s name,” Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken told Norway’s NRK radio. “Her daughter will give the speech that Maria Corina herself wrote.” Harpviken said he “simply” did not know where Machado was.
Few people were informed of Machado’s movements because of the nature of Maduro’s “repressive regime, which is willing to use absolutely all means against the opposition”, he said, noting that she “lives under a death threat from the regime”.
Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, are in Norway for the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.
‘Fugitive’ laureate
While organisers said Machado had previously indicated she would attend, suspicions had already been raised when a traditional press conference with the award winner on Tuesday was first postponed and then cancelled.
Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, which she was banned from. Her claim is backed by much of the international community.
Machado has been hailed for her efforts in favour of democracy, but she has also been criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel Prize.
The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug smuggling boats.
Maduro insists that the goal of the US operations —  which Machado has said are justified —  is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.
Since going into hiding, her only public appearance was on January 9 in Caracas, where she protested against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.
The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.
Machado was awarded the Nobel on October 10 for her efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, challenging Maduro’s iron-fisted rule since 2013.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said last month the opposition leader would be considered a “fugitive” if she travelled to Norway to accept the prize.
“By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,” Saab told AFP, adding that she is accused of “acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism”.
“It has happened multiple times in the history of the Peace Prize that the laureate has been prevented from attending the ceremony, and on those occasions it’s always been the case that close family members of the laureate will receive the prize and give the lecture in the place of the laureate,” Harpviken explained this week.
Doubts had been raised about how Machado would return to Venezuela.“She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialised in Latin America at the University of Oslo.
On the other hand, “she is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change, and she would gradually lose political influence,” she added.
Both pro- and anti-Machado protests are expected in Oslo on Wednesday.
The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics will receive their prizes at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-12-10 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1013165959b1052.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960311/elon-musk-says-doge-somewhat-successful-but-would-not-do-it-again' target='_blank'><strong>Elon Musk says DOGE ‘somewhat successful’ but would not do it again</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency was only “a little bit successful”, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on a podcast on Tuesday, adding that he would not lead the project again.
The billionaire, who is founder of electric car company Tesla, was a major donor to Trump’s presidential election campaign and became a close ally and adviser to his administration.
Musk led the DOGE team in seeking to slash the federal government’s budget and workforce in the first five months of Trump’s second term.
But the role and his political rhetoric sparked a backlash against him and Tesla, including vandalism of Tesla cars. “I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars,” Musk said on the podcast with former Trump administration official Katie Miller.



“We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful. We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was entirely wasteful,” Musk said.
Asked if he would go back and lead DOGE again, Musk said: “No, I don’t think so.” Musk’s work for DOGE also sparked concerns among investors that he was not paying enough attention to Tesla as it faced slowing sales.
Musk and Trump had a bitter public falling out around midyear over the president’s sweeping tax and spending bill. But there have been some signs of reconciliation.
DOGE has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, the Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month.
DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditure, but it was impossible for outside financial experts to verify that because the unit did not provide detailed public accounting of its work.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/101049117339d9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960297/pakistans-population-challenge-deepens-as-growth-slows-but-numbers-keep-rising-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s population challenge deepens as growth slows but numbers keep rising: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s population has crossed an estimated 257 million at midyear, placing it among the world’s most populous nations even as its fertility and growth rates continue to decline, according to a report released by the US Census Bureau on Tuesday.
Demographic databases, including projections by the US Census Bureau and the United Nations, show Pakistan’s population density at 333 persons per square kilometre, underscoring the scale of pressure on land and public services.
The data depict a country facing one of the most complex population transitions in South Asia — caught between rapid numerical expansion and slow human-development gains.

 

Despite decades of policy debate, Pakistan is still adding millions of people each year. Its annual population growth rate stands at 1.82 per cent, lower than in previous decades but high enough to keep total numbers rising steeply for at least another generation, the report said,
It added that the total fertility rate (TFR) — the average number of births per woman — has fallen to 3.25, yet remains well above the replacement level of 2.1, ensuring continued expansion through what demographers describe as population momentum.

 

At the same time, social indicators remain weak. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 60.5 years, among the lowest in the region, while the under-five mortality rate stands at nearly 65 deaths per 1,000 live births, reflecting persistent shortcomings in maternal health, child nutrition, disease prevention and primary healthcare access, per the report.
Together, these figures underline the uneven nature of Pakistan’s demographic transition, in which family size is shrinking faster than improvements in health and longevity.
How Pakistan compares with its neighbours
A regional comparison highlights the scale of Pakistan’s challenge. India, now the world’s most populous country with about 1.46–1.47 billion people, has already crossed below replacement fertility, with a TFR of around 1.9.
While India’s absolute numbers will continue to rise for several decades due to its large youth cohort, its growth rate is slowing rapidly, and attention is shifting toward labour-force ageing, pension systems and productivity.
Bangladesh, often cited as a demographic success story, has pushed fertility down to around replacement level despite extreme land pressure. With a population of about 175–176m packed into one of the world’s highest population densities, Bangladesh has achieved sharp declines in child mortality and steady gains in life expectancy, largely through female education, family planning outreach and primary healthcare investments.
In contrast, Pakistan, with far more land per person, continues to lag on several of these indicators.
Afghanistan, at the other extreme, remains trapped in a high-growth, high-mortality cycle. With a population now estimated at over 44m, fertility remains above four births per woman, while child mortality and life expectancy are among the worst in the region.
Afghanistan’s demographic trajectory resembles Pakistan’s own profile from several decades ago, reinforcing how conflict and weak state institutions delay demographic transition.
A young country under immediate strain
Pakistan’s population structure remains heavily weighted toward the young. A broad base of children and working-age youth means that pressure on schools, universities, housing, transport and employment will intensify through the 2030s and 2040s. Even as fertility declines, the large size of today’s child and teenage population guarantees continued high demand for jobs and public services for decades.
Economists warn that without sustained economic growth and large-scale job creation, this youth bulge could become a source of long-term instability rather than a demographic dividend. Urban centres are already showing the strain through informal housing expansion, transport congestion and widening access gaps in health and education.
The global backdrop: growth slows everywhere
Globally, the world’s population continues to grow, but at its slowest pace in modern history. With the global total now exceeding eight billion, projections suggest that the world population will approach nine billion by the late 2030s and may peak near the end of the century before stabilising or declining.
This slowdown is being driven by sharp fertility declines across East Asia, Europe and much of Latin America, with even South Asia now firmly on the same downward path.
An unfinished transition
Demographers note that Pakistan is now at a critical midpoint of its demographic transition. Fertility is declining, but not fast enough to reduce near-term population stress. Mortality is falling, but not fast enough to lift life expectancy to regional standards. Meanwhile, urbanisation is accelerating without the infrastructure needed to support it.
Without major gains in girls’ education, reproductive healthcare, nutrition, clean water, and employment, Pakistan risks entering the second half of the century with both an ageing population and weak human capital — a combination that could severely strain public finances, pension systems and healthcare services.
Experts argue that the coming two decades will be decisive. If investments in health, education and economic productivity accelerate, Pakistan could still convert its youth bulge into sustained growth. If not, the same numbers could amplify unemployment, migration pressures and fiscal strain well into the latter half of the century.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10071006401ee52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960130/water-cannons-used-to-disperse-pti-protesters-staging-sit-in-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Water cannons used to disperse PTI protesters staging sit-in outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>The PTI said early on Wednesday that authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier.
In a post on X at 3:58am, the party said, “Pakistani authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala Jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.







In another post, the party said that Imran’s family was deliberately blocked from meeting him, which led to the sit-in.
It said that the use of water cannons was “not only a shameless violation of Imran Khan’s prisoner rights but also an outright assault on the constitutional rights of people who gathered to protest the regime’s atrocities”.
“International human rights organisations and champions of democracy must not stay silent in the face of such inhumane and authoritarian actions in Pakistan,” the party said.
In yet another post, Imran’s sisters Aleema, telling drenched participants of the sit-in, “Kids, ghabrana nahin hai (don’t panic) … its just water, don’t panic because of water.”







PTI stages sit-in
The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration.
Police had contacted Imran’s sisters twice and suggested that they leave. Later, a heavy contingent of police was deployed at the scene.







The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.
Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison on Tuesday, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal.
“If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said,







She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months.
“What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets.
“What sort of system is this?”







Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police.
Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video.
“This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law.
“We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.”







Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”.
“We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.”
“There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.”
Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility.
He left the area without meeting the PTI founder.
PTI Secretary General Raja said there was no excuse to bar Imran’s sisters from meeting him, as it is one’s right to meet relatives.
“No one can deny the right to meet by saying that Imran Khan’s message was shared outside,” he said.
PTI provincial president Akbar said that a large number of party workers and supporters reached Adiala Jail because of a challenge from Senator Faisal Vawda.
“We have come here prepared and are willing to sit here the whole night,” Akbar said. “We hope that the meeting will be arranged, but workers are charged and we are ready for a prolonged sit-in.”
He added that the distance between people and state institutions is increasing, stating that the PTI does not want the gap to grow.
“People have started hating you, so you should think wisely,” said Akbar. It remains unclear whom he was addressing.
Similarly, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak said that they were peaceful people and would demonstrate peacefully.
“I am a parliamentary leader of the PTI in the National Assembly and it is my right to meet Imran Khan,” he said. “Workers have arrived here just because they love Imran Khan and they think that only he can address the issues of Pakistan.”
Khattak also said that a policy should be made to address the issue of military operations in tribal areas.
“We have no objection to drone attacks, but drones don’t strike the right targets, due to which civilians are being killed. I suggest that the elders of tribal areas be involved in negotiating with the terrorists. In the past, we were having tea in Afghanistan and now Afghans have been declared enemies,” the MNA added.
Meanwhile, KP MPA Shafiullah Jan said that in the mainstream media, someone was saying that nobody would reach Adiala Jail.
“He should see that we have reached here,” he stated. “I think anger has grown among workers after the press conference of DG ISPR. We will sit here unless one of the sisters is allowed to meet with Imran Khan.”
Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother.
When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”.
Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code.
“There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.
That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.
The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly.
The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.</p><small>2025-12-10 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1012061053eef9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960305/ecp-rejects-cm-bugtis-plea-for-postponement-of-local-govt-polls-in-quetta-elections-to-be-held-on-dec-28' target='_blank'><strong>ECP rejects CM Bugti’s plea for postponement of local govt polls in Quetta; elections to be held on Dec 28</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) rejected on Wednesday Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti’s petition seeking the postponement of local government elections in Quetta that were scheduled to be held on December 28.
Bugti had filed the petition on Monday, and informed sources told Dawn that he cited the precarious law and order situation in the provincial capital and the suspension of internet services as reasons for postponing the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) elections.
In its written order today, seen by Dawn, the ECP said the plea was being rejected for “being devoid of force” and that the electoral body had decided to hold local government elections in Quetta on the already scheduled date of Dec 28.
However, in the majority decision, one of the six members of the commission that considered the plea was in favour of the postponement of local government elections.
In its order, the ECP directed the Balochistan government to assist the commission and “all other functionaries who have been entrusted responsibilities for the conduct of local government elections in District Quetta in every possible manner”.
It also instructed that “foolproof security arrangements” be made for the safety and security of voters, contesting candidates, the general public and polling staff, as well as to ensure the smooth conduct of polls in Quetta.
ECP, in its order, noted that the chief minister had filed an appeal on Dec 8 seeking the postponement of elections, stating that elections should be rescheduled to a time when “when weather, security, administrative preparedness, constituency demarcation & voter rolls accuracy are ensured.”
The commission took up the matter on Dec 9 for a review, it said.
Addressing “irregularities” regarding constituency demarcation, ECP clarified that, “the process of delimitation of constituencies was completed after observing all legal processes, i.e. publication of preliminary list of constituencies for inviting proposals, objections on preliminary lists and the same was finalised after hearing and deciding the objections/representations.”
It also recalled a Balochistan High Court (BHC) order, which on October 10, had dismissed petitions filed on the same ground and directed the commission to hold elections “as soon as possible.”
ECP further maintained that “the appellant has wrongly calculated the term of expiry of local government elections in Balochistan”.
“As per Section 26 of the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, the term of local government election is for four [years]. In the present case, the members and chairman/vice chairman of union councils, municipal committees and municipal corporations took oath on February 9, 2023, for which the expiry of term is February 9, 2027.
“However, the members and chairman/ vice chairman of district councils took oath on July 6, 2023, for which the term of expiry is July 5, 2027.”
The order added that the commission had “carried out the process of reconciliation of electoral rolls wherever required to adjust voters in accordance with census blocks, wards and delimitation through door-to-door verifications”.
“For the purpose, vide publicity was given to facilitate the voters and inspiring contesting candidates for registration and transfer of their votes,” it said, adding that the election schedule was issued after the completion of this process.
The order noted that ECP had completed the delimitation process “twice” and “after a number of meetings with the provincial government of Balochistan, issued the election programs twice”.
However, the elections could not be held despite “efforts” of the commission, the order noted.
On the matter of law and order situation and harsh weather, the ECP recalled a request made by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government in Oct 2021 — on the same grounds — where the Supreme Court (SC) had upheld the electoral body’s decision to proceed with the elections.
The SC directed the provincial government to proceed with the local government elections in the case.
It also noted that the “process of printing of ballot papers has been already started, and [the] maximum number of ballot papers have been printed out.”
In his dissenting note, ECP member Shah Muhammad Jatoi, while agreeing with the commission’s decision on delimitation, electoral rolls and term, maintained that harsh weather conditions could lead to a “low” voter turnout as most residents during December “migrate from the district (Quetta) to [other] districts”.
He further noted: “I am also of the considered view that the law and order situation in the province of Balochistan is not conducive for [the] conduct of local government elections in the present scenario.”
Quetta local polls
The Balochistan government had previously requested the election commission on November 2 as well to postpone the polls in Quetta, citing similar reasons. However, the request was turned down a day later.
Prior to that on Oct 6, a bench of the BHC had rejected constitutional petitions filed by numerous individuals regarding the postponement of the elections and directed the election commissioner of Balochistan to hold the local government elections as soon as possible.
In view of the BHC orders, the election commission had started preparation for holding elections in Quetta and announced the schedule for it on November 13.
Elections will now be held in 172 union councils and 641 wards, with 2,710 candidates contesting the elections in Quetta district.
The previous local bodies, elected in 2015, had completed their tenure on January 27, 2019.
Under the Elections Act 2017, local body elections should be held within 120 days after the expiry of the term. However, the polls were held in May 2022, more than three years after the expiry of the previous term.
The delay primarily resulted from a lack of consensus among political parties over proposed amendments to the Balochistan Local Government Act, 2010, and issues concerning the delimitation of constituencies.
The LG elections in two major districts with sizeable urban populations in the province, Quetta and Lasbela, were delayed because of issues with the delimitation of wards.
While the LG elections in Lasbela were held at the end of 2022, the elections in Quetta could not be held due to pending litigation in the BHC over the delimitation of wards in the district.</p><small>2025-12-10 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10111559561ef9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960300/mob-torches-water-tanker-after-collision-leaves-motorcyclist-dead-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Mob torches water tanker after collision leaves motorcyclist dead in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>A man riding a motorcycle was killed on Wednesday morning after a water tanker collided with his vehicle in Karachi, prompting a mob to torch the tanker.

Today’s incidents come two days after a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi.
Last month, angered citizens also set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it met with an accident, resulting in the death of a man. His wife was injured in the incident.</p><small>2025-12-10 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/101249485ae043c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960308/trump-says-hell-make-phone-call-to-stop-renewed-thai-cambodia-fighting' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he’ll make phone call to stop renewed Thai-Cambodia fighting</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of targeting civilians in border attacks on Wednesday, as US President Donald Trump said he would make a phone call to stop the fighting and salvage a ceasefire he brokered in July.
The two Southeast Asian nations have each blamed the other for the clashes that started on Monday, and remain at odds on a diplomatic solution to the border tensions that have been simmering for months.
Thailand’s foreign minister said in an interview on Tuesday that he saw no potential for negotiations, adding the situation was not conducive to third-party mediation, while a top adviser to Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet told Reuters his country was “ready to talk at any time”.
Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday evening, Trump listed a number of wars that he claimed he helped stop, including between Pakistan and India, and Israel and Iran, before commenting on the renewed conflict in Southeast Asia.
“I hate to say this one, named Cambodia–Thailand and it started up today and tomorrow I am going to have to make a phone call. Who else could say I’m going to make a phone call and stop a war of two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia.”
Asked about the prospect of Trump intervening again, Cambodian government spokesperson Pen Bona said Phnom Penh’s position remained the same, that it wanted only peace. A Thai government spokesperson said he did not know if the prime minister had spoken to Trump, as he was in parliament.
Claims civilian areas hit
Cambodia on Wednesday withdrew its athletes from the Southeast Asian Games in Thailand, citing safety reasons and serious concerns from the team’s families.
Thailand’s military said BM-21 rockets fired by Cambodian forces landed near the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin district on Wednesday morning, forcing the evacuation of patients and staff to a shelter.
It also said drones, BM-21 rockets and tanks were used at other border points, including near the contested Preah Vihear temple complex.
“Our forces destroyed an anti-drone position to the south of Chong Chom in order to support operations to clear Cambodian elements in a mango plantation that has been planted across the line of operations,” the military said in a situation update.
Cambodia’s military said Thailand had used artillery fire and armed drones to launch attacks in Pursat province, fired mortars into civilian residences in Battambang province, and Thai F-16 fighter jets had entered Cambodian airspace and dropped bombs near civilian areas.
Land mine allegations raised tensions
Trump has previously spoken to leaders of both countries and been central to the fragile truce between them since five days of fighting in July, which killed at least 48 people and was the heaviest clashes between the two in recent history.
In July, Trump used the leverage of trade negotiations to broker a ceasefire. Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow told Reuters on Tuesday he did not think the threat of tariffs should be used to pressure his country into talks.
Thailand last month suspended de-escalation measures that were agreed at an October summit in Trump’s presence, after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine that Bangkok said was newly laid by Cambodia, which rejects the allegation.
Both countries have said they have evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from border areas.
As of Tuesday night, Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said nine civilians had been killed since Monday and 20 seriously injured, while Thai officials said four soldiers had been killed and 68 had been injured.</p><small>2025-12-10 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0919541180fb69d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960131/women-reporters-drop-to-4pc-in-pakistan-from-16pc-in-2020-study-finds' target='_blank'><strong>Women reporters drop to 4pc in Pakistan from 16pc in 2020, study finds</strong></a><br><p>Women reporters in Pakistan fell to four per cent in 2025, down from 16pc in 2020, according to the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), the Uks Research Centre said in a statement on Wednesday, highlighting how progress on gender equality in the news has largely stalled in the country as well as in 94 others.
The GMMP takes place once every five years and captures a snapshot of news content from one global monitoring day. This year marks the fourth cycle in which Uks has served as GMMP’s national partner, monitoring and contributing Pakistan’s data to the world’s longest-running study on gender representation in the news.
GMMP 2025 was monitored around the world on May 6, 2025, a day on which Pakistan’s news agenda was dominated by India-Pakistan military tensions. The conflict shaped the media landscape that day and left very limited space for gender-related reporting.
“No women reporters were recorded in television, radio, or internet news on May 6,” the statement said, which was issued ahead of the release of the GMMP report and Pakistan’s National Report.
“The overwhelming focus on cross-border shelling, political statements, and military assessments meant that women’s stories almost disappeared from the news cycle. While the conflict skewed 2025’s data, the long-term trend still shows biases that continue to limit women’s visibility and voice in Pakistani media.”
Regarding news on gender-based violence (GBV), the statement said that “across all media monitored on the monitoring day, only one story on GBV appeared,” adding “the sole story focused on intimate partner violence, portraying the woman strictly as a victim.”
“No human rights lens or legal framework was applied,” it stated.
The statement further revealed that this year, women made only 13pc of news subjects, down from 18pc in 2020. “All stories that included women as subjects were reported by men.”
“These numbers show a clear reversal of progress made over previous cycles and highlight how deeply women’s representation is tied to editorial priorities and news routines,” it added.
It, however, added that the only area where women’s representation showed an increase in Pakistan was in social and legal news, where their presence rose to 20pc from 14pc in 2020.
Global highlights
Progress on gender equality in the news largely stalled across 94 countries, according to the statement.
“Women make up 26pc of people seen or cited in traditional news, and 29pc in digital news. These figures have barely shifted in a decade. The structure of news continues to prioritise male-dominated political and economic coverage, in both traditional and digital media.”
It added that women’s visibility improved over time in political and economic stories, but remained extremely low in sports (15pc).
“Women continue to be portrayed as victims at twice the rate of men, with 2025 showing a shift toward domestic violence and other crimes as the primary victim categories,” it said.
“Women remain underrepresented in expert roles, although digital news shows rising numbers of women experts. Stories by women journalists continue to feature more women sources and are more likely to apply a gender lens.”
Globally, it added, less than 2pc of news stories cover GBV. While the stories tend to apply a clearer gender perspective, the volume is too low to influence broader narratives.
“The 2025 findings show a media environment where change has slowed significantly, and existing approaches are not delivering meaningful improvements in gender equality,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-10 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10113152b6e2ad0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960301/ihc-grants-10-day-protective-bail-to-youtuber-rajab-butt-tiktoker-nadeem-nani-wala-after-they-surrender-in-court' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants 10-day protective bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt, TikToker Nadeem Nani Wala after they surrender in court</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt and TikToker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, on Wednesday in multiple cases related to gambling apps, cybercrime and other allegations after they surrendered before the court.
Justice Raja Inam Ameen Minhas approved the bail after the social media influencers appeared before the IHC after reaching Pakistan from the United Kingdom.
The development comes a day after the IHC granted protective bail to the two till December 10 (today), in response to a petition filed by Butt and Mubarak’s relatives, to ensure the content creators were not arrested upon their arrival in Pakistan.
Their counsel informed the court yesterday that Butt and Mubarak had been abroad for several months and feared arrest upon landing at Islamabad International Airport.
He argued that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other departments had registered several cases against them, but under the law the petitioners were entitled to seek relief from the relevant forum before any arrest.
After hearing the arguments, the court approved one-day protective bail and restrained the authorities from arresting the petitioners at the airport. The judge further directed both influencers to appear before the IHC today to mark their presence so that proceedings in the pending cases could move forward.
Meanwhile, it was also reported that Butt was being deported from the UK after British authorities cancelled his visa. However, his lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq said in a post on social media platform X that the YouTuber had not been deported from the UK and was returning to Pakistan of his own free will.







Cases against social media influencers
According to official records, the two are nominated in several FIRs registered under various cybercrime provisions, including allegations related to operating or promoting gambling applications, misuse of digital platforms and online harassment. The FIA had earlier issued multiple notices, but their stay abroad meant no substantial progress could be made in the investigations.
In September this year, Butt was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for allegedly promoting online gambling apps on social media.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car.
On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, IK-804, which is said to be the prisoner number allotted to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, in March, Butt was also booked under blasphemy and cybercrime laws due to a “religious stir” caused by the launch of his perfume brand that allegedly mocked Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Butt launched his “295” perfume, which refers to the namesake blasphemy law in the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last December, the YouTuber found himself in legal trouble when he was arrested for illegally keeping a lion cub and weapons at his residence. He pleaded guilty in January this year to owning an undocumented wild animal after accepting the cub as a wedding gift.
He avoided jail by promising a judge to post animal rights videos for a year.</p><small>2025-12-10 07:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10112755fbd2735.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960217/accused-in-doctor-murder-case-remanded-to-police' target='_blank'><strong>Accused in doctor murder case remanded to police</strong></a><br><p>ABBOTTABAD: An anti-terrorism court handed over the accused in the Dr Warda Mushtaq murder case to the police here on Tuesday on a three-day physical remand amid street protests against the medical doctor’s brutal killing in various parts of the province.
Waheed Billa, husband of accused Rida, and others were presented before the ATC, which remanded them in police custody.
In order to prevent any untoward incident in light of the people’s anger, the district administration sealed all cloth shops in the city belonging to Billa’s family. The key accused in the case, Shamrez, is still at large, increasing people’s resentment against police.
Dr Warda was laid to rest in the cantonment area graveyard on Monday night after funeral prayers were offered at 10pm.
Medical staff members of the hospital were among the people who took the body toher house for final rituals.
A pall of gloom descended over the place, with most people having teary eyes. With the doctor’s children, father, brother and other relatives present, some of them fainted. Fellow doctors went to Dr Warda’s grave and placed wreaths.
DIG of Hazara police Nasir Mahmood Satti said the investigation into the murder would consider all aspects.
A special police investigation team under the patronage of DPO Haroonur Rashid has already been formed.
Those named in the case have been arrested, while special teams have been formed to arrest crime facilitators.
“We will fulfil all legal requirements and bring killers and their facilitators to justice,” he said.
Meanwhile, the DPO removed Sub-Inspector Zubair Khan from the post of the SHO at the Cantonment Police Station and appointed Inspector Ali Jadoon in his place.
Health minister Khaliqur Rehman visited the deceased’s house and offered condolences to the family. He pledged all possible support to it.
“The brutal murder of Dr. Warda Mushtaq is a big tragedy. The government is taking it very seriously and will ensure dispensation of justice at all costs. The accused won’t get off scot-free,” he said.
The minister later visited the Benazir Teaching Hospital Abbottabad and met the representatives of the doctors association.
“The safety of doctors is the top priority of our government. Those serving in the health sector are a valuable asset to us,” he said.
He said a JIT had been formed to conduct a transparent investigation into the murder and it was discharging its responsibility in a completely professional manner.
Doctors at the Benazir Shaheed Hospital observed a complete strike.
A condolence reference was also held to pay tribute to the deceased. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees participated and prayed for Dr Warda. They also demanded exemplary punishment for the killers.
The doctors of Ayub Medical Complex staged a protest sit-in on the Silk Road. Along with nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees, they demanded that the killers and their facilitators be brought to justice. The protesters shouted slogans against the district administration and police and demanded the arrest of the SHO of the Cantonment police station and DSP (Cantt).
Also, medical staff members at the tehsil headquarters hospitals in Havelian and Lora staged street protests.
In Mansehra, doctors, paramedics and nurses from across upper parts of Hazara Division observed a complete strike, suspending all health services, except emergency for patients.
They also took to the streets and demanded exemplary punishment for the killers.
Healthcare professionals at public-sector facilities in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts participated in the strike.

In a determination, Nepra said the 33 paise per unit higher charges would be applied to all consumers across the country, including K-Electric, under the quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for 1QFY26. The authority has allowed the positive quarterly adjustments of Rs6.067 billion to be applicable to all consumer categories, except lifeline consumers and prepaid consumers, in three months starting December, it said.
In a separate determination, the regulator also allowed the Power Division to notify its incremental consumption package for industrial and agricultural electricity consumers of ex-Wapda Distribu­tion Companies (Discos) and K-Electric.
Under the package, the reduced rate of Rs22.98 per unit — the marginal cost of power supply — would be applicable to industrial and private agricultural consumers, including both Time-of-Use and Non-ToU categories on their peak and off-peak incremental consumption over the corresponding reference period.
A Power Division spokesperson welcomed the decision and added that under the new tariff structure, the price of additional units for agriculture and industry had been reduced to Rs22.98 per unit from their existing rates of Rs38 and Rs34 per unit, respectively.

 

The package will remain applicable for three years on a monthly basis and the reference months for determining incremental consumption shall be from December 2023 to November 2024. The incremental package is subsidy-neutral for both but will be subject to positive Fuel Cost-Adjustments (FCAs). Further, Quarterly Tariff Adjustments (QTAs), Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) and negative FCAs shall not be applicable on incremental consumption for eligible consumers.
Nepra also released an additional note of its member, technical Rafique A Shaikh, exposing the deep-rooted inefficiencies, theft and mismanagement of power plants, including inadequate utilisation of cheaper plants and greater capacity payments.
Mr Shaikh, who completed his two terms at the regulator, in his departing note said such unnecessary costs arising from inefficiencies should not be passed on to consumers. “Transferring such costs to consumers may lead to an industrial slowdown, reduced GDP growth, increased unemployment, pressure on the current account deficit, weakened socio-economic activities, and an overall deterioration in the quality of life across the country”, he said and demanded that the concerned companies and organisations should bear these inefficiencies themselves.
He pointed out that QTAs primarily reflected variations in the Power Purchase Price (PPP), including the impact of T&D losses. The data clearly showed lower plant factors for thermal power plants operating under ‘Take-or-Pay’ capacity contracts.

The directive came from the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, who expressed displeasure over rising taxes on mobile phones, noting that these institutions have wrongly classified mobile phones as luxury items.
The chairman urged both the FBR and Tax Policy Office to review current tax rates on mobile phone imports under the personal baggage and registration schemes. Mr Qamar said the report should be prepared by March 2026, enabling the committee to examine the matter comprehensively ahead of the next budget.

 

MNA Qasim Gilani criticised the heavy taxes on mobile phones, noting that consumers are forced to pay taxes again if their phones are lost or stolen. He highlighted that smartphones are already very expensive, citing a tax of Rs35,000 on older iPhone 6 models and Rs100,000 on iPhone 12 imports. “People are using smartphones for content creation, video sharing, and e-commerce,” he said, stressing their role in livelihoods.

FBR chairman claims smartphone taxes, prices have declined overall

MNA Sharmila Faruqi pointed out that the latest iPhone costs Rs350,000, with an additional tax burden of Rs190,000. FBR officials clarified that levies are applied on the price of devices rather than on specific models.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig said that a clear mechanism for taxation is essential, rejecting the notion that smartphones are exclusively for the wealthy.
The PTA chairman informed the committee that only six per cent of high-end phones are imported, while the majority are locally manufactured. He also announced that 5G licences are expected to be issued by February-March next year.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that smartphone prices and taxes have declined overall, except for a few major brands. He reported that Rs82 billion in tax revenue was generated from mobile phones in the last fiscal year.
The committee suggested placing smartphones under the Eighth Schedule to provide relief to consumers. Tax officials explained that the Ninth Schedule currently applies to telecom, while the Eighth Schedule offers concessions. They added that, apart from Apple, most smartphones are now manufactured domestically.

A Chinese delegation headed by the Group’s Chairman, Wang Jianbin, accompanied by representatives of China-Pakistan Business Forum, met Minister for the Board of Investment (BoI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, on Tuesday. The delegation conveyed its intention to invest billions of dollars in Pakistan’s solar energy and other high-tech sectors.
Welcoming the proposal, Mr Sheikh said it was “a great time and a golden opportunity for investment in Pakistan”. He highlighted the government’s commitment to improving the business environment, citing recent reforms launched by the prime minister to ease of doing business, including the new single-window Business Facilitation Centre (BFC) process for business facilitation.
As part of its facilitation package, the BOI informed the delegation that the government is prepared to allocate 6,000 acres of land for investment. The minister also briefed the visitors on Special Economic Zones (SEZs), which offer various incentives, including zero income tax for the first 10 years.

Chairman Wang Jianbin meets BOI Minister Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh; proposes multi-billion-dollar investment in solar and high-tech sectors

Mr Sheikh noted that Pakistan is on a path to economic stabilisation, with the stock market index having risen nearly four-to-five-fold over the past year. He reiterated that sectors such as agriculture, solar energy, information technology, chemicals, and manufacturing offer significant growth and export potential for foreign investors.
The meeting also reviewed outcomes of the second edition of the Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference held in Beijing in September this year, which resulted in agreements and joint ventures worth $8.5 billion across multiple priority sectors.
The minister reaffirmed the BOI’s commitment to supporting Chinese investors and called for expediting feasibility studies and joint-venture agreements.
He emphasised that Pakistan remains a strategic partner for China and welcomes high-quality, green-tech investments that will generate jobs and promote sustainable economic growth.

ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet has approved an additional Rs2.56 per litre margin for petrol and diesel to boost the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and their dealers.
A meeting of the ECC, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also tightened rules for second-hand vehicle imports and restricted the import of chloroform solely to drug companies certified by the regulator.







A senior government official told Dawn that the ECC approved a Rs1.22 per litre increase in profit margins for OMCs and Rs1.34 per litre for petroleum dealers, to be implemented in two equal instalments.
The first increase — 61 paise per litre for OMCs and 67 paise per litre for dealers — will take effect with the upcoming fortnightly price revision. This will immediately raise the OMCs’ margin to Rs8.48 per litre and that of dealers to Rs9.31 per litre.
The second equivalent increase will come into force on June 1, 2026, subject to digitalisation of sales and stock networks and their live connectivity with government bodies, including the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Federal Board of Revenue and Petroleum Division.
After this increase, OMCs will charge Rs9.10 per litre while dealers will receive about Rs9.98 per litre, compared to the current Rs7.87 and Rs8.64, respectively.
An official statement said the ECC had approved revising margins for OMCs and petroleum dealers on petrol and high-speed diesel in line with the National CPI for 2023-24 and 2024-25, with increases capped between 5pc and 10pc.
It added that half of the margin increase would be paid immediately while the remaining half would depend on progress in digitalisation, with the Petroleum Division to report back by June 1, 2026.
Vehicle import procedure
The ECC also approved amendments to the vehicle import procedure, retaining only the Transfer of Residence and Gift Schemes, as proposed by the commerce ministry in consultation with other ministries. The Personal Baggage Scheme has now been discontinued.
Under the revised framework, commercial-import safety and environmental standards will apply to these schemes, the allowed import period will be extended from two to three years, and imported vehicles will remain non-transferable for one year.
The changes follow widespread misuse of the Personal Baggage, Transfer of Residence and Gift Schemes under the Import Policy Order (IPO) 2022 — originally intended for genuine overseas Pakistanis — and pressure from local assemblers facing quality competition and foreign exchange concerns.
The decision includes a one-year non-transferability condition for imported vehicles, though enforcement of such rules has historically been weak.
It also increased the minimum stay abroad requirement to three years with at least 850 cumulative days, and retains the condition that vehicles under the Transfer of Residence Scheme must be exported from the same country where the sender resides.
The ECC also approved restrictions on chloroform imports due to its toxic and carcinogenic nature, deciding that Trichloromethane (chloroform) will only be imported by pharmaceutical companies with a no-objection certificate from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap).
The move follows demands from the Pakistan Footwear Manufacturers Association (PFMA) and the Pakistan Chemical Manufacturers Association (PCMA) for a complete ban, arguing that chloroform was being used as an adhesive in the footwear industry and posed serious health and environmental risks.
The ministries of industries and production, climate change, national health services regulations and coordination and FBR supported a complete ban, but Drap argued that chloroform was essential as a laboratory reagent and for quality control testing in pharmaceutical industries.
The ECC also rejected a concessionary gas/RLNG tariff claim by M/s Ghani Glass, saying that such subsidies were no longer permissible and that broader export-support initiatives were already underway.
The meeting approved a Rs1.28bn supplementary grant for the Pakistan Digital Authority to support digital transformation and technological innovation across government departments, and another Rs5bn supplementary grant for the Ministry of Housing and Works.
It also approved, in principle, the release of budgetary allocations for PIA Holding Company Ltd to meet pension and medical expenses of PIACL employees.

The organisations, inclu­ding Amnesty Interna­tional, Save the Children, Human Rights Watch and church groups, urged the government to bring the roughly 1,800 Afghans to Germany from Pakistan before the end of the year.
Those affected must be evacuated in the coming weeks to protect them from deportation back to Afghanistan, the groups said.
The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government, but have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
Around 350 people on the scheme have been able to come to Germany after winning legal challenges against the government in German courts.

UNHCR survey shows only 1.2m of 2m Afghans in Pakistan are registered

According to the open letter sent to the German government by the NGOs on Tuesday, most of those left in Afghanistan are women and children.
“Especially now, during the Christmas season, we remember humanity and compassion. Therefore, we appeal to you: finally bring those to whom we have promised protection to safety,” the letter said.
Those affected include those who served with German armed forces in Afghanistan, as well as journalists and human rights activists.
Germany says it has received assurances from the Pakistan government that the Afghans on the scheme would not be deported before the year end, but this deadline cannot be extended.
UNHCR data
According to the UN refugee agency data released on Tuesday, a population count of Afghans living in Pakistan revealed that they number over 2.18 million, out of whom 1.22m are registered, with only 35pc of registered Afghans living in refugee villages.
It shows over 1.09m registered Afghan refugees holding PoR cards. According to the UN body, this figure does not include 138,701 unregistered members of registered families.
The number of asylum seekers registered with the UNHCR is 115,652, out of which Afghans number 115,390. Others are from Yemen, Iran, Somalia, Myanmar and Syria.
“The statistics of registered asylum seekers have been revised as a result of verification exercise,” the UN refugee agency says.

Additionally, an outdated criminal justice system and institutional overreach contribute to civil rights violations. What lies ahead for Pakistan’s children is the more pressing aspect. Not only are millions without essential services — food, education and health — they are also forced into labour and illicit trade. Even their existence is ignored by the state: The Human Rights Review noted that only 42pc of children under five were registered at birth. Pakistan, with some 26m children out of school, has allowed the education emergency to persist. Education statistics show that 40pc of children have only a slim chance of acquiring a primary education. This is worsened by the displacement and destruction wrought by both extreme weather patterns and turmoil in KP and Balochistan. According to a World Bank report, poverty caused by climate change will hover over 49m people in South Asia by 2030. Every statistic signifies a future adult lost to exploitation and indigence. 
For a society that has rearranged itself around uncertainty and scarcity, this year’s theme, ‘our everyday essentials’, which upholds food, water, “peace and justice as core rights, not abstract ideas”, is a distant dream. Climate and economic calamities, conflict and an increasingly polluted environment have brought Pakistan to the brink of a hunger crisis. As per new estimates, 11m people are likely to face food insecurity, with elevated levels of severe malnutrition in Sindh and KP. This is a fearsome state of affairs that has led to a sense of deprivation among citizens. Human rights are crucial entitlements upheld with enforceable laws. Instead of restricting its focus to economic misfortunes, the state must intervene with urgent pro-people policies that prioritise nutrition and shelter for women and children, alongside climate-resilient agriculture and access to clean water. Moreover, educational and healthcare reforms cannot be postponed. As transforming these structures is an extended process, mobile units must ensure steady learning and well-being for affected children. The state’s inability to realise that a human rights system is only possible when politicians are answerable for rights excesses, has left our young wedged between deprivation and illiteracy.
