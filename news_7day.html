Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.
Imran has decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the protest and ordered PTI members to immediately shun all their differences. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja previously said the party has no plans to gather workers at a specific place for the Aug 5 agitation, and instead it will protest at different locations across the country.
An order issued yesterday by Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hassan Waqar Cheema said it was brought to his attention by the District Intelligence Committee (DIC) that there was an “imminent threat” within the limits of Rawalpindi district — particularly surrounding sensitive installations, prominent roads and other critical infrastructures — that may pose a serious risk to human life, public property, and the overall peace and order of the district.
“The DIC has reported specific intelligence suggesting that certain groups and elements are actively mobilising with intentions to disturb the law and order situation through large gatherings, protests, and disruptive assemblies,” the order read.
“The forum further indicates that these elements may target soft locations and mobilise individuals with the potential to engage in violent actions near key installations and other sensitive sites, thereby endangering the public peace and tranquillity,” it added.
It continued that it was essential to ensure the security of the people and installations and buildings against any potential threat or untoward activity, in the larger interest of public safety, security, peace and tranquillity to avoid any untoward incident.
DC Cheema said that he was prohibiting the following activities within the district from Aug 4-10 under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger) of the Code of Criminal Procedure:

Assemblies, gatherings, sits-in, rallies, processions, demonstrations, protests and such other activities with a gathering of five or more people
Carrying weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence
Displaying arms and objectionable and hateful speeches
Attempting to remove any restriction imposed by a police officer to regulate the assembly of people or the movement of traffic
Pillion riding.
Using loudspeakers

Separately, the Adiala Jail superintendent requested the Rawalpindi city police officer to beef up security.
“It is awfully brought into your notice that PTI political worker, family members, especially sister of PTI leader are used to protest against the Jail administration and other state institutions, particularly outside the Jail. It has come to our attention through electronic/social media that PTI leadership is planning to stage a protest outside this jail tomorrow on Tuesday, which could potentially lead to an untoward incident,” the request read.
“Given the sensitivity of the situation, it is imperative to strengthen the outer security of the jail to maintain law and order. Proactive measures must be taken to identify and apprehend any miscreants involved in organising this protest,” it added.
“Furthermore, strict action should be enforced to prevent such gatherings near the jail premises to avoid any disruption or security risks. Additional police guard deployment, barricades, and surveillance may be necessary to deter unlawful assemblies and ensure the safety of the facility. Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated. Therefore, it has become a dire need of the hour to beef up the security (from all sides) of the jail to evade an unpleasant situation in future.”
It urged that, in light of the above, additional personnel be deployed at the jail and its surrounding areas urgently to strengthen the facility’s outer security under the supervision of police officers so that any unpleasant incident could be avoided.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ said the federal government had received a request two days ago, but no one had followed up on it despite attempts by the Islamabad administration to contact the sender.
He said there were opposing narratives and viewpoints coming from within the PTI about the nature of the protest, adding that the party should not blame the government for its own “internal division and weakness”. Chaudhry said the government was “clear” that any protest was the PTI’s right.
The state minister questioned why the administration was not directly contacted and the party did not give legal cover to its protest.
The PTI had approached the Lahore High Court last week, seeking permission to hold a public rally at Minar-i-Pakistan on Aug 5.
It has also submitted a request to the Islamabad administration for holding a workers’ convention at F-9 Park tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the capital police have begun preparations. Officers had told Dawn.com that in the first phase, the Anti-Riot Unit of the police started exercises, physical training and refresher anti-riot courses at the Police Lines Headquarters.
Over a thousand personnel of the unit are undergoing refresher courses. The courses include physical training and exercises to make them fit and respond to the protesters with full energy.
Besides, they are also doing refresher courses on the usage and handling of anti-riot kits. They are getting training regarding the usage of shields to protect themselves and the force from stones and other objects that may be pelted at them.
Furthermore, they are also being trained on how to intercept mobs at certain points, cordon them off and disperse them. They are also learning how to deal with troublemakers and protesters taking law and order into their hands.
On the other hand, police have also started collecting details of local PTI leaders and activists besides keeping an eye on their activities. The intelligence units of the police have mounted surveillance over the leaders and hardcore members of the PTI.
Surveillance at all hotels, motels, inns and guest houses along with cthe apital’s suburbs and outskirts has also been increased to monitor the PTI workers’ activities and get information about their stay and gatherings. The police intelligence units were also asked to prepare fresh lists of local PTI leaders.</p><small>2025-08-04 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0423430430744a4.jpg?r=234548' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928717/two-shot-dead-three-injured-in-karachis-gulistan-i-johar-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two shot dead, three injured in Karachi’s Gulistan-i-Johar: police</strong></a><br><p>Two men were gunned down and three others were wounded in a suspected targeted attack in Gulistan-i-Johar on Monday evening, according to police.
Gulshan Superintendent of Police (SP) Ahmed Iqbal Memon told Dawn.com that five persons were shot and injured by unidentified gunmen at Pehlwan Goth, near the Sindh-Balochistan Housing Society.
“The injured were taken to a nearby private hospital, where two of them were pronounced dead,” Memon said, adding that the exact motive was being ascertained.
Meanwhile, a statement from Sharqi police station read that the victims were sitting at a battery shop at the time of the incident.
“Initial information suggests that two motorcyclists came to the shop and opened fire,” the statement read. “There are reports about the presence of a car at the scene but these are being confirmed.”
The statement added that forensic evidence has been collected from the crime scene, including bullet casings.
East Senior Superintendent of Police Dr Farrukh Raza said in a statement that police were receiving “different information” about the possible motives of the incident from the area.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for a religio-political party, Syed Ali Ahmed Zaidi, told Dawn.com that the shooting was a targeted killing, as one of the victims was the son of a prayer leader in the locality.
“One of the deceased … is the son of Maulana Rajab Ali Bangash, who is the prayer leader of a mosque in the area,” Zaidi said. “All of the victims were Ahle Tashi, who originally hailed from Gilgit-Baltistan,” he added.
One of the party’s leaders, Allama Sadiq Jafri, condemned the incident in a statement, saying, “We demand the immediate arrest of the suspects involved in this incident. The increase in target killings puts a question mark on law enforcement agencies.”
He added: “The network of sectarian extremists is becoming active again.”
Earlier this week, a senior lawyer was shot dead while his son was hurt in a suspected targeted attack in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the firing took place after a funeral prayer at a mosque in DHA Phase 6.
“As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG said. “Both father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.”</p><small>2025-08-04 18:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04224607e225cac.jpg?r=224846' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928714/us-could-require-up-to-15000-bonds-for-some-tourist-visas-under-pilot-programme' target='_blank'><strong>US could require up to $15,000 bonds for some tourist visas under pilot programme</strong></a><br><p>The United States could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme launching in two weeks, a government notice said on Monday, an effort that aims to crack down on visitors who overstay their visas.
The programme gives US consular officers the discretion to impose bonds on visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays, according to a Federal Register notice.
Bonds could also be applied to people coming from countries where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient, the notice said.
US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a focus of his presidency, boosting resources to secure the border and arresting people in the country illegally.
He issued a travel ban in June that fully or partially blocks citizens of 19 nations from entering the US on national security grounds. Trump’s immigration policies have led some visitors to skip travel to the US.
Transatlantic airfares dropped to rates last seen before the Covid-19 pandemic in May and travel from Canada and Mexico to the US fell by 20 per cent year-over-year.
Effective from August 20, the new visa programme will last for approximately a year, the government notice said. Consular officers will have three options for visa applicants subjected to the bonds: $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000, but will generally be expected to require at least $10,000, it said.
A similar pilot programme was launched in November 2020 during the last months of Trump’s first term in office, but it was not fully implemented due to the drop in global travel associated with the pandemic, the notice said.
The State Department was unable to estimate the number of visa applicants who could be affected by the change. Many of the countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban also have high rates of visa overstays, including Chad, Eritrea, Haiti, Myanmar and Yemen.
Numerous countries in Africa, including Burundi, Djibouti and Togo, also had
high overstay rates, according to US Customs and Border Protection data from fiscal year 2023.</p><small>2025-08-04 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04204159fdaa0b3.jpg?r=204206' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928704/trump-warns-he-will-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns he will ‘substantially’ raise tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil.
Trump last week said he would impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India and added that the world’s fifth-largest economy would also face an unspecified penalty, but gave no details. Later, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Over the weekend, two Indian government sources told Reuters that India will keep purchasing oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. In turn, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller had accused India of effectively financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow.
In a post on Truth Social today, Trump assailed New Delhi for buying Russian oil and then selling it.
“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,” Trump wrote. “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine.
“Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,” the US president wrote.
 


Responding to the threat, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement claiming that the US and the European Union “targeted” New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
“India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,” the statement read. “The US at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy market stability.”
The MEA highlighted in its statement that the very nations criticising India were engaging in trade with Russia themselves, adding that the goods exchanged include energy, fertilisers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.
“Where the United States is concerned, it continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its electric vehicle industry, fertilisers, as well as chemicals,” the MEA statement added.
“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.”
 






India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
Last week, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end.</p><small>2025-08-04 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0421122200ceae2.jpg?r=212323' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928707/fm-dar-rubio-hold-second-phone-call-since-us-visit-amid-improving-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar, Rubio hold second phone call since US visit amid improving bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday held his second phone call with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio since visiting Washington and an improvement in bilateral ties.
There has been a surge in relations between the US and Pakistan, with both nations inking a trade deal last week in which Washington lowered tariffs on Islamabad to 19 per cent, while tapping the latter’s oil reserves. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation in the arrest of an Islamic State-Khorasan operative to claiming credit for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president’s day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’.
In a post on X today, the Foreign Office (FO) stated that the two top diplomats had their most recent interaction over the phone.
“The two leaders discussed a range of bilateral matters and exchanged views on current regional and international issues,” the FO stated. “Both sides agreed to remain in contact and continue cooperation on areas of mutual interest.”
 






FM Dar had met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.
The meeting — the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years — was considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US. Secretary Rubio had recognised Pakistan’s “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a “constructive actor” in efforts to ensure regional stability.
The two had subsequently talked again on July 28 after their “productive meeting” and discussed key bilateral matters, including tariffs, as well as regional & global issues of mutual interest.

The incident comes a few days after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.
According to Battagram police Public Relations Officer Ghulam Nabi, “The uncle of the victim allegedly gunned down his niece in the name of honour.”
A first information report (FIR) dated Aug 4, seen by Dawn.com, said that the incident occurred during the early hours of Monday.
In the FIR, the suspect confessed that he had been a guest at his brother’s house for two days. “My brother went outside at night and told me to take care of the house,” the FIR quoted him as saying.
He further said that he heard the sound of the gate of the house opening at around 2am, prompting him to wake up.
“Using a flashlight, I saw that my niece was at the gate and going out with three people.”
Upon seeing his niece leaving the house, he fired at the victim and the cartridge ran out, the FIR read.
The suspect said that the victim’s mother gave him a pistol, adding, “After chasing them, I deliberately fired at Zahida Bibi out of honour.”
The firing killed the girl and injured one boy, while the other two people fled the scene, the FIR said.
The police arrested the suspect and recovered the weapons used in the crime.
The case was registered at the Battagram city police station under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempt to murder) and 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 15 AA-KPK.
Last week, a couple was shot dead by the woman’s family over ‘honour’ in Balochistan’s Mastung district.
On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-08-04 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0421300484f5764.jpg?r=213008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928708/mardan-police-arrest-four-in-teenage-girl-viral-video-case' target='_blank'><strong>Mardan police arrest four in teenage girl viral video case</strong></a><br><p>Police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan on Monday arrested four individuals in a case involving a viral video wherein suspects were involved in the harassment of a teenage girl.
The action was taken on KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s instructions after the incident was highlighted by journalists.
“A video of a young girl had gone viral on TikTok in which the girl was being harassed by men while she was dancing at a private event,” Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan said.
He added that the Mardan police took prompt action and arrested four people.
“The men physically harassed the victim, who was used to be sent to private parties by her relatives.”
The police spokesperson said that after the video went viral on TikTok, journalists including Asad Ali Toor brought up the issue with the KP chief minister, who then ordered the Mardan District Police Officer (DPO) Zahoor Babar Afridi to take action.
“The girl’s grandmother and close relatives are among the arrested individuals, who used to send the teenage girl to private dance events for the sake of money.”
Khan said that a first information report has been lodged at the City police station and further invetigation into the case is underway.
Separately, DPO Afridi asked citizens in a statement to keep watch on their children and protect them from getting involved in such immoral activities.
“Public should report incidents like exploitation of children and abuse to the police” the statement quoted him as saying.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
Last month, the Punjab Police said they arrested a man suspected of molesting a minor girl in Multan district after a video of the incident went viral online.
Also, last month, police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Punjab’s Kasur district went viral online.</p><small>2025-08-04 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04175926ea1a3da.jpg?r=204620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928694/moving-beyond-limits-how-one-student-from-kp-defied-disability-to-top-matric-exams' target='_blank'><strong>Moving beyond limits: How one student from KP defied disability to top Matric exams</strong></a><br><p>Muhammad Sudais Khan, a 17-year-old student from rural Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has emerged as a remarkable symbol of perseverance, proving that physical limitations cannot suppress determination and talent.
Born as a disabled person, who had both his hands and one foot rendered non-functional, Sudais faced an uphill journey on the road to getting an education.
This year, not only did he sit for his Matriculation examinations under the Peshawar Board, but he also shocked the community by scoring an impressive 890 marks, all accomplished with just one toe.
Despite all the hardship, Sudais answered each question using the only working toe on his left foot, without ever letting his physical constraints define his potential.
His achievement, unprecedented and inspiring, has turned him into a symbol of resilience and a role model for people of all abilities across KP and beyond.
“I was not expecting this much appreciation from the people,” Sudais told Dawn.com.
He said that his public school was very supportive of him, saying that “my friends and school fellows never let me feel my disability”.
A biology teacher at his school, Abdullah Jan, called him an example for the world, saying, “His success is a motivation for students.”
Sudais had to face various challenges to mark his name in this spot. Being a disabled person is full of hardships, including mobility issues. “More than the disability, the transportation was a bigger challenge for me,” he said.
He added that his school was about seven to eight kilometres away from his home, adding, “I had very limited resources to fulfil my transportation needs.”
Sudais’s parents were happy and surprised at the same time about his success. His father, Muhammad Nawaz Khan, who drives a Qingqi rickshaw, told Dawn.com that walking from home to school was a barrier for Sudais.
“Every morning, I had to take him in a Qingqi for 7-8km to his school,” he said, adding that Sudais’ education was the goal. He continued, “We will work hard for his education.”
Sudais quoted his mother as saying: “I am the happiest mother today.” He further shared his mother’s remarks, stating: “Besides all of your barriers, I had a feeling that you (Sudais) will get success where everyone will get to know you.”
 

Peshawar Division Commissioner Riaz Mehsood greets Sudais Khan in Peshawar, Aug 2. — DawnNewsTV

Sudais’ achievements have become talk of the town, with government officials offering rewards for his hard work after his exemplary success.
Peshawar Division Commissioner Riaz Mehsood invited Sudais and his family, awarding him with cash and certificates. “With one hand and a foot disability, this is a big success,” Mehsood said. “We will further help Sudais in his educational struggle,” he added.
MPA Laik Muhammad Khan also acknowledged the hard work and motivation of the young student and announced a Rs50,000 cash prize for him. “More children will learn from his example,” he said.
As Charsadda celebrates one of its brightest stars, Sudais’s story reminds us all that courage can break any barrier when paired with opportunity.</p><small>2025-08-04 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04195018d59173a.jpg?r=195159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928701/pakistan-approves-first-ever-ferry-licence-for-routes-to-iran-gcc-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan approves first-ever ferry licence for routes to Iran, GCC countries</strong></a><br><p>The maritime affairs ministry on Monday approved its first-ever ferry service licence to an international ferry operator, authorising the company to operate routes connecting Pakistan with Iran and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Last month, the ministry announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with GCC countries.
The approval followed a high-level meeting of the licensing committee, comprising officials from maritime affairs, defence, foreign affairs, and interior ministries, along with representatives from the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation as well as port and shipping authorities.
According to a statement issued by the ministry, Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry hailed the move as a historic step aligned with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision and Pakistan’s National Maritime Policy.
“This licence creates the opportunity for boosting regional connectivity, religious tourism, and economic activity via sea routes,” he emphasised.
The new ferry service is expected to serve hundreds of thousands annually, particularly pilgrims travelling to Iran and Iraq, alongside workers and tourists bound for GCC states.
“The ferry service will alleviate pressure on land routes and reduce travel costs compared to air transport for the Pakistani diaspora and religious travellers,” he noted.
“Initial operations will commence from the ports of Karachi and Gwadar using modern ferry vessels equipped with essential amenities to ensure safe, affordable travel. Expansion of routes and port calls is planned based on demand and bilateral agreements,” he added.
“This ferry service launch forms part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to develop its blue economy, improve trade logistics, and promote maritime tourism, reflecting a renewed commitment to sustainable regional sea transport infrastructure.”
Last week, amid a deadlock in negotiations over the government’s decision to ban land travel to Iran for pilgrims during Arbaeen — the chehlum of Imam Husain — the Maritime Mini­stry was deliberating to launch a ferry service to facilitate travel of zaireen (pilgrims) to Iran and Iraq.
Last month, five private companies proposed routes for the newly announced ferry service from Gwadar to the Gulf region, according to the maritime ministry.</p><small>2025-08-04 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041837437bbf2a0.png?r=183829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928666/pm-shehbaz-announces-rs4bn-for-mapping-damage-reconstruction-of-gb-after-floods' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces Rs4bn for mapping damage, reconstruction of GB after floods</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced Rs4 billion for mapping damage to infrastructure in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and reconstruction efforts following recent floods in the region.
The prime minister was on a one-day visit to GB to review monsoon damages and distribute relief funds to flood-affected people. The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
A statement posted on the X account of state broadcaster PTV News said PM Shehbaz emphasised the need for timely preparation to deal with natural disasters and announced a Rs4bn fund for infrastructure restoration and the activation of a 100-megawatt solar project soon. The PM also laid the foundation stone for a Daanish School.
 






Addressing a cheque distribution ceremony for flood affectees, he recalled, “A huge cloudburst occurred here, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.”
Noting the loss of lives and the damage caused to people’s property, the premier prayed for those who died and for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“I have come here specifically to express my sympathies and to assure you that I will keep coming here till you get resettled in your homes,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan was in the “red zone” of 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the prime minister underscored that both federal and GB governments had to work around the clock to combat climate change.
 


He ordered the early completion and functioning of the advanced weather warning system in GB and noted that Pakistan required preparedness to ward off damage and losses from climate change and weather-related disasters.
The prime minister said that he was visiting GB, along with cabinet members, to express sympathy with the affected families and assured them that they would be rehabilitated, adding that the federal government departments and the relevant departments in GB would work closely for this purpose.
PM Shehbaz said he had directed the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority to conduct mapping of the damages and submit a report in this regard, adding that he would visit the area in August.
Earlier, the prime minister distributed cheques containing compensation amounts among the family members of those who lost their loved ones in the recent rains and floods.
Chief Minister Gilgit Baltistan Haji Gulbar Khan, in his remarks, highlighted the damages, rescue and relief activities in the region after recent floods.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions Engineer Amir Muqam lauded the prime minister for his commitment and dedication to the public welfare projects.
He said, contrary to the past, GB’s budget had now been increased to Rs186 billion annually.
Premier orders weather alert system for tourist spots
Earlier today, PM Shehbaz chaired a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains. He termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”.
He emphasised that an advanced weather alert system must be established for tourist destinations based on seasonal forecasts, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
 
 

The prime minister said local populations should be resettled away from natural water passageways to help prevent emergencies in the future.
He also ordered the NDMA and the climate change ministry to jointly establish a forecasting and monitoring centre for GB in the coming months.
A comprehensive system must be developed for immediate rescue and assistance in emergency situations, the premier stressed. He instructed the NDMA to ensure close cooperation with provincial governments and relevant institutions to enhance rescue and relief efforts.
“All rehabilitation measures for those affected by the recent monsoon must be completed promptly,” PM Shehbaz asserted, issuing directives for a survey of damage to roads and infrastructure, and the restoration of communication links in all affected areas on a priority basis.
The Ministry of Climate Change informed the meeting about progress on the ongoing installation of an early warning system for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), with the premier ordering its completion in two months.
Regarding the July 21 heavy rains in GB’s Thak-Babusar, Thor, Kundus, and Ishkoman areas, the meeting was informed that over 600 people were rescued, while damaged roads were repaired and reopened to restore connectivity, APP reported.
 
 

Five tent villages were established for rescue operations, and 10 helicopters, along with two C-130 aircraft, were deployed to transport stranded tourists and individuals to safe locations.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz instructed Water Minister Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo to remain in GB to complete consultations and planning for a better water management system.
PM highlights ‘key role’ of the climate change ministry
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter.
He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.
Emphasising that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.
He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.
“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the top 10 countries that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” PM Shehbaz noted.
 






Recalling the devastating 2022 floods, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”
In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred losses worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.
PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.
The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of Daanish Schools he had promised. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.
He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.
“I will try to ensure this project’s completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.”
Premier meets with GB CM, governor
During his day trip, PM Shehbaz held separate meetings with the GB governor and chief minister to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.
Governor Shah briefed the prime minister on the flood situation and damages caused by the recent rains, as well as on the progress of development projects underway in Gilgit, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.
The governor also updated the premier on the region’s overall law and order situation. Recently, GB’s Tangir district witnessed two honour killing incidents within a week, taking the lives of four people.
In his meeting, CM Gulbar informed PM Shehbaz about the rescue and relief activities in the wake of the monsoon rains, Radio Pakistan reported.
Gulbar, an estranged member of the PTI who was backed by the PML-N and PPP during his election as chief minister, appreciated the premier’s decision to establish Daanish schools in GB.
They also discussed the law and order situation in GB and progress on development projects.
 






Federal govt cooperation akin to oxygen: GB govt
Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.
 






The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.
“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” PTV said.
In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister. GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods.”
As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters.
 
 

“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.
Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were rescued today, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.
Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts.
On Friday, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members went missing after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.
Glof alert issued for GB, KP ahead of likely rains
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued an alert for an increased risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The alert noted that a wet spell was likely to affect both regions in the current week as “scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls”, were expected.
 






As per the PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country from today till Thursday.
 






At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04184401477fa06.jpg?r=192927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928697/coas-aims-to-build-a-more-sustainable-multi-faceted-relationship-with-america-report' target='_blank'><strong>COAS aims to build a more sustainable, multi-faceted relationship with America: report</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is aiming to build a sustainable and multi-faceted relationship with the United States, British magazine The Economist reported on Sunday.
Relations between Washington and Islamabad have grown deeper since US President Donald Trump took office. On July 31, both nations struck a trade deal lowering US tariffs on Pakistan to 19 per cent, while also establishing an agreement to explore Pakistani oil reserves.
In June, the COAS made a five-day official visit to the US, where he met with Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. During the trip, Field Marshal Munir stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.
 
 

The COAS’ visit followed a four-day military confrontation with India in May, after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
“There he was, enjoying a private lunch with Donald Trump in the White House on June 18, just over a month after Pakistan’s brief conflict with India,” The Economist wrote about the June luncheon.
“Then, at the end of July, came further snubs for India: branding it a ‘dead economy’, Mr Trump imposed tariffs of 25pc while hailing a new trade deal with Pakistan.”
The Economist wrote that the field marshal’s fortunes “reflect a shift in American policy that affects India, China and the Middle East”.
Speaking to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, The Economist quoted him as saying that Field Marshal Munir is “well versed” with The West, despite not having trained in the US or the UK.
“To India’s dismay, America and Pakistan are now rebuilding ties with a focus on trade, counter-terrorism and consultation on Middle Eastern policy.
America may even sell arms again to Pakistan,” the magazine noted.
Additionally, The Economist recognised that Pakistan recently earned Washington’s praise for killing and capturing leaders of a local offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group.
In June, United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.
“He (Munir) has sparked interest from Trump associates in Pakistan’s crypto and mining sectors … and he has positioned Pakistan as a potential means to advance America’s interests with Iran and its efforts to get more Muslim countries to establish diplomatic ties with Israel,” the magazine wrote.
America, in turn, toned down its criticism of Pakistan’s programme to
build longer-range ballistic missiles, which officials from former president Joe Biden’s administration considered a threat to the US, The Economist wrote.
“It has resumed some aid programmes [and] it is also considering selling weaponry, including armoured vehicles and night-vision goggles, to help Pakistan combat local insurgents.
“American officials are examining Pakistan’s evidence to support its
claims that India backs those insurgencies, although they are unconvinced, so
far.”
In January, prior to Trump’s inauguration as president, the US said Pakistan played a pivotal role in US counterterrorism efforts over the years, but it “has never been a formal ally bound by treaty obligations”, according to former White House official John Kirby.
Meanwhile, Pam Bondi, who is currently serving as the US attorney general, emphasised during her confirmation hearing that global cooperation would be essential to counter the growing threat posed by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups like Islamic State-Khorasan Province.</p><small>2025-08-04 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04190101e1cb154.jpg?r=190251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928698/russia-urges-caution-in-nuclear-rhetoric-after-trump-comments' target='_blank'><strong>Russia urges caution in nuclear ‘rhetoric’ after Trump comments</strong></a><br><p>Russia urged caution on Monday after United States President Donald Trump said he would deploy two nuclear submarines following an online row with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.
Trump said he had ordered the deployment in response to what he alleged were highly provocative comments by Medvedev, saying the submarines would be positioned in “appropriate regions”.
Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.
“Russia is very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation. And we believe that everyone should be very, very cautious with nuclear rhetoric,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including from AFP, on Monday.
The row between Medvedev and Trump erupted against the backdrop of the US leader’s ultimatum for Russia to end its military offensive in Ukraine or face fresh economic sanctions, including on its remaining trading partners.
Medvedev — one of Russia’s most prominent anti-Western hawks — accused Trump of “playing the ultimatum game” and said that Trump “should remember” that Russia was a formidable force.
“Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,” he said.
 






Medvedev, who has not posted on social media since the spat, is currently the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. He served one term as president from 2008 to 2012, effectively acting as a placeholder for Putin, who was able to circumvent constitutional term limits and de facto remain in power.
The chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday backed Trump’s actions.
“The concept of peace through strength works,” Andriy Yermak wrote on social media.
“The moment American nuclear submarines appeared, one Russian drunk — who had just been threatening nuclear war on X — suddenly went silent.”

The Lahore-based player won the Tekken 7 tournament in Japan in 2019 as well as the Evolution Championship Series in the US. In August 2022, he finished third in the EVO 2022 Tekken 7 competition. He won the Tekken 7 competition at EVO Japan 2023 in April 2023 and gained his 5th EVO title in July 2024.
EVO 2025 was held at the Las Vegas Convention Centre from Aug 1-3.
Siddique repeated history to win his 6th EVO title against fellow Pakistani and a former member of the team founded by Ash himself, Atif Butt.
EVO posted the winning moment on X with Ash using Nina Williams and Butt using Anna Williams, characters from the Tekken fighting game franchise who are sisters, terming it “greatness on another level”.
 






“I’m feeling so blessed,” EVO quoted Ash as saying after his win and becoming a six-time title holder, adding that he remains “grateful in victory”.
 






“Our player Arslan achieves the Evo World Championship for the sixth time in his career. The right path to achieving the World Cup, God willing,” said his e-sports club, Saudi Arabia’s Twisted Minds, further calling Ash by his moniker as the greatest of all time (GOAT) in the competitive Tekken scene.
“Six-time EVO champion. Undisputed GOAT of Tekken.”
 






Ash himself said in a post on Instagram: “Six EVO titles. What started as a kid grinding in gaming arcades became something I never imagined. Thank you to everyone who believed in me. This is for Pakistan.”

“I’m still not able to get over the thought of how I ended up in second place again. Just like last year’s Evo final, runner-up once again. Anyway, I sincerely want to thank everyone for their support,” said runner-up Butt.
 






Yuta “Chikurin” Take rounded out the top three in third position.

Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.
After deadly floods swept across GB’s Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of seven people had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region’s death toll stands at 10.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, “The funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.”
He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. “All vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,” he said.
“[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,” he added.
Last week, the GB government had intensified the search operations on Babusar Highway.
Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.
5 family members rescued after 4 days in Ghizer
Separately, five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer district have been rescued and taken to a safe place, Ghizer’s Rescue 1122 said today.

According to Ghizer Rescue 1122’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.
“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told Dawn.com.
“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”
According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.
On Thursday, cloudburst-induced floods in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The next day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had resulted in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-04 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04113959388fab5.png?r=114024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928646/pakistan-clinch-series-win-2-1-after-defeating-west-indies-by-13-runs' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan clinch series win 2-1 after defeating West Indies by 13 runs</strong></a><br><p>Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub combined for a 138 opening partnership and Pakistan defeated the West Indies by 13 runs on Sunday to capture their T20 International Series.
Pakistan won the series opener by 14 runs but dropped the second match by two wickets to set up a Sunday night decider at Lauderhill, Florida.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Pakistan were rewarded with a powerhouse performance by Farhan and Ayub.
 






Pakistan went 189 for four as Farhan hammered the hosts for 74 runs on 53 balls, smashing five sixes and three fours, while Ayub lasted 19 overs, finishing on 66 from 49 balls with two sixes and four fours.
Farhan was caught by West Indies captain Shai Hope at long off from a delivery by Shamar Joseph on the second ball of the 17th over.
Hasan Nawaz entered but was retired after only 15 runs, caught by Romario Shepherd at long off from a delivery by Roston Chase on the penultimate ball of the 18th over.
Mohammad Haris was run out for only two runs by Gudakesh Motie to start the 19th over and Ayub finally exited on the last ball of the penultimate over,
Jason Holder’s delivery grabbed by Sherfane Rutherford at sweeper cover.
Set 190 to win, West Indies struck for 30 runs on the first 10 balls from Hasan Ali and Mohammad Nawaz.
Jewel Andrew was caught by Hasan Ali at long on, bowled by Haris Rauf for 24, the first West Indies wicket falling at 44.
Ayub caught Hope bowled out by Nawaz for seven in the ninth over with the hosts still 116 runs from victory.
Alick Athanaze lasted 13 overs before being taken for 60, caught by Khushdil Shah bowled by Ayub with West Indies on 110, needing 80 runs off the last 42 deliveries.
Chase was retired on the last ball of the 17th over and his replacement, last-ball hero Holder from the win a night earlier, was bowled out by Sufiyan Muqeem two balls later for a duck, leaving the hosts 41 runs shy with 16 balls remaining.
Rutherford smashed a six to reach a half-century with seven balls remaining before exiting on 51 as West Indies couldn’t pull off another last-over comeback.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated the cricket team on its win, praising players’ determination and teamwork.
“Pakistani players won hearts by playing their best game,” he said in a statement. “Hopefully, the national team will continue to achieve successes in the future.”
 






While congratulating the players, Prime Minister also praised PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and the team management on the victory.
In a post on X, he “expressed the hope that team would prepare for the upcoming matches with even greater hard work and dedication to continue this streak of success”.

However, the audio in the clip is doctored.
On July 31, an X user, who seemed to be Indian from previous posts, shared a video that showed a split frame of Bilawal in the National Assembly and Indian politician Gaurav Gogoi in the Lok Sabha.
In the clip, Bilawal could allegedly be heard saying: “Who attacks in the dead of the night? We can easily do propaganda in front of the Indian prime minister. Our people are sitting in their parliament.”
The caption of the post said: “Our people are sitting in India’s parliament — Bilawal Bhutto. Hello Gaurav Gogoi Asm ji, who are those ‘our people’ of Bilawal Bhutto sitting in the Indian Parliament?”
It gathered more than 100,000 views and was shared 5,200 times.
The same video was also shared by other Indian accounts, as can be seen here, here and here.
The video was also shared by Indian accounts on Instagram, as seen here.
Moreover, an image of Bilawal along with the statement “our people are sitting in their parliament” was also shared by Hindutva accounts as can be seen here, here, here and here, racking up 611,378 views collectively.
None of the posts provided any other additional details about the context of the alleged video, such as when it was from or a link to the full address.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as well as current relations between the neighbouring countries.
Observing the video revealed inconsistencies in Bilawal’s audio in the clip, the most prominent among them being issues in lip-syncing, the mispronunciation of “prime minister”, and the use of Hindi words.
Reviewing the alleged clip via reverse image search showed that Bilawal’s video is actually from May 7, 2025, when he spoke in the National Assembly on the four-day India-Pakistan conflict.
In his original speech, the former foreign minister said: “Only thieves and cowards attack at night. If they had even an ounce of courage, they would have announced their attack during the day.”
 


He added: “We do not condone war and never have, but India should brace itself because Pakistan is yet to respond, and it will not do so during the night, or on the basis of lies, but as per international laws and UN Charter.”
The same was also corroborated by a keyword search that yielded reports by credible news outlets Dawn and Express Tribune, both of which did not report anything on Bilawal talking about the Indian parliament.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows Bilawal saying “our people are sitting in India’s parliament” is false. The video is doctored and dubbed over.

England, set 374 to win, were bowled out for 367, with fast bowler Siraj taking 5-104, including a sensational burst of 3-9 on Monday’s final morning.
It is India’s narrowest winning margin in a Test match.
“To be honest, it is so amazing,” Siraj told Sky Sports. “From day one to here, everyone fought so hard, so we are very happy.
 






“I just wanted to make sure I hit the right areas, the wickets would fall, and anything else would be a bonus.
“When I woke up, I believed I could do it.”
After resuming on 339-6, England lost four wickets for 28 runs on the final morning of a dramatic series.
The home side were soon 354-8 after Siraj, the leading bowler on either side this series, struck twice to remove Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton.
When injured England last man Chris Woakes came in to bat with his left arm strapped up owing to an injured shoulder, England still needed 17 more runs for victory.
Gus Atkinson hit a six off Siraj before England got the target down to single figures.
But Siraj set the seal on a superb series by bowling Atkinson (17) as he knocked over the batsman’s off stump to spark delirious scenes among the India team and their supporters in south London.
India were without Jasprit Bumrah at the Oval after deciding to stand by a decision to only play the world’s top-ranked Test bowler in three games of this five-match series.
Siraj, who featured throughout, ended the series with 23 wickets at 32.43.
Smith and Overton had struggled to get the ball off the square on their Surrey home ground on Sunday.
And with play starting Monday beneath grey skies, conditions favoured India’s quicks.
Overton pulled the first ball of the day, from Prasidh Krishna, for four – a shot greeted by huge cheers from England fans in an impressively large Oval crowd — and under-edged the second for another boundary
Siraj took up the attack from the Pavilion End and promptly twice beat Smith on the outside edge.
And with the third ball of his over Siraj had Smith caught behind, without the batsman adding to his score, to leave England 347-7.
The next delivery saw new batsman Atkinson edge the lion-hearted Siraj just short of the slip cordon.
But it was his Surrey county colleague Overton who fell next, lbw for nine to a Siraj ball angling into his pads. Overton reviewed but Kumar Dharmasena’s decision was upheld on umpire’s call.

England had been cruising to victory while Harry Brook (111) and Joe Root (105) were sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 195 on Sunday.
However, Brook’s exit sparked a mini-collapse, with England losing three wickets for 36 runs and Root also among those dismissed.</p><small>2025-08-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04172320de84d57.png?r=172353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691/pakistan-issues-another-tender-to-buy-01m-tonnes-of-sugar-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues another tender to buy 0.1m tonnes of sugar, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, European traders said on Monday.
The quantity is double the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is August 11.
The announcement is believed to indicate that Pakistan will make no purchase in its previous tender for 100,000 tonnes of sugar on July 31, traders said.
On July 8, Pakistan’s government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
 
 

Traders said three companies had participated in the July 31 tender, with the lowest price offer assessed at $539.00 a tonne cost and freight included (c&f).
Pakistan reportedly received no offers in a previous tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar on July 22, with traders saying the requirement to load shipments from August 1-15 was too short notice for realistic offers.
The new tender seeks small/fine and medium grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel, packed in bags transported either in ocean shipping containers or breakbulk.
Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1-15 for 50,000 tonnes and September 10-25 for 50,000 tonnes. For 50,000 tonnes of sugar in ocean shipping containers, shipment can also be made between September 1 and 20.
Shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20.
Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.
 
 

During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.
Despite the export surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.
Last week, the government decided to enforce strict monitoring of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04123958291465c.jpg?r=132737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928670/police-arrest-3-for-allegedly-gang-raping-woman-in-abbottabad' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 3 for allegedly gang-raping woman in Abbottabad</strong></a><br><p>Police on Monday arrested three suspects who allegedly gang-raped a woman last week in the Bakot area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district, springing into action after the incident sparked social media outrage.
Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the suspects had allegedly gang-raped a woman from Rawalpindi on Wednesday.
“District Police Officer (DPO) Umar Tufail took action and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects after the incident was highlighted on social media, including Facebook and TikTok,” Spokesperson Afzal said.
He added that the Bakot station house officer (SHO), Arshad Khan, was sent to the village, where he had also found the local community angered over the incident.
 
 

On the SHO’s complaint, a first information report (FIR) was lodged at the Bakot police station yesterday under sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 375A (rape) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, police arrested the suspect who owned the house where the woman was allegedly raped by him and his friends.
The FIR added that one of the suspects brought the woman to his friend’s house in his car from Rawalpindi, where he and his friends raped her, one after the other. In his statement, the homeowner confessed to committing the crime while also identifying his two accomplices.
The police stated in the FIR that the accomplices were also arrested, while a search for the victim continued and the investigation was underway.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In July, a newlywed 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari, who was admitted to a hospital in critical condition after an alleged marital rape and “brutal sexual violence” at the hands of her husband, succumbed to her injuries. Her spouse was arrested by the police.
Earlier that month, Karachi police arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p><small>2025-08-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041314300568515.jpg?r=131556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928668/shameless-actions-pakistan-condemns-israeli-ministers-storming-al-aqsa-mosque' target='_blank'><strong>‘Shameless actions’: Pakistan condemns Israeli ministers storming Al-Aqsa mosque</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, calling Tel Aviv out for its “shameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region”.
Early on Sunday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, shielded by Israeli police, led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B’Av, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.
“This sacrilege against one of Islam’s holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.
 






He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.
The prime minister said that Israel’s “shameless actions” were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.
“Pakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” PM Shehbaz added.
The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.
“The presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‘the Temple Mount is ours,’ are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‑Aqsa Mosque,” the statement said.
It said that Israel’s expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.
“These provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.”
The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‑Aqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
 
 

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 60,839 and injured nearly 149,000 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office.
Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Last month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
On July 29, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the UN and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.

The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
According to a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Sindh, the trailer was travelling at a high speed when it crashed into a bungalow in DHA Phase 2.
He said that as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the urban search and rescue team, along with two ambulances and one disaster response vehicle, rushed to the scene.
“Two people trapped as a result of the collision were rescued safely,” he said, adding that they were transported to the hospital via ambulance with minor injuries. He added that both of the injured victims were trailer staff.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the two people trapped were the driver and cleaner of the trailer, who were rescued and taken to the hospital “after immediate medical assistance”.
“The police of the bungalow have contacted the owners, who are currently in Islamabad,” the DIG said.
He added that according to initial investigations, the accident occurred as a result of slippery conditions on the road due to rain.
Accidents frequently occur in the metropolis due to violations of traffic rules, with speeding and unsafe overtaking being major contributing factors. Speeding increases the risk of crashes and the severity of injuries, while unsafe overtaking often leads to head-on collisions.
Last month, a 59-year-old man was killed when a dumper truck ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad. The incident angered area residents, who damaged the truck and beat the driver before police intervened.
Earlier in the same week, at least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, while a separate collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p><small>2025-08-04 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04111541342bb32.jpg?r=111939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928661/76-dead-dozens-missing-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>76 dead, dozens missing after migrant boat sinks off Yemen</strong></a><br><p>At least 76 people have been killed and dozens are missing after a boat carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants sank off Yemen, in the latest tragedy on the perilous sea route, officials told AFP on Monday.
Yemeni security officials said 76 bodies had been recovered and 32 people rescued from the shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden. The UN’s migration agency said 157 people were on board.
The accident occurred off Abyan governorate in southern Yemen, a frequent destination for boats smuggling African migrants hoping to reach the wealthy Gulf states.
Some of those rescued have been transferred to Yemen’s Aden, near Abyan, a security official said.
UN agency the International Organisation for Migration earlier gave a toll of at least 68 dead.
The IOM’s country chief of mission, Abdusattor Esoev, told AFP that “the fate of the missing is still unknown.”
Despite the civil war that has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a key transit point for irregular migration, in particular from Ethiopia which itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict.
Each year, thousands brave the so-called “Eastern Route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea route last year, with 462 from boat accidents.
Last month, at least eight people died after smugglers forced migrants to disembark from a boat in the Red Sea, according to the UN’s migration agency.
The vessel that sank off Abyan was carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants, according to the province’s security directorate and an IOM source.
Yemeni security forces were conducting operations to recover a “significant” number of bodies, the Abyan directorate said on Sunday.
On their way to the Gulf, migrants cross the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Red Sea that is a major route for international trade, as well as for migration and human trafficking.
Once in war-torn Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, migrants often face other threats to their safety.
The IOM says tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Yemen and suffer abuse and exploitation during their journeys.
In April, more than 60 people were killed in a strike blamed on the United States that hit a migrant detention centre in Yemen, according to the Houthi rebels that control much of the country.
The wealthy Gulf monarchies host significant populations of foreign workers from South Asia and Africa.</p><small>2025-08-04 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041057439d08bcd.jpg?r=110120' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928551/couple-shot-dead-over-honour-in-rajanpur-a-year-after-love-marriage' target='_blank'><strong>Couple shot dead over ‘honour’ in Rajanpur a year after love marriage</strong></a><br><p>DERA GHAZI KHAN: A man and a woman who had married of their own free will a year ago were shot dead on Sunday, allegedly by the woman’s brother in the jurisdiction of Muhammad Pur Dewan police station in Rajanpur district.
Rajanpur District Police Officer (DPO) Farooq Amjad told Dawn that Saqlain, son of Ghulam Sadiq, a resident of Muhammad Pur Dewan, had contracted marriage with Ayesha Bibi, a year ago, without the consent of her family.
He said that on Sunday, when the couple was in their house, the armed suspect barged in and opened indiscriminate fire, leaving his sister and her husband dead on the spot.
The DPO said that on being informed of the incident, the police acted promptly and arrested the suspect.
 
 

The police, after collecting evidence from the crime scene, moved the bodies to the hospital for autopsy.
According to initial investigation, the double murder was committed over ‘honour’. A case is yet to be registered.
NOSE CHOPPED OFF: Four assailants chopped off the nose of a man in a brutal attack in the limits of Kot Mubarak police station on Sunday.
According to the police, four men attacked Jumma Oghani, a resident of Jumma Chowk, and after overpowering him, chopped off his nose with a sharp object, leaving him seriously injured.
The injured man was shifted to hospital.
Police sources say that the victim was in litigation with the attackers.
Police are conducting raids to apprehend the culprits.

“Around 20 armed men attacked the 132kV grid station in the wee hours, causing massive damage to the grid station,” Qesco officials said on Sunday.
The armed men snatched the 12-bore rifle from the security guards and vandalised the premises while holding the staff at gunpoint. They opened fire inside the grid station, damaging the control room, high-power transformer, current transformers, conservator tank, radiator tubes, AC/DC panels, auxiliary panels, and other essential electrical equipment, according to a Qesco spokesperson.
After holding the staff and guards at gunpoint for some time, the attackers reportedly threatened them to vacate the premises immediately or risk losing their life. Subsequently, the staff and guards fled to safety.
Later, Qesco officials submitted a written complaint to the local police station to lodge an FIR against the attackers.
Separately, some men sabotaged the 132kV Yaro industrial transmission line near Kuchlak Bypass by creating a technical fault using ropes.
 
 

During a joint patrolling operation with local administration and police, nearly 700m of conductors and various electrical components were found stolen.
The electric company later filed a written request with the police to pursue legal action against those behind the transmission line theft.
The spokesperson expressed serious concern over the rising number of sabotage and theft incidents targeting power infrastructure in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Dasht, and Sibi in recent weeks. The attacks not only disrupted power supply but also posed a significant threat to public safety and national assets, he added.
The Qesco appealed to all consumers to assist in protecting national infrastructure by reporting any suspicious activity related to theft or tampering of transmission lines.

• Blames rupee devaluation for hike despite near same fuel prices
ISLAMABAD: The price of electricity is expected to increase by one-fourth over the next eight years, according to a power division forecast, after a 50per cent increase in the past three years due to massive currency devaluation.
The average tariff is projected at Rs29.70 per unit by 2034, up by Rs5.70 from the existing rate of Rs24, said the power division in a working paper shared with stakeholders in the last week of July.
The report said the increase in tariffs over the last three years can largely be attributed to the rupee’s depreciation which led to “second round effects of inflation and a contractionary monetary policy that further escalated overall tariff”.
The average power purchase rates increased by almost 50pc from Rs16.77 per unit to Rs24.88 between FY2022 and 2025.
This included about a 115pc increase in annual capacity charges from Rs971bn to about Rs2.1tr, although energy payments slightly dropped by 11pc from Rs1.43tr to Rs1.27tr.
All in all, power purchase rates increased by almost 250pc to Rs24.88 per unit in FY2025 from Rs7.17 per unit in FY2016 before the induction of mega power projects, mostly under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as capacity charges surged from Rs275bn to Rs2.1tr, an increase of 660pc, according to the power division.
Exchange rate impact
The power division said the average base tariff largely remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY25 in dollar terms ($0.12 per unit).
However, due to exchange rate losses, effective base rate jumped 44pc to Rs35.50 per unit from Rs25 as capacity charges increased by 66pc to Rs18.4 per unit compared to Rs11 per unit.
The energy price was reported at Rs10.94 per unit in FY25 against Rs10.2 in FY23, a nominal change. According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.
The fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.
Therefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.
The overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.
Despite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.
Going forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.
Deindustrialisation
The power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.
“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.
The power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.
Further compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.
The power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.

Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told Dawn on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional agreement of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.
Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.
“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.

Third round of talks between local elders and terrorists continues for several hours

On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook post also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.
However, in a social media post shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.
 
 

Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.
The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.
ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.
They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, bombing at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.
The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.
JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.
“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.
He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.
The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.
 
 

Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.
The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.
The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.
