In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said that the two-week-long exercise — which began on Friday and is being held at the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) in Pabbi — will focus on the “counterterrorism domain, involving professional contingents from the armies of Pakistan and the US”.
Officials from both sides attended the opening ceremony, it added.



“The exercise is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and interoperability through the sharing of counterterrorism experiences, while further refining tactics, techniques, and procedures essential for effective CT operations,” the statement said.
“Emphasis is being laid on marksmanship skills during urban warfare, as well as on understanding each other’s operational doctrines and best practices,” it added.
The military’s media wing termed the exercise of “vital importance“, stressing its role in “addressing evolving security challenges, improving professional military standards, and strengthening the capacity of both forces to operate in complex counter-terrorism environments”.
“‘Inspired Gambit 2026’ reflects the continued commitment of Pakistan and the US towards collaborative efforts for peace and stability,” ISPR added.

Dr Sidhu is currently serving as the chairman of the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), a position he assumed in August 2023.
Under his leadership, the CCP witnessed significant institutional turnarounds in its history. Within two years, the CCP reduced its court case backlog by over 70 per cent, with 434 cases decided out of 567 pending matters, helping restore the regulator’s credibility and enforcement capacity.
During Dr Sidhu’s tenure, the CCP recovered approximately Rs1.36 billion in penalties. In contrast, its total recoveries in the last 20 years were merely Rs20o million. The regulator also imposed over Rs2bn in fresh penalties through new enforcement actions.
As CCP head, Dr Sidhu launched a renewed crackdown on cartels and market abuse, initiating major investigations and actions against cartels in poultry, sugar, edible oil, telecom, and medical services. Several of these actions were upheld by the Supreme Court and the Competition Appellate Tribunal, providing strong judicial validation to CCP’s enforcement work.
Dr Sidhu also placed strong emphasis on consumer protection and deceptive marketing enforcement. The CCP imposed significant penalties on companies operating in real estate, FMCG, education, pharmaceuticals, and automobile sectors. These included Kingdom Valley, Unilever, FrieslandCampina Engro, Al-Ghazi Tractors, Hyundai Nishat, British Lyceum and 3N Lifemed, sending a clear signal against misleading business practices.

 

A major institutional reform during his tenure was the launch of the Market Intelligence Unit (MIU), CCP’s first AI-powered surveillance arm. This initiative marked a shift toward data-driven, proactive detection.
On the market facilitation front, the CCP processed 139 mergers across 34 sectors during Dr Sidhu’s tenure. High-profile transactions included the PTCL–Telenor merger, Shell Pakistan’s sale to Wafi Energy, and several deals in financial services, energy, and logistics. The PTCL–Telenor merger order, in particular, was widely noted by stakeholders for balancing investment facilitation with competition safeguards.
The CCP also set up a centre of excellence in competition law. Its purpose was to carry out competition assessment studies to modernise the legal and regulatory framework in every sector of the economy.
According to the CCP website, Dr Sidhu holds a Bachelor’s degree in law, an LLM (Master’s in Law) in banking, insurance and international business law, and a PhD from the University of Manchester. His doctoral research was focused on the investor protection and regulation of stock exchanges in the United Kingdom, the United States and Shariah-compliant stock exchanges.
He also earned a postgraduate diploma in civil litigation from the Manchester Law Society and certifications in mortgage and financial advice from the London Institute of Banking and Finance.
With over 20 years of professional experience, Dr Sidhu has worked with insurance companies, law firms and financial institutions in the UK, as well as government ministries in Pakistan.
Prior to joining CCP, Dr Sidhu had served as a senior legal consultant at the Ministry of Law. He has also worked in the Privatisation Commission in a similar role, and remained a research associate with leading academics in UK universities.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101532182a1146a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966188/kp-cm-sohail-afridi-stops-in-jamshoro-en-route-to-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi stops in Jamshoro en route to Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>HYDERABAD: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday reached Jamshoro district as the PTI’s caravan made its way to Hyderabad for a day-long trip to mobilise the public for a nationwide street movement.
CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests, which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.
Sindh United Party (SUP) President Syed Zain Shah welcomed CM Afridi upon his arrival at the G.M. Syed Edifice.







In a post on Facebook, the SUP demanded the release of “all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, Ali Wazir, Mahrang Baloch, and Moro [incident’s] prisoners“.



Hours earlier, the PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the SUP was ready to welcome Afridi, with a stage set.







In a post on its official X account, the PTI detailed the KP CM’s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he will address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”.
The party agenda also lists an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar.
The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent.
In a post, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh told reporters that Jamshoro district’s Kotri city was among the party caravan’s stops.
Departure from Karachi
“[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced Sheikh shortly after 12pm.
“God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier.







Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.”
Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”.
“We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed.







“Toward Hyderabad for street movement [sic],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja.







Sheikh also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza.







We are patriots of Pakistan: Salman Akram
Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others, gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy.
Umer Dar, the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present.
Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said.
The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”.
“We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”.
“We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said.







A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, including the Mazar-i-Quaid gathering and a meeting with the All City Tajir Ittehad Association in Karachi.
The schedule stated that Afridi would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12) morning.

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “Pakistan Navy demonstrated its operational readiness and combat preparedness through a comprehensive exercise in the north Arabian Sea, showcasing both conventional and unmanned capabilities, as per dictates of evolving naval warfare.
“The exercise included the successful live firing of LY-80 (N) surface-to-air missile from a vertical launching system at an extended range, validating the long-range capabilities of Pakistan Navy’s modern air defence systems,” said ISPR.



It said that the missile “successfully engaged and neutralised an aerial target, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s robust air defence capabilities”.
It added that the exercise also featured the “successful engagement” of surface targets using loitering munition, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s precision strike capabilities.
It added that the loitering munition successfully engaged and destroyed surface targets.
“Successful open-sea trials of an unmanned surface vessel were also conducted, marking a significant leap in autonomous naval technology. The trials validated the platform’s ability to combine high-speed performance with mission-critical durability,” it said.
“Key capabilities demonstrated include extreme manoeuvrability, precision navigation and weather resilience,” it said, adding that an unmanned surface vessel offered a low-risk, high-impact solution with the stealth of a tactical interceptor.
It added that the Pakistan Fleet commander witnessed the exercise, which showcased Pakistan Navy’s ability to “employ advanced systems”.
It stated that Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended officers on their “professionalism and operational competence”.
He reaffirmed Pakistan Navy’s resolve to “ensure seaward defence of Pakistan and safeguard national maritime interests under all circumstances”, it added.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10142921ee6a521.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966191/jui-f-leader-succumbs-to-injuries-following-blast-in-lower-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F leader succumbs to injuries following blast in Lower South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area.
Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia.
He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way.
Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible.
The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years.
In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”.
“This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values.
“Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said.
Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”.
He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away.

 

Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection.
The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas.
“The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented.
He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state.
“This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.”
Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents.
He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”.







Peace committee chief unhurt in blast
Separately, a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted the vehicle of peace committee chief Qadeem Khan in the Barwand area of South Waziristan’s Servekai tehsil.

Upper South Waziristan DPO Arshad Khan said that the vehicle sustained significant damage in the attack, but the peace committee chief escaped with minor injuries.
Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital.
The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.</p><small>2026-01-10 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091811575324ab3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966003/consent-on-trial-how-pakistans-courts-are-failing-rape-survivors' target='_blank'><strong>Consent on trial: How Pakistan’s courts are failing rape survivors</strong></a><br><p>Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Supreme Court (SC) set aside a rape conviction, changing it to fornication (consensual sex out of marriage), reducing a 20-year sentence to five years and slashing the fine from Rs500,000 to Rs10,000, sparking fresh calls for better protections for Pakistani women.
“Such judgments do not give confidence to women to come out and report sexual violence perpetrated on them,” said Ayesha Farooq, chairperson of the government-notified Committee of the Anti-Rape Investigation and Trial Act, formed in 2021.
Despite protective legislation, 70 per cent of gender-based violence (GBV) incidents go unreported. Of those reported, the national conviction rate stands at just 5pc, with some categories as low as 0.5pc and domestic violence convictions at 1.3pc.
Senator Sherry Rehman highlighted the stark figures: in 2024, Islamabad recorded just seven convictions out of 176 reported rape cases. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported one conviction from 258 cases, Sindh reported no convictions despite 243 cases, and Balochistan recorded 21 rape cases with no convictions.
Legal precedent or social regression?
Nida Aly, Executive Director AGHS Legal Aid Cell, said, “I have never felt so disappointed in our judiciary. Judges have failed as a gender-competent forum and lost credibility.”
The SC case involved a survivor who, in 2015, was raped at gunpoint while relieving herself in the woods. She reported the incident seven months later; DNA tests confirmed the accused as the father of her child. The trial court convicted him, and the Lahore High Court (LHC) upheld the verdict. Yet at the SC, two of three judges reclassified the act as fornication, citing the complainant’s silence, lack of resistance, and absence of physical marks. Section 496-B of the Penal Code prescribes five years of imprisonment and a Rs10,000 fine for fornication.
This reasoning drew sharp criticism from the National Commission on the Status of Women, which said consent cannot be inferred from silence, delayed reporting, or lack of resistance, and urged courts to recognise the realities of trauma, fear, coercion, and power imbalances in sexual violence cases.
Ironically, after the recasting of the case, the woman was exempted from punishment.
She was reminded of another case of rape in 2024, where a woman accused her brother’s friend of rape.
“The same judge converted the conviction of rape into fornication along with arguments like “the woman showed no resistance; there were no marks of violence” and there was a two-day delay in reporting to the police.
Justice Ayesha Malik’s dissenting note arguing there was no “standardised” rulebook response by the victim emphasised consent.
Jamshed M. Kazi, UN women country representative, said such cases resonate far beyond the courtroom. “The language used and the conclusions reached shape not only legal precedent but also social attitudes, survivor confidence, and public trust in justice.”
He added, “For survivors of sexual violence, judgements can leave lasting marks on the lives of women and girls, affecting how their experiences are believed and remembered, and may discourage reporting, reinforcing silence, fear, or self-doubt among survivors.”
Another case saw the LHC dismiss rape complaints against a husband because he was still legally married, even though he raped the woman at gunpoint. The judge, while maintaining the conduct of the man to be “immoral” and “inappropriate under religious or social norms”, said it was not a crime since the marriage continued to exist legally at the time of the incident.
“The judge focused on the validity of the marriage and completely disregarded the woman’s claim of non-consent and being subjected to forced sex at gunpoint,” pointed out Aly.
Marriage, consent and the law — A dangerous grey area
While there is no explicit provision criminalising marital rape, the Protection of Women (Criminal Law Amendment) Act, 2006 removed marriage as a defence to rape. When the definition of rape was substantially revised under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2021, no marital exemption was reintroduced.
Between 1979 and 2006, Maliha Zia, Director, Gender, Inclusion & Development at the Karachi-based Legal Aid Society, explained, marriage operated as a defence to rape because the law defined rape as sexual intercourse by a man with a woman “who is not his wife” under specified circumstances. The deliberate removal of the words “not his wife” in 2006 therefore eliminated marriage as a defence, a position that has remained unchanged since.
“The 2006 Protection of Women Act was an important step; it corrected major injustices by separating rape from zina (unlawful sexual intercourse – including adultery and fornication),” said Dr Sharmila Faruqui, a member of the National Assembly.  “But it stopped short of clearly saying that lack of consent within marriage is also rape and that silence has allowed old assumptions to survive.”
Faruqui stressed the need for judicial sensitisation, particularly at senior levels, but noted that judges are ultimately bound by the law. “When the law is unclear, even well-intentioned interpretations can go wrong,” she said. She called for legislative clarity — through a penal code amendment or another carefully considered route — emphasising that consent, grounded in dignity and equality, must remain central regardless of marital status. “Marriage was never meant to be a license for violence.”
This was endorsed by Zia, who has been among the trainers of judges who hear GBV cases. “Much work needs to be done to constantly sensitise the justice sector on women’s experiences and the trauma they go through due to sexual violence. “Many work on the assumption that the woman is most likely lying, especially if she didn’t fight or run or report straight away,” she added.
To its credit, Pakistan, under the anti-rape act of 2021 special courts were notified to look into GBV cases. To date there are 174 such courts. Unfortunately, these courts are not exclusively handling GBV cases, said Zia.
But even with this limitation, rape case convictions in Sindh rose to 17pc in 2025, from 5pc in 2020, when such courts did not exist. “Imagine how much better it could be!” According to her, in districts where there is a high caseload of GBV, courts should be exclusive, not necessarily more.

According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, who on a visit to Iraq, called on Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi.
The two met at the Iraqi Air Force headquarters, where the ACM Sidhu received a guard of honour upon his arrival, it said.
“Discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, with emphasis on joint training, capacity building and improving operational cooperation,” ISPR said.







During the meeting, ACM Sidhu “highlighted the deep-rooted religious, cultural, and historical ties between Pakistan and Iraq”.
He also “reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to support the Iraqi Air Force in training and capacity development”.
The statement said the pair “agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability”.
Meanwhile, the Iraqi air chief commended PAF’s “professionalism and technological advancement”.
The statement added that he also expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.
The commander also appreciated Pakistan for its role in regional stability, it said.
“The visit underscored the shared resolve of both air forces to further strengthen defence ties and professional collaboration,” ISPR added.
The JF-17 Thunder aircraft are jointly developed by Pakistan and China. Earlier this week, Bangla­desh had expressed an int­e­rest in the “potential pro­cu­r­e­ment” of JF-17 Thun­der aircraft.
Meanwhile, reports have emerged stating that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10123026b822291.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966185/how-cuba-was-blindsided-by-audacious-us-operation-to-capture-nicolas-maduro' target='_blank'><strong>How Cuba was blindsided by audacious US operation to capture Nicolas Maduro</strong></a><br><p>The capture by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and the killing in the operation of 32 Cubans assigned to protect him represent a major blow for the island’s revered intelligence services, experts say.
Fearful of betrayal by dissenters within Venezuela’s ranks, the leftist Maduro — like his late mentor Hugo Chavez — sourced his security detail in communist-ruled Cuba.
But the Cubans proved little match for the US special forces sent by helicopter to snatch Maduro from a military compound after US jets had pummelled Venezuela’s air defences.
Of the 32 Cubans killed — along with 23 Venezuelan troops — 21 were from the Cuban interior ministry, which oversees the intelligence services, officials said.
The remaining 11 were from Cuba’s military.
Experts consulted by AFP agreed that the key to the seamless execution of the US operation — meticulously prepared for months, in complete secrecy — was the element of surprise.
But former Venezuelan military officer Jose Gustavo Arocha of the Center for a Secure Free Society, a US think tank specialising in defence issues, also suggested that Cuba had misjudged the threat.
Cuban intelligence “convinced the Maduro regime and its security agencies that the United States would never attack on Venezuelan territory,” Arocha said.
Former US intelligence officer Fulton Armstrong, who is now a Latin America researcher at American University in Washington, also pointed to intelligence failures.
Chief among them, he said, was the failure to anticipate the attack and then to detect helicopters entering Venezuela’s airspace.
“Even a five or 10-minute warning would have made a massive difference for the guards and for Maduro,” the former CIA agent said.
US forces, however, had a major advantage in the form of stealth drones, used to monitor the Venezuelan leader’s movements in real time, as well as more advanced weapons and combat gear.
Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba and Venezuela, argued that Cuban intelligence underestimated US access to “insider cooperation in Venezuela” — an informant within Maduro’s camp.
Citing sources close to the operation, The New York Times reported that a CIA source within the Venezuelan government revealed Maduro’s location.
The United States had issued a reward of $50 million for information leading to his capture.
Aura of invincibility
For decades, the Cuban secret service, trained during the Soviet era by the KGB, enjoyed a reputation for invincibility.
Besides having foiled some 600 assassination attempts against late leader Fidel Castro, Cuba was reputed for its ability to infiltrate foreign intelligence services and recruit high-ranking informants, particularly Americans.
The most recent case to come to light was that of Victor Manuel Rocha, a former US diplomat sentenced in 2024 to 15 years in prison after working for over four decades for the Cuban state.
But Cuba “didn’t adequately read the Trump administration,” said Arocha, noting that the administration’s National Security Strategy unveiled in December clearly articulated Trump’s goal of asserting US dominance over Latin America.
Washington had regularly denounced Cuba’s role, since the 2000s, in the Venezuelan security apparatus.
The routine response from Caracas and Havana was that Cuba, in return for Venezuelan oil supplies, provided its ally with doctors and humanitarian workers.
Arocha argued that “so many years … doing the same thing successfully” blinded the Cubans to Trump’s willingness to defy diplomacy and international law, so they did not see him coming.
The Republican leader stunned the world by ordering the capture of the Venezuelan president in what his administration said was a law enforcement operation that did not require authorisation from Congress.
“All the capabilities of Cuban intelligence were blocked for the first time in the region … because their traditional methods became irrelevant against this new decision-making style,” Arocha said.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10111853ccf8ee7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966181/spotlight-on-pak-india-conflict-again-as-trump-continues-to-make-case-for-nobel-peace-prize' target='_blank'><strong>Spotlight on Pak-India conflict again as Trump continues to make case for Nobel Peace Prize</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Friday continued to make a case for him deserving the Nobel Peace Prize, yet again highlighting his role in ending the May 2025 conflict between Pakistan and India.
Taking media queries after a meeting with oil and gas executives at White House in Washington, Trump was asked about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s offer to share her Nobel Peace Prize with the US president.
“Norway is very embarrassed with what took place,” Trump said; the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.
“Whether people like Trump or don’t like Trump, I settled eight wars — big ones,” Trump said — a claim that he has repeated in the past.
“Some going on for 36 years, 32 years, 31 years, 28 years, 25 years. Some just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already eight jets were shot out in the air,” Trump said.
He pointed out that he arranged a ceasefire between the two countries in “rapid order without nuclear weapons”.







“I can’t think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel prize more than me, and I don’t want to be bragging but nobody else settled wars. Obama got the Nobel prize. He had no idea why. He still has no idea,” Trump said, calling former US president Barack Obama a “bad president”.
“You should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. These were major wars. These were wars that nobody thought could be stopped. President Putin called me [and] he said about two of the wars that he’s been trying to stop them for 10 years [but] he wasn’t able to do it. He couldn’t believe it,” Trump said.
“So, in theory, you should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. Every war was major. But I don’t care about that; I care about saving lives. I’ve saved tens of millions of lives,” he added, before recalling his Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in September.
“The prime minister of Pakistan came here and he made a very public statement. He said that President Trump saved a minimum [of] 10 million lives having to do with Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging.”
Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations.
The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries.

 

India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
Initially stating that five jets were shot down during the May conflict — albeit without specifying of which side — Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October, and then eight in November.
He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “highly respected general”, a “great fighter” and “my favourite”.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101134470a33d42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966182/fo-urges-pakistanis-to-avoid-unnecessary-travel-to-iran-amid-growing-unrest' target='_blank'><strong>FO urges Pakistanis to avoid unnecessary travel to Iran amid growing unrest</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Saturday issued a travel advisory urging Pakistani nationals to avoid unnecessary travel to Iran amid growing unrest in the neighbouring country.
In a statement, FO said, “For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all unnecessary travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran until conditions improve.”
It also advised Pakistani nationals residing in Iran to exercise “extreme caution, remain vigilant, minimise non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani missions” in Tehran, Zahidan and Mashhad.







The FO also shared the phone numbers for the Pakistan embassy in the three cities; Tehran +98-21-66-9413-88/89/90/91, +98-21-66-9448-88/90, +98 910 764 8298; Zahidan +98 54 33 22 3389, +989046145412; Mashhad +98 910 762 5302, +98 937 180 7175.
Protests have taken place across Iran for nearly two weeks in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
Iranian rights group HRANA said on Friday it had documented at least 62 deaths, including 14 security personnel and 48 protesters, since demonstrations began on December 28.
At the start of January, US President Donald Trump had warned that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters.
In response, in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei on Friday called the demonstrators “vandals” and “saboteurs”.
In a speech broadcast on state TV, he said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians”, in apparent reference to Israel’s June war against the Islamic republic, which the US supported and joined with strikes of its own.
He predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.
For his part, Trump issued a new warning to Iran’s leaders on Friday, saying: “You better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too.”
“I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that’s a very dangerous place right now,” he added.
Earlier this week, Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said Islamabad firmly opposed any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, including Iran, in its first public comments since protests erupted.
He said Pakistan viewed the situation in Iran as an internal matter and rejected external pressure or aggression. The spokesperson stressed that Pakistan did not wish to comment on Iran’s internal developments.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10090200e75b734.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966064/low-gas-pressure-disrupts-domestic-kitchens-amid-cold-snap-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Low gas pressure disrupts domestic kitchens amid cold snap in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: As the mercury dropped to a single digit in the city for the first time this winter, low gas pressure in cooking stoves, running on natural gas supply from Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC), has affected a large number of households, compelling them to postpone breakfast preparation at homes for students, office workers, and others.
As winter hit the city, people have begun lighting bonfires on street corners to keep themselves warm. Gatherings at steaming soup shops have also increased.
At the same time, warm-clothing shops and stores are experiencing a sudden rush of customers.
However, citizens are experiencing a sudden fall in gas pressure with the start of the cold spell, a pattern that repeats every winter, piling misery on people.

Chilly winds, gas shortage pile miseries on citizens; SSGC concedes ‘technical fault’ affecting supply

The SSGC acknowledges the problem, saying that the utility is short of30 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) from one of their fields, which is causing low pressure in parts of the city.
Many residents have complained that the gas pressure has dropped sharply over the past three days, forcing them to turn to costly LPG cylinders as an alternative.
“I woke up to barely a whisper of gas in the morning,” grumbled a disgruntled resident of the Defence Housing Authority, adding that the pressure was so low that the tea wouldn’t even boil.
Sehrish Rehan, a resident of Saddar, said that the situation was the same every winter and she had already bought an LPG cylinder to cope with the situation.
“Expecting normal gas supply during winters in Karachi is just living in a fool’s paradise,” she quipped.
A SSGC spokeswoman told Dawn that the gas utility was presently dealing with a shortfall of roughly 30 mmcfd of natural gas from one of its production fields.
She said that the reduction stemmed from an unexpected ‘technical problem’ at that field, which had cut its output and left the utility with less gas than it needed to maintain normal distribution pressures.
The spokesperson said that because the overall supply was now tighter, some districts of the city were seeing lower-than-standard pipeline pressure.
She said to manage the crunch, the government approved load management plan prioritised domestic use.
“Fertiliser plants have been shut off and weekly industrial closures are being enforced.”
The spokesperson said that the field issue was expected to be fixed by early next week, after which the overall supply should improve.
The dip in pressure has affected household cooking, heating, and the operation of appliances that rely on a steady gas flow.
She said that the SSGC was grappling with a severe gas shortfall as winter approaches.
“Over the past five years, supply has fallen 57 per cent from 1,156 mmcfd in201819 to 660 mmcfd this year, widening the demand and supply gap,” she added.
She said that in Balochistan, winter demand spiked from 6080 mmcfd to 170180 mmcfd and the gas utility was now delivering 180 mmcfd there to keep households running in subzero temperatures.

Bessent said he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since last summer’s summit of G7 leaders, and finance ministers had already held a virtual meeting in December.
India was also invited to attend the meeting, Bessent told Reuters in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries. He said he was unsure if it had accepted the invitation.
It was not immediately clear which other countries had been invited.
The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada, as well as the European Union, most of whom are heavily dependent on rare earth supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.
Australia signed an agreement with the US in October aimed at countering China’s dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leveraged Australia’s proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.
Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.
China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47 per cent and 87pc of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defence technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

Western countries have sought to reduce their dependence on China’s critical minerals in recent years, given moves by China to impose strict export controls on rare earths.
Monday’s meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.
Bessent said China was still living up to its commitments to purchase US soybeans and ship critical minerals to US firms.</p><small>2026-01-10 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101022346378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966179/11-terrorists-killed-in-2-intelligence-based-operations-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 terrorists killed in 2 intelligence-based operations in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that security forces killed eleven terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said the operations were carried out on Jan 8 and that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said that an IBO was conducted by the security forces in North Waziristan district on the reported presence of terrorists. During the operation, troops engaged the terrorists, and six were killed after an “intense fire exchange”.
“Another joint IBO by police and security forces was conducted in Kurram district. In the ensuing fire exchange, five khawarij were effectively neutralised,” it said.







The statement said weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and the target killing of innocent civilians”.
It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists in the area, adding that the counterterrorism campaign would continue at “full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the “professional capabilities of the armed forces” for the successful operations.
“We will continue the war against terrorism until it is completely eliminated,” the premier said, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
He said that Pakistan’s armed forces, as well as the police, remained engaged in combat with the enemies of the country.
“The entire nation, including myself, stands shoulder to shoulder with the security forces in their unwavering resolve to protect the homeland,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “the role of security forces and law enforcement agencies in protecting the lives and property of the people is commendable”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
In a press conference earlier this week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.</p><small>2026-01-10 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1010253295dc3ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966180/venezuela-says-in-talks-with-us-to-restore-diplomatic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuela says in talks with US to restore diplomatic ties</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela said on Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, days after US forces deposed Nicolas Maduro as its president.
It was the latest sign of cooperation following the leftist leader’s capture and US President Donald Trump’s claim to be “in charge” of the South American country.
Officials said US diplomats were in Caracas to discuss reopening the country’s embassy, while in Washington, Trump met with oil companies over his plans to access Venezuela’s huge crude reserves.

 

The government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez “has decided to initiate an exploratory diplomatic process with the government of the United States of America, aimed at re-establishing diplomatic missions in both countries,” Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement.
John McNamara, the top US diplomat in neighbouring Colombia, and other personnel “travelled to Caracas to conduct an initial assessment for a potential phased resumption of operations,” a US official said on customary condition of anonymity.
Venezuela said it would reciprocate by sending a delegation to Washington.
Rodriguez, in a statement, condemned “the serious, criminal, illegal and illegitimate attack” by the United States and vowed: “Venezuela will continue to confront this aggression through the diplomatic route.”
Trump vows oil investments
Trump said earlier on Friday that he had called off a second wave of attacks on Venezuela due to the prisoner releases.
The US president had suggested he might use force again to get his way in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
At a White House meeting on Friday, he pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela’s reserves, but was met with a cautious reception — with ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissing the country as “uninvestable” without sweeping reforms.
Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, “but now you have total security. It’s a whole different Venezuela.”
He also stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela’s oil resources.
Trump earlier said that oil companies promised to invest $100 billion in Venezuela, whose oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions.
He had earlier announced a plan for the United States to sell between 30 million and 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, with the money to be used at his discretion.
He promised any funds sent to Caracas would be used to buy only US-made products.
In the meantime, Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude — oil that would be sold, Trump said.
State-owned oil company PDVSA confirmed in a statement that one vessel was returning to Venezuelan waters, describing it as the “first successful joint operation” with Washington.
Prisoners’ release
Anxious relatives waited outside Venezuelan jails for a glimpse of their loved ones as the authorities began releasing political prisoners — a move Washington claimed credit for.
“When I heard the news, I broke down,” said Dilsia Caro, 50, waiting for the release of her husband, Noel Flores, who was jailed for criticising Maduro.
Venezuela began releasing prisoners on Thursday in the first such gesture since US forces removed and detained Maduro in the deadly January 3 raid.
Trump told Fox News he would meet next week with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whom he earlier brushed aside as lacking the “respect” to lead Venezuela.

 

Exiled Venezuelan opposition figurehead Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that any democratic transition in the country must recognise his claim to victory in the 2024 presidential elections.
Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the vote, but his re-election was widely seen as fraudulent.
Gonzalez was hoping on Friday for the release of his son-in-law, who was detained a year ago in Caracas.
Protests in Caracas
Maduro was seized in a US special forces raid accompanied by airstrikes, operations that left 100 people dead, according to Caracas.
US forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking and other charges.
Rodriguez insisted on Thursday that her country was “not subordinate or subjugated” despite her pledge to cooperate with Trump.
Angry protesters rallied in the streets of Caracas on Friday, demanding Maduro’s release in the latest of a daily series of demonstrations.
“We don’t have to give one little drop of oil to Trump after all that he has done to us,” said one protester, Josefina Castro, 70, a member of a civil activists’ group.

“Paper mulberry trees, which are a major cause of allergies and have caused deaths among chronic asthma patients, have been chopped following Supreme Court’s orders which were issued in 2023. In 2025, the order was again implemented to rid the city of this invasive species which is not indigenous and is life threatening,” said Dr Malik while talking in a TV talk show after presiding over a meeting on the issue.
“It is planned not to plant non-indigenous species,” said the minister, adding: “One tree chopped is being replaced with three new saplings/trees in the capital city”.
The meeting was held in the wake of widespread criticism on the authorities in the media over cutting of thousands of grown-up trees in different locations of the capital city, including the leveling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian.








Claims 29,000 allergy causing trees have been cut; CDA starts early tree-plantation drive in unfavourable weather

Recently, thousands of trees were chopped in Islamabad’s three areas – Shakarparian, H-8 and Chak Shahzad. In Shakarparian, at least four patches have been turned into almost a desert, where citizens stated that besides paper mulberry, other trees had also been cut down. However, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has been stating that only paper mulberry was removed.
A number of trees have been cut in H-8 area where a park is being upgraded while cutting of decades-old trees took place in Chak Shahzad for the construction of a dual carriageway for the CDA-DHA housing society.
The minister said that paper mulberry were non-indigenous trees planted in the 1960s. According to him, the felling of trees was planned after confirming from Ministry of Health that paper mulberries are a major health concern.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the ministry said the minister was briefed on the ongoing campaign aimed at reducing the number of non-native paper mulberry trees in Islamabad. The minister reviewed and discussed measures for environmental protection and preservation of green cover in Islamabad.
The meeting was attended by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa, Secretary Climate Change Aisha Moriana and senior representatives from the CDA, Environment Protection Agency (EPA), Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and others.
It was stated that paper mulberry was an allergenic species and a major contributor to severe allergies and asthma-related health issues among residents of the federal capital. The campaign focused on the selective removal of paper mulberry trees in areas where their concentration exceeded 90 per cent such as Shakarparian, F-9 Park and along H-8 and H-9 sectors, and replacing them with native, fruit-bearing trees and pine species.
The minister was informed that to safeguard Islamabad’s green cover, plans were underway to plant more trees against every tree removed under the campaign, ensuring that the city’s overall tree cover was not reduced.
The statement said plans for plantation included installation of mature native trees to accelerate ecological recovery. The meeting also discussed the need for enhanced coordination among EPA, CDA and the Ministry of Climate Change to ensure timely plantation activities during the upcoming spring season. Emphasis was placed on synchronised planning and execution to maximise environmental and public health benefits.
Dr Malik stressed the importance of streamlining processes and strengthening communication among relevant ministries, environmental protection agencies such as EPA and IWMB and CDA. He directed that a transparent, well-defined and streamlined mechanism be developed to ensure full compliance with existing laws, rules, and procedures related to permissions and licensing for such environmental campaigns.
Interestingly, when the official handout talked about cutting of trees in various sectors, it has no mention of the cutting of trees along Park Road at Chak Shahzad.
Tree plantation
Interestingly, in an apparent move to counter the ongoing criticism, the CDA has started a tree plantation campaign in January, which is otherwise known for frost and not ideal for plantation.
In the past, the CDA used to start tree plantation around mid-February. However, this time around it has started the campaign more than a month earlier in Shakarparian area – a step which is being criticised by public on social media, stating that nowhere trees are planted in January as Islamabad faces due and frost in this month.
The CDA officials, on the other hand, are stating that only those species are being planted which survive in January, such as Chir Pine. They said this campaign, in which 30,000 trees would be planted, would get momentum next month.

In an open letter to PM Shehbaz Sharif, Agnes Callamard — secretary general of the global rights watchdog — noted that Pakistan has been a generous host to refugees for over 40 years, but noted that its policy changed significantly once the repatriation plan was announced in Sept 2023.







“Since then, Amnesty Inte­rnational has documented a complete lack of transparency, due process and accountability in the unlawful arrests, detentions and deportations of Afghan nationals in Pakistan,” it said.
It also called on the country to create well-resourced and accessible pathways for the registration of refugees, taking proactive measures to expedite the registration of refugees particularly at risk, including but not limited to women and girls, journalists, and those belonging to minority and ethnic communities, and those facing barriers due to gender, disability, language, among others.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) is set to finally begin hearing cases from Monday, operating from its originally envisaged premises — the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).
Although extensive renovation and refurbishment work is still under way at the FSC building, an informed source privy to the development told Dawn that the FCC is likely to commence functioning from January 12.
On December 11, 2025, the Mi­­nistry of law had issued a notification proposing the temporary rel­o­­­­cation of the FCC to the FSC pre­mises, while the Federal Shariat Court was to be shifted to the Isla­mabad High Court (IHC) building.
In addition, the FCC is seriously considering the establishment of registry branches in all four provinces to facilitate the filing of cases and appeals by litigants closer to their homes. However, the establishment of branch registries requires a presidential order, which is also expected to be issued soon.
If set up, these branch registries would help ease the difficulties currently faced by litigants, who are compelled to travel to Islam­abad, where only a small space has been allocated for filing FCC petitions within the IHC building.
Under the proposed arrangem­e­­­­nt, cases could temporarily be fil­ed at FCC branch registries operating from the existing premises of the Supreme Court in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta.
Recently, 22,910 cases were transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC and are currently housed within the IHC. Due to severe space constraints, the files have been cramped into small areas, making it extremely difficult to locate case records or obtain certified copies of judgements.
“I filed a petition before the FCC sometimes ago, but notices to the respondents have still not been served due to a lack of manpower and an effective mechanism,” a senior lawyer told Dawn on condition of anonymity.
The 27th Constitutional Amendment was passed by parliament within days, but the government has yet to determine how and where to properly house the FCC — now considered the country’s apex court following the amendment, the lawyer said.

 

The source added that while more judges will be elevated to the FCC in due course, establishing the court’s infrastructure remains the immediate priority.
A meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan scheduled for January 12 may also take up the formulation of rules for appointing FCC judges. After the court’s relocation, the next step would likely involve developing facilities for video-link hearings, enabling lawyers to argue cases from branch registries — a practice already in use at the Supreme Court.
The FSC building currently houses seven courtrooms along with seven chambers for judges. The FCC presently has seven judges, with plans to gradually increase its strength to 13.
According to the source, the establishment of additional courtrooms should not pose major difficulties, as office spaces within the building can be merged to create smaller courtrooms if required.
In November last year, the government had decided to set up offices for FCC judges within the IHC building due to space constraints, after FSC judges reportedly declined to vacate their building in favour of the newly established constitutional court.
As a result, the FCC was temporarily housed in the IHC building shortly after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

Speaking to the BBC, Petro said Washington was treating other nations as part of a US “empire”.
His remarks came after US President Donald Trump said a military operation in Colombia “sounds good” in the wake of strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Maduro.
Petro said that the US risked transforming from “dominating the world” to becoming “isolated from the world”.
He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like “Nazi brigades”.

President Petro raises alarm after Trump says operation in South American country ‘sounds good’

Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US.
The BBC has approached the White House for comment.
Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to “watch his a..”, remarks the Colombian president strongly condemned.
Change in tone
Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which US president said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the “near future”.
Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a “Great Honour”.







A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric “from both sides”.
But on Thursday, Petro’s tone suggested relations had not significantly impr­oved.
He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, “most of it occupied by me”, covered “drug trafficking Colombia”, his cou­n­try’s view on Vene­zuela and “what is happening around Latin America rega­rding the United States”.
Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking.
The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the Washington says were being used for drug trafficking in the Cari­bbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people.
Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water “we are going to start now hitting land”, adding that “the cartels are running Mexico”.
Trump has often bla­med immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations.

The ministry confirmed that not only did overall revenues decline, but consolidated profits also fell, and financial losses and budget injections increased in 2024-25 compared to the previous year. The consolidated financial results of the SOEs firmed up by Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the MoF came up for review before a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on SOE (CCoSOEs) presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday.
The committee was informed that “during 2024-25, aggregate revenues of SOEs stood at approximately Rs12.4 trillion, reflecting a decline largely attributable to reduced profitability in the oil sector following lower international oil prices,” the MoF said.
Aggregate profits of pro­­fit-making SOEs decli­ned by 13pc to Rs709.9bn compared to Rs820.7bn last year, while aggregate losses of loss-making SOEs showed improvement, declining by around 2pc to Rs832.8bn. “Despite this improvement, the net result was an overall net loss of Rs122.9bn for the SOE sector, compared to a net loss of Rs30.6bn in the previous year,” showing more than three times increase, the MoF said.

Finance ministry cites power sector drag in FY25 performance

It was highlighted that losses remain heavily concentrated in a small number of entities, particularly in the transport and power distribution sectors. National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies continued to be major loss contributors, reflecting structural issues, high depreciation, financing costs, and the public service nature of certain operations that are not commercially viable.

 

The committee was briefed on the categorization of SOEs into green, amber and red categories based on financial sustainability, with a view to prioritising reforms and decision-making.
On fiscal support, the committee noted that total government support to SOEs increased to Rs2.078tr during 2024-25, driven mainly by higher equity injections to clear circular debt stock, while subsidies showed a modest decline. At the same time, inflows from SOEs to the government increased to Rs2.119tr, supported by higher dividends, tax rec­eipts and interest income on government lending.
The debt profile of SOEs was discussed in detail. Total SOE debt at the portfolio level increased to Rs9.57tr, comprising cash development loans, foreign re-lent loans, bank borrowings and accrued interest. The committee was also explained the quantification of unfunded pension liabilities across SOEs, estimated at around Rs2tr, which was identified as a major legacy risk requiring policy attention. Guara­ntees and other off-balance-sheet contingencies were reported at Rs2.16tr.
The meeting reaffirmed commitment to transparency and structural refo­rms while reviewing the Annual Consolidated Per­formance Report of Comm­ercial and Non-Commercial State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) for 2024-25. Director General CMU Majid Soofi presented the report and briefed the committee.
The report covered the financial and non-financial performance of SOEs, government support and fiscal flows, contribution of SOEs to the exchequer, debt profile, corporate governance and compliance status, business plan assessments, and the proposed way forward under the SOEs Act 2023.
The finance minister commended the CMU for strengthening transparency, consolidating SOE financial information on an International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aligned basis, and establishing a comprehensive digital database to support evidence-based decision-making.
He noted that the presentation reflected meaningful progress in oversi­ght, disclosure and risk id­­­­entification, particular­­ly in areas of fiscal flows, debt mapping and unf­u­nded pension liabilities.
The minister said the report was a credible foundation for informed policy action and sustained refo­rms, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to improving governance, enfo­rcing accountability, and placing SOEs on a path toward financial sustainability and operational efficiency.
The meeting stressed the need for enforcement of audit completion in compliance with the SOEs Act 2023, and timely transition to IFRS-based reporting by February 2026. The importance of realistic business plans, sector-specific eng­age­ment, loss reduction strategies and hard budget constraints, particularly for chronically loss-making enti­ties, was also underscored.

The prime minister was chairing a meeting to review the proposed Ramazan package and third-party validation of the last year’s package.







He said the federal government had established a transparent system to provide subsidised essential food items to the underprivileged during Ramazan, replacing a decades-old corrupt system of financial irregularities and mismanagement in Utility Stores.
During the meeting, he praised all relevant institutions and ministries on the report by a reputable audit firm regarding the transparency of last year’s Ramazan package.
He noted that deserving individuals were deprived of their rights due to corruption in Utility Stores.

Orders solarisation of loss-making electricity feeders

Financial support and social well-being for the poor and the middle class are among the top priorities of the government, the prime minister said.
He said providing subsidy amounts to the public through digital wallets will prove to be a milestone in achieving a cashless economy.
“The inclusion of the State Bank of Pakistan in the distribution of the Ramazan package will promote a cashless economy,” the prime minister said.
He stressed all relevant ministries and institutions to ensure maximising the scope and inclusion of the underprivileged in receiving subsidies.
He also directed officials concerned to present a comprehensive strategy containing practical measures for a better and more effective disbursement than the last year’s Ramazan package as soon as possible.
He also directed them to ensure that eligible low-income households were included in the assistance programme to the maximum extent possible. He also called for the creation of a digital dashboard and a monitoring system to oversee implementation.
PM Shehbaz said a Social Protection Wallet system was being introduced under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), under which SIM cards would be provided to eligible beneficiaries. He added that from March 2026 onward, assistance payments would be distributed digitally through these SIMs.
Solarisation of feeders
He directed that loss-making electricity feeders be shifted to solar power with the cooperation of local communities and provincial governments to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply in remote areas of the country.
The prime minister said the initiative would help reduce financial losses of deficit-running feeders besides providing continuous and affordable electricity to those regions.
He directed immediate launching of pilot projects on high-loss feeders of Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) and Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco).
He emphasised that consultation with elected representatives and active community participation would be ensured to guarantee the success and sustainability of the pilot projects. The meeting was informed that transitioning of loss-making feeders to solar power would create environmentally friendly, low-cost, and sustainable power generation.
The project will be implemented through a partnership involving local communities, provincial governments, and the federal government.
The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Syed Imran Ahmed Shah, Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Prime Minister’s Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar, besides the heads of National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

Citing people familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously, Bloomberg reported that the talks are at an advanced stage and “a deal is very likely”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh last September, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
“The expanded alliance would make sense because Turkiye’s interests increasingly overlap with those of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in South Asia, the Middle East and even Africa,” the Bloomberg report said.
“Turkiye also sees the pact as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato,“ it added.
The report noted Riyadh’s financial clout and Islamabad’s nuclear capability, ballistic missiles, and manpower, with Turkiye offering military experience and a developed defence industry, according to Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with the Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.
“As the US prioritises its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The information ministry and Turkiye’s defence ministry declined to comment. Saudi Arabian authorities weren’t immediately available to respond to a request for comment to the American publication.
New era
According to Bloomberg, Turkiye joining the alliance would underscore a new era in relations with Saudi Arabia.
“After turning the page on years of rancour, the countries are working to develop economic and defence cooperation,” the report read. “They held their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.”
The report noted Riyadh and Ankara’s longstanding concern over Tehran and their preference for engagement with the country rather than the use of force.
With regard to Pakistan, Bloomberg noted Turkiye’s construction of corvette warships for the Pakistan Navy and its work upgrading the Pakistan Air Force’s fleet of F-16 fighter jets.
“Turkiye is already sharing drone technology with both countries, and now wants them to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet program,” the outlet added, citing an earlier report.
“The trilateral defence talks come in the wake of a cease-fire between Pakistan and India that ended a four-day military clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May,” Bloomberg added.
The report also acknowledged Pakistan‘s tensions with Afghanistan following border clashes, as well as Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts to broker talks, which were inconclusive.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage.
These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
With Turkiye, defence cooperation remains a key pillar of bilateral relations. According to the 2023 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, Turkiye is Pakistan’s second-largest arms supplier, accounting for 11pc of its total arms imports.
The defence partnership has grown significantly, with joint projects such as the Milgem warships, aircraft modernisation, and drone acquisitions deepening military collaboration.</p><small>2026-01-10 02:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10075951cb5befa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966117/pm-shehbaz-woos-uae-investment-in-it-sector' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz woos UAE investment  in IT sector</strong></a><br><p>

prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif meets a delegation of the UAE’s Sajwani Group on Friday.—PID

ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the growing interest of the UAE investors in Pakistan’s digital economy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the government is giving special importance to business-to-business (B2B) cooperation in the fields of information technology, digital innovation, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.
The prime minister, in a meeting with a delegation of the UAE’s Sajwani Group, said that the recent high-level contacts and exchanges had increased mutual trust between the private sectors and investors of Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, providing a strong foundation for advancing bilateral cooperation.







He said that the deep, fraternal and longstanding Pakistan-UAE relations were based on mutual trust, which were heading towards more effective economic cooperation and investment.
The premier vie­wed that the recent visit of the UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan to Pakistan had further strengthened the bilateral partnership, also creating a conducive environment for promoting cooperation.
He said that the UAE’s in­­vestment and global con­­nectivity, combined with Pakistan’s human resour­c­­es and workforce, repres­e­n­­ted a highly beneficial partnership for economic growth.
PC as apex forum
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the Planning Commission (PC) should act as the central clearinghouse for econo­m­­ic decisions, providing guidance to ministries and divisions to maintain policy consistency and development planning, while supporting sustainable reforms to strengthen Pakistan’s economic governance.
Chairing a meeting on economic reforms, Mr Dar highlighted the historic and central role of the PC in economic and development policy-making, said a news release.
He emphasised the need to empower PC to drive strategic policy, give priorities, and oversee public investment effectively.

Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik held a briefing session with Pakistan’s ambassadors and high commissioners posted in key foreign capitals to advance preparations and mobilise international participation for the event.
The meeting was conducted virtually with Pakistan’s missions abroad, while senior officials from the petroleum division and representatives of key public sector entities attended in person.
The session focused on aligning diplomatic outreach with national economic priorities and positioning PMIF26 as a premier global platform for investment in Pakistan’s mineral and mining sector, the petroleum division said.

PM approves national policy framework to reform gemstones sector

During the briefing, the minister explained the aims, scale, and strategic importance of PMIF26 as a forum representing a national economic priority.
He urged ambassadors and high commissioners to actively engage leading mining companies, institutional investors, financial institutions, and relevant government counterparts in their host countries to ensure broad-based and meaningful international participation.
“PMIF26 will serve as a key platform for promoting mining awareness, stimulating economic activity, and attracting sustainable investment into Pakistan’s mineral sector,” the minister said, adding that the forum would build on the “success of PMIF 2025” held last year.
He said the previous edition of the forum was organised in line with international standards and delivered tangible outcomes.
“The forum attracted participants from over 50 countries and more than 5,000 delegates, while the signing of 14 memorandums of understanding with globally recognised companies validated growing international confidence in Pakistan’s mineral sector,” he added.
PMIF 2026 is being planned as a strategic. technical conference — alongside an international gemstone exhibition — and a comprehensive resource library aimed at supporting informed as well as data-driven investment decisions.
APP adds: Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday gave in-principle approval to a national policy framework to reform the gemstones sector, align it with international standards, and create a conducive environment for foreign investment, state-run APP reported.
Chairing a high-level meeting on the country’s gemstone reserves, sectoral reforms, export enhancement, and adoption of modern technology, the prime minister directed strict adherence to timelines outlined in the policy framework this year.
He also instructed immediate steps to establish international-standard laboratories and certification systems.
PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of two model centres of excellence for gemstones during the year and the engagement of internationally recognised experts to remove obstacles in policy implementation.
He noted that Pakistan’s gemstone exports remained negligible despite the country having immense reserves, and called for encouraging private companies, particularly young entrepreneurs, to invest in the sector.
Citing vast reserves of gemstones in Pakistan, he directed geological surveys to determine their location and value, ensuring full consultation with relevant institutions, provincial governments, and stakeholders.
The meeting was told that Pakistan’s gemstone reserves were valued at around $450 billion, while annual exports stood at just $5.8 million.
More than 5,000 companies are processing more than 30 types of precious stones in the country. Leading reserves in the country include those of emerald, peridot, ruby, topaz, and aquamarine.
The industries and production ministry has chalked out a comprehensive action plan identifying challenges and priority measures to achieve a $1bn export target over five years through reforms.
This year, the ministry will integrate the gemstone value chain into the national economy, promote local processing for value addition, adopt modern technology, launch private-sector training programmes, and introduce ‘Brand Pakistan’.

The KP chief executive is currently in Karachi as part of the PTI’s plans to launch a street movement, as per the directions of party founder Imran Khan.
Speaking on the Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the PM’s aide said that the PTI was in no position to launch a street movement and described their upcoming nationwide wheel-jam strike on February 8 as “violence”.
“They cannot mobilise because it isn’t in accordance with the law. The KP CM is involved in illegal activity and his travel is illegal,” Sanaullah said.
When asked what part of CM Afridi’s visit was illegal, Sanaullah replied: “How is a wheel-jam strike a political activity permitted by the law and Constitution? Holding a wheel-jam strike in and of itself is illegal.”
Sanaullah added that the Sindh government “would not permit a wheel-jam strike” and that the PTI “is not in a position to block even one road.”
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information, Shafiullah Jan — also a guest on the programme — responded to Sanaullah, clarifying that the February 8 wheel-jam strike was called by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chairman of the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance.
“Rana Sanaullah is confused; he issued a statement saying that if the call [to strike] isn’t revoked, May 9 cases will be opened,” he claimed, referring to the prosecution of PTI members over riots that occurred on May 9, 2023. “This shows that May 9 was a false flag operation against the PTI.“
“As far as February 8 is concerned, the PTI will support and accept Achakzai’s call for a wheel-jam,” Jan added.
Sanaullah stated that the PTI’s street movement would not be successful and that “only a handful of people from KP” might join in.
“When these people are prosecuted, they will create a ruckus,” the PM’s aide said.
“These people are still claiming that May 9 was a false flag operation and that their members weren’t involved. They are willing to spread lies and create misunderstandings. Tell me, can you believe what they say?”
Sanaullah also questioned what movement the PTI would lead.
“With this wheel-jam strike, they say that KP will lead it. What are they leading?” he asked.
“At most 4,500 people turned up at their Peshawar rally, even though they had been preparing for a month.”
“In KP, they will try, but they will fail, and whoever takes part will continue to cry about false flags and fake cases when they get prosecuted,” the PM’s aide added.
The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.</p><small>2026-01-09 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09192840058e553.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965987/democratic-traditions-still-alive-in-sindh-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-rallies-pti-support-base-in-karachi-for-street-movement' target='_blank'><strong>‘Democratic traditions still alive in Sindh’: KP CM Sohail Afridi rallies PTI support base in Karachi for street movement</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Friday evening continued his efforts to rally PTI’s support base in Karachi to support the party’s upcoming nationwide street movement.
After his visit to the Karachi Press Club (KPC), the provincial chief executive was scheduled to visit Insaf House and hold public meetings in the city’s district South and Malir.
Earlier in the evening, Afridi reached the KPC and met with the city’s journalist fraternity while appreciating the welcome extended to him by the Sindh government.
From the airport, the KP CM’s convoy took six hours to reach the press club, accompanied by a large crowd of party supporters.
During his interaction with the media, Afridi compared his arrival in the metropolis with his recent visit to Lahore and said, “Karachi has been more welcoming than Lahore”.
“The democratic traditions of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto are still alive in Sindh,” said the KP CM during his interaction with journalists at the press club.







The KP chief minister said that the purpose of his visit to Sindh’s provincial capital was to prepare for the PTI’s street movement.
“The Punjab tour was not a good experience. Wherever we went to eat food, the lights of that area were turned off,” he told reporters.
Afridi said that they had received verbal approval from the Sindh government for Sunday’s rally, though they had not received a response in writing.
“Imran Khan did not struggle for power, but for the independence of the judiciary, true democracy and freedom of expression. This is why he has been imprisoned,” the KP CM said in his address at the press club.
“In prison, he has been treated in an inhumane manner and kept in the same place where terrorists are held,” he added.
Fielding questions, CM Afridi said that he saw traces of former premiers Benazir Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Sindh’s governance, and expressed satisfaction.
CM Afridi, in another response, noted that a peace jirga was held in the provincial assembly, where all political parties agreed on fifteen points.
“One of these points was that military operations are not a problem, but if one is carried out, it would be thuggery,” he added.
Elaborating on the topic, Afridi said that “decisions cannot be made behind closed doors” and added that if the tribal elders and local leadership are not involved as stakeholders, “there will never be peace”.
“What guarantee is there that peace will return after a military operation?” he questioned.
“If the prime minister calls only on a single-point agenda regarding terrorism, I will certainly attend.”
“The solution to terrorism is that all political parties, as well as the provincial and federal governments, make a joint decision and implement it. Only then is peace possible,” Afridi said.
Arrival in Karachi
Afridi reached Karachi earlier today, beginning his three-day visit to Sindh as part of PTI’s street mobilisation movement.
Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani welcomed him at the airport. A video released from the minister’s office showed Ghani receiving Afridi and the two hugging at the airport. Ghani was also seen presenting Afridi a Sindhi cap and Ajrak.
The party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja also accompanied the KP CM.
Videos shared by the PTI on X showed a large crowd gathered at the airport to welcome Afridi.







An update shared on PTI‘s X account at around 5:15pm said Afridi’s convoy, surrounded by a large crowd, had reached Karachi’s main artery Sharea Faisal.

Afridi also shared a video of himself at Sharea Faisal, with PTI supporters and workers shouting slogans of “Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi”.







The convoy eventually reached the Karachi Press Club late in the evening after making a pit stop at Mazar-i-Quaid.
Afridi boarded the flight for Karachi from the Islamabad airport, where he faced flight delays.
KP Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, who is accompanying the chief minister, said in a post on X prior to their departure that their flight had been delayed.

PTI alleges dismantling of tents
Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had removed the tents put up outside the party‘s head office near the nursery area for the KP CM’s reception.
He, however, clarified that the office had not been sealed by police.
Previously, the PTI had alleged in a post on social media platform X that Sindh police had sealed the Insaf Secretariat in Karachi and dismantled a camp installed there for Afridi’s welcome.







Bozdar said CM Afridi was expected to address party workers and leaders at the head office, where he would be taken from the airport.
He also said he had spoken to police and Sindh government officials, who have assured that the tents would be returned. He added that the officials also assured that the party would be allowed to hold a gathering but was asked not to block roads.
Dawn reached out to police for a comment but there was no response from their side.
Afridi to hold gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday
Before departing for Karachi, the KP chief minister said in a post on X that he was bringing party founder Imran Khan’s “message” to the province.
“My visit is for three days and during this time we have planned various activities,” the chief minister said, urging people to support the street movement.







KP CM announced that he would be holding a gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday at 4:30pm, calling on people to participate in the gathering.
“We will hold the biggest gathering in Karachi’s history,” CM Afridi said.
Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement issued by his office that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We will fully welcome KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the province,” he said, adding that the peaceful struggle of any political party, including the PTI, could not be stopped.
But, he also warned that “difficulties could arise in the law is violated”.
“There is no restriction on the rally. They have sought permission for holding rallies in South and Korangi districts. They have sought permission for a rally at Jinnah Ground and they are being given permission for that,” he said. “We are in talks with the PTI leadership and they can definitely be given permission for holding the rally in accordance with the law.”
However, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office earlier on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad.
What’s on CM’s agenda?
The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.
On Monday, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, shared the CM Afridi’s schedule for the visit.
He detailed that CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on January 9 and arrive in Karachi, where he will be received by party workers and supporters.
His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a meeting with the Press at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir.
The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation.
He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice following his arrival in Karachi.
Hyderabad visit
The CM will travel to Hyderabad on Jan 1o. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah.
The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad.
The agenda also includes an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), but the lawyers’ body has said it never accorded permission for the CM to visit or address the bar.
Earlier, the bar association general secretary invited the CM to the Hyderabad High Court in a letter dated January 7.
In the letter, seen by Dawn, General Secretary Israr Hussain Chang said he warmly welcomed the CM to Sindh and “commend your principled stance on the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the rule of law, human rights, and justice for missing persons”.
“We hope you will also support our ongoing legal and constitutional struggle to protect Sindh’s lands, resist unjust corporate farming allotments, and safeguard Karoonjhar Kirthar, and the water rights and Indus delta, all vital to our ecological and cultural identity.
“During your visit to Hyderabad, if you spare some moments to visit the High Court, Hyderabad, I would be honoured to receive you on behalf of the legal fraternity and people of Sindh,” the letter read.
But, the bar association clarified in a press release on January 8 that it “never accorded permission nor allowed the worthy KP chief minister to address or visit HCBA, Hyderabad”. It added that the bar association’s entire executive/ managing committee, by a clear majority, had rejected during a meeting an application submitted in this connection.
The general secretary issued his letter in his personal capacity and “used the letterhead of the HCBA without consent of the managing committee for the aforesaid programme”, the press release said.
Meanwhile, the spokesperson for PTI Hyderabad chairperson alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had conducted raids at residences of the “elected chairpersons of different union committees and activists of PTI on Thursday in different parts of the city”.
However, no arrests could be made, he said.
Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio also told Dawn that no PTI activists had been arrested during the raids in Hyderabad.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.

Body cameras, or body cams, are wearable audio and video recording devices used to capture footage of official action for evidence. Last month, following corruption complaints against the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera), CM Maryam made it mandatory for field officials to wear body cams in a bid to ensure transparency and accountability. However, this order has yet to be implemented.
Presiding over a meeting on provincial health projects today, the CM said that wearing body cams would be mandatory for nurses, ward boys, security guards, and pharmacy staff.
The CM further said that public hospital administration must ensure the comprehensive daily steam cleaning of facilities by 9am.
