China and India should “adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship” and “find a way for mutual respect and trust, peaceful coexistence, common development and win-win cooperation”, Wang said, according to Xinhua.
The two foreign ministers met in Beijing on Monday as the two rivals seek to repair ties following a 2020 clash on their border.
The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia, and their 3,500-kilometre frontier has been a perennial source of tension.
The 2020 clash between their troops led to a four-year military standoff, but they agreed in October on patrols in disputed areas.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years later that month, agreeing to work on improving relations.
New Delhi is concerned over Beijing’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean, seeing the region as firmly within its sphere of influence.
Another source of tension is the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader India has hosted since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.
The 90-year-old Dalai Lama says only his India-based organisation has the right to identify his eventual successor.
China insists that it would have the final say on who succeeds the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p><small>2025-07-15 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151458426bb8a1f.png?r=150136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924365/asian-development-bank-recommends-5pc-gst-on-digital-transactions' target='_blank'><strong>Asian Development Bank recommends 5pc GST on digital transactions</strong></a><br><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has advised the government to implement a uniform 5 per cent general sales tax (GST) for all digital transactions to encourage nationwide adoption of digital payments and e-commerce platforms, reducing cash-related inefficiencies and documenting the economy.
In its latest report on Pakistan’s Digital Ecosystem issued yesterday, the ADB cautioned that steep and inconsistent taxes on digital infrastructure in the country pose a serious risk to foreign investment, growth, and the expansion of digital services.
“Pakistan’s digital infrastructure faces a major challenge from high taxation. Taxes on this sector, both federal and provincial, are some of the highest globally and regionally, and the tax policies tend not to be very consistent,” the report said.
“The cost of service provision exacerbates the digital divide, especially for women and marginalised groups, who face asymmetric cost and cultural barriers to accessing the internet.”
The report further added that the telecom sector in Pakistan has “experienced a decline in revenues and foreign investment, which reflects a very challenging business environment”.
It called for a “renewed focus is needed by the government on engaging with investors and industry stakeholders to address their concerns and provide incentives and facilitation to invest and operate in the country”.
In its recommendations, the ABD urged to “rationalise all digital infrastructure taxes, both direct and indirect, making them competitive against a basket of countries, and fix sector tax rates for at least 10 years”.
Pakistan’s currently has 56.5pc broadband penetration with 137 million subscriptions. Every province charges a regressive sales tax of 19.5% on internet service usage which is higher
than any other service, it added.
“High capital investment; regulatory obstacles; costly and cumbersome Right of Way (RoW) arrangements; and high, unpredictable taxes hinder new investments in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure,” the report stated.
Pakistan has the world’s lowest average revenue per user due to fierce competition among service providers, the report read, adding that revenues of operators and telecom companies have been “shrinking” in real terms.
It recommended mandating a flat countrywide optimal RoW fee per meter — permission granted to telecom companies to install and maintain their infrastructure (like fiber optic cables, mobile towers, etc) — and provide for a predictable rise over a longer period.
It also recommended prioritising early-stage investments in digital infrastructure projects, promote local manufacturing of smartphones, and provide 3pc research and development allowance on exports of locally produced smartphones.
The ADB advised the government to create a “robust enabling legal and regulatory framework for development and implementation of public–private partnerships (PPPs) for digital infrastructure”.
It also called for expanding internet access and device ownership for citizens, especially women, working with local and global partners to design tailored PPP programmes, and providing low-cost or easy installment-based smartphones.</p><small>2025-07-15 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1514440122d1f36.jpg?r=154550' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924358/indonesian-defence-minister-expresses-jakartas-desire-to-boost-defence-ties-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian defence minister expresses Jakarta’s desire to boost defence ties with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Indonesia’s Defence Minister Lt Gen (retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin expressed his country’s desire to boost defence ties and explore possible collaboration in defence production as he met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad on Tuesday.
Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with both countries cooperating in trade, education, and health.
Gen Sjamsoeddin called on PM Shehbaz at the PM Office today, where he reiterated Indonesia’s desire to “further strengthen defence ties with Pakistan and to explore possible areas for cooperation, especially in defence production”, according to a statement from government-run PID.
 






The Indonesian minister conveyed the best wishes of President Prabowo Subianto for the prime minister and people of Pakistan, the press release added.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz “reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to explore and expand collaboration with Indonesia in joint ventures of investment in mutually beneficial projects”, the statement said.
The prime minister also reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation with Indonesia in all avenues, including economic, strategic and trade sectors, along with defence and defence production.
He highlighted that Pakistan and Indonesia enjoyed a “longstanding friendship rooted in shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, supporting each other at international forums”.
Both sides stressed the importance of “enhancing multifaceted bilateral cooperation”, according to the PID.
“The meeting underscored the deep-rooted historical, brotherly and friendly bilateral relations between Pakistan and Indonesia,” the statement noted.
Recalling his meeting last year with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto on the sidelines of Developing-8 Summit in Cairo, PM Shehbaz conveyed his best wishes for the Indonesian president.
The prime minister also reviewed ongoing initiatives under the Pakistan-Indonesia Defence Cooperation Agreement and agreed to “accelerate the implementation of key areas of mutual interest”, the PID added.
In June, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.
Last year, Indonesian Charge d’Affaires Rahmat Hindiarta hosted an exclusive dinner for Pakistani business leaders and their spouses at the Indonesian Embassy to enhance bilateral finance and trade relations.</p><small>2025-07-15 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151459089314149.jpg?r=150306' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364/4-of-a-family-among-5-killed-in-karachi-road-accidents' target='_blank'><strong>‘4 of a family’ among 5 killed in Karachi road accidents</strong></a><br><p>Five people — four from the same family — were killed in two separate road accidents in Karachi on Tuesday, according to rescue officials.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
At least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a nullah on the Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, according to DIG South Syed Asad Raza.
DIG South speculated that the family was most likely returning from Hawkesbay beach. The incident took place at 9am on Tuesday.
“The accident most likely happened as a result of speeding,” said DIG South, adding that further investigation is underway.
The deceased include a man and woman — identified as Yousuf and Khalida — along with two children, 6-year-old Zainab  and 10-year-old Ayesha.
The injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital, three of whom are currently in critical condition, according to Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
 
 

In a separate incident, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway, according to rescue officials.
The injured were rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, as per rescue officials.
The deceased has been identified as 39-year-old Gaya Chand, rescue officials said.
On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.  On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway.
The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p><small>2025-07-15 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151118152f80d60.png?r=131432' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924349/dar-meets-xi-ahead-of-sco-foreign-ministers-meeting-in-china' target='_blank'><strong>Dar meets Xi ahead of SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in China</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with China’s President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders, which will be hosted by China this autumn in Tianjin.
In a post on X today, Dar said  he was “delighted” to meet with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before the SCO meeting and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.
“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.
 






The Chinese president, welcoming the heads of delegations, underlined the “salience of regional cooperation” under the ambit of the SCO, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa).
Shortly later, Dar arrived in Tianjin along with other foreign ministers to lead Pakistan’s delegation to the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting, according to Mofa.
 






The deputy premier arrived in Beijing last night, where he was received at the airport by Ambassador Yu Hong and other senior officials of the Asian Affairs department of China’s Mofa, as well as Pakistan’s ambassador to China, Khalil ur Rehman Hashmi.
India’s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and Iran’s Abbas Araghchi are among the top diplomats arriving in Beijing for the SCO moot.
Meetings with SCO members’ ministers
Dar also met with the foreign ministers of various SCO member states on the sidelines of the joint call on Xi.
“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he said on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.
 






In separate meetings with Kazakhistan FM Murat Nurtleu and Kyrgyzstan’s Zheenbek Moldokanovic, Dar and the ministers reaffirmed a commitment to the enhancement of positive bilateral ties and expanding collaboration across areas of interest.
According to an earlier statement from the Mofa, Dar is set to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from the SCO member states during his visit to China.

Additional input from AFP</p><small>2025-07-15 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151303528f03fbd.jpg?r=130523' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354/uk-introduces-e-visa-for-pakistani-students-workers' target='_blank'><strong>UK introduces e-visa for Pakistani students, workers</strong></a><br><p>The United Kingdom’s government on Tuesday launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
In a statement today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: “The UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.”
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said on X that the facility was for “most students and workers applying for more than 6 months”.
 






An e-visa is an online record of a person’s immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.
“E-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,” it highlighted.
Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.
In 2024, the UK government announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.
The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:

Students, including short-term study for 11 months
Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)  
Global Talent   
International Sportsperson   
Skilled Worker (including health and care)  
Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes) 
Youth Mobility Scheme  

Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.
Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.
Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. “It also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,” she pointed out.
 
 

She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person’s present immigration status.
“Holders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,” the statement read.
The UKVI — introduced in 2024 — is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people’s immigration status.</p><small>2025-07-15 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1512163970decdf.jpg?r=122345' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924346/tesla-marks-india-entry-with-first-showroom-pricey-70000-model-y' target='_blank'><strong>Tesla marks India entry with first showroom, pricey $70,000 Model Y</strong></a><br><p>Tesla unveiled its first showroom in India on Tuesday, marking its entry into the world’s most populous country, as Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company seeks new customers amid sagging sales in the United States and Europe.
The store opened its doors to select visitors after its inauguration by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in India’s financial capital Mumbai.
Tesla has for years signalled its interest in India but held back due to the country’s steep tariffs on electric vehicles.
 
 

Musk, who once described India as having “more promise than any large
country”, has also criticised its import duties, calling them among the “highest in the world”.
New Delhi has offered to cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers only if they commit to investing hundreds of millions of dollars and make cars locally.
Tesla has yet to announce plans to set up a plant in India.
For now, local media reports say, the company will likely sell cars imported from China, with deliveries projected to start from late August.
Its Model Y variants start from an on-road price of around $70,000 in India, according to its website, compared with a US price of $37,490 after a $7,500 federal tax credit.
Tesla’s India debut comes at a critical time for the company, which is seeing demand wane for its cars in countries around the world.
The recent slump in Tesla’s sales partly reflects the highly competitive nature of the EV market, which the company once dominated but now also features BYD and other low-cost Chinese players.
While Tesla is looking to tap the world’s third-biggest car market, experts say it is unlikely to see huge volumes in the short term due to the nascent nature of India’s EV industry and the hefty price tag of its vehicles.
India’s EV market is fast-growing but remains small, with automakers reporting sales of around 100,000 vehicles in 2024 or less than three per cent of total car sales.

Soumen Mandal, a senior analyst at Counterpoint, said the high price tag will likely place it out of the price range of most Indian customers and see it compete against offerings from luxury carmakers instead.
“We don’t expect Tesla to play the volume game right away given the price tag,” Mandal told AFP.
“We project 500-700 units sold in the initial months and then that to taper off to 200-300 (per month).”
India is currently negotiating a trade deal with the United States, including a potential reduction in tariffs on automobiles.
In February, Musk held a one-on-one meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington.</p><small>2025-07-15 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151621108069b93.jpg?r=162203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924352/worlds-oldest-marathon-runner-fauja-singh-dies-aged-114-in-road-accident' target='_blank'><strong>‘World’s oldest marathon runner’ Fauja Singh dies aged 114 in road accident</strong></a><br><p>India’s Fauja Singh, believed to be the world’s oldest distance runner, has died in a road accident aged 114, his biographer said on Tuesday.
Singh, an Indian-born British national, nicknamed the “Turbaned Tornado”, died after being hit by a vehicle in Punjab state’s Jalandhar district on Monday.
“My Turbaned Tornado is no more,” Fauja’s biographer Khushwant Singh wrote on X.
“He was struck by an unidentified vehicle… in his village, Bias, while crossing the road. Rest in peace, my dear Fauja.”
 






Singh did not have a birth certificate but his family said he was born on April 1, 1911.
He ran full marathons (42 kilometres) till the age of 100.
His last race was a 10km event at the 2013 Hong Kong Marathon when 101, where he finished in one hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds.
He became an international sensation after taking up distance running at the ripe old age of 89, after the death of his wife and one of his sons, inspired by seeing marathons on television.
Although widely regarded as the world’s oldest marathon runner, he was not certified by Guinness World Records as he could not prove his age, saying that birth certificates did not exist when he was born under British colonial rule in 1911.
Singh was a torchbearer for the Olympics at Athens 2004 and London 2012, and appeared in advertisements with sports stars such as David Beckham and Muhammad Ali.
His strength and vitality were credited to a routine of farm walks and a diet including Indian sweet “laddu” packed with dry fruits and home-churned curd.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh on social media.
“Fauja Singh was extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness,” said Modi on X.
 






“He was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination. Pained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and countless admirers around the world.”</p><small>2025-07-15 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151159287a3405e.jpg?r=120425' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924347/psx-breaches-137000-points-in-intraday-trade' target='_blank'><strong>PSX breaches 137,000 points in intraday trade</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday to cross the 137,000 barrier in intra-day trading, amid continued investor optimism and improved economic outlook.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,237.03 points, or 0.91 per cent, to stand at 137,739.56 points at 11:39am, from the previous close of 136,502.53 points.
The market opened on a positive note, rising by 1,205.1 points, or 0.88pc, from yesterday’s close to reach 137,707.63 points at 9:45am. It then dropped to 136,498.16 points at 10:15am before regaining its bullish momentum. The total volume of shares is 152m valued at Rs11.87bn.
The PSX has continued its upward trend from last week, crossing the 136,500 level on Monday due to value-hunting by investors and optimism over strong corporate earnings.
The rally was supported by active participation from local mutual funds and institutional investors.
 
 

A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.
Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.
The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.

Speaking at a joint press conference at Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, members of the business community warned that the strike would be changed into a prolonged agitation if the demands were not met.
Chamber president Fazal Moqeem Khan, along with senior vice president Abdul Jalil Jan and members of the SCCI’s executive committee at the Chamber House here, rejected the “alarming” provisions of the Finance Act, which came into force on July 1, 2025, said in the prevailing situation, the business community had been left with no option but to take even more drastic steps, including suspending the filing of sales tax and income tax returns.
He noted that those sentiments were increasingly echoed by SCCI’s members, who had lost faith in the prevailing economic environment due to the government’s oppressive policies.

Business community threatens prolonged agitation if govt doesn’t meet demands

Fazal voiced solidarity with the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which identified 30 “harsh tax and customs measures” as a serious threat to the survival of businesses across the country.
He emphasised that the SCCI stood shoulder to shoulder with all business organisations demanding the immediate reversal of these unjust laws.
The SCCI leader said the introduction of Sections 37A and 37B of the Income Tax Ordinance was a draconian and unprecedented move.
“The Finance Act also has an amendment introduced through Section 21(s), which effectively disallows any cash transaction amounting to Rs200,000 or more for tax deduction purposes. This means that if a customer pays a supplier in cash, even by depositing cash directly into the supplier’s account, the supplier could be penalised by losing 50 per cent of the expense in tax calculations,” he noted.
The SCCI chief voiced serious reservations about the mandatory implementation of e-bilty and digital invoicing systems for all sales tax-registered entities.
He criticised the FBR for attempting to enforce complex digital systems in a country where general and computer literacy remains significantly low.
“Why are taxpayers being forced to perform the FBR’s duties at their own expense? This will only widen the gap between the business community and tax authorities,” he said.
Fazal said businessmen should be encouraged to focus on productivity and revenue generation rather than bureaucratic red tape that stifled operations and increased costs.
The SCCI chief also flayed the government’s complete disregard for the established consultative process traditionally followed before the passage of the Finance Bill.
He said historically, the Business Anomaly Committee engaged with stakeholders and the FBR in a series of meetings to address anomalies and formulate mutually agreed-upon recommendations.
“These discussions are held with the participation of Member Inland Revenue, Member Customs, and eventually the Finance Minister and Chairman FBR.”
The SCCI president said this year, the process was unilaterally bypassed for the first time, leaving no room for dialogue or consensus.
He added that in protest, several committee members resigned and walked out.
“Despite vocal objections from the business community and the parliamentary standing committees, the Finance Bill was rushed through the house,” he said.
Fazal urged the prime minister to immediately withdraw sections 37A and 37B, the Rs200,000 cash transaction penalty under Section 21(s), the digital invoicing requirement under SRO 709, and the mandatory e-bilty provision under Section 40(c).
“Section 8B of the Sales Tax Act, which also grants discretionary powers to the FBR commissioner to disallow complete input tax adjustment, is completely unacceptable,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) on Monday decided to launch an anti-tax movement to unite all political parties of Malakand Division, trader federations, business associations, chambers, lawyers, journalists and people from other walks of life on a single platform to initiate a public movement.
The decision was made during a SCCI meeting held in Swat under the chairmanship of president Noor Mohammad Khan.
The session included a detailed discussion on the imposition of a 10pc sales tax and the resulting public reaction. The participants stressed that while the government was taking steps to restore Fata, the former status of the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas should also be reinstated.
The participants said there was a severe lack of employment opportunities in Malakand Division, while the residents had long suffered due to natural disasters and conflicts.
They added that if the government couldn’t provide employment to youth, it must not impose taxes.
The participants also complained about the demolition of public property in the recent anti-encroachment operations and said the administration used the crackdown to cover up their inefficiency and negligence. They demanded immediate relief for the affected individuals.
The participants formed a committee to consider selling the land previously purchased for the Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and acquiring more suitable land.

According to district police officials, the crossfire erupted after militants launched a sudden attack on an FC checkpost and a nearby police station using heavy weaponry. During the assault, a mortar shell landed inside the Azam Warsak police station, causing partial damage to the building.
DSP Wana Imranullah confirmed the incident, saying that the attackers, whose identity and affiliation remain unknown, opened fire from an undisclosed location. In response, FC and police personnel retaliated, and the firefight continued for an extended period. The assailants, however, managed to flee under the cover of darkness.
DSP Imranullah further said that one of the mortar shells struck a residential house nearby, leaving three civilians injured.
All three injured were rushed to District Headquarters Hospital, Wana, for immediate medical attention.
According to medical superintendent Dr Jan Mohammad, two of the critically wounded were later referred to Dera Ismail Khan via Rescue 1122 ambulance service, while the third victim is reported to be out of danger.
In the aftermath of the attack, law enforcement agencies launched a search operation in the surrounding areas. Authorities said an investigation has been initiated, and efforts are underway to trace the perpetrators.

In Lakki Marwat district, four children drowned in a rainwater pond in the Daulatkhel area of Lakki Marwat district.
A resident said the rural locality received heavy downpour on Sunday night, filling the deep ditch with water.
“The boys, aged between 9-12, got stuck in the deep water while bathing in it. Local divers rushed there and pulled out their bodies,” he said.
A Rescue 1122 official said that divers were sent along with a medical team to the rural area after the control room learned about the incident.
He identified the deceased as Rahimullah, Fahimullah, Fahad and Hamad and said that the bodies were transported to the Government City Hospital.
A hospital official said that the boys had died before reaching the emergency ward. He said that the bodies were handed over to the relatives after fulfilling formalities.
On Sunday night, rain with strong winds lashed urban and rural parts of the district, inundating roads and streets and suspending power supply.
 


The downpour damaged road infrastructure and bridges in some areas and caused suspension of traffic on the Darra Tang Road.
Goods and public transport vehicles travelling between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab stranded, adding to the troubles of transporters and commuters.
Deputy commissioner Zeeshan Abdullah dispatched government officials along with heavy machinery to the site to repair the damaged road and restore traffic movement.
Torrential rains and sudden flash floods late Monday night caused widespread destruction in multiple areas of birmal tehsil, Lower South Waziristan. According to the district administration officials, at least two mud houses were completely destroyed, over 15 rooms collapsed, and fertile agricultural land along with fruit orchards were washed away by the raging floodwaters.
In the Azam Warsak Nargasi area, the house of prominent tribal elder Haji Said Ullah was entirely destroyed in the flood. In the Warai Noor area, the boundary walls and roofs of a house caved in, while a nearby well was also swept away. Fortunately, no casualties were reported, and the family members remained safe.
Strong winds accompanying the rainstorm also blew away solar panels installed on the rooftops of several houses, resulting in disruption of local electricity supply. Life in the affected areas was severely affected, with residents struggling to access food and essential services.
Meanwhile, the Wana–Gomal Zam Road, a vital transport artery connecting South Waziristan Lower with other regions, was once again blocked due to fresh landslides. According to Additional Deputy Commissioner South Waziristan Lower Khalid Qayum, multiple sections of the road, particularly around Sheenikai, have been completely buried under debris, and no clearance operation was initiated. Traffic was diverted to the Wana-Jandola Road, which is also facing congestion and delays.
Met department forecast for Monday night predicted rain showers with thunderstorm and gusty winds is likely at scattered places in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, North and South Waziristan districts.
Heavy rainfall is also expected at isolated places during the period.
Meanwhile, a statement issued here stated that the minister for the local government department put all the relevant agencies on alert during the current spell. It said that following the heavy rains on Sunday in Peshawar and other parts of the province, institutions operating under the LG department took immediate and effective measures, and teams remained active in the field to handle any emergency situation.
According to a Peshawar Development Authority report, at around 4pm, heavy rain and strong winds led to water accumulation on roads in various areas of Hayatabad. However, no drain closure was reported.
All accumulated water was drained within two to three hours after the rain stopped. The areas where water accumulated included Bagh Naran Chowk, PSO Pump Phase III, Phase IV Underpass, Aramco Pump Phase V, Tatara Park Chowk, near Zarghoni Mosque, and some roads in Phase I and Sector D-1.
Mr Khan said the safety and convenience of people during the monsoon was the administration’s top priority. He said all departments should remain alert to deal with any emergency promptly.

The conservative-dominated court, in an unsigned order, lifted a stay that had been placed by a federal district judge on mass layoffs at the department.
The three liberal justices on the nine-member panel dissented.
Trump pledged during his White House campaign to eliminate the Education Department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and he moved in March to slash its workforce by nearly half.
Trump instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job”.
 






Around 20 states joined teachers’ unions in challenging the move in court, arguing that the Republican president was violating the principle of separation of powers by encroaching on Congress’s prerogatives.
In May, District Judge Myong Joun ordered the reinstatement of hundreds of fired Education Department employees.
The supreme court lifted the judge’s order without explanation, just days after another ruling that cleared the way for Trump to carry out mass firings of federal workers in other government departments.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said in the Education ruling that “only Congress has the power to abolish the Department”.
“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naïve, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave,” Sotomayor said.
Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the US, with only about 13 per cent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
 
 

After returning to the White House in January, Trump directed federal agencies to prepare sweeping workforce reduction plans as part of wider efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — previously headed by Elon Musk — to downsize the government.
Trump has moved to fire tens of thousands of government employees and slash programmes — targeting diversity initiatives and abolishing the Education Department, the US humanitarian aid agency USAID and others.</p><small>2025-07-15 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1507520242280c9.jpg?r=075208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924275/ecp-seeks-kp-assembly-session-to-swear-in-mpas-on-reserved-seats' target='_blank'><strong>ECP seeks KP Assembly session to swear in MPAs on reserved seats</strong></a><br><p>• Writes to KP governor, chief minister; says delay in oath taking would prevent it from holding Senate elections on schedule
• Commission reserves verdict on plea seeking redistribution of reserved seats in provincial assembly
ISLAMABAD: With Senate elections in Kh­yber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) just a week away, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has written to the province’s governor and chief minister, asking that the provincial assembly be convened immediately so that new members can be sworn in on reserved seats.
Also on Monday, the ECP reserved its verdict in a case related to reallocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
The letter, addressed to the KP governor’s principal secretary, stated that the commission was obligated to conduct Senate elections in the province, which had been set for July 21.
“But the matter of administration of oath is still pending and dela­yed,” it said.
The correspondence no­ted that the KP Asse­mbly speaker was requ­ested to administer the oath to the newly returned candidates, enabling them to complete the electoral college for Senate elections.
In response, the speaker has conveyed that the oath will be administered when the assembly is in session.
“The Commission has also received a copy of the letter of the Leader of the Opposition, attached with the application submitted by Mr Suresh Kumar MPA and others in this Comm­ission, wherein the Spe­aker has stated that neither the Constitution nor the Provincial Asse­mbly of Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa Proce­dure and Con­duct of Business Rules, 1988, contain any provision empowering the Speaker to summon a session of Assembly on his own,” it said.
Noting that the administration of oaths has already been delayed considerably, it asked the governor to summon the assembly at the earliest.
Through another letter, the KP chief minister has been requested to issue advice to the governor to summon the assembly immediately, so that new members can take oath and the Senate elections can be held.
Verdict reserved
Meanwhile, an ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, reserved its verdict in a case related to the re-allocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly, after hearing arguments from all parties.
Five political parties — the PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, Awami National Party and PTI-Parliamentarians — and 71 individuals had been issued notices, as the ECP fixed the case for hearing after receiving the order of the Peshawar High Court.
The PHC had on July 8 ordered the ECP to redistribute reserved seats after hearing all parties, while declaring the ECP’s notifications on distribution of reserved seats of KP Assembly null and void. The PHC verdict came on a petition filed by the PML-N.
Later, talking to reporters, JUI-F counsel Senator Kamran Murtaza said the PML-N was demanding a greater share of reserved seats after independent candidate, Tariq Awan, joined the party belatedly.
Mr Murtaza said that an independent lawmaker who joins a political party after the time stipulated in the law has expired, continues to be an independent, and this in no way affects the share of a political party in terms of reserved seats.
The PTI-led government currently holds 92 seats in the KP Assembly, while the opposition, which was only able to win 18 out of the total of 115 general seats, has seen its numbers swell to 53.

Former prime minister Ehud Olmert said in the interview with The Guardian newspaper that if Palestinians are “deported into a new ‘humanitarian city’ (in southern Gaza Strip), then you can say that this is part of an ethnic cleansing”.
Olmert served as Israel’s prime minister from 2006 to 2009.
The proposed city intended to hold hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be a “concentration camp”, Olmert warned.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said last week he had told the military to advance plans for the zone, which would be meant to eventually contain the “entire population” of Gaza. The area would be built on the ruins of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, and once Palestinians enter the zone, they would not be allowed to leave.
The minister vowed to implement a plan for the migration of Palestinians from Gaza.
“It is a concentration camp. I am sorry,” Olmert told The Guardian. “If they (Palestinians) will be deported into the new ‘humanitarian city’, then you can say that this is part of an ethnic cleansing.”
He has repeatedly condemned the behaviour of the Israeli military in Gaza and the country’s political leadership. In May, he said he could no more defend Israel against charges of war crimes. “What is it if not a war crime?” he asked rhetorically in an interview with CNN.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right members of his government are “committing actions which can’t be interpreted any other way”, Ehud Olmert added.
His latest comments go beyond questioning Tel Aviv’s intentions in Gaza, particularly since comparisons to Nazi concentration camps is virtually unimaginable in Israel. Olmert said it was an “inevitable interpretation” of the plans.
“People make their way past the rubble of houses in Rafah in Jan 2025, a day after a now-defunct ceasefire deal in the conflict came into force.
“When they build a camp where they (plan to) ‘clean’ more than half of Gaza, then the inevitable understanding of the strategy is that it is not to save (Palestinians). It is to deport them, to push them and to throw them away,” Olmert told the Guardian.
Israeli cabinet discusses proposal
The Israeli defence minister’s proposal for the “humanitarian city” were debated at a meeting with Netanyahu on Sunday.
Yair Lapid, the head of Israel’s opposition, blasted the plans as an attempt by Netanyahu to let his far-right government partners “run wild with extreme fantasies just to preserve his coalition”.
Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said last week that Katz’s plan would entail the forcible transfer of a population in preparation for deportation. Both of these are war crimes, he observed.
“If they are done on a massive scale — whole communities — they can amount to crimes against humanity,” Sfard added.

• Extreme rainfall will become ‘more common and stronger’ by end of the century
ISLAMABAD: Calling the 2022 floods “a forewarning of elevated future flood risks”, a study published in a leading scientific journal warns that Pakistan is likely to experience more frequent and severe floods due to extreme rainfall events and human-induced development encro­aching on floodplains.
Published in Nature, the article comprehensively evaluates the complex interplay of pluvial (direct rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) conditions, upstream snow cover dynamics, and anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape that contributed to the unprecedented 2022 flooding.
 
 

The study says the Indus Plain in Pakistan experienced 19 flood disasters between 1950 and 2012, affecting an area of 599,459km², causing 11,239 deaths, and resulting in economic damages exceeding $39 billion.
“A significant proportion of these flood events were predominantly attributed to monsoon rainfall, with around 10 out of 20 occurrences taking place after the 2000s,” it added.
According to the paper, after a multi-year drought, the pre-monsoon rainfall in 2022 was 111 per cent higher than the long-term average of 1951–2021, increasing soil moisture by 30pc in the Indus Basin floodplains.
“Monsoon rains were 547pc above average, with record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200mm) on already saturated soils. Upstream drainage catchments (e.g., Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi) received 33pc and 41pc more rain in pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, respectively,” it said, adding that August 2022’s streamflow at Sukkur Barrage, just upstream of the floodplains in Sindh, was 170pc larger than the historical average, due to the compounding effects of rain-on-snow and warmer temperatures accelerating snowmelt.
It said the 2022 flood was triggered by pre-monsoon rainfall followed by an intensified monsoon system, adding that during the monsoon season (July-Sep), rainfall in Sindh and Balochistan surged to “between 600 and 1800mm, far exceeding historical average”.
 
 

Anthropogenic changes
According to the study, riverine flooding was amplified by anthropogenic changes, extreme streamflow, and antecedent soil moisture conditions.
“The river water level during the 2022 flood surpassed the levels recorded during the historical catastrophic floods of 2010 and 2015 by 2.4m and 2.79m in Aug. For example, Jun 2022 flows at Sukkur Barrage were 32pc lower than the long-term average (1994–2021), while subsequent months saw increases of 26pc, 105pc, and 170pc, respectively.”
The study revealed human activities were land use adjacent to riverine ecosystems, characterised by intensive agricultural practices and high population density along riverbanks.
For instance, Larkana has consistently expanded toward the riverbanks, with cropland extended from about 37,000km² to 47,500km² between 2001 and 2022.
Another factor that contributed to these floods was the accelerated upstream snowmelt and rain-on-snow events.
‘Adding fuel to fire’
According to the authors of the study, Dr Ali Mirchi and Dr Arfan Arshad, flooding risks in Pakistan could “increase dramatically” under a high-emission scenario, with intense rainfall events, especially 5-day extreme rainfall events in southern Pakistan projected to become “more common and stronger by the end of the century up to 58pc”.
“For example, the frequency of rainfall totals of more than 400mm over five days in this region would increase. At the same time, single-day rainfall extremes (RX1day) could rise by 44pc, pushing already vulnerable regions beyond their coping capacity,” they told Dawn via email.
They said Pakistan could focus on adaptation to mitigate these risks, such as restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, and shifting development away from riverbanks.
“Pakistan cannot solve global warming alone, but local emission reductions combined with smarter land planning can reduce damage and save lives,” they said.
“To reduce the rainfall-induced direct flooding from urban runoff, we have to fix and upgrade drainage systems in both cities and rural areas to reduce flooding. These are practical, actions that can be done quickly and can go a long way in preventing the kind of widespread damage we saw during the 2022 floods,” the authors said, while stressing the need to improve early warning systems.

Muhammad Umar filed the petition for the recovery of his father, Muhammad Sajid.
Representing the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak alleged that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.
He claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.
The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.
He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.
Additional District & Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer (SHO) and directed him to file a reply by July 15.
A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.

The issue at hand was a PTCL announcement in which the company said it would auction a property situated on I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi. Committee’s Chair­man Syed Aminul Haq exp­ressed displeasure, saying the PTCL was not providing the proof of powers that allowed it to sell properties.
The chairman of the committee asked the PTCL team about the specific clauses of the sale and purchase agreement that allowed PTCL to sell its properties without seeking permission from the government. The company did not provide information to the panel, but in a response to the IT ministry it stated that the PTCL’s Memoran­dum of Association allowed the company to sell its properties.
At this, the lawmakers asked if the company had such powers to sell land and wondered whether other government entities could do the same without seeking prior authorisation. Meanwhile, Sher Ali Arbab also expressed concerns that the PTCL had not responded to the queries by the committee.

Chairman says all stakeholders will be invited to in-camera meeting to clear ambiguity

Mazhar Hussain, adviser to the PTCL president, said that the company was not bound to respond to the questions posed by the committee and the reply had been forwarded to the IT ministry. He added that the committee could approach the ministry or Etisalat which retains the management control of the PTCL.
The situation in the committee room turned tense due to this response and Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani suggested taking the matter to a logical end to clear the ambiguity.  The members said the panel had powers to hold the company accountable since it was owned by the government.
The PTCL team was led by Zahida Awan,  Group Chief Legal Officer and it included Naveed Butt and Mazhar Hussain, advisor to President PTCL.
Meanwhile, the representative of the Privatization Commission informed the committee that under Clause 6 of the agreement between the government and Etisalat, the commission was legally bound not to share the details of the agreement unless mutual consent was obtained from both the government of Pakistan and Etisalat.
Amid concerns that the members might have been given ‘incomplete information’ by the company representatives, the chairman said that the matter would be discussed in an in-camera meeting to be attended by the representatives of the IT ministry, the law ministry, the Privatisation Commission, and Etisalat. They will be invited so that the sale and purchase agreement could be thoroughly reviewed.
The next meeting is likely to be held by the end of this month.
Another agenda item pertained to the upcoming projects of the Universal Service Fund (USF) in District Tharparkar and Sargodha Division.
While briefing the committee regarding complaints received from LDI (Long Distance and Inter­national) operators, PTA Chairman retired major general Hafeezur Rehman informed that 9 LDI operators defaulted on their payments, amounting to approximately Rs19 billion. Additionally, more than 100 cases involving these operators were pending in various courts.
The PTA issued notices to the LDI operators and at least six operators had expressed their willingness to clear their outstanding dues, he said, adding that there was a need to formulate a clear mechanism for recovery. According to one of the suggestions, an instalment-based payment plan could be used for recovery.
To address the overall issue, a subcommittee was constituted under the convenorship of Sher Ali Arbab.

According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol is projected to rise by about 2pc to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD is likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre. The final prices will be announced after government approval.
Currently, petrol is priced at Rs266.79 per litre following a Rs8.36 per litre hike on June 30. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.
Diesel, which fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains, stands at Rs272.98 per litre after a Rs10.39 hike earlier this month. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters have already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.

Petrol and diesel rates may rise by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre

In contrast, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to decline by Rs3.80 and Rs2.25 per litre, respectively.
Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.
Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.
Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161tr through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.
Oil falls 1pc
According to a Reuters report, oil prices edged lower on Monday, as investors weighed new threats from US President Donald Trump for sanctions on buyers of Russian oil that may affect global supplies, while still worried about Trump’s tariffs.
Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 1.12pc, to $69.57 a barrel by 1:04 pm EDT (1704 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.07, also 1.56pc, to $67.38.
Trump announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.
Oil prices rallied early, on expectations that Washington would impose steeper sanctions. But prices retreated as traders weighed the 50-day deadline.
“The market took it as a negative because there seemed to be a lot of time to negotiate,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.

In Naseerabad’s Ghafoorabad and Tamboo areas, heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds caused multiple mud houses to collapse. 
The boundary wall of a school in Ghafoorabad was damaged along with numerous solar panels installed in the area. Though the downpour brought some relief from the intense summer heat, the destruction left many residents struggling with damaged property and limited access to basic facilities.
Officials from the local administration confirmed that loss assessment and emergency relief efforts have begun in the affected areas.
Teams have been dispatched to survey the damage and provide immediate assistance to affected families.

Widespread destruction in Naseerabad, Dhadar, Sohbatpur; dozens of mud houses collapse

In nearby Dhadar, intermittent rain continued throughout the day, raising concerns about rising water levels. According to the Irrigation Department, a flood wave of 6,000 cusecs is currently flowing through the Nari River, while another surge of 4,850 cusecs is passing through the Mushkaf Weir, increasing the risk of flash floods in vulnerable regions.
Sohbatpur faced some of the most severe impacts, with torrential rain and storm winds flooding low-lying neighborhoods and causing local streams and drains to overflow. 
Although the weather improved after the rain, the city’s communication and power infrastructure was severely disrupted. Multiple electrical feeders tripped, mobile networks went offline, and the Sohbatpur grid station sustained critical damage. According to Quetta Electric Supply Company, a high transmission line tower collapsed and the grid station’s boundary wall was also brought down by the storm.
Despite improving weather conditions, affected communities in all three districts — Naseerabad, Dhadar, and Sohbatpur — continue to face difficulties. Authorities have launched restoration and relief efforts, though challenges remain as the full scale of the damage is yet to be determined.

“We are creating job opportunities not only through RDMC but also through our large network of partner and supplier companies that are coming onboard to support this major development,” Mr Bristow said during his visit to Humai village, the closest community to the Reko Diq project site. 
“[W]e have launched educational and skills training programmes. Currently, 75 per cent of our workforce is from Balochistan — the majority from Chagai district — and we aim to continue strengthening this local representation,” he added. 
In addition to economic and educational initiatives, RDMC has invested in health services for the region. A health clinic and newly established Mother & Child Health Centre in Humai are delivering quality primary healthcare to villagers — marking the first time communities in the region have had access to a specialised maternal facility offering comprehensive pre- and postnatal care for women.

The initiative, launched under the auspices of the Law and Justice Commi­ssion of Pakistan (LJCP), will be implemented acr­oss all levels of the judiciary, from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court.
The counsels in such cases would be given up to Rs50,000 in remuneration, which would be provided to them through the Dis­trict Legal Empo­werment Commi­ttees, to ensure equi­table access to justice for all citizens.
The decision was taken during a meeting presided over by the chief justice at the Supreme Court Branch Registry in Quetta. The meeting reviewed institutional linkages between the bar associations of Balo­c­histan and LJCP in strengthening justice delivery.
During the meeting, the CJP shared insights from his visits to some remote districts, where he noticed a gap in coordination bet­ween bar associations and the LJCP. He said that despite the availability of funds, they were not being properly utilised for uplifting the district judiciary.
As the commission has limited outreach capacity, LJCP  has decided to post a senior-level representative in every province who will be stationed at the respective high courts. These representatives will act as front desk to maintain liaison with district bar associations, identify local priority areas, raise awareness, and supervise grassroots-level justice sector initiatives.
 
 

The bars associations may present their development project proposals to District  Development Committees. Moreover, representatives of federal and provincial development departments have also been taken on board to ensure speedy execution and to avoid resource duplication.
Moreover, CJP encouraged the bar representatives to ensure that their members benefit from the Continuing Legal Education programmes offered by the Federal Judicial Academy.
Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Attaullah Khan Langov apprised the meeting about various facilities provided by the provincial government to the bar associations across the province.
It included 100 scooties for women lawyers, digital library at High Court Bar, shuttle services from high court to District Court Quetta, a 100-acre housing scheme for lawyers of high court and grant-in-aid by the federal government to 28 districts bars of Balochistan and the High Court Bar Association.
All federal and provincial stakeholders present at the meeting assured their full cooperation and support in advancing the shared goal of accessible and efficient justice.

Data from the national disaster agency between June 26 and July 14 showed that electrocution was the leading cause of fatalities, followed by flash floods.
In late June, at least 13 tourists were swept to their deaths while sheltering from flash floods on a raised river bank.
In its latest report, the disaster agency said 111 people, including 53 children, have been killed, with the highest number of deaths in the most populous province of Punjab.
Meanwhile, the national meteorological service has issued a warning for further heavy rainfall in the northern and eastern regions of the country, with the potential for urban flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage due to strong winds.
 
 

Monsoon season brings South Asia 70 to 80 per cent of its annual rainfall, arriving in early June in India and late June in Pakistan, and lasting through until September.
The annual rains are vital for agriculture and food security, and the livelihoods of millions of farmers.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting the highly complex monsoon.
Pakistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change, and its 240 million residents are facing extreme weather events with increasing frequency.
In 2022, unprecedented monsoon floods submerged a third of Pakistan and killed 1,700 people, with some areas yet to recover from the damage. In May, at least 32 people were killed in severe storms, including strong hailstorms.

• New system will automatically pull data linked to filer’s CNIC, at-source deductions, bank details
• PM seeks early release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals; wants Raast chairman, board to be appointed by September
ISLAMABAD: In a move to simplify tax filing procedures for the salaried class, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has introduced a new interactive return form, which will incorporate an auto-fill system that seamlessly integrates data about purchases, asset details and tax deductions at source etc. — ultimately generating a single-form return upon completion.
The new return form is currently available in English, while the Urdu version is set to come out by the end of this month.
During the first rollout phase, the form will also be available in two regional languages, Sindhi and Pashto. More versions in regional languages — Punjabi and Balochi — are expected to be rolled out subsequently.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, individual taxpayers are required to file their returns by September 30.
The new return form consists of eight digital windows, each containing one input column. The process is designed to be step-by-step, with each screen containing a single question prompt to guide users through the filing process.
In the first window, entering one’s employer’s name will automatically populate the fields of tax deduction at source.
All deductions of withholding taxes based on the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers will also appear on the form.
Similarly, providing bank account details will prompt the form to display closing balances.
Registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will also appear automatically, streamlining data entry and minimising manual input.
 
 

According to an official annou­ncement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the FBR to launch a digital invoicing in Urdu. He said tax reforms should focus on facilitating citizens.
He asked the FBR to expedite the release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals of those amounting to less than Rs50,000. These refunds are to be issued within one month of return submission. The total disbursement under this directive is estimated at Rs10 billion.
While chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms on Monday, the PM instructed the FBR to establish a helpline aimed at assisting the filing process. The meeting was informed that simplified digital tax returns for salaried individuals would be available from Tuesday, with access for other taxpayers beginning by July 30.
PM Shehbaz said tax returns had been made digital, concise, and linked with a central database for public convenience. He believed the salaried class would benefit the most from the new simplified tax returns system. He noted that implementation of AI-based tax assessment system was a major success, calling for raising awareness to encourage taxpayers to use the new system.
 
 

He also emphasized a third-party validation to ensure transparency in all FBR reforms. The premier directed the officials concerned to provide special facilities to small and medium-sized businesses to join the digital invoicing system.
The meeting was briefed on progress regarding digital invoicing, e-Bilty, simplified tax returns, the AI-based assessment system, the central command and control centre, and the cargo-tracking system. It was shared that FBR’s Command and Control Unit would become operational by September, enabling centralized data access and facilitating efficient decision-making.
Regarding the digital invoicing system, it was noted that all small and large businesses would issue receipts through FBR’s online platform at the point of sale and purchase. Approximately 20,000 businesses are expected to be integrated into the system in the coming months.
Customs automation
The meeting was briefed on the AI-driven assessment system that would allow traders to submit advance goods declarations prior to the arrival of ships, with full exemption from upfront duties and taxes. This measure is expected to increase advance declarations from three per cent to over 95pc, allowing containers to be transported directly from ships to factories.
The meeting was informed that within just one month, 8,000 invoices worth Rs11.6bn were issued. The system includes a taxpayer portal and a monitoring dashboard. Integration with PRAL is free of cost, and traders’ training is being actively facilitated. Once fully implemented, traders will no longer need to file separate sales tax returns, as transactions would be automatically recorded in the system.
Digital economy
The PM said the digitisation of the economy was the government’s top priority as it would bring transparency to the system. He said that digitalising payment systems between the public and the government would enhance transparency and ease of use for citizens.
 
 

He directed that progress towards a digital economy be accelerated and instructed that the processes of digitisation and the shift towards a cashless economy be simplified for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He also emphasised that all state-owned enterprises should be integrated into the digital framework.
The PM advised the relevant officials to complete the process for the appointments of the board of governors and chairman of Raast by September. He noted that RAAST’s Board of Directors must comprise business experts.
The meeting was informed that the number of users of mobile apps and digital banking services was expected to increase from 95 million to 120m, with the volume of digital payments projected to rise from Rs7.5bn to Rs15bn. A nationwide public awareness campaign on Raast and digital payments would be launched next month.
To align Pakistan’s economy with those of developed nations, a Digital Payments Index will be introduced within one month. Additionally, the Capital Development Authority Board has approved the right of way for digital public infrastructure in Islamabad.
It was also noted that the remittance system was being digitised, ensuring that all funds sent from abroad would be received through the formal banking system. Coordination is ongoing with the governments of all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to promote digital payments.
