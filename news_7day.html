Yesterday, PTI’s Ali Amin Gandapur said he has resigned from his role as the KP CM while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Afridi to assume the role of provincial chief executive.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today along with Ikhtiar Wali Khan, the coordinator to prime minister on information for KP affairs, Tarar maintained PTI “enables terrorists”.
“These handful of terrorists are enabled by a person sitting in jail who is the chief sponsor of terrorism,” the information minister claimed, saying that PTI founder’s support for terrorists is evident from old interviews.
Tarar said the contention with Ali Amin Gandapur was that he does not do what he’s told, i.e., “enable and support terrorists and prevent actions against them”.
Referring to Afridi as a “fugitive” and “criminal-minded”, the information minister further said he has been brought in to support and give a free hand to terrorists in KP.
“Let me tell this with clarity to the KP govt and PTI,” he said. “Pakistan’s security policy is made in Islamabad and will continue to be so. It will not be made in Kabul. We will not allow terrorists to take full control.”
Tarar alleged that PTI and its founder caused great damage to the country when they “brought in and settled terrorists” in the country, adding that PTI has been in governance for the past 12 years in KP and terrorism has again peaked.
The information minister also referred to the verdict in the London high court earlier today, which ruled against YouTuber and former Pakistan Army officer retired Major Adil Farooq Raja in a high-profile defamation case filed by retired Brigadier Rashid Nasir, a former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer, saying that the verdict was a “win for Pakistan”.
Meanwhile, Ikhtiar Wali said KP is “Pakistan’s most sensitive province”, besieged by terrorism from one side and bad governance from the other.</p><small>2025-10-09 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0918365297aec5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947576/hamas-and-israel-sign-ceasefire-and-hostage-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas and Israel sign ceasefire and hostage deal</strong></a><br><p>Hamas and Israel signed an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza.
Officials on both sides confirmed they had signed the deal following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The deal’s announcement had been greeted with celebrations among Palestinians and Israelis alike.
The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today.
An Israeli government spokeswoman, confirming the deal had been signed, said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the hostages held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said.
A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed.
An Israeli official said all 20 Israeli captives still believed to be alive in Gaza after being seized by Hamas would be released.
The prisoners released in exchange will not include Marwan Barghouti, one of the most prominent Palestinian prisoners, the spokeswoman said.

Key developments

US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line
Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners
Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday


Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, Trump had said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal.
Qatar had said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”.
Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP.
The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said.
The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added.
 
 

The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement
“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
“This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.”
Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
 






He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”.
“The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview.
“This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”.
 






In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.”
“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”.
 






Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”.
In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt.
“I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza.
 






Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier.
An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday.
 






‘Optimism prevails’
As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air.
“We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza.
Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce.
 
 

In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday.
Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible.
The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning.
Protests, prisoners
Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return.
One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for.
High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media.
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”.
Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state
The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration.
Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.
There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.
 
 

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries.
It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.
Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.</p><small>2025-10-09 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0910362549d743c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947639/26th-amendment-case-order-for-formation-of-full-court-can-be-issued-using-judicial-powers-cb-told' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Order for formation of full court can be issued using judicial powers, CB told</strong></a><br><p>Senior lawyer Munir A. Malik contended on Thursday that an order for the formation of a full court could be issued using “judicial powers” as an eight-member Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) heard pleas against the contentious legislation.
The Amendment was passed by the parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The CB hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Today’s hearing — which was streamed live — began at 11:30am and was adjourned at around 1pm. Malik, the counsel for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA), presented his arguments. Former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Abid Shahid Zuberi also began his arguments and is set to continue them on October 13 (Monday).
 
 

During yesterday’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan had requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment’s passage.
Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Ayesha noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.
The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment.
The case was initially taken up in January, and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Malik voiced his support for the arguments presented by LHCBA counsel Hamid yesterday. At this, Justice Mandokhail asked him whether he also backed the statements about “keeping the points of the 26th Amendment aside”.
Justice Mazhar also noted that Hamid had asked the court to ignore the Article 191A introduced in the 26th Amendment, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court.
Malik then replied that a full court “existed before the 26th Amendment”. He contended that the CB was “formed within the Supreme Court” and requested that a bench comprising all SC judges hear the pleas.
During the hearing, judges questioned whether the CB had the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, while Malik contended that it could do so through a judicial order.
“Yes, absolutely. This order can be issued using judicial powers,” the BHCBA lawyer said in response to a question on the matter by Justice Mandokhail. “Everyone is obliged to follow a judicial order under Article 191A,” the counsel added.
At this point, Justice Ayesha asked whether there was any “obstacle” in constituting a full court bench. Justice Mazhar also wondered about the CB’s powers.
The BHCBA lawyer responded that “it did not matter whether the current bench was a regular one or Constitutional, the current bench could decide on who will hear the case”.
Justice Ayesha then asked Malik if he wanted the CB to issue orders for a full court using its judicial powers. “You are depending on the same amendment that you are challenging. This court has said numerous times before not to depend on the challenged amendment but on the original Constitution,” she remarked.
The counsel contended that judicial powers and judicial jurisdiction were two different things. “The Supreme Court is the full court. The Constitutional Bench is a crafted department of the Supreme Court.”
Justice Mandokhail then observed that, as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan nominated the judges for the CB and it had the authority to nominate all apex court judges for the CB. Giving an example, he asked whether the CJP could say “no, this case will be heard by a full court” if the JCP decided a five-member CB.
 
 

Malik replied by saying that any kind of bench could issue a judicial order and there were no obstacles for it.
Here, Justice Ayesha wondered if a full court could be constituted in the presence of the 26th Amendment. “If we have to consider the judicial powers, then do we not have to look at Article 191A?” she asked.
The BHCBA counsel stated that he considered the CB a bench of the apex court.
The petitions
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
 
 

The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

The coalition allies have been trading barbs over how the PPP and PML-N have been providing aid to victims of the recent floods. The bad blood escalated to the point that leaders from both sides hold daily press conferences to take potshots at each other.
In a post on X, the PPP confirmed the telephone call had taken place and that the country’s political situation, foreign policy and flood aid were among the topics of discussion.
 






The war of words between the two sides expanded to water rights on the Indus River as Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
 
 

Last week, she said at a public address that she would not apologise for her remarks and censured the PPP for hurling “wrongful criticism” at the Punjab government over its handling of the floods.
In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, has had lawmakers walk out of the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
Concerted efforts have been made by leading figures, such as the PM and President Asif Ali Zardari, who have stepped in to defuse tensions, with the latter also calling on Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to play his role for a possible rapprochement.
A PML-N delegation, comprising Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq, headed]5 to Nawabshah by special plane on Wednesday night, according to a statement from the Presidency.
While speculation has been rife over what actually sparked the bad blood between both parties, the events of Wednesday night clearly indicated that the disagreement had caused enough ‘trouble in paradise’ for the ruling party to dispatch its ‘A-Team’ in an attempt to win over President Zardari.
Naqvi — who was earlier summoned to Karachi by the president to help — was also present in the meeting.
While there were no details given by either side about the emergent meeting with President Zardari, many observers believed that the decision to send a team to mend fences with the PPP leader must have been endorsed by Nawaz Sharif after his younger brother prevailed upon him to help bring down political temperatures.
Before the PML-N dispatched its top men to Nawabshah, ostensibly to negotiate a rapprochement, background discussions with PML-N and PPP leaders indicated that the tiff was quite serious, and “anything but scripted”.
The development came swiftly on the heels of an announcement by the PPP that it would convene its Central Executive Committee — the party’s top decision-making forum — on October 18 to discuss the political situation in the country.
That the meeting was being called on the anniversary of the Karsaz bombing that targeted the late Benazir Bhutto’s homecoming parade in 2007 was being seen as quite significant, leading many to believe that the party may arrive to some momentous decision at the gathering.
Amid these tensions, the PPP is said to be receiving several proposals — from all quarters — about potentially reviewing it’s support for the PML-N in the Centre. Even in Punjab too, a proposal was floated that the PPP, with around a dozen seats in the Punjab Assembly, should sit on the opposition benches.
But as things stand, there seems to be little chance of the two allies disbanding their relationship, as those who have brokered this alliance will not allow it, insiders opined.</p><small>2025-10-09 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09182408c64521a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947631/ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmad-receives-heros-welcome-in-islamabad-after-flotilla-mission' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad receives hero’s welcome in Islamabad after flotilla mission</strong></a><br><p>Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad arrived in Islamabad on Thursday from Jordan wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker.
 
  @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday. Khan was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla's mission to Gaza to distribute humanitarian aid. His vessel was intercepted in the late hours of October 1 and he was taken in captivity along with other participants of the GSF. After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com   

The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Ahmad, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan.
Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them.
In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan.
“In accordance with the instructions of the honorable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said.
 






The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post.
Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi.
According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home.
“He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Mushtaq was scheduled to reach Pakistan today.
On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia.
“Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said.
“Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over.
“I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention.
“During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.
He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down.
“We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.
He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.

The high-level business delegation from Saudi Arabia, led by Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council Chairman Prince Mansour bin Mohammad Al Saud, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday to discuss trade, investment and collaboration.
The development followed Pakistan forming an 18-member committee to oversee bilateral economic engagements and negotiations with the kingdom. Last month, the two countries also signed a mutual defence agreement, pledging a joint response to any act of aggression.
A press release issued today from the CM Secretariat said the delegation was welcomed at CM House by Shah and provincial ministers. It added that the delegation included over 30 prominent businessmen and investors associated with the energy, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, mining, construction, logistics and investment sectors.
Representatives of the Pakistan Business Council, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) and the Saudi Embassy also attended the meeting.
On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework.
The first MoU was signed for the sale and purchase of shares in KES Power Ltd. The second MoU was signed between K-Electric Limited and Trident Energy Ltd to explore strategic cooperation and investment opportunities in Pakistan’s power sector.
“These agreements reflect growing international investor confidence in Pakistan’s energy market and a renewed commitment to enhancing power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country,’’ a press release from the CM Secretariat said.
“Sindh CM highlights 12 priority investment sectors of Sindh. Saudi companies invited to invest in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, logistics and industrial projects,” the press release said.
 






It said the chief minister acknowledged the historical and brotherly relations between the two countries.
“Sindh is ready to become the gateway for Pakistan’s economic development. We have digitised land records and simplified investment procedures. Investor-friendly and reform-oriented environment is Sindh government’s priority.”
‘‘Our partnership with Saudi Arabia is very important for the economic future of the region. Sindh government is fully aligned with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030,’’ the press release quoted the chief minister as saying.
He pointed out that the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway presented investment opportunities and invited the delegation to participate in Karachi’s Blue and Yellow Line transit systems.
Joint ventures in the fisheries and livestock sectors were also offered to the Saudi delegation, along with an invitation to participate in the establishment of special economic zones.
The chief minister and the Saudi delegation agreed to establish joint working groups, with Shah saying that different sectoral working groups were necessary to ensure continuity of cooperation.
 






‘‘Sindh government is working in full coordination with federal institutions. The Sindh government has close links with the Federal Ministry of Investment, Special Investment Facilitation Council and Trade Development Authority of Pakistan so that foreign investors will be provided with complete facilities from feasibility to practical implementation,’’ CM Shah said.
The press release added that promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors was also discussed.
Prince Mansoor thanked CM Shah for hosting him and said he had come with the delegation to establish a “new partnership’’ between the two countries.
He said sub-committees would be established for each sector and investment would be initiated to promote funding inflows.
Pointing out Karachi’s status as a port city, the Saudi prince said there were “great investment opportunities here’’ while CM Shah said the Sindh government had opened its doors for investment and all possible cooperation would be extended to Saudi investors.
Addressing the delegation, CM Shah said bilateral relations had gained a new dimension with the Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council, adding that the country’s relations with Sindh would also further strengthen.
 






He invited Saudi investors to explore long-term partnerships in Sindh under public-private partnerships, government-to-business and business-to-business models, emphasising collaboration for innovation, technology transfer and industrial growth.
 






On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework.
The first MoU was signed for the sale and purchase of shares in KES Power Ltd. The second MoU was signed between K-Electric Limited and Trident Energy Ltd to explore strategic cooperation and investment opportunities in Pakistan’s power sector.
“These agreements reflect growing international investor confidence in Pakistan’s energy market and a renewed commitment to enhancing power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country,’’ a press release from the CM Secratariat said.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with the kingdom being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In February, Riyadh signed a $1.2 billion deferred oil facility, releasing $100 million monthly until February 2026. Islamabad is also seeking a rollover of $5bn Saudi loans — $2bn maturing in December 2025 and $3bn in June 2026 — at a concessional four per cent interest rate.
Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Riyadh was “central to Pakistan’s economy” as he met Saudi Crown Prince Moha­m­med Bin Salman on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh.
The government is seeking large investments in state-owned enterprises and the development of a petrochemicals plant, according to a Reuters report.
Riyadh has also shown interest in mining in the past, including in buying part of the Pakistani government stake in the multibillion-dollar Reko Diq copper mine being developed in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-10-09 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091749259160862.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947689/workers-remittances-increase-by-841pc-to-95bn-in-fy26s-1st-quarter' target='_blank'><strong>Workers remittances increase by 8.41pc to $9.5bn in FY26’s 1st quarter</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Thursday that overseas workers’ remittances witnessed an increase of 8.41 per cent during the first quarter (July-September) of fiscal year 2025-26.

It added that remittance inflows during September were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($750.9 million), the United Arab Emirates ($677.1m), the United Kingdom ($454.8m) and the United States ($269m).
 






Adviser to Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said Pakistan received $38.3bn in remittances during the last fiscal year, adding that remittances were expected to surpass $41bn in the current fiscal year.
Remittances are a lifeline for millions of households across the country, he said, adding that the continuous increase in remittances strengthened Pakistan’s external accounts.
‘‘Remittances are not merely a source of financial inflow but a symbol of national and economic resilience.’’
 






Currency experts believe remittance growth this year is weaker than in FY25. They cite concerns over a “managed” exchange rate, suggesting some inflows may be diverted away from official banking channels. Despite the rupee’s appreciation over the past two months, market participants argue the current rate may not reflect true market parity.
The government received $38bn in remittances in FY25 and has set a target of $40bn for the current fiscal year. Currency analysts believe maintaining FY25’s inflow level would support exchange rate stability.</p><small>2025-10-09 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09164256b95c662.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947682/hungarian-writer-krasznahorkai-wins-2025-nobel-prize-in-literature' target='_blank'><strong>Hungarian writer Krasznahorkai wins 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature</strong></a><br><p>Hungarian writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, the award-giving body said on Thursday.
The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million crowns ($1.2 million).
Established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes for achievements in literature, science and peace have been awarded since 1901.
“The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2025 is awarded to the Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art,” said Mats Malm, Permanent Secretary at the Swedish Academy.
 






Past winners of the 11 million Swedish crown ($1.2 million) literature prize include French poet and essayist Sully Prudhomme, who bagged the first award, American novelist and short story writer William Faulkner in 1949, Britain’s World War Two Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1953, Turkey’s Orhan Pamuk in 2006 and Norway’s Jon Fosse in 2023.
Last year’s prize was won by South Korean author Han Kang, who became the 18th woman, the first was Swedish author Selma Lagerlof in 1909, and the first South Korean to receive the award.
Over the years, the choices made by the Swedish Academy have drawn as much ire as applause.
In 2016, the award to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan sparked criticism that his work was not proper literature, while Austrian Peter Handke’s prize also drew criticism in 2019.
Handke had attended the funeral in 2006 of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, seen by many as responsible for the deaths of thousands of ethnic Albanians who were killed in Kosovo and the displacement of almost 1 million others during a brutal war waged by forces under his control in 1998-99.
Prizegivers have also in the past been accused of being snobbish, of having an anti-American bias and of ignoring some of the giants of literature, including Russia’s Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, France’s Emile Zola and Ireland’s James Joyce.</p><small>2025-10-09 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091220262772e94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947651/afghan-fm-amir-khan-muttaqi-on-first-india-visit-since-2021' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan FM Amir Khan Muttaqi on first India visit since 2021</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s foreign minister arrived in India on Thursday for talks aiming to foster economic ties with New Delhi in the first such visit by a leader of the group since it seized power in 2021.
The six-day trip by Amir Khan Muttaqi highlights the Taliban’s efforts to spur engagement with regional powers to secure eventual diplomatic recognition.
He is set to meet Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and other officials to discuss a range of political, economic and trade matters.
“We look forward to engaging discussions with him on bilateral relations and regional issues,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X welcoming the minister.
 






Muttaqi is also expected to speak with Indian business representatives, visit the ancient monument to love, the Taj Mahal, and a historic Islamic seminary, media said.
He arrives in New Delhi after talks in Moscow with diplomats from Afghanistan’s neighbours, who appeared to unite against US President Donald Trump’s stated aim of taking over the Bagram military base near Kabul, the capital.
Russia is the only country to have yet recognised the Taliban administration, whose members are under UN sanctions including a travel ban and asset freeze, including Muttaqi, who got a temporary exemption to visit India.
Historically, India and Afghanistan have had friendly ties but New Delhi does not recognise the Taliban and shut its embassy in Kabul after the US withdrawal from the war-shattered country in 2021.
New Delhi opened a small mission a year later to ease the way for trade, medical support and humanitarian aid, while its senior officials have held two-way talks with Taliban leaders.</p><small>2025-10-09 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091607563f63d62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947680/uk-signs-468m-deal-to-supply-india-with-missiles' target='_blank'><strong>UK signs $468m deal to supply India with missiles</strong></a><br><p>Britain said on Thursday it had signed a £350 million ($468m) contract to supply the Indian army with UK-manufactured lightweight missiles, as part of a deepening weapons and defence partnership between the two countries.
The announcement came as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was visiting Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Mumbai, where the pair hailed the potential of the commercial links from their months-old trade deal.
In its statement on the defence deal, the British government said the new contract for Lightweight Multirole Missiles made by Thales in Northern Ireland would secure 700 jobs at a factory which currently makes the same weapons for Ukraine.

“The deal paves the way for a broader complex weapons partnership between the UK and India, currently under negotiation between the two governments,” it said.
Starmer has, over the last 12 months, thrown his weight behind Britain’s defence sector to try to drive higher economic growth, pledging to up spending in line with Nato targets, as well as focusing on winning exports, such as a recent $13.5 billion frigate contract with Norway.
Britain also said on Thursday it reached a new milestone with India on a tie-up for electric-powered engines for naval ships as both countries signed the next phase of a deal, worth an initial £250m.
Modi hails Indian dynamism, UK expertise
Starmer’s visit, accompanied by the largest-ever business delegation, “reflects the new energy and broad vision” in the partnership, Modi said after talks with the British prime minister.
“India’s dynamism and the UK’s expertise together create a unique synergy,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi.
“Our partnership is built on trust … it is a clear reaffirmation of our shared commitment to … build a brighter future for the people of both our nations.”
Starmer said the focus of his visit was about doubling down on the potential of the trade deal, expected to take effect within a year.

“When we leave India tonight, I expect that we will have secured major new investments creating thousands of high-skilled jobs in the sectors of the future.”
An Indian foreign ministry statement said the two sides agreed to set up an India-UK connectivity and innovation centre and a joint centre for AI, and unveiled a critical minerals industry guild to bolster supply chains and promote green technologies.
They also announced joint investment in a climate technology startup fund and set up new collaborations on health and renewable energy, an offshore wind task force, and a health research partnership, among other things, it said.

But the two countries do not agree on everything.
After Modi wished Russian President Vladimir Putin a happy birthday on Tuesday, Starmer joked to reporters that he would not be doing the same, given Britain’s strong backing for Ukraine and condemnation of Russia over its invasion.
Britain says it respects India’s strategic independence and Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander, a former trade minister who joined the delegation, told reporters the issue had not prevented Starmer from leveraging close ties with Modi to expand the UK economy.
Separately, Modi said flying instructors from the Indian Air Force would serve as trainers with the Royal Air Force, as part of their agreement for cooperation in military training.
New Delhi has for decades been dependent on Moscow for much of its military hardware but has slowly moved away in recent decades to buy from France, Israel, and the US.

The defamation suit was filed in August 2022, but was made public in April after the respondent stirred another controversy in Pakistan over his allegations targeting leading film and TV actresses.
On Thursday, the court found Raja’s allegations of corruption, electoral interference, and human rights abuses against Nasir to be “false and baseless”, ordering him to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs.
Justice Richard Spearman KC delivered the judgment, ordering Raja to pay £50,000 (around Rs20 million) in damages and approximately £300,000 (around Rs110m) in legal costs.
The court also directed Raja to publish a summary of the verdict on all his social media platforms, confirming that his claims against Nasir were untrue. In addition, he must apologise and give a written assurance that he will not repeat the allegations.
The case was based on nine social media posts and videos in which Raja accused Brig Nasir of corruption, political interference, and misuse of authority. He alleged that Nasir influenced court proceedings, interfered in elections and engaged in political dealings on behalf of senior military officials — claims that the court found to have no factual basis.
Justice Spearman noted that Raja failed to provide credible evidence or reliable sources to support his statements.
He also observed that the three witnesses presented by Raja — journalist Shaheen Sehbai, former PTI leader Shahzad Akbar, and Syed Akbar Hussain — did not provide testimony that substantiated any of the allegations.
Following the ruling, Adil Raja expressed his disappointment with the judgment.
“Today is a disappointing day,” he wrote on X. “The judge was not with us.”
He added: “Our resolve is undeterred despite today’s setback. Our struggle for democracy in Pakistan will continue. The people of Pakistan are witnesses to the facts on the ground, and their determination for freedom remains rock solid. Our mothers and sisters who have faced brutality and torture with courage in their eyes know that we are fighting for them.”</p><small>2025-10-09 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09162601567faec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947681/otis-pays-penalty-as-pakistan-held-by-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Otis pays penalty as Pakistan held by Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Otis Khan missed a penalty as Pakistan played out a goalless draw against Afghanistan at the Jinnah Stadium in Islamabad on Thursday, securing their first point in the third round of qualifying for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.
Nolberto Solano’s side had the better of the opportunities against the jaded visitors, who only arrived in Islamabad less than 24 hours before kickoff due to a prolonged visa problem.
However, the hosts weren’t able to capitalise on the chances — notably Otis’ opportunity when he blazed his spot-kick over the bar midway through the second half — in front of a fervent home crowd.
 






The draw meant Pakistan and Afghanistan both got off the mark in Group ‘E’, and they trail joint-leaders Syria and Myanmar by five points.
Syria were hosting Myanmar later on Thursday in a clash between two teams

Convergent evolution, or convergence, refers to the repeated, independent emergence of the same trait in two or more lineages of species during evolution, often indicating functional adaptation to specific environmental factors.
The research team uncovered the critical role of high-order protein features in adaptive convergence.
Despite the significant evolutionary distance between bats and toothed whales, both species have independently developed the ability to perceive their environment through echolocation.
The research team, led by Zou Zhengting, proposed a computational analysis framework named “ACEP”. The core innovation of this framework lies in its use of a pre-trained protein language model.
“A protein language model can understand the deeper structural and functional characteristics and patterns behind amino acid sequences,” Zou explained.
“This work not only deepens the understanding of the laws of evolution of life but also demonstrates the strong potential of AI technology in resolving complex biological issues,” Zou said.
“We hope to achieve broader and more effective application of AI technology in evolutionary biology in the future.”</p><small>2025-10-09 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09152820ae89d11.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947665/security-measures-tightened-in-rawalpindi-following-raid-on-tlp-lahore-headquarters-police' target='_blank'><strong>Security measures tightened in Rawalpindi following raid on TLP Lahore headquarters: police</strong></a><br><p>Security in Rawalpindi was heightened on Thursday as tensions rose in Lahore and the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) prepared for a large anti-Israel protest in Islamabad.
On Wednesday night, violence broke out in Lahore after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of TLP in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. The group had annou­nced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital on Friday.
At least three police constables were reportedly injured in clashes with enraged TLP supporters, who attacked law enforcers with stones and iron rods. Police responded with tear-gas shelling, turning Multan Road into a battleground.
Today, Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani chaired an important meeting regarding the law and order situation, a statement from the police said.
 






“No person is allowed to take the law into their hands under any circumstances,” the CPO added, according to the statement. “Blocking any road, traffic or any activity affecting the normal life of citizens will not be allowed.”
The meeting was attended by the senior superintendent of police (SSP) operations, SSP investigation, divisional superintendents, SPs, and sub-divisional police officers.
The CPO reviewed the law and order situation and issued instructions to the officers, the statement said, adding that “violent activity under the guise of protests will not be tolerated.”
“Those who create disturbance in peace and order or violate the law will be dealt with strictly. Rawalpindi Police is determined and ready to deal with any situation. Attack on the lives and property of citizens, property or law enforcement agencies will not be tolerated under any circumstances.”
In view of the situation in the city, hostels and hotels on Murree Road and the surrounding areas have been told to evacuate non-essential people, with only foreigners and patients able to stay.
However, the CPO told Dawn.com that “foreigners, patients, families, and students appearing in exams have been exempted.”
Two TLP workers arrested on Tuesday were produced before a Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court, which remanded them in police custody for 10 days for further investigation.
According to a police spokesman, the two suspects were transporting “dangerous items for a violent protest and rally of a religious political party” when they were arrested by Chaklala police.</p><small>2025-10-09 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091416472766068.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947667/google-announces-free-one-year-ai-pro-plan-for-pakistani-students' target='_blank'><strong>Google announces free one-year AI Pro Plan for Pakistani students</strong></a><br><p>Google announced on Thursday that Pakistani students of age 18 and above will be able to gain access to a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan.

Here’s how</strong></a><br><p>As the winter of 2025 approaches, the genie of smog is preparing to escape its bottle in South Asia, especially in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This phenomenon occurs every year during the late autumn and winter months when temperature inversions cap the lower atmosphere across the Indus and Ganges plains.
With shallow mixing heights and weak winds, emissions accumulate under the skies in the region, causing severe health hazards for vulnerable populations. The principal health burden from particulate matter is often accompanied by ground-level ozone.
According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6), these pollutants are key contributors to cardiopulmonary diseases, exposing elderly people and children in particular to higher health risks.
In Pakistan, alarm bells are ringing in policy and governance circles, which have increasingly failed to provide any clear-cut vision to control the persistent issue of smog that affects major cities across the country including Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan, and their surrounding towns.
It’s been done before, it can be done again
Last year, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Lahore exceeded 700. In November 2024, it even reached over 1,500, making Lahore one of the most polluted cities in the world. The question now is: how do we control it with the available resources. Let’s look at two major examples, China and England, where comprehensive policies were enforced in the 1950s to control smog and emissions.
In December 1952, a stagnant weather pattern in London trapped coal smoke in the atmosphere for several days. Sunlight was blotted out, visibility plummeted, and thousands lost their lives to respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Recognising the gravity of the crisis, the British government enacted the Clean Air Act of 1956 — a landmark move that demonstrated how timely regulation can effectively curb the menace of smog.
 
 

Years later, several Chinese megacities faced similar episodes of acute smog. The government responded with stricter fuel and industrial standards, and within a few years, citizens previously exposed to dangerously high levels of PM2.5 began to experience marked improvements in air quality.
These two examples offer valuable lessons for Pakistan in formulating its own strategy to curb emissions. The country shares similar atmospheric conditions and potential policy tools, even if the sources of pollution differ.
However, while regulatory frameworks exist, Pakistan continues to grapple with severe policy implementation challenges. Effective execution demands strong governance mechanisms, a trained and committed bureaucracy, public support, and transparent enforcement — all of which remain lacking. As a result, the threats of smog and air pollution continue to loom large.
Engines of Pakistan’s smog crisis
In Pakistan, the transport sector remains the leading contributor to the smog crisis. Although national fuel standards have improved over the years, much of the existing fleet is outdated and poorly regulated.
Pre Euro and Euro-II diesel trucks and buses dominate long-haul corridors while the inspection and maintenance of all other types of vehicles are inconsistent. The use of substandard lubricants and widespread reliance on backup diesel generators further exacerbate emissions. In urban areas, two- and three-wheelers, along with small engines, release significant amounts of black carbon and nitrogen oxides which are key drivers of the winter haze and precursors of secondary particulate matter.
 


Furthermore, brick kilns encircling many cities in the Punjab often burn low-grade coal and in some cases, waste fuels, which significantly contribute to emissions due to continuous intensive burning and high impurities such as sulphur, moisture, and heavy metals. To reduce the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel requirements, a low hanging fruit is to convert fixed chimney kilns into zig zag designs.
Industrial clusters, including cement, steel re-rolling, textiles, foundries, and glass manufacturing, are major emitters of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Despite existing emission limits, continuous monitoring and third-party audits are rarely carried out.
 
 

Filtration systems and low nitrogen oxide (Nox) technologies, where installed, are often poorly maintained or inconsistently operated. During periods of temperature inversion, emissions from these clusters can push entire regions into hazardous air quality levels. Strengthening monitoring systems and ensuring transparent reporting have, therefore, emerged as key priorities in recent policy documents and reviews of air quality governance.
The agricultural sector also poses one of the biggest threats to Pakistan’s air quality. The open burning of crop residues leads to predictable pollution spikes during October and November each year. In Punjab, these fires often coincide with similar burning across the border in India’s Punjab.
Under the influence of northeasterly winds and stable, cool air, the resulting smoke blankets Lahore and much of the central plains. Satellite based analysis and sector studies highlight that residue burning worsens winter smog episodes and underscores the need for in situ management and ex situ markets for straw.
The road to cleaner air
The health consequences stemming from smog aren’t just limited to breathing issues. Fine particles penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstreams, elevating the risk of heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and various metabolic disease.
The elderly population, outdoor workers, children, and people with pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions are especially subjected to higher risks during short durations of smog. In coastal cities such as Karachi, high humidity and heat can exacerbate health risks.
 
 

Air pollution and climate change intersect in the same chimneys and tailpipes. Several short-lived climate forcers such as black carbon, methane, and ozone precursors degrade air quality and contribute to rising atmospheric temperatures.
In such alarming circumstances, Pakistan needs to make significant changes in its transport as well as industrial, and agricultural sectors to make them environment-friendly and sustainable so as to align with sustainable development goal 13 (SDG-13), which accounts for climate action. IPCC AR6 finds that targeting these pollutants can yield rapid health improvements and climate benefits when combined with sustained carbon dioxide reductions.
In the case of transport, emphasis needs to be placed on vehicle (cars and 2/3 wheelers) inspection and maintenance, compliance to registration and toll access, and retirement of heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) that release harmful emissions. Simultaneously, fuel quality at oil refineries must be enhanced to meet emission limits as per Euro 5 and Euro 6 fuel standards. Prioritising clean buses for high-demand routes is the need of hour to maximise public health benefits.
As far as the industrial sector is concerned, Pakistan must complete transition to cleaner brick kiln designs as suggested above. Continuous and real-time emissions monitoring must be made mandatory for large industrial stacks so they can measure their emissions and take necessary action when required.
To further reinforce these actions, there is a need to establish standardised third-party audits and release compliance reports to enable regulators, communities, and investors to monitor progress of industrial zones.
 
 

Pakistan must ban crop waste burning with strict monitoring and transparent reporting. Instead, there is a need to replace open burning of crop residues with viable alternatives by scaling in situ residue management and building ex situ markets for industrial boilers, compressed biogas, and pellets. Coordinate across borders and prioritise ending waste burning because smoke does not respect administrative lines.
London showed the world how quickly air can be improved when public policy bows to science. China proved that large-scale transformation is possible when standards, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms are aligned.
Pakistan, too, can breathe easier by curbing transport emissions, modernising kilns and industries, prohibiting the open burning of crop waste, and guiding public behaviour. The science is clear; what remains clouded is resolve. Once we begin to implement the proposed changes with consistency, our grey horizons could once again turn blue.

Italy was the scene of some of Europe’s biggest pro-Palestinian protests last weekend, as Israeli forces continue their offensive in Gaza.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered across Italy in anger at Israel’s actions, and calls for the country to be barred from international sport have grown louder.
 






The protests were in response to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, which was sparked by the attack by Hamas fighters on October 7, 2023, on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip.
During Friday’s massive strike action in support of the Palestinians, demonstrators went to the Italian national team’s training centre in Florence to demand the match against Israel be called off.
As of Tuesday only around 4,000 tickets had been sold for the game in Udine, a small city in Italy’s far north-east, which was picked specifically to help limit the potential for disorder.
Udine was the venue when Italy — who face Estonia in Tallinn on Saturday — last hosted Israel, in the Nations League in September 2024. That match passed off largely without incident, albeit surrounded by a massive security operation which included soldiers on the roof of the stadium.
But the threat of much bigger and more disruptive protests led Udine’s mayor Alberto Felice De Toni to ask for the match to be postponed.
‘Very sad’
This week Italy’s coach Gennaro Gattuso said the situation in Gaza was “very sad” and lamented a difficult atmosphere for a match which will be key to Italy’s hopes of avoiding missing out on a third straight World Cup.
 
 

“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it… I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” Gattuso said.
His task was already complicated enough without the external political pressure of playing Israel, as direct qualification for the World Cup is seriously in doubt.
Only the winner of the five-team group is guaranteed an automatic spot and Italy sit second, level on nine points with Israel and six behind leaders Norway, but with a game in hand on both.
However Norway’s far superior goal difference — they have a 16-goal advantage over Italy — means Gattuso’s side can only top the group if they win all four of their remaining matches and Erling Haaland and company slip up before they travel to the San Siro next month.
That leaves second place and a spot in the play-offs as the likely route to the World Cup, a tournament in which Italy haven’t played a knockout fixture since winning it in 2006.

Pakistan’s shrimp exports to the US have been banned since 2017 because fishermen were not using the TED in their nets, endangering turtles.
A TED is a specialised mechanism fitted into shrimp trawl nets that allows sea turtles and other large marine animals to escape while retaining shrimp, the statement said.
“Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the launch of a PKR 90 million initiative aimed at protecting sea turtles during shrimp trawling operations, as part of broader efforts to sustain marine biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of ocean resources,” a statement from the ministry said.
It added that the project aimed to distribute and install TEDs at zero cost to fishermen.
“Shrimp trawling often results in the capture of large quantities of non-target marine species. When sea turtles become trapped in nets, they are unable to surface for air and can drown,” the statement quoted the maritime minister as saying.
The project will also feature “capacity-building workshops, hands-on training for trawler crews, and data collection to monitor the devices’ impact on shrimp catch efficiency and net performance,” the statement read.
The minister stressed that TEDs “would significantly reduce the accidental capture of endangered sea turtles, mitigate concerns from fishermen over shrimp loss and net damage, and pave the way for Pakistan to regain US certification —  essential for resuming shrimp exports to the American market.”
 
 

“The project aligns with Pakistan’s international commitments on marine sustainability and biodiversity conservation, ensuring compliance with global seafood traceability and sustainability standards,” Chaudhry was quoted as saying.
This initiative will showcase Pakistan’s commitment to responsible marine resource management, enhancing its reputation in the global seafood trade, Chaudhry added.
Pakistan currently sells shrimp at a comparatively low rate of about $2 per kilogram, the minister said, noting that with TED compliance and improved international certification, the price could rise to $6 per kilogram, unlocking new opportunities in lucrative markets including the US, EU, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
He urged the Karachi Fisheries Harbour Authority, Sindh Fisheries Department, and Marine Fisheries Department to ensure immediate and full TED compliance, both at sea and at dockside, the statement read.
Cautioning about risks associated with non-compliance, the minister said, “One hundred per cent TED compliance and credible enforcement will be ensured.
Meanwhile, on the economic front, Pakistan’s current shrimp exports are around $100m per year, Chaudhry said, stressing that investing in TED compliance could “potentially triple export volumes and open access to premium markets such as the European Union and Canada.”
“The project is being supported by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), Pakistan Fisheries Exporters Association (PAKFEA), Sindh Trawler Owners Fisheries Association (STOFA), Karachi Fish Harbour Authority (KFHA), Sindh Marine Fisheries Department (SFD), and Fishermen’s Cooperative Society (FCS),” the statement read.
According to a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) study from 2012, around 30,000 sea turtles were annually caught in the tuna gillnet fisheries of the country.
Entanglement in fishing nets is the most serious threat to marine turtles. It was estimated that about three per cent of entangled turtles were dying due to drowning or mishandling onboard fishing vessels.</p><small>2025-10-09 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/03/1112180874fe9c9.jpg?r=121828' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1897220/really-suffocating-pakistan-emerges-from-record-smog-season' target='_blank'><strong>‘Really suffocating’: Pakistan emerges from record smog season</strong></a><br><p>The article was first published in March 2025 and has been replugged for DawnMedia’s upcoming air pollution conference in Lahore.

Tens of millions of Pakistanis spent at least four months breathing toxic air pollution 20 times above safe levels, in the worst winter smog season for several years, according to data analysed by AFP.
Pakistan regularly ranks among the world’s most polluted countries, with Lahore often the most polluted megacity between November and February.
AFP’s analysis of data recorded since 2018 by independent air monitoring project AQICN shows the 2024-2025 winter smog season started a month earlier in October and persisted at higher levels, including in cities normally less affected by pollution.
Lahore’s 14 million residents spent six months breathing concentrations of PM2.5 — tiny particles that can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream — at levels 20 times or more than recommended by the World Health Organisation.

Those in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, and the capital Islamabad were subjected to 120 days of the same choking pollution levels.
“The smog is just getting worse every year,” admitted a factory owner in Lahore, who wished to remain anonymous after openly criticising government policies.
“If I was rich, my first decision would be to leave Pakistan for Dubai, to protect my children and raise them in a smog-free environment,” he told AFP.
Legal action
Experts say the pollution is primarily caused by factory and traffic emissions. It worsens in winter as farmers burn crop stubble and cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds trap the deadly pollutants.
This year, winter rains that typically bring relief did not arrive until late February, as climate change renders Pakistan’s weather patterns increasingly unpredictable.
The smog was so thick it could be seen from space and prompted authorities to close schools serving millions of students across the largest province Punjab, including its capital Lahore.
 
 

Young climate activist Risha Rashid said Islamabad is fast becoming “another Lahore” and has launched legal action against the government.
“It’s really suffocating,” the 21-year-old, who has asthma, told AFP.
“I cannot go out, even if I have exams. It’s not just affecting our physical health but our mental health as well.”
An Ipsos poll in November found four out of five Pakistanis said they were affected by the smog.
It can cause sore throats, stinging eyes and respiratory illnesses, while prolonged exposure can trigger strokes, heart disease and lung cancer.
Its effects are worse for children, who breathe more rapidly and have weaker immune systems.
‘At war’
This smog season, Punjab’s provincial government declared a “war on smog”, increasing public air quality monitoring devices tenfold to around 30 and offering farmers subsidised rentals of machinery to clear crop stubble and avoid burning.
It also pledged to increasingly enforce emissions regulations on tens of thousands of factories and more than 8,000 brick kilns, a major source of black carbon emissions.
But environmentalists and experts say action has been piecemeal and sometimes counterproductive, including restrictions on private air quality monitoring devices that the government claims give “misleading results that spread panic.” And anti-smog machines, including a tower in Lahore shut down two months after installation, are effectively useless, experts say.
“It is like putting an air conditioner out in the open,” said one who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Pledges for clean air
Efforts that tackle pollution’s effects, rather than its source, miss the point, said Ahmad Ali Gul at Lahore’s University of Management and Technology.
“It’s like when you have a bathtub and it’s overflowing and it’s creating a huge mess, do you first grab a towel or you first close the tap?” he said.
“First, we need to focus on reducing the emissions and then we talk about how to protect ourselves from smog.”
The government has blamed rival India, which borders Punjab province, for pollution blowing over into Lahore.
But Pakistan has limited vehicle emissions standards, and officials admit 83pc of Lahore’s carbon emissions are from transport.

“Switching to a cleaner fuel would give immediate results, we’ve seen it in other countries,” said Frank Hammes, the global CEO of the Switzerland-based AQI air quality project.
But that “needs a pretty strong central effort to push down sometimes the painful changes that need to be made in order to reduce air pollution,” he added.
Pakistan’s government wants electric vehicles (EVs) to account for a third of new sales by 2030.
Cheaper Chinese models launched in Pakistan in 2024 but currently make up just a fraction of overall car sales in a country where 40 per cent of the 240 million population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank.
 
 

Pakistan had a taste of clean air during the pandemic when a lockdown forced vehicles off the streets and factories to close in March 2020, but it was short-lived, as the economic impact was too great for many to bear.
“Air quality improved so much that we could even see the stars in Lahore in the evening,” said Omar Masud, a director of Urban Unit, which analyses pollution data for the government.
While climate change can make air pollution worse, few Pakistanis worry about global warming, explained Abdul Sattar Babar, Ipsos director for Pakistan.
“Most Pakistanis are overwhelmed by the economic challenges that they are facing,” he said.
“When you can barely survive, climate issues are obviously not your primary concern”.

Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
DI Khan Regional Police Officer (RPO) Ashfaq Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that a police checkpoint in DI Khan’s Khutti area was attacked by terrorists from multiple sides.
When asked to confirm if the checkpoint in charge — identified as Ahmed Nawaz — was seriously injured during the attack and later succumbed to his injuries, Anwar said, “Yes.”
Funeral prayers for the deceased were offered today at the Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
In attendance at the funeral were: RPO Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmad, SPs of CTD, investigation, city, and headquarters, officers of security forces, police officials, and the family members of the martyr, according to APP.
The attack comes on the same day a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in DI Khan, the military’s media wing said.
Last week, a soldier was martyred and another was injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Bannu.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.

The development comes a day after the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred in an exchange of fire between the forces and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.
According to the ISPR’s statement issued today, security forces carried out the IBO on Wednesday on the reported presence of “khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij” in the Daraban area of DI Khan.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP.
During the operation, the ISPR said, seven “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” due to effective engagement by security forces’ troops.
However, during the intense exchange of fire, 30-year-old Major Sibtain Haider, a resident of the Quetta district, embraced martyrdom. “A brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.”
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were found in the custody of the slain terrorists, who had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [the] killing of innocent civilians”.
A sanitisation operation was being carried out to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area”, the ISPR statement said.
It added that the “security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave sons further strengthen our resolve”.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces’ successful operation in Daraban, DI Khan and paid rich tribute to Major Sibtain Haider for his “valour and sacrifice, saying the nation’s resolve to end terrorism remains unshakable”, a statement posted on the presidency’s X account said.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to martyred Major Sibtain Haider, according to a statement posted by his ministry on X.
 






State-run APP reported that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also lauded security forces for the successful operation and paid them rich tribute for their “courage and professionalism in eliminating terrorists who pose a threat to peace and stability in the region”.
Expressing grief over the martyrdom of Major Sibtain Haider, he extended condolences to his family and prayed for the “elevation of his ranks in Jannah”.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Subsequently, amid rising terror attacks, the government labelled the group as Fitna al Khwarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers.
Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.  In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan.
Last month, after 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the  “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091133139e65318.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947647/commonwealth-says-time-taken-for-election-reports-varies-following-concerns-over-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Commonwealth says time taken for election reports ‘varies’ following concerns over delay</strong></a><br><p>Foreign observation mission Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has clarified that the time taken to write and release its reports “varies considerably” with each group and that the report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections was finalised by the end of that year.
The COG report, released to the public on September 30, had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the polls to be riddled with problems. According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth secretary general on Nov 20, 2024.
“The length of time taken to write COG reports, and similarly, the finalisation and release of the publication, varies considerably with each COG. Other factors affecting the release dates include legal challenges and disputes. In this case, a comprehensive report of over 160 pages was finalised by the end of 2024,” the Commonwealth said in a statement on Tuesday.
It added that its secretariat first shared the report earlier this year with Pakistani government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), encouraging a “domestic mechanism which convenes all electoral stakeholders to address the recommendations in the COG report”.
 
 

“Subsequently, the secretariat sought information on the status of action taken. This process was necessary for any further steps with regard to the internal process for releasing the report,” the statement added.
“It was then decided that the Pakistan COG report, along with two other outstanding reports of elections in 2024, would be released at the end of September. This timeline was made available to the media, when contacted, and the report was duly published on September 30 along with other reports,” the Commonwealth said.
On the same day the COG released its Pakistan report, it also made public the reports for Mozambique and Botswana — almost 11 months after both of them were held in October 2024.
“The Commonwealth Secretariat is guided by, and is deeply committed to, the values of the Commonwealth Charter, which are shared by all our member countries,” the statement stressed.
The body cited the 2018 Revised Commonwealth Guidelines for the Conduct of Election Observation in Member Countries, as per which the reports are “shared with the member government, Election Management Bodies (EMBs) and with other stakeholders” first and “thereafter, the report is made public”.
 
 

“We strongly encourage all stakeholders to use the report constructively, in service of the people of Pakistan. As we have stated in earlier statements, we remain ready to support any mechanism aimed at strengthening democracy in Pakistan, for the benefit of all its citizens,” the Commonwealth said.
“We will continue to partner with stakeholders to ensure that COG reports are released in a timely manner,” it added, affirming its commitment to transparency while adhering to the sequence of release as outlined in the 2018 Revised Guidelines.
The statement comes after 130 activists, lawyers and journalists wrote a letter to the Commonwealth Secretariat on October 2, expressing concern over the “extraordinary” delay in the report’s publication and noting that election reports were usually published routinely without any delay.
In its report, the COG had noted the denial of an election symbol to the PTI, the consecutive convictions of the party’s founder Imran Khan and limitations on the freedom of assembly, adding that such conditions “consistently limited one party’s ability to contest the election on a level playing field”.
 
 

It also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy, saying it reviewed documentation suggesting that Form-45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates.
Commenting on the Commonwealth’s latest statement, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “The Commonwealth Guidelines clearly state that election reports must be issued in a ‘timely manner, initially to key national stakeholders and then made public’ and specifically identify all ‘political parties taking part in the elections’ as key stakeholders.
“This was not done,” he said.
 






At the time of the 2024 elections, a team of inter­national observers from the Commonwealth had expressed their satisfaction at the poll­ing exercise and pla­yed down suspension of mobile cellular services in the country.
COG Chairperson Dr Goodluck Jonathan, who was chairing the observer mission, shared the group’s preliminary findings days later and noted the impact of legal decisions on some candidates’ ability to run for office in the days leading up to election day.
“We call on all those with grievances to address disputes through prescribed election dispute resolution mechanisms,“ he said.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/090939277ef26e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947556/kharan-judge-back-home-after-2-days-in-captivity' target='_blank'><strong>Kharan judge back home after 2 days in captivity</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The abducted judge of Kharan Qazi court, Mohammad Jan, returned home safely on Wednesday after remaining in captivity for two days, police said.
“Judge of the Qazi court had been abducted by armed men after setting the court building on fire two days back,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rakhshan region, Abdul Hayee Amir Baloch, told Dawn. The judge was “safe and sound”, Mr Baloch added.
It was not immediately clear whether the judge had been freed by the kidnappers or recovered by authorities.
Police said a group of armed men had stormed into the Qazi Court building in the Maskan Kalat area, some 30km from Kharan city, while the judge was hearing cases. They held him and the court staff hostage, ransacked records and damaged office furniture and other items on the premises before setting them on fire. While fleeing, they had taken the judge with them at gunpoint.

An IMF mission led by Iva Petrova met with Pakistan’s economic team in Karachi and Islamabad from September 24 to October 8 to review the implementation of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The programme’s performance as of the end of June this year — the period under review — has been mixed.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its review for the country.
In a statement released early on Thursday, the Fund quoted Petrova as saying, “The IMF mission and the Pakistani authorities made significant progress toward reaching a staff-level agreement on the second review under the 37-month extended arrangement under the EFF and on the first review of 28-month arrangement under the RSF”.
“Programme implementation remains strong, and broadly aligned with the authorities’ commitments,” she added.
“Significant progress was made in the discussions in several areas, including sustaining fiscal consolidation to strengthen the public finances while providing needed flood recovery support; ensuring inflation remains durably within the State Bank of Pakistan’s target range by maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy; restoring the viability of the energy sector by implementing regular tariff adjustments and cost-reducing reforms; and advancing structural reforms to reduce the footprint of the state, strengthen governance and  transparency, foster a more competitive business environment, and liberalize commodity markets,” she said.
“Productive discussions were also held on the authorities’ reform agenda to strengthen climate resilience, including the completion of reform measures under the RSF,” Petrova said.
She said that the IMF team and the authorities would continue policy discussions “with a view to settling any outstanding issues”.
She concluded by saying, “The IMF team wants to express its sympathy to those affected by the recent floods, and is grateful to the Pakistani authorities, private sector, and development partners for many fruitful discussions and their hospitality throughout this mission.”
Pakis­tan and the IMF reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July last year, giving much-needed respite to the nation. The programme aimed to enable Pakistan to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
In May this year, the IMF board approved a fresh $1 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters. However, the disbursement of funds is contingent upon successful completion of reviews under the EFF, an IMF official said.
Tax hikes not on table for now
Sources told Dawn on Wednesday that another round of discussions may take place on the margins of the World Bank-IMF annual meetings in Washington in the coming days to resolve the last-mile issues.
Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb is scheduled to depart for the United States later this week with a delegation that includes the finance secretary, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman.
Officials said Islamabad would have to provide verified estimates of flood-related losses and ensure that provinces would absorb these costs from their own resources without compromising cash surplus commitments to the Centre. For the current fiscal year, Punjab is required to provide a cash surplus of Rs740bn, followed by Rs370bn by Sindh, Rs220bn by Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, and Rs185bn by Balochistan.
Sources said that, against this backdrop, the IMF mission did not hold a formal wrap-up meeting with the finance minister before leaving, although both sides met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, given his recent engagements with the IMF managing director to discuss flexibility in light of the flood damage.
A select team of the IMF mission had reportedly called on the minister on Monday, the sources said.
Official sources, however, claimed that the talks were “smooth” so far, and there was no immediate need for additional tax measures to bridge the shortfall, although the tax target might have to be revised depending on the first-quarter GDP data, due in the last week of December.
At that time, the question of fresh measures or changes in rates would become due with effect from Jan 1, 2026, to cover lapses in the first half of the fiscal year in view of the biannual nature of the review.</p><small>2025-10-09 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09085416bc3a195.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947558/clashes-break-out-in-lahore-after-raid-on-tlp-hq-goes-awry' target='_blank'><strong>Clashes break out in Lahore after raid on TLP HQ goes awry</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Violence broke out in the city late on Wednesday night, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of Tehreek-i- Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi.
At least three police constables were reportedly injured in clashes with enraged TLP supporters, who attacked law enforcers with stones and iron rods. Police responded with tear-gas shelling, turning Multan Road into a battleground.
Videos shared on social media, which could not be immediately verified by Dawn, showed TLP activists running as police fired tear gas. Other clips showed TLP activists holding up spent bullet casings and tear gas shells.
The crackdown on TLP’s central office came after the group annou­nced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital on Friday.
In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration has also begun placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins.
A statement issued by TLP in the early hours of Thursday claimed a number of their workers had been arrested, condemning raids on their supporters’ homes.
Police sources said that the group had called a large number of supporters to Lahore, who had taken up position in temporary shelters. These elements attacked police parties as they moved in to raid the TLP main office.
Armed with stones, clubs and iron rods, the enraged TLP men managed to push police back. Clashes were on­­going at the time of going to press.

Afghanistan, however, will take to the pitch here at the Jinnah Stadium on Thursday without having held a single training session in the host country.
In terms of rest and preparation, it is advantage Pakistan but it remains to be seen how Nolberto Solano’s men make it count against a side that only landed at the Islamabad airport on Wednesday evening as they search for their first victory in qualifying for the 2027 continental showpiece on Saudi Arabia.
Afghanistan are also winless and pointless after their opening two Group ‘E’ matches and head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese will hope his players can rebound after a long wait to set foot in Pakistan due to a visa issue that till Tuesday had raised the spectre of the match being cancelled.
Till Tuesday night, the Afghan team was waiting for clearance in Dubai after the Afghanistan Football Federation had bungled the visa application process, stating that the players and officials would appear for their biometric verification at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul.
With most Afghanistan players based abroad, the AFF was unable to ensure their presence at the Pakistan Embassy and eventually it went back and forth with Pakistan Football Federation on how its diaspora players could enter Pakistan for the game.
A breakthrough was eventually reached when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi intervened and ensured that the Afghanistan delegation will be granted visa on arrival.
 






“We are thankful to the Government of Pakistan for their support and coordination in facilitating the arrival of the Afghanistan team,” PFF president Mohsen Gilani was quoted as saying in a PFF press release.
“I would also like to acknowledge and extend my sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Pakistan Sports Board and the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) for their full cooperation.”
Over 10 members of the Afghanistan team, along with Italian head coach Annese, landed on Wednesday evening while another batch was due to arrive at midnight. Three players, who got their visas in Kabul, are making a road trip from Peshawar.
Those circumstances give Pakistan an edge with Solano having held a short training camp for his side ahead of the fixture, although the team could only call upon a handful of diaspora players due to the funding issue that has impacted the recently-elected PFF.
It is Solano’s first game in-charge of the senior team since he took over as head coach in August and the Peruvian was hopeful his side could get a good result against the Afghans.
“The players have been working really hard in training and we should hope for the best,” he told a news conference earlier on Wednesday. “We are well prepared and we expect a good match.”
Thursday’s fixture is the first of a double-header between the two sides with Afghanistan hosting Pakistan in the return game in Kuwait on Tuesday.
Syria and Myanmar, the two teams with maximum points in the group, will also meet each other twice in the next six days. Only the group winner will advance to the Asian Cup finals.

Mr Gandapur, who has been in Islamabad for the past several days, is thou­ght to have been trying to meet the PTI founder.
Sources said that soon after the party’s announcement that he would be replaced, the strongman from Dera Ismail Khan tried to secure a meeting with the party founder to make a last-ditch attempt to save his seat. However, things did not pan out that way, and he had to bow out.
 
 

“I held the KP chief ministership in trust for Imran Khan, and am returning it to him after tendering my resignation,” he posted on social media on Wednesday.
PTI insiders told Dawn that Mr Gandapur has decided to go down without a fight that may create further problems for the embattled party. “He will make a smooth transition,” an insider told Dawn.
Speculation about a possible change at CM House had been rife. Although there was no official word, sources close to Sohail Afridi — the new CM-in-waiting — had left it be known that he had been tapped for the top spot.
 
 

Mr Afridi is said to be Bushra Bibi’s pick to run the province.
Those privy to matters confided that while Imran Khan’s spouse and sister rarely see eye to eye, they had a rare convergence of opinion on Mr Gandapur, with both agreeing to the need for his ouster.
Sources in the PTI said the party chief Imran Khan had made up his mind about Ali Amin’s removal after the November 26 march on the federal capital, when Mr Gandapur mysteriously disappeared from Islamabad, leaving confused workers behind.
He subsequently met Imran Khan several times in his prison cell and bought time by assuring him that he would be the one to fulfil his (Imran’s) agenda.
They said that the decision to remove Mr Gandapur was entirely Mr Khan’s decision and he had not consulted anyone in the party on the subject.
Sources said that the resignation of Mr Gandapur would certainly bring down the number of differences and groupings within the party.
President of the KP chapter of PTI Junaid Akbar, MNA Atif Khan and MNA and former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser, who are through to be in the opposing camp, congratulated the chief minister-designate Afridi and assured him of their full support.
Talking to Dawn, MNA Atif Khan said that they would fully support the new chief minister in the larger interest of the province and its people, and would help him in the implementation of Imran Khan’s vision.
Mr Afridi was appointed provincial minister for the higher education department a week ago (on October 1). Before this appointment, he was serving as special assistant to the chief minister on the works and communication department.
If installed, Mr Afridi would be the first chief minister from the former tribal regions. He has a Master’s in Economics from the University of Peshawar. During his student life, he remained a die-hard activist of the Insaf Students Federation and later became its chairman.
He has also served as the PTI’s youth wing provincial president. He won the election from PK-70 tribal district Khyber in the previous general elections held on February 8, 2024.
