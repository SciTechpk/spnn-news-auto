Speaking to the BBC, Petro said Washington was treating other nations as part of a US “empire”.
His remarks came after US President Donald Trump said a military operation in Colombia “sounds good” in the wake of strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Maduro.
Petro said that the US risked transforming from “dominating the world” to becoming “isolated from the world”.
He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like “Nazi brigades”.

President Petro raises alarm after Trump says operation in South American country ‘sounds good’

Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US.
The BBC has approached the White House for comment.
Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to “watch his a..”, remarks the Colombian president strongly condemned.
Change in tone
Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which US president said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the “near future”.
Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a “Great Honour”.







A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric “from both sides”.
But on Thursday, Petro’s tone suggested relations had not significantly impr­oved.
He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, “most of it occupied by me”, covered “drug trafficking Colombia”, his cou­n­try’s view on Vene­zuela and “what is happening around Latin America rega­rding the United States”.
Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking.
The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the Washington says were being used for drug trafficking in the Cari­bbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people.
Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water “we are going to start now hitting land”, adding that “the cartels are running Mexico”.
Trump has often bla­med immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations.

The ministry confirmed that not only did overall revenues decline, but consolidated profits also fell, and financial losses and budget injections increased in 2024-25 compared to the previous year. The consolidated financial results of the SOEs firmed up by Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the MoF came up for review before a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on SOE (CCoSOEs) presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday.
The committee was informed that “during 2024-25, aggregate revenues of SOEs stood at approximately Rs12.4 trillion, reflecting a decline largely attributable to reduced profitability in the oil sector following lower international oil prices,” the MoF said.
Aggregate profits of pro­­fit-making SOEs decli­ned by 13pc to Rs709.9bn compared to Rs820.7bn last year, while aggregate losses of loss-making SOEs showed improvement, declining by around 2pc to Rs832.8bn. “Despite this improvement, the net result was an overall net loss of Rs122.9bn for the SOE sector, compared to a net loss of Rs30.6bn in the previous year,” showing more than three times increase, the MoF said.

Finance ministry cites power sector drag in FY25 performance

It was highlighted that losses remain heavily concentrated in a small number of entities, particularly in the transport and power distribution sectors. National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies continued to be major loss contributors, reflecting structural issues, high depreciation, financing costs, and the public service nature of certain operations that are not commercially viable.

 

The committee was briefed on the categorization of SOEs into green, amber and red categories based on financial sustainability, with a view to prioritising reforms and decision-making.
On fiscal support, the committee noted that total government support to SOEs increased to Rs2.078tr during 2024-25, driven mainly by higher equity injections to clear circular debt stock, while subsidies showed a modest decline. At the same time, inflows from SOEs to the government increased to Rs2.119tr, supported by higher dividends, tax rec­eipts and interest income on government lending.
The debt profile of SOEs was discussed in detail. Total SOE debt at the portfolio level increased to Rs9.57tr, comprising cash development loans, foreign re-lent loans, bank borrowings and accrued interest. The committee was also explained the quantification of unfunded pension liabilities across SOEs, estimated at around Rs2tr, which was identified as a major legacy risk requiring policy attention. Guara­ntees and other off-balance-sheet contingencies were reported at Rs2.16tr.
The meeting reaffirmed commitment to transparency and structural refo­rms while reviewing the Annual Consolidated Per­formance Report of Comm­ercial and Non-Commercial State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) for 2024-25. Director General CMU Majid Soofi presented the report and briefed the committee.
The report covered the financial and non-financial performance of SOEs, government support and fiscal flows, contribution of SOEs to the exchequer, debt profile, corporate governance and compliance status, business plan assessments, and the proposed way forward under the SOEs Act 2023.
The finance minister commended the CMU for strengthening transparency, consolidating SOE financial information on an International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aligned basis, and establishing a comprehensive digital database to support evidence-based decision-making.
He noted that the presentation reflected meaningful progress in oversi­ght, disclosure and risk id­­­­entification, particular­­ly in areas of fiscal flows, debt mapping and unf­u­nded pension liabilities.
The minister said the report was a credible foundation for informed policy action and sustained refo­rms, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to improving governance, enfo­rcing accountability, and placing SOEs on a path toward financial sustainability and operational efficiency.
The meeting stressed the need for enforcement of audit completion in compliance with the SOEs Act 2023, and timely transition to IFRS-based reporting by February 2026. The importance of realistic business plans, sector-specific eng­age­ment, loss reduction strategies and hard budget constraints, particularly for chronically loss-making enti­ties, was also underscored.

The prime minister was chairing a meeting to review the proposed Ramazan package and third-party validation of the last year’s package.







He said the federal government had established a transparent system to provide subsidised essential food items to the underprivileged during Ramazan, replacing a decades-old corrupt system of financial irregularities and mismanagement in Utility Stores.
During the meeting, he praised all relevant institutions and ministries on the report by a reputable audit firm regarding the transparency of last year’s Ramazan package.
He noted that deserving individuals were deprived of their rights due to corruption in Utility Stores.

Orders solarisation of loss-making electricity feeders

Financial support and social well-being for the poor and the middle class are among the top priorities of the government, the prime minister said.
He said providing subsidy amounts to the public through digital wallets will prove to be a milestone in achieving a cashless economy.
“The inclusion of the State Bank of Pakistan in the distribution of the Ramazan package will promote a cashless economy,” the prime minister said.
He stressed all relevant ministries and institutions to ensure maximising the scope and inclusion of the underprivileged in receiving subsidies.
He also directed officials concerned to present a comprehensive strategy containing practical measures for a better and more effective disbursement than the last year’s Ramazan package as soon as possible.
He also directed them to ensure that eligible low-income households were included in the assistance programme to the maximum extent possible. He also called for the creation of a digital dashboard and a monitoring system to oversee implementation.
PM Shehbaz said a Social Protection Wallet system was being introduced under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), under which SIM cards would be provided to eligible beneficiaries. He added that from March 2026 onward, assistance payments would be distributed digitally through these SIMs.
Solarisation of feeders
He directed that loss-making electricity feeders be shifted to solar power with the cooperation of local communities and provincial governments to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply in remote areas of the country.
The prime minister said the initiative would help reduce financial losses of deficit-running feeders besides providing continuous and affordable electricity to those regions.
He directed immediate launching of pilot projects on high-loss feeders of Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) and Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco).
He emphasised that consultation with elected representatives and active community participation would be ensured to guarantee the success and sustainability of the pilot projects. The meeting was informed that transitioning of loss-making feeders to solar power would create environmentally friendly, low-cost, and sustainable power generation.
The project will be implemented through a partnership involving local communities, provincial governments, and the federal government.
The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Syed Imran Ahmed Shah, Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Prime Minister’s Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar, besides the heads of National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and other senior officials.

Citing people familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously, Bloomberg reported that the talks are at an advanced stage and “a deal is very likely”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh last September, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
“The expanded alliance would make sense because Turkiye’s interests increasingly overlap with those of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in South Asia, the Middle East and even Africa,” the Bloomberg report said.
“Turkiye also sees the pact as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato,“ it added.
The report noted Riyadh’s financial clout and Islamabad’s nuclear capability, ballistic missiles, and manpower, with Turkiye offering military experience and a developed defence industry, according to Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with the Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.
“As the US prioritises its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The information ministry and Turkiye’s defence ministry declined to comment. Saudi Arabian authorities weren’t immediately available to respond to a request for comment to the American publication.
New era
According to Bloomberg, Turkiye joining the alliance would underscore a new era in relations with Saudi Arabia.
“After turning the page on years of rancour, the countries are working to develop economic and defence cooperation,” the report read. “They held their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.”
The report noted Riyadh and Ankara’s longstanding concern over Tehran and their preference for engagement with the country rather than the use of force.
With regard to Pakistan, Bloomberg noted Turkiye’s construction of corvette warships for the Pakistan Navy and its work upgrading the Pakistan Air Force’s fleet of F-16 fighter jets.
“Turkiye is already sharing drone technology with both countries, and now wants them to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet program,” the outlet added, citing an earlier report.
“The trilateral defence talks come in the wake of a cease-fire between Pakistan and India that ended a four-day military clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May,” Bloomberg added.
The report also acknowledged Pakistan‘s tensions with Afghanistan following border clashes, as well as Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts to broker talks, which were inconclusive.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage.
These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
With Turkiye, defence cooperation remains a key pillar of bilateral relations. According to the 2023 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, Turkiye is Pakistan’s second-largest arms supplier, accounting for 11pc of its total arms imports.
The defence partnership has grown significantly, with joint projects such as the Milgem warships, aircraft modernisation, and drone acquisitions deepening military collaboration.</p><small>2026-01-10 02:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10075951cb5befa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966117/pm-shehbaz-woos-uae-investment-in-it-sector' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz woos UAE investment  in IT sector</strong></a><br><p>

prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif meets a delegation of the UAE’s Sajwani Group on Friday.—PID

ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the growing interest of the UAE investors in Pakistan’s digital economy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the government is giving special importance to business-to-business (B2B) cooperation in the fields of information technology, digital innovation, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.
The prime minister, in a meeting with a delegation of the UAE’s Sajwani Group, said that the recent high-level contacts and exchanges had increased mutual trust between the private sectors and investors of Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, providing a strong foundation for advancing bilateral cooperation.







He said that the deep, fraternal and longstanding Pakistan-UAE relations were based on mutual trust, which were heading towards more effective economic cooperation and investment.
The premier vie­wed that the recent visit of the UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan to Pakistan had further strengthened the bilateral partnership, also creating a conducive environment for promoting cooperation.
He said that the UAE’s in­­vestment and global con­­nectivity, combined with Pakistan’s human resour­c­­es and workforce, repres­e­n­­ted a highly beneficial partnership for economic growth.
PC as apex forum
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the Planning Commission (PC) should act as the central clearinghouse for econo­m­­ic decisions, providing guidance to ministries and divisions to maintain policy consistency and development planning, while supporting sustainable reforms to strengthen Pakistan’s economic governance.
Chairing a meeting on economic reforms, Mr Dar highlighted the historic and central role of the PC in economic and development policy-making, said a news release.
He emphasised the need to empower PC to drive strategic policy, give priorities, and oversee public investment effectively.

The meeting will discuss the implications of Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.
“The session will address the implications of Israel’s recognition of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” read a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) on Friday.
It said the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s position on the issue of Somaliland.
On the sidelines, Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states to discuss further cooperation on regional and international issues, added the FO.
Somaliland enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.
Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar arrived in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.
Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries issued a joint statement on Thursday condemning the visit by the Israeli diplomat to Somaliland.
The joint statement, issued by the FO, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the OIC.
Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the OIC in rejecting Israel’s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.
The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.</p><small>2026-01-10 02:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10073533f8a49fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966130/groundwork-launched-with-diplomatic-outreach-for-second-minerals-forum' target='_blank'><strong>Groundwork launched with diplomatic outreach for second minerals forum</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has begun soft global marketing of the 2nd Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, 2026 (PMIF26), scheduled to be held here on April 8 and 9, according to an official announcement on Friday.
Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik held a briefing session with Pakistan’s ambassadors and high commissioners posted in key foreign capitals to advance preparations and mobilise international participation for the event.
The meeting was conducted virtually with Pakistan’s missions abroad, while senior officials from the petroleum division and representatives of key public sector entities attended in person.
The session focused on aligning diplomatic outreach with national economic priorities and positioning PMIF26 as a premier global platform for investment in Pakistan’s mineral and mining sector, the petroleum division said.

PM approves national policy framework to reform gemstones sector

During the briefing, the minister explained the aims, scale, and strategic importance of PMIF26 as a forum representing a national economic priority.
He urged ambassadors and high commissioners to actively engage leading mining companies, institutional investors, financial institutions, and relevant government counterparts in their host countries to ensure broad-based and meaningful international participation.
“PMIF26 will serve as a key platform for promoting mining awareness, stimulating economic activity, and attracting sustainable investment into Pakistan’s mineral sector,” the minister said, adding that the forum would build on the “success of PMIF 2025” held last year.
He said the previous edition of the forum was organised in line with international standards and delivered tangible outcomes.
“The forum attracted participants from over 50 countries and more than 5,000 delegates, while the signing of 14 memorandums of understanding with globally recognised companies validated growing international confidence in Pakistan’s mineral sector,” he added.
PMIF 2026 is being planned as a strategic. technical conference — alongside an international gemstone exhibition — and a comprehensive resource library aimed at supporting informed as well as data-driven investment decisions.
APP adds: Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday gave in-principle approval to a national policy framework to reform the gemstones sector, align it with international standards, and create a conducive environment for foreign investment, state-run APP reported.
Chairing a high-level meeting on the country’s gemstone reserves, sectoral reforms, export enhancement, and adoption of modern technology, the prime minister directed strict adherence to timelines outlined in the policy framework this year.
He also instructed immediate steps to establish international-standard laboratories and certification systems.
PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of two model centres of excellence for gemstones during the year and the engagement of internationally recognised experts to remove obstacles in policy implementation.
He noted that Pakistan’s gemstone exports remained negligible despite the country having immense reserves, and called for encouraging private companies, particularly young entrepreneurs, to invest in the sector.
Citing vast reserves of gemstones in Pakistan, he directed geological surveys to determine their location and value, ensuring full consultation with relevant institutions, provincial governments, and stakeholders.
The meeting was told that Pakistan’s gemstone reserves were valued at around $450 billion, while annual exports stood at just $5.8 million.
More than 5,000 companies are processing more than 30 types of precious stones in the country. Leading reserves in the country include those of emerald, peridot, ruby, topaz, and aquamarine.
The industries and production ministry has chalked out a comprehensive action plan identifying challenges and priority measures to achieve a $1bn export target over five years through reforms.
This year, the ministry will integrate the gemstone value chain into the national economy, promote local processing for value addition, adopt modern technology, launch private-sector training programmes, and introduce ‘Brand Pakistan’.

The trade talks fell apart last year and Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods in August to 50 per cent, the world’s highest rate, including a levy of 25pc in retaliation for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
“It’s all set up and you have got to have Modi call the president. And they were uncomfortable doing it,” Lutnick said in an interview on the All-In podcast, a US show by four venture capitalists that focuses on business and technology. “So Modi didn’t call.”







The comments came after Trump stepped up the pressure for talks with a warning this week that tariffs could rise further unless India curbs its Russian oil imports.
That step pushed the Indian rupee to a record low and spooked investors waiting for progress in two-way negotiations for a trade deal that remains elusive.
India still seeks a tariff rate between Washington’s offers to Britain and Vietnam that had formerly been agreed but the offer has expired, Lutnick added.
India’s trade ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment on Lutnick’s remarks.
New Delhi and Washington were very close to a trade deal last year but a communication breakdown led to the collapse of any potential pact, Reuters reported.
It cited an Indian government official involved in the talks as saying that Modi could not have called Trump, for fear that a one-sided conversation would put him on the spot.
‘Not accurate’
However, India said on Friday that Lutnick’s remarks were “not accurate” and did not reflect the discussions between Delhi and Washington, reported the BBC.
“India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement as far back as 13 February last year. Since then, both sides have held multiple rounds of negotiations to arrive at a balanced and mutually beneficial trade agreement. On several occasions, we have been close to a deal,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.
The spokesperson added that the Indian prime minister had spoken with the US president eight times on the phone in 2025, “covering different aspects of our wide-ranging partnership”.</p><small>2026-01-09 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09231344de0473d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966013/kp-cm-engaging-in-illegal-activity-and-travel-says-rana-sanaullah-over-afridis-karachi-visit' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM engaging in ‘illegal activity and travel,’ says Rana Sanaullah over Afridi’s Karachi visit</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi is engaging in “illegal activity and travel” by trying to mobilise the party’s support base for a nationwide street movement.
The KP chief executive is currently in Karachi as part of the PTI’s plans to launch a street movement, as per the directions of party founder Imran Khan.
Speaking on the Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the PM’s aide said that the PTI was in no position to launch a street movement and described their upcoming nationwide wheel-jam strike on February 8 as “violence”.
“They cannot mobilise because it isn’t in accordance with the law. The KP CM is involved in illegal activity and his travel is illegal,” Sanaullah said.
When asked what part of CM Afridi’s visit was illegal, Sanaullah replied: “How is a wheel-jam strike a political activity permitted by the law and Constitution? Holding a wheel-jam strike in and of itself is illegal.”
Sanaullah added that the Sindh government “would not permit a wheel-jam strike” and that the PTI “is not in a position to block even one road.”
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information, Shafiullah Jan — also a guest on the programme — responded to Sanaullah, clarifying that the February 8 wheel-jam strike was called by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chairman of the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance.
“Rana Sanaullah is confused; he issued a statement saying that if the call [to strike] isn’t revoked, May 9 cases will be opened,” he claimed, referring to the prosecution of PTI members over riots that occurred on May 9, 2023. “This shows that May 9 was a false flag operation against the PTI.“
“As far as February 8 is concerned, the PTI will support and accept Achakzai’s call for a wheel-jam,” Jan added.
Sanaullah stated that the PTI’s street movement would not be successful and that “only a handful of people from KP” might join in.
“When these people are prosecuted, they will create a ruckus,” the PM’s aide said.
“These people are still claiming that May 9 was a false flag operation and that their members weren’t involved. They are willing to spread lies and create misunderstandings. Tell me, can you believe what they say?”
Sanaullah also questioned what movement the PTI would lead.
“With this wheel-jam strike, they say that KP will lead it. What are they leading?” he asked.
“At most 4,500 people turned up at their Peshawar rally, even though they had been preparing for a month.”
“In KP, they will try, but they will fail, and whoever takes part will continue to cry about false flags and fake cases when they get prosecuted,” the PM’s aide added.
The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.</p><small>2026-01-09 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09192840058e553.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965987/democratic-traditions-still-alive-in-sindh-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-rallies-pti-support-base-in-karachi-for-street-movement' target='_blank'><strong>‘Democratic traditions still alive in Sindh’: KP CM Sohail Afridi rallies PTI support base in Karachi for street movement</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Friday evening continued his efforts to rally PTI’s support base in Karachi to support the party’s upcoming nationwide street movement.
After his visit to the Karachi Press Club (KPC), the provincial chief executive was scheduled to visit Insaf House and hold public meetings in the city’s district South and Malir.
Earlier in the evening, Afridi reached the KPC and met with the city’s journalist fraternity while appreciating the welcome extended to him by the Sindh government.
From the airport, the KP CM’s convoy took six hours to reach the press club, accompanied by a large crowd of party supporters.
During his interaction with the media, Afridi compared his arrival in the metropolis with his recent visit to Lahore and said, “Karachi has been more welcoming than Lahore”.
“The democratic traditions of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto are still alive in Sindh,” said the KP CM during his interaction with journalists at the press club.







The KP chief minister said that the purpose of his visit to Sindh’s provincial capital was to prepare for the PTI’s street movement.
“The Punjab tour was not a good experience. Wherever we went to eat food, the lights of that area were turned off,” he told reporters.
Afridi said that they had received verbal approval from the Sindh government for Sunday’s rally, though they had not received a response in writing.
“Imran Khan did not struggle for power, but for the independence of the judiciary, true democracy and freedom of expression. This is why he has been imprisoned,” the KP CM said in his address at the press club.
“In prison, he has been treated in an inhumane manner and kept in the same place where terrorists are held,” he added.
Fielding questions, CM Afridi said that he saw traces of former premiers Benazir Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Sindh’s governance, and expressed satisfaction.
CM Afridi, in another response, noted that a peace jirga was held in the provincial assembly, where all political parties agreed on fifteen points.
“One of these points was that military operations are not a problem, but if one is carried out, it would be thuggery,” he added.
Elaborating on the topic, Afridi said that “decisions cannot be made behind closed doors” and added that if the tribal elders and local leadership are not involved as stakeholders, “there will never be peace”.
“What guarantee is there that peace will return after a military operation?” he questioned.
“If the prime minister calls only on a single-point agenda regarding terrorism, I will certainly attend.”
“The solution to terrorism is that all political parties, as well as the provincial and federal governments, make a joint decision and implement it. Only then is peace possible,” Afridi said.
Arrival in Karachi
Afridi reached Karachi earlier today, beginning his three-day visit to Sindh as part of PTI’s street mobilisation movement.
Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani welcomed him at the airport. A video released from the minister’s office showed Ghani receiving Afridi and the two hugging at the airport. Ghani was also seen presenting Afridi a Sindhi cap and Ajrak.
The party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja also accompanied the KP CM.
Videos shared by the PTI on X showed a large crowd gathered at the airport to welcome Afridi.







An update shared on PTI‘s X account at around 5:15pm said Afridi’s convoy, surrounded by a large crowd, had reached Karachi’s main artery Sharea Faisal.

Afridi also shared a video of himself at Sharea Faisal, with PTI supporters and workers shouting slogans of “Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi”.







The convoy eventually reached the Karachi Press Club late in the evening after making a pit stop at Mazar-i-Quaid.
Afridi boarded the flight for Karachi from the Islamabad airport, where he faced flight delays.
KP Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, who is accompanying the chief minister, said in a post on X prior to their departure that their flight had been delayed.

PTI alleges dismantling of tents
Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had removed the tents put up outside the party‘s head office near the nursery area for the KP CM’s reception.
He, however, clarified that the office had not been sealed by police.
Previously, the PTI had alleged in a post on social media platform X that Sindh police had sealed the Insaf Secretariat in Karachi and dismantled a camp installed there for Afridi’s welcome.







Bozdar said CM Afridi was expected to address party workers and leaders at the head office, where he would be taken from the airport.
He also said he had spoken to police and Sindh government officials, who have assured that the tents would be returned. He added that the officials also assured that the party would be allowed to hold a gathering but was asked not to block roads.
Dawn reached out to police for a comment but there was no response from their side.
Afridi to hold gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday
Before departing for Karachi, the KP chief minister said in a post on X that he was bringing party founder Imran Khan’s “message” to the province.
“My visit is for three days and during this time we have planned various activities,” the chief minister said, urging people to support the street movement.







KP CM announced that he would be holding a gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday at 4:30pm, calling on people to participate in the gathering.
“We will hold the biggest gathering in Karachi’s history,” CM Afridi said.
Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement issued by his office that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We will fully welcome KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the province,” he said, adding that the peaceful struggle of any political party, including the PTI, could not be stopped.
But, he also warned that “difficulties could arise in the law is violated”.
“There is no restriction on the rally. They have sought permission for holding rallies in South and Korangi districts. They have sought permission for a rally at Jinnah Ground and they are being given permission for that,” he said. “We are in talks with the PTI leadership and they can definitely be given permission for holding the rally in accordance with the law.”
However, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office earlier on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad.
What’s on CM’s agenda?
The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.
The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.
On Monday, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, shared the CM Afridi’s schedule for the visit.
He detailed that CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on January 9 and arrive in Karachi, where he will be received by party workers and supporters.
His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a meeting with the Press at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir.
The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation.
He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice following his arrival in Karachi.
Hyderabad visit
The CM will travel to Hyderabad on Jan 1o. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah.
The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad.
The agenda also includes an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), but the lawyers’ body has said it never accorded permission for the CM to visit or address the bar.
Earlier, the bar association general secretary invited the CM to the Hyderabad High Court in a letter dated January 7.
In the letter, seen by Dawn, General Secretary Israr Hussain Chang said he warmly welcomed the CM to Sindh and “commend your principled stance on the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the rule of law, human rights, and justice for missing persons”.
“We hope you will also support our ongoing legal and constitutional struggle to protect Sindh’s lands, resist unjust corporate farming allotments, and safeguard Karoonjhar Kirthar, and the water rights and Indus delta, all vital to our ecological and cultural identity.
“During your visit to Hyderabad, if you spare some moments to visit the High Court, Hyderabad, I would be honoured to receive you on behalf of the legal fraternity and people of Sindh,” the letter read.
But, the bar association clarified in a press release on January 8 that it “never accorded permission nor allowed the worthy KP chief minister to address or visit HCBA, Hyderabad”. It added that the bar association’s entire executive/ managing committee, by a clear majority, had rejected during a meeting an application submitted in this connection.
The general secretary issued his letter in his personal capacity and “used the letterhead of the HCBA without consent of the managing committee for the aforesaid programme”, the press release said.
Meanwhile, the spokesperson for PTI Hyderabad chairperson alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had conducted raids at residences of the “elected chairpersons of different union committees and activists of PTI on Thursday in different parts of the city”.
However, no arrests could be made, he said.
Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio also told Dawn that no PTI activists had been arrested during the raids in Hyderabad.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.

The clarification comes after a reportedly fake notification circulated on social media claiming that winter vacations in Punjab had been extended from January 10 to 17.







However, the education minister rebuffed claims of extending winter holidays, urging the public to “avoid fake news.”
Earlier this week, he had also denied any extension of the winter holidays.







Later in the evening, the education minister posted a poll on his X account, asking people about when schools and colleges in Punjab should reopen. The two options were January 12 and 19.
Around 11:30pm on January 9, 82.5 per cent of users were in favour of January 19, while 17.5pc for January 12.







Commenters seemed in favour of reopening institutions on the later date, due to the increasing cold in the province, while others noted that January 19 would be peak cold in Punjab. Another user questioned why the minister was using an X poll to begin with.
The Punjab government had announced winter vacations for all public and private schools and colleges from December 22 to January 10.
According to the official notification, schools and colleges were scheduled to reopen on January 12.
A day ago, a fake notification claiming to have been issued by Punjab’s School Education Department went viral on social media, spreading confusion among parents and students.
The notification claimed that “due to severe weather conditions,” the vacations had been extended until January 17, and that schools would reopen on January 19.</p><small>2026-01-09 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091805186de0cdf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965993/iran-cuts-internet-amid-expanding-protests-over-economy-supreme-leader-tells-trump-to-focus-on-problems-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Iran cuts internet amid expanding protests over economy; supreme leader tells Trump to focus on problems in US</strong></a><br><p>Iran was largely cut off from the outside world on Friday after authorities blacked out the internet to curb expanding protests, with phone calls not reaching the country, flights cancelled and online Iranian news sites only intermittently updating.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of US President Donald Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as “mercenaries for foreigners”. He also told Trump to focus on the problems in his own country.
The protests, which began on December 28 over an inflationary spiral, have not approached the scale of unrest three years ago but have spread across Iran with dozens reported dead and the authorities looking more vulnerable because of a dire economy and the aftermath of last year’s war with Israel and the United States.







The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest.
Images of fires raging in Iranian cities
Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baluch minority predominates, was met by gunfire that wounded several people.
Iran’s fragmented external opposition factions called for more protests on Friday with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a social media post: “The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets.”







Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and who last week warned Tehran it could come to the protesters’ aid, said on Friday he would not meet Pahlavi and was “not sure that it would be appropriate” to support him.
Images published by state television overnight showed what it said were burning buses, cars and motorbikes as well as fires at metro stations and banks. It accused the People’s Mujahedin Organisation, an opposition faction that splintered off after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and is also known as the MKO, of orchestrating the unrest.
A state TV journalist standing in front of the fires on Shariati Street in the Caspian Sea port of Rasht said: “This looks like a war zone — all the shops have been destroyed.”
Videos verified by Reuters as having been taken in the capital Tehran showed hundreds of people marching. In one of the videos, a woman could be heard shouting, “Death to Khamenei!”







Iran has quelled far bigger bouts of unrest before, but it now faces a graver economic situation and intensifying international pressure with global sanctions over its disputed nuclear programme reimposed since September.
Supreme leader warns protesters
The authorities have tried a dual approach — describing protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces.
Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told lawmakers that the voices of protesters must be heard but that any cases linked to “foreign spy networks” must be handled differently.
The Supreme Leader, the ultimate authority in Iran above the elected president and parliament, used tougher language in his speech on Friday.
“The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honourable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,” he said, accusing those involved in unrest of seeking to please Trump.
Khamenei also told Trump to focus on the problems in his own country.
The US president had stated earlier that the US was watching the situation in Iran “very closely”.
“If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump had said.
Khamenei said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians” and predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.
While the initial protests were focused on the economy, with the rial currency losing half its value against the dollar last year and inflation topping 40 per cent in December, they have morphed to include slogans directly against the authorities.
Protesters have chanted slogans including “death to the dictator” and praising the former monarchy that was overthrown in 1979. The extent of support inside Iran for the monarchy or for the MKO, the most vocal groups among emigre Iranians, is disputed.
Most of the demonstrators seen in videos viewed by Reuters, many of which it has been unable to verify, have been young men.
Iran blocked off the internet overnight. Reuters reporters trying to place phone calls to Iran from abroad were unable to do so on Friday.
Flights cancelled
At least six flights between Dubai and Iranian cities scheduled for Friday were cancelled, the Dubai Airport website showed.
Turkish Airlines on Friday also cancelled its seven flights from Istanbul to Iran — five of them to the capital Tehran, a spokesperson told AFP.
The other flights were bound for Tabriz and for Mashhad, the spokesperson said.
Turkish Airlines had already cancelled two flights to Tehran on Thursday and one to Tabriz, the spokesperson said.
According to the Istanbul airport app, five other flights operated by Iranian airlines have also been cancelled, while seven others were still scheduled at midday.
According to the specialist website Flight Radar, a Turkish Airlines plane flying to Shiraz and a Pegasus flight to Mashhad turned back from Iranian space on Thursday night.
Turkey shares a border of around 500 kilometres with Iran, and there are three active land crossings between the two countries.</p><small>2026-01-09 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/092119416f7f744.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966012/israel-army-says-struck-hezbollah-targets-in-several-areas-of-lebanon' target='_blank'><strong>Israel army says struck Hezbollah targets in ‘several areas’ of Lebanon</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah targets in several areas of Lebanon on Friday, a day after the Lebanese army said it had completed the first phase of its plan to disarm the group.
Under US pressure and amid fears of expanded Israeli strikes, Lebanon has committed to disarming the resistance group, which was weakened by more than a year of hostilities with Israel, including two months of all-out war that ended with a November 2024 ceasefire.
Despite the truce, Israel has kept up regular strikes in Lebanon, usually claiming it is targeting Hezbollah sites and operatives, and has maintained troops in five south Lebanon areas it deems strategic, accusing the group of rearming.
In a statement on Friday, the Israeli military said it struck “several areas in Lebanon”, targeting “weapons storage facilities and a weapons production site that were used for the rehabilitation and military build-up of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation”.
“Additionally, several launch sites and rocket launchers, along with military structures, were struck,” it claimed.
Lebanese official news agency NNA reported strikes on southern Lebanon in areas far from the border, as well as in the eastern Bekaa area, where Hezbollah has a strong presence.
No casualties were immediately reported.
“The targets that were struck, and Hezbollah’s reestablishment activity in these sites, constitute a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, and pose a threat to the State of Israel,” the military statement said.
‘Encouraging announcements’
Lebanon’s army said Thursday it had “achieved the objectives of the first phase” of its plan to disarm Hezbollah, covering the area south of the Litani River — around 30 kilometres from the Israeli border — with the intention to extend it to the rest of the country.
Israel said the efforts were encouraging but not enough.
“The ceasefire agreement … states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,” the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.
“Efforts made toward this end by the Lebanese government and the Lebanese armed forces are an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient,” it added.
Lebanese official media said a strike on Thursday killed one person near the southern city of Sidon, as Israel’s army claimed it targeted a Hezbollah operative.
Under the ceasefire, Hezbollah was to withdraw its forces north of the Litani River and have its military infrastructure dismantled in the evacuated areas.
The group has refused to surrender its weapons.
On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the “encouraging announcements by the Lebanese authorities”, calling for the disarmament process to be pursued “resolutely”.
“The second phase of the plan will be a decisive step,” he wrote on X, adding that “the ceasefire agreement must be strictly respected by all parties.“
“Lebanon’s sovereignty must be fully restored,” he added, saying an international conference would soon be held in Paris “to provide them with the concrete means to guarantee this sovereignty”.</p><small>2026-01-09 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/092051089242f28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966010/prioritising-patient-care-punjab-cm-orders-hospital-staffers-to-wear-body-cameras' target='_blank'><strong>Prioritising patient care, Punjab CM orders hospital staffers to wear body cameras</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Acting on public complaints about hospitals, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Friday made it mandatory for hospital staff to wear body cameras.
Body cameras, or body cams, are wearable audio and video recording devices used to capture footage of official action for evidence. Last month, following corruption complaints against the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera), CM Maryam made it mandatory for field officials to wear body cams in a bid to ensure transparency and accountability. However, this order has yet to be implemented.
Presiding over a meeting on provincial health projects today, the CM said that wearing body cams would be mandatory for nurses, ward boys, security guards, and pharmacy staff.
The CM further said that public hospital administration must ensure the comprehensive daily steam cleaning of facilities by 9am.
“There must be a ban on the use of mobile phones by doctors and nurses during duty hours, stressing that patient care must remain the foremost priority,” she also ordered.
To strengthen hospital management, the meeting approved the creation of a Medical Superintendent (MS) pool, with salary increments linked directly to performance. Community health inspectors were also assigned the responsibility of conducting hospital surveys to monitor service delivery.
The provincial chief executive further directed the establishment of a data analysis centre to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of public welfare initiatives in the health sector.
CM Maryam also directed the preparation of a revised medicines list for government hospitals and called for a foolproof mechanism to ensure an uninterrupted supply of essential drugs.
Additionally, the chief minister ordered the formation of a dedicated committee to finalise the updated medicines list.
She expressed concern over reports of medicine shortages despite substantial budget allocations, noting that Rs80 billion was being spent on medicines and any lapse in delivery to patients was unacceptable.
The meeting also reviewed proposals to modernise public hospitals, including the potential use of Chinese-manufactured medical equipment to upgrade healthcare facilities across the province.
It was informed that over 2,500 doctors had been recruited over the past two years and that 585,000 patients across the province had been registered for the home delivery of cardiac medicines, with doorstep delivery completed for 6,000 patients suffering from hepatitis and tuberculosis.
CM Maryam emphasised that the government would no longer tolerate wastage of public funds or citizens’ time, warning that inefficiency and negligence in public hospitals would not be accepted.
Last month, Nishtar Hospital sacked a doctor working as an additional house officer for misbehaving with a patient’s family, a video of which had gone viral on social media.
An inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.</p><small>2026-01-09 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/092118345afbe39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966011/interior-minister-orders-strict-screening-of-travel-documents-at-airports' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister orders strict screening of travel documents at airports</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: While chairing a meeting to review the performance of the Immigration Wing of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Friday issued orders for strict screening of travel documents at airports.
The ongoing campaign to prevent illegal immigration and human smuggling, as well as actions against the professional beggar mafia, came under detailed discussion during the meeting.
The interior minister’s order came amid complaints of arbitrary offloading at airports despite travelers carrying valid documents.
In the first week of December, Naqvi had said that 50–70 passengers were being offloaded daily from flights to protect the country’s passport reputation, which, at an average of 60 per day, comes to fewer than 22,000 in a year. However, official figures showed that the actual number of offloaded passengers in 2025 was three times higher, at 66,000.
During the meeting today, the interior minister ordered the continuation of relentless and strict action against the mafia involved in illegal immigration.
“Elements involved in human smuggling do not deserve any leniency,” he said, making it clear that no one would be allowed to tarnish Pakistan’s image.
He directed the FIA to effectively implement immigration laws and make the immigration checking system at airports more efficient.
Naqvi also directed an effective crackdown against the professional beggar mafia and their backers.
The meeting was attended by federal secretary interior, additional secretary interior, director general FIA, directors Karachi and Lahore Zones.
Amid fears that genuine travellers would be given a tough time at airports in the name of “strict screening,” an official said there were clear directions from the interior minister that no passenger with complete and valid travel documents should be stopped.
He added that strict screening, coupled with a crackdown against fraudulent visa agents exploiting citizens, was meant to curb attempts to use fake or unverified documents, since such practices damage Pakistan’s image abroad.
Following months of growing public fury and social media outrage, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif finally took notice of questionable offloading in mid-December and formed a “special committee” to look into the issue and ensure safe migration.
Disclosing this, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain said, “By the end of January, we will prepare proposals to address these issues,” stressing that safe migration is a “fundamental right.”</p><small>2026-01-09 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09124119ffed2b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965988/ptis-ali-zafar-says-talks-with-govt-cannot-happen-till-meetings-with-imran-remain-suspended' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Ali Zafar says talks with govt cannot happen till meetings with Imran remain suspended</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar on Friday said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan.
He made the remarks while speaking alongside a delegation of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in Lahore, which is on a three-day visit to the city as part of the opposition’s “street movement” to hold political and social gatherings.
The alliance posted on X that TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas arrived on Friday at a gathering held at the residence of Advocate Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas, where a large number of journalists, political leaders and PTI workers were present.
Speaking during the gathering, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar welcomed the TTAP delegation to Lahore.
He urged the TTAP to use its platform to push for a meeting with Imran, who has not been allowed visitors in recent weeks.
“No talks or dialogue can start until meetings are allowed with Imran,” he said. Zafar assured the TTAP of “full cooperation and support from [PTI’s] leaders and workers in Lahore”.







He stressed that the top priority at the moment was the protection of Pakistan‘s sovereignty. In this regard, he said that Imran’s release was “the need of the time”.
“The government cannot take any such step that will harm Pakistan‘s future or is against Pakistan’s sovereignty,” he said.
Zafar expressed gratitude to the TTAP leadership for their visit, stating, “The difficulties you faced in reaching here, I would like to say that we face it every day here.“
On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, had urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government.
The PTI had also accused the Punjab police of a crackdown on its supporters ahead of Achakzai’s visit, saying its workers were rounded up by the police in late-night raids while the caravan was also attacked by “masked individuals” on its way to the provincial capital.
Speaking to reporters, Achakzai said a powerful protest would exert pressure on the government to hold talks with the opposition and release its leader, Imran.</p><small>2026-01-09 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0920095629e44c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966009/police-official-allegedly-kills-wife-for-honour-in-karachis-shadman-town' target='_blank'><strong>Police official allegedly kills wife for ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Shadman Town</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A woman was allegedly shot dead by her husband, a serving police official, over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Shadman Town on Friday, according to police.
A police spokesperson said in a statement that the 40-year-old woman was shot and injured by her husband in their home. During the initial probe, it transpired that the incident occurred over a “domestic dispute”.
“After receiving information [about the incident], the police rushed to the spot and shifted the injured woman to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where she expired,” Senior Superintendent of Police (Central) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the body bore “two gunshot injuries to [the] torso, through and through”.
The SSP, meanwhile, added that the suspect — who fled the scene — is a serving police inspector posted with the Special Investigation Unit (SIU).
SSP Siddiqi said it was the victim’s second marriage.
“The suspect had doubts that his wife was still in ‘contact’ with her former husband,” he said. “CCTV footage has been obtained and concerted efforts are underway to arrest the alleged killer.”
A day prior, a young couple was gunned down over ‘honour’ in the Sohrab Goth area, police and rescue services officials said.
They stated that a 30-year-old man and his 28-year-old wife were found dead inside a home in Lasi Goth with gunshot wounds.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2026-01-09 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09172352108a1e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965996/info-minister-slams-pti-over-ttp-says-party-extended-olive-branch-to-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister slams PTI over TTP, says party extended ‘olive branch’ to terrorists</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Friday slammed the PTI for its stance towards the banned TTP and claimed the party has extended an “olive branch” towards the group.
“The spokespersons of the political party are afraid of talking about the terrorist group, as they have taken exemption from it by extending an ‘olive branch’ to them,” said Tarar while addressing a press conference alongside former ANP senator Zahid Khan.
The information minister also accused the PTI of initiating “confidence-building measures with the TTP” and added that they were afraid of being attacked by the TTP, so they didn’t call them terrorists.
Tarar made this statement after playing a clip from a Hum News program in which the host openly called the TTP a terrorist group. However, Shafiullah Jan, an adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, insisted that there are “groups within the TTP,” adding that those who are “against the state are terrorists.”
“They are afraid of saying anything regarding the TTP,” said Tarar, citing the example of former MPA Samar Haroon Bilour, who spoke courageously against terrorists in the Assembly despite losing her husband and father-in-law to terrorism.
He also accused the PTI of “bringing back terrorists” and settling them in KP after terrorism had been eliminated from the province.
“Their leader [incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan] used to call terrorists martyrs,” he said, adding that the PTI’s social media accounts criticised the army chief and the Pakistan Army, but did not utter a single word for the martyrs of the armed forces, as they are afraid of terrorists.
He claimed that a political-terror-crime nexus prevails in KP. “Political elements have a nexus with terrorists, and crime links them through the smuggling of oil, drugs, consumer goods, timber, and tobacco,” he said, adding that it forms a “bridge with political leaders at one end and terrorists at the other”.
“PTI does not condemn terrorists because they earn money for political leaders and assist them in running their businesses,” said the information minister.
“When it comes to maligning women and spreading hatred against them, they speak fluently and target them. However, they don’t speak against terrorists because they have weapons,” he said, accusing the PTI of misogyny.
He challenged the PTI to share the names of ten terrorist groups that were “good, pro-Pakistani, and whose services are for the country.”
‘Governance in KP’
Tarar said the federal and provincial governments of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan are making efforts by constructing schools, colleges, universities, and hospitals. The governments have run electric buses, constructed modern bus stops, and built modern IT institutions.
“The governance in KP has collapsed,” he said, adding that when the ruling PTI in the province was asked about health and education facilities, they were unaware.
He said that land had been allocated for Benazir Hospital in KP 13 years ago, but it could not be constructed.
Talking about hospitals, he said public officials and ministers don’t go to KP public hospitals for treatment, as the hospitals are filled with garbage.
“The majority of patients from KP go to the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, as they have no options in the province,” he said, adding that the PTI had not provided them with any facilities in 12 years.
He said South Waziristan faces a scarcity of doctors, with only one male doctor available in the entire district. “The district does not have a single female doctor,” he added.
“The PTI couldn’t provide a system of drinking water in Tank district, as animals and residents drink water from the same pond,” he said.
Talking about education in the province, he said, “At least 4.9 million children and teenagers aged five to 17 years are out of school, with 22,000 schools lacking basic facilities.”
He added that four districts in the province do not have a college for girls.
“More than a dozen universities in KP don’t have any staff, and the staff in the remaining universities are not being paid,” he said.
Tarar further said that scandals involving billions of rupees had emerged in Kohistan, with PTI office bearers implicated, yet they could not establish a girls’ college.</p><small>2026-01-09 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091845059cc3be0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966005/noor-zaman-gives-former-world-champion-a-run-for-his-money-before-exiting-karachi-open' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Zaman gives former world champion a run for his money before exiting Karachi Open</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s squash sensation Noor Zaman gave former world champion Mohamed Elshorbagy a run for his money as he took the Englishman to five intense games at the Karachi Open quarterfinals before being defeated and ending Pakistan’s streak at the international tournament.
Noor had a shaky start in the first game against the former world number one, who wowed the crowd with exceptional shots that the 21-year-old Pakistani couldn’t keep up with, winning 11-2.
But Noor had the advantage of a home crowd that was cheering him on for every handful of points he won, finding his footing in the second game that Elshorbagy took 11-8.
It was in the third game that Noor finally found his momentum and defeated Elshorbagy 11-6 to stay in the running for a spot in the semifinals. He exited the court to “shabash Noor!” from the crowd of sports enthusiasts and former athletes in Creek Club’s glass court.
Noor had begun loosening Elshorbagy’s grip on what otherwise seemed like a sure-shot, three-game victory for the current world number four and tournament fourth seed.
The two were neck-and-neck in the fourth game before Noor pulled ahead with some tactical shots just above the tin that stunned Elshorbagy. Karachi had turned up, albeit in a small crowd, to see world-class action, and the senior and junior world champions delivered on that expectation.
Fists pumping, sweat drenching, his green T-shirt covered with his sponsors, Noor was in his element. His previous two games in the tournament went to five games as well, so Noor was no stranger to intense matches and spectacular comebacks.
The fifth game was anyone’s to win. Elshorbagy matched every point Noor took; Noor closed any lead Elshorbagy took. Noor pulled to 6-5 as the ball caught between Elshorbagy’s racket and the wall, but the Englishman got his revenge as he won a superb rally that saw the two players staring each other down and exchanging pleasantries.
The two kept surging neck-and-neck towards the finale before Elshorbagy shifted gears one last time and finished the game and match 11-9 as Noor slid to the floor but couldn’t catch the ball quickly enough.
The two hugged, and Elshorbagy seemed to be offering words of advice to Noor as the crowd gave the two a standing ovation all the way till Noor exited the court, and Elshorbagy stayed on for the commentator’s questions.
“I had heard of [Noor] and was told to watch out for him. I’ve never played against him, but he got in front of me in the second game, and I had to watch out,” Elshorbagy said.
“I’ve been playing for a long time, I’ve come through the juniors, played a lot of talented Pakistani players, but I’ve never seen someone as focused as Noor; he’s always watching and learning how to get better,” he said as the crowd nodded in agreement and Noor watched on quietly from outside the court.
”It’s great for Pakistan to have someone coming up, you guys need another world champion coming up soon since you’re a squash nation, and it’s very exciting for Pakistan to have Noor.”</p><small>2026-01-09 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/091616392970dd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966000/grok-to-offer-image-generation-only-to-paid-subscribers-after-backlash' target='_blank'><strong>Grok to offer image generation only to paid subscribers after backlash</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok on Friday turned off its image creation feature for non-paying users of X following backlash over its use in creating sexualised deepfakes of women and children.
Owned by Elon Musk and developed by xAI, Grok’s image-generation and editing tools have faced backlash on the social media platform X after netizens raised concerns about the chatbot generating nude images of women and children.
Musk has also been threatened with fines, and several countries have recently pushed back publicly against the tool over its creation of sexually explicit imagery.
Replying to users on Musk’s social media platform X, Grok posted: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features.”
The change means many users of the tool can no longer generate or edit images using the AI. Paying customers must provide the platform with their credit card information and personal details.
The European Commission this week said the photos of undressed women and children were unlawful and on Thursday ordered X to retain all internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said X has “got to get a grip of this” and stated that he has asked communications regulator Ofcom “for all options to be on the table,” according to media reports. He called the images “unlawful” and said Britain was “not going to tolerate it.” France, Malaysia and India have also criticised Musk’s platform over the issue.
“Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk wrote on X last week in response to a post about the explicit images.







X’s official “Safety” account subsequently said it addresses illegal content on X “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.“
Users now have to subscribe to access image-generating features on X, which were initially rolled out for free with daily limits.
However, users can avail Grok’s image-generating and editing features for free on its separate app.
In December 2025, a controversy erupted on X after users were found exploiting Grok’s tools to edit and manipulate photographs, including digitally undressing people, including children or portraying them in minimal clothing such as bikinis.
Reuters, BBC, and other news outlets also documented numerous cases where Grok had generated sexualised images of women and minors.</p><small>2026-01-09 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09164457fa0c59c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966001/russia-fires-hypersonic-oreshnik-missile-near-ukraines-eu-border' target='_blank'><strong>Russia fires hypersonic Oreshnik missile near Ukraine’s EU border</strong></a><br><p>Russia fired a powerful hypersonic missile at Ukraine near the EU border overnight, in what Kyiv called a new threat to European security that demanded a global response.
Moscow said it had fired the Oreshnik missile in response to what it has described as an attempted drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin’s residences last month, which Ukraine has denied and the United States has said did not happen.
It was only the second time Russia has fired the Oreshnik at Ukraine, and came amid a night of air attacks that Ukrainian authorities said also killed four people in Kyiv, knocked out power in the capital and damaged the Qatari embassy there.
The Oreshnik, designed to project power across Europe and which Moscow says is impossible to intercept, is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, although there was no suggestion it had done so.

“Such a strike close to [the] EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha said on X.
“It is absurd that Russia attempts to justify this strike with the fake ‘Putin residence attack’ that never happened,” he added. “Putin uses an IRBM near the EU and Nato border in response to his own hallucinations. This is truly a global threat. And it demands global responses.”







Kyiv has called Russia’s allegation that it attacked Putin’s residence in the Novgorod region of northern Russia on December 29 “an absurd lie” to sabotage peace talks.
US President Donald Trump has said he does not believe it happened, although something else happened in the area.
The Oreshnik hit the Lviv region in western Ukraine, around 60 kilometres from the border with Poland. Moscow said it hit a drone factory and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said it hit unspecified infrastructure; local media reported that it struck a large underground gas storage site.
Germany condemned the missile strike, accusing Moscow of seeking to “instil fear”.
“Russia has escalated the situation once again,” government spokesman Steffen Meyer said. “These are symbolic gestures of intimidation intended to instil fear, but they are not effective. “
Casualties, power supplies disrupted in attack on Kyiv
Russia fired a total of 242 drones and 36 missiles, including Oreshnik, to hit infrastructure in the western Lviv region and in and around the capital Kyiv, Ukraine said.
Authorities said at least four people were killed and more than 20 injured by the strikes on Kyiv, which knocked out electricity to more than half a million homes in the capital. Water and heat were cut off, with temperatures around -10º Celsius and heavy snow.

The Oreshnik was fired just before midnight, according to Lviv regional officials. The Ukrainian military said the missile was moving at a speed of 13,000 kilometres per hour.
“The strike’s targets were hit,” Russia’s Defence Ministry said in a statement, describing the targets as a factory producing drones used in the alleged attack against Putin’s residence, as well as energy infrastructure.
Russian war correspondents released a video purportedly showing the moment the Oreshnik struck its target in western Ukraine. Filmed across a snow-covered landscape, what looked like six flashes were seen striking the ground, followed by a loud bang and a series of detonations.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
Moscow first fired an Oreshnik — Russian for “hazel tree” — against what it said was a military factory in Ukraine in November 2024. On that occasion, Ukrainian sources claimed the missile was carrying dummy warheads, not explosives, and caused limited damage.
Ukrainian and US envoys, joined by a coalition of Ukraine’s allies, have been negotiating in Paris this week to iron out remaining disagreements in a peace framework Washington is seeking to thrash out with Kyiv before presenting it to Russia.</p><small>2026-01-09 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09112923e887342.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965985/pakistan-seeks-economic-dialogue-with-us-flags-regional-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks economic dialogue with US, flags regional security concerns</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Pakistan has called for the launch of a high-level economic dialogue with the United States at the earliest and urged a shift in bilateral engagement from geopolitics to geoeconomics during a series of meetings between the country’s envoy Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior members of Congress.
Meeting House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US said 2026 should be treated as a “year of action” to translate shared intentions into concrete economic cooperation.
“Our focus is shifting from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” he said, according to one of two handouts issued after the meeting, and stressed the need for institutionalised engagement in sectors such as energy, defence, minerals, information technology and artificial intelligence.
Ambassador Sheikh said Pakistan’s low-cost, high-quality manufacturing base positioned it well to meet growing US market needs, highlighting surgical instruments, textiles and sports goods as areas with strong export potential.
He said that “2026 should be the year of action for a long-term, sustainable partnership based on economic cooperation”, noting that footballs manufactured in Sialkot had been used in five consecutive Fifa World Cups.
US State Secretary Marco Rubio has recently spoken positively about expanding ties with Pakistan, describing the relationship as one with significant untapped potential.
“We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan,” Rubio said in October 2025, adding that Washington valued Islamabad’s long history of cooperation, particularly in counter-terrorism.
At the same time, Rubio sought to reassure regional partners, saying that closer engagement with Pakistan does not come at the expense of US ties with India.
“I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important,” he had said, describing US policy as pragmatic and interest-based.
US President Donald Trump, however, has also highlighted strains in Washington’s dealings with New Delhi.
Speaking at a political gathering this week, Trump said: “I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi … he’s not that happy with me because they’re paying a lot of tariffs now,” referring to trade and energy-related differences between the two countries.
Meanwhile, in his meeting with US lawmakers, Ambassador Sheikh also praised the US president’s political judgment and personal engagement in helping de-escalate tensions following the military escalation between Islamabad and New Delhi in May 2025.
According to the handouts, the discussions in Washington also focused on regional security challenges, with the Pakistani ambassador warning that terrorism originating from Afghanistan continued to pose serious threats to Pakistan’s security as well as to regional and international peace.
He told congressional leaders that terrorist incidents in Pakistan increased by 40 per cent in 2024 and by a further 25pc in 2025, attributing the rise to militant groups operating from Afghan soil.
He expressed concern over the continued misuse of advanced weapons left behind during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Addressing South Asian tensions, Ambassador Sheikh referred to the events of May 2025 and said India’s “irresponsible and aggressive behaviour” had lowered the threshold of escalation in the region.
He warned that confrontation between two nuclear-armed neighbours had moved beyond conventional conflict to include advanced technologies, describing the use of dual-capable weapons in a region of 1.7 billion people as deeply alarming.
Ambassador Sheikh cautioned that decisions based on misperceptions or miscalculations could undermine regional peace and reiterated that the unresolved issue of Kashmir and the right of self-determination of its people remained central to lasting stability in South Asia.
Both sides agreed on the need to institutionalise structured and regular dialogue on issues of mutual interest, including economic cooperation and security.
Ambassador Sheikh also extended invitations to congressional leaders to visit Pakistan to strengthen parliamentary and people-to-people ties.
About his meeting with Rogers, the envoy said on X that the two discussed the “ascendantly evolving Pak-US partnership”.
“Focused on regional security challenges, the escalating and sponsored terrorism from Afghanistan, and the subsequently urgent need to address the leftover military equipment. Emphasised that a stable, standalone Pak-US relationship remained vital to regional as well as global peace, security and stability,” he said.







About his meeting with Mast, the ambassador said he thanked him for his leadership and continued support during a year of positive trajectory in Pak-US relations.
“Noted that 2026 must be a year of action — moving from good intent to concrete content based on structured and sustained engagement, geared to translating our ties into a long-term partnership on its own merits,” he said.
“Also exchanged views on regional and global developments. Sought support for enhanced counterterror cooperation, and invited him to visit Pakistan,“ he said.

“What I have done is that I have asked our three missions to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It’s a security issue,” he told reporters at the foreign ministry, responding to a question on whether Bangladesh missions in India had restricted tourist visas for Indians.
He did not name the missions. However, diplomatic sources said the visa sections of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, and the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala have been closed.
The visa sections at Bangladesh missions in Chennai and Mumbai, however, remain operational, sources said.
Over the past few weeks, protests have taken place near Bangladesh missions in India.

 

Following the ouster of the Awami League regime, the Indian High Commission restricted tourist visas to Bangladeshis, citing security concerns.
Touhid was also asked about the dropping of Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman from the Indian Premier League amid anti-Bangladesh protests in India, and Bangladesh’s decision not to send the national cricket team to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.
The adviser said he fully supported Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul’s stance on not sending the team to India for safety reasons and demanding that Bangladesh’s matches be relocated to co-host Sri Lanka.
“We will certainly play outside India,” Touhid said.
He added that both players and supporters would have to travel to India and said the government must consider their security.
Asked about the impact on bilateral relations, Touhid said such issues arise from time to time and each has some impact.
He said Bangladesh would take decisions based on its national interest.
“We have an interest in our players’ safety in not sending them to India. If we have interest in buying rice from India, we will buy it,” he added.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 159km in the Tajikistan- Xinjiang border region at 2am.
The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which reports magnitude using the Moment Magnitude scale, said the earthquake had a magnitude of 5.3 and struck Tajikistan at a depth of 140km.
The United States Geological Survey said Pakistan, Tajikistan, China and Afghanistan were among the affected countries.
According to media reports, the tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There were no immediate reports of any casualties.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
In October 2025, a 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi. A month earlier, a 5.5-magnitude earthquake was felt in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2026-01-09 04:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/090927211be7b7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965981/trump-says-us-going-to-start-now-hitting-land-against-drug-cartels' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US ‘going to start now hitting land’ against drug cartels</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that land strikes against drug cartels were on the way following maritime attacks in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, without providing further details.
“We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump told broadcaster Sean Hannity in an interview on Fox News that aired on Thursday night.
Trump’s comments come after the brazen abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicholas Maduro last weekend, the culmination of months of mounting US military and economic pressure on the leftist leader.
As part of that campaign, the United States has killed more than 100 people in strikes on alleged drug boats since September, and Trump has also said that the US forces conducted a land strike on a docking area for such vessels in Venezuela.
But strikes on cartels in Mexico would mark a significant US military escalation.
The left-wing interim government in Caracas has condemned US strikes on Venezuela as a threat to regional stability.
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that the Americas “do not belong” to any power, after Trump invoked Washington’s “dominance” of the hemisphere after seizing Maduro.
Trump said on Sunday he was pushing Sheinbaum to let him send US troops to tackle drug cartels in Mexico, an offer he said she had previously rebuffed.</p><small>2026-01-09 04:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09083126f3cf1c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965936/terror-kingpins-orders-vindicate-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Terror kingpin’s ‘orders’ vindicate Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: In what is being interpreted as a tac­it acknowledgement of Pak­­istan’s grouse with Ka­­bul, the leader of a notorious terrorist outfit has reportedly urged his ‘commanders’ to avoid recruiting and deploying foreign fighters — most notably Afghans — to fight in Pakistan, warning of serious consequences if his instructions are violated.
The instruction was rel­ayed by Hafiz Gul Baha­dur, who heads the so-cal­led Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan, in an audio message released to his cadres a few days ago, The Khorasan Diary reported.
This also seems to fly in the face of Kabul’s stance that the terrorist threat plaguing Pakistan is “an internal problem”.
The issue of Afghan soil and fighters being used to stage terrorist attacks in Pakistan has remained a critical bone of contention between Islamabad and Afghanistan, escalating into border skirmishes and leading to the eventual closure of the Pak-Afghan border in October last year.
In recent months, Pakis­tan’s civilian and military leadership has maintained that the terrorism plaguing the country originated from Afghanistan.
The instruction from Gul Bahadur comes in the backdrop of pressure from the Afghan Taliban on their Pakistani comrades — in the face of rising international pressure — and follows a decree by a council of religious scholars, pledging that Afghan soil would not be used against a foreign country.
Issued in Kabul early last month, the decree followed a similar statement by the Afghan Taliban su­­preme leader Hibatul­lah Akhundzada, which had largely gone unheeded.

The Brussels-based independent and non-profit think tank, founded by prominent statesmen, says in a new report that relations between the two countries have tanked, mainly because of the Afghan Taliban’s refusal to crack down on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Since 2022, violence in Pakistan has spiralled. In 2025 alone, militants killed more than 600 Pakistani soldiers and police, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the two provinces bordering Afghanistan.
Islamabad blames the banned TTP for these attacks, along with Baloch insurgent groups, which it believes with evidence, are backed by arch-rival India.

Brussels-based think tank says Islamabad may strike Afghanistan again if militant attacks continue

“UN monitors assert that the TTP enjoys Taliban support, but the Taliban publicly deny that Pakistani militants are even in Afghanistan and say Islamabad provoked what they paint as homegrown violence,” according to the report.
On its western flank, after 11 Pakistani military personnel were martyred in a TTP attack on Oct 8, Islamabad conducted cross-border airstrikes, including its first-ever strike on Kabul, ostensibly targeting TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud.
Afghanistan retaliated with attacks on Pakistani military installations. Continued fighting claimed military and civilian lives on both sides.
The report cautions that Islamabad is likely to lash out again if it traces another strike back to Afghanistan.
The Taliban regime is badly outgunned, but its retaliation could still be lethal. Kabul claims to have missiles that can reach Pakistani cities, the use of which would likely provoke an even stronger Pakistani response.
South Asia
In South Asia, however, Islamabad’s foreign relations are far more fraught. After short wars in 2025 with both Afghanistan and India, another major attack by militants could upend the precarious calm that prevails between Pakistan and its two neighbours.
The report lists 10 conflicts to watch in 2026: Afghanistan-Pakistan, Myan­mar, Israel and the United States versus Iran, Israel-Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, Mali and Burkina Faso, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, and Venezuela.
The report says the world was careening into a dangerous new era well before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Thus far, his second term has done less to slow things down than to put a foot on the gas. The year 2025 was a bloody one, and 2026 promises little better.
‘Trump effect’
Less predictable has been President Trump, whose first year back in the White House has turned world politics and international crisis management on their heads. Trump returned to power pledging to bring peace to a world ablaze. He has put himself centre stage in many wars and trouble spots.
Trump has brought fresh attention to peacemaking after years in which diplomatic efforts to end conflicts had been flailing.
But Trump has not calmed the global turmoil he decried on the campaign trail. In some cases, he has made it worse.
His deals, often built on other countries’ diplomacy, have brought respite to some battlefields but delivered no lasting peace anywhere.
Trump’s deal-making aims to bring US power to bear, whether in Gaza, by leveraging Israel’s dependency on Washington, or elsewhere, mostly by threatening tariffs or dangling business opportunities.
Trump’s bargaining must be set against the dearth of peace deals that preceded his return to power as well as the lack of progress in places where he does not engage.
European leaders, for example, focused on the existential peril they see on their doorstep, have less bandwidth for peacemaking elsewhere, the report says.

“He (Xi) considers it to be a part of China, and that‘s up to him what he’s going to be doing,” Trump told the newspaper on Wednesday.
“But I‘ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he‘ll do that. I hope he doesn’t do that.”
Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump‘s audacious military operation in Venezuela and the abduction of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro.
The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Maduro posed to the United States.
He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029.
“He may do it after we have a different president, but I don‘t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said.
The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up US and allies’ military power.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims.
The Taiwan question is purely China‘s internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights, said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington.
The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island’s most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.
The issue has been an irritant in US-China relations for years.
Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.</p><small>2026-01-09 02:21</small></div><hr>
