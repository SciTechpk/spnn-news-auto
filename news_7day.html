Pakistani airspace has remained closed to Indian aircraft since April 24 in a tit-for-tat move after India in a controversial move unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
The ban will now remain in place until 4:59am on Aug 24, according to the authority.
The NOTAM issued by the PAA reads: “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian-registered aircraft and aircraft operated, owned, or leased by Indian airlines/operators, including military flights.”

• Plan hinges on withdrawal of five ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates
• Peshawar chapter livid after its president denied ticket in favour of ‘affluent individual’
• Candidate denies late-night media reports on withdrawal from race
• JUI-F senator claims his party turned down ‘last-minute offer’ from PTI
PESHAWAR: As political parties hold negotiations over seat adjustments for the upcoming Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI’s Peshawar chapter seems to be at odds with the party leadership and has vowed to contest the polls independently.
On Thursday night, leaders of opposition parties had met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur at the CM House to chalk out the modalities of seat adjustment.
The opposition delegation was led by KP Assembly Opposition Leader Dr Ibadullah.
Sources said that the initial understanding developed would see the PTI get six out of 11 Senate seats, comprising four general, one technocrat and one reserved for women.
In contrast, the opposition would receive five seats, including two seats each for JUI-F and PPP (one general and one technocrat each), and one general seat for the PML-N.
This agreement, however, hinges on the withdrawal of PTI candidates Irfan Saleem, Ayesha Bano, Irshad Hussain, Khurram Zeeshan and Waqas Orakzai. But these candidates are seemingly bent upon contesting elections and have refused to bow to party pressure.
In an attempt to defuse the crisis, the PTI’s top leadership, including Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and General Secretary Salman Akram Raja rushed to Peshawar and held talks with the dissidents on Friday.
At least two rounds of meetings remained inconclusive, and the party’s 38-member political committee was expected to make a final decision.
While there was no official word from either side till the filing of this report after midnight, media reports suggested the final round of PTI meeting ended, with the protesting aspirants agreeing to withdraw from the contest.
However, one of the candidates while talking to Dawn denied the media reports, explaining that they had not taken any such decision in the meeting.
Insiders said that the body may like to stick to the deal negotiated with the opposition. If that is the case, then the dissenting PTI figures are unlikely to withdraw their candidature.
Earlier, Irfan Saleem told Dawn that the PTI-opposition arrangement benefits only “pro-establishment elements”.
“Given the current scenario, we’re not ready to withdraw. The number of Senate seats PTI is getting under this arrangement is less than our actual strength in the provincial assembly,” he said.
But he added that if the PTI’s share in the Senate seats could be increased, they were ready to withdraw their candidacy.
‘Peshawar’s Imran Khan’
On the other hand, PTI’s Peshawar chapter has been up in arms against the party leadership for ignoring workers in the process of awarding Senate
tickets, and has threatened to stage a protest outside CM House and lay seige to the KP Assembly on polling day.
The rift deepened following the denial of a Senate ticket to Mr  Saleem, a longstanding party worker and president of PTI’s Peshawar chapter.
“Irfan Saleem is Peshawar’s Imran Khan,” said former district general secretary Jalal Khan at a press conference at Peshawar Press Club on Friday. He was joined by former city president Ihtisham Khan and several tehsil heads.
He said that Mr Saleem had been associated with the PTI for the last 23 years and has rendered tremendous sacrifices for the party before and after the May 9, 2023, violent protests.
“PTI workers in Peshawar were happy when Irfan Saleem was nominated, as he had previously been denied tickets for both the National and provincial assemblies,” he added.
Jalal Khan accused the leadership of dropping Mr Saleem in favour of affluent candidate Mirza Afridi.
He said Mr Saleem suffered a lot at the hands of the law enforcement agencies after the May 9 events, whereas Mr Afridi condemned the incident during a press conference, contrary to party policy.
He also alleged that Mr Saleem’s name was removed from the list of candidates through a conspiracy orchestrated by Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif.
On July 15, the PTI KP chapter had recommended five names to Chairman Barrister Gohar for general seats, including Murad Saeed, Irfan Saleem, Faisal Javed, Khurram Zeeshan and Azhar Mashwani.
A letter accompanying the recommendations said the names were listed “in order of priority, reflecting their dedication, service to the party and ability to represent PTI’s vision at the national level”.
However, Irfan Saleem’s name was dropped following a meeting between Imran Khan and Barrister Saif at Adiala Jail, reportedly to accommodate Mirza Afridi.
JUI-F ‘not interested’
Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza told DawnNewsTV on Friday that the PTI had also approached it for a potential alliance for the Senate elections.
Mr Murtaza said a senior PTI leader had recently contacted him to propose contesting the Senate elections jointly.
However, the JUI-F has turned down the offer, citing its prior  commitment to other opposition parties.
“I told PTI that we have already  given our word,” Mr Murtaza said, confirming that the JUI-F would not  entertain a last-minute alliance with PTI.

• Law introduced to meet EU’s GSP+ conditions requiring limitation of death penalty to the ‘most serious crimes’
• PTI leader slams govt over ‘poor’ disaster response
ISLAMABAD: A bill seeking to abolish the death penalty for harbouring hijackers and for publicly stripping a woman of her clothes was among the four bills passed by the Senate amidst voices of dissent from both sides of the aisle.
The Criminal Laws Amendment Bill, aimed at aligning Pakistan’s laws with its international obligations under the GSP+ trade agreement with the European Union (EU), which requires limiting capital punishment to the most serious crimes, was moved in the House by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry.
The bill proposes the replacement of the death penalty under Sections 354-A and 402-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) with life imprisonment.
Currently, Section 354-A states: “Whoever assaults or uses criminal force against any woman, strips her of her clothes, and exposes her in public shall be punished with death or life imprisonment, along with a fine.”
PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar remarked that the crime of stripping a woman in public is as serious as murder and stressed that death penalty for this offence should remain unchanged.
Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir questioned whether the death penalty for terrorism would be abolished.
Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) lawmaker Samina Mumtaz Zehri observed that the laws concerning crimes against women should be made stricter, not lenient. She warned that easing punishments would embolden criminals. She pointed out that the conviction rate in such cases is already low due to weak prosecution, and emphasised the need for reforms in the police and judicial systems.
“This is not right. This is not going to help the country or its people,” she said, opposing the amendment.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, argued that harsh sentences did not necessarily deter crime. He cited the example of European countries where death penalty did not exist, yet the crime rate ws just 2pc.
He added that in Pakistan, the death penalty currently applied to over a hundred offences. He noted the punishment for stripping a woman in public was originally seven-year imprisonment, and was converted to capital punishment during the regime of Gen Zia in 1982.
The Senate also passed the Extra­dition (Amendment) Bill to address procedural delays in extradition requests, and the Pakistan Citizen­ship Act (Amendment) Bill, enabling Pakistani diaspora members to resume their Pakistani citizenship.
Poor disaster response
Meanwhile, the government came under fire in the Senate over what was described as a lack of preparedness that led to loss of lives and immense suffering during the recent rains.
Speaking on a point of public importance, PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar said: “The loss of precious lives and the severe hardships faced by the people due to the recent rains are a clear indication of the government’s unacceptable negligence and incompetence.”
He stressed that this was not the first instance. Despite early warnings from the meteorological department about the monsoon’s arrival, government institutions were not prepared.
He noted: “Roads and neighbourhoods were flooded, people were forced to spend nights on rooftops, and the state machinery remained a silent spectator. This wasn’t just a natural disaster — it was a failure of governance.”
He raised critical question is there any effective system in place at the government level to deal with emergencies or not? The people go through the same ordeal every year, and the government makes the same old promises and explanations every year.
He urged the chair that the House should be told: “Where were the NDMA and the provincial institutions? where was the emergency plan? what steps were taken to improve the electricity, water and sanitation systems? Why was immediate assistance not provided to the victims?
Mr Zafar demanded a comprehensive report on the government’s response to the rains and called for the formation of a special parliamentary committee to investigate the matter and suggest reforms to prevent such negligence in the future.
He concluded: “It is not only the right of those who lost their lives, but the constitutional and moral responsibility of the state to protect the life, property, and dignity of every citizen. For God’s sake, don’t wait for the next disaster. Reform now so that no mother is forced to search for her child in floodwaters again.”
In response, the Deputy Chairman, who was presiding over the session, said a detailed discussion on the matter would be held on Monday, as several motions were scheduled.
However, Ali Zafar pressed again: “Deputy Chairman Sahib, the time for debate is over. Don’t wait — act now. Decide on the proposed committee.”
The chair stated that it was not only the responsibility of the federal government but also of the four provincial governments to act during such emergencies. As other members stood to speak, the chair concluded the session, citing the approaching time for Friday prayers.

Thai police this week arrested a woman accused of bedding at least 11    monks in violation of their vows of celibacy, before blackmailing them with thousands of secretly taken photos of their trysts.
The monks are said to have paid nearly $12 million, funnelled out of their monasteries, funded by donations from laypeople hoping to increase their merit and prospects for reincarnation.
The scandal provoked outrage over hypocrisy in the monkhood, concern that their status shields them from scrutiny, and soul-searching across society about the role of religion.

“I’m not involved in the religion like I used to be,” 33-year-old motorbike taxi driver Mongkol Sudathip told AFP. “I don’t have full respect for it anymore.”
King Maha Vajiralongkorn has cancelled invitations to more than 80 monks who had been due to attend his upcoming 73rd birthday celebrations, citing “inappropriate behaviour that caused mental distress among the Thai people”.
While the 11 monks have been stripped of their robes, the kingdom’s National Office of Buddhism has vowed to “restore public trust” with a sweeping police probe into the grubby affair.
‘Splurging attitude’
Theravada Buddhism has been the spiritual backbone of Thai identity for more than two millennia, and still shapes national laws banning alcohol on religious holidays and protecting sacred objects.
Thai men are traditionally expected to ordain as monks at least once in their lives for a period lasting as short as a few weeks or as long as decades.
The clergy are bound by 227 strict rules, including a ban on masturbation, touching women and even handling objects directly from them.
Monks traditionally survive on alms, food offerings and a modest $170 monthly stipend, but some pocket fees for lectures, blessings and ceremonies — blurring the line between faith and fortune.

In a TV interview, the woman at the heart of the scandal said she had developed a “splurging attitude” as her monk lovers lavished her with shopping trips worth up to $90,000 a day.
Motorcycle taxi driver Mongkol said he now prefers to donate to hospitals or schools for underprivileged children. “It feels more meaningful than giving money to temples,” he told AFP.
This month’s scandal is not the first to rock the monkhood.
In 2017, police raided Wat Dhammakaya temple north of Bangkok, arresting its former abbot over allegations of laundering $33m in public donations.
This May, police held another monk in the capital over allegations of embezzling nearly $10m from a temple for an online gambling network.

Buddhism scholar Danai Preechapermprasit said repeated scandals — especially among senior monks — have “shaken people to the core”.
“People question whether donations are used for spiritual significance or personal desire,” he told AFP. “I think Thailand has reached a point where it’s difficult for monks to even walk down the street.”
A powerful lawmaker has pledged tighter regulations within three months, including mandatory donation disclosures and laws treating monk misconduct as a criminal offence.
“This case does not represent Buddhism as a whole,” said national police chief Kitrat Panphet on Thursday, pledging a new task force to probe misbehaving monks. “It’s about a few individuals doing wrong,” he said.
‘Never lose faith’
In Buddhist tradition, monks are viewed as the Buddha’s spiritual heirs, entrusted with preserving and passing on his teachings.
But at Wat Bowonniwet in Bangkok, one of Thailand’s most revered temples, only 26 monks were ordained this year, a steep drop from nearly 100 before the Covid-19 pandemic.
A monk there, speaking to AFP anonymously, blamed societal changes after the pandemic, which forced people into isolation, saying nowadays “people prefer to live outside the temple life”.
But independent Buddhism expert Jaturong Jongarsa said temples are increasingly being treated as “a garbage dump”, where families send drug addicts or LGBTQ youth to be “corrected”.
“Temples are no longer seen as the sacred spaces they once were,” he told AFP. “People send their problems to the temple and hope they’ll go away.”
Still, not all Thais have lost faith.
Camphun Parimiphut, a 52-year-old security guard from Maha Sarakham in Thailand’s northeast, said: “Buddhism is about the teachings, not the individuals who fail it”.
Because of corruption scandals, he now avoids giving money to monks, preferring to donate only food. But his devotion remains steadfast.
“You can lose faith in monks,” he said. “But never lose trust in Buddhist teachings. They still teach us how to live a good life. “</p><small>2025-07-18 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18233800ab0e6e3.jpg?r=234058' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925037/us-rejects-who-global-pandemic-response-accord' target='_blank'><strong>US rejects WHO global pandemic response accord</strong></a><br><p>The United States has rejected an agreement adopted by members of the World Health Organisation to improve preparedness for future pandemics following the disjointed global response to Covid-19, the American government said on Friday.
The State Department and Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement they had transmitted on Friday the official US rejection of the legally binding pact, which was adopted in Geneva in May after three years of negotiations.
The pact aims to ensure that drugs, therapeutics and vaccines are globally accessible when the next pandemic hits. It requires participating manufacturers to allocate a target of 20 per cent of their vaccines, medicines and tests to the WHO during a pandemic to ensure poorer countries have access.
US negotiators left discussions about the accord after President Donald Trump began a 12-month process of withdrawing the US, by far the WHO’s largest financial backer, from the agency when he took office in January. Its exit means the US would not be bound by the pact.
“Developed without adequate public input, these amendments expand the role of the WHO in public health emergencies, create additional authorities for the WHO for shaping pandemic declarations, and promote the WHO’s ability to facilitate ‘equitable access’ of health commodities,” the US statement said.
“Terminology throughout the 2024 amendments is vague and broad, risking WHO-coordinated international responses that focus on political issues like solidarity, rather than rapid and effective actions,” said the statement, jointly issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy, who has a long history of sowing doubt about vaccine safety, had slammed WHO in a video address to the Assembly during its vote, saying it had failed to learn from the lessons of the pandemic with the new agreement.
Kennedy and Rubio said on Friday that the rejection protects US sovereignty. The pact leaves health policy to national governments and contains nothing that overrides national sovereignty, however.</p><small>2025-07-18 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181926180b5eff0.jpg?r=192813' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924989/medium-level-flood-at-punjabs-kalabagh-and-chashma-on-indus-river-due-to-monsoon-rains' target='_blank'><strong>Medium-level flood at Punjab’s Kalabagh and Chashma on Indus River due to monsoon rains</strong></a><br><p>Flooding at Punjab’s Kalabagh and Chashma on the Indus river reached a “medium” level on Friday, prompting the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to issue a high-level flood warning for the two points, as water flows surged due to heavy monsoon rains.
Rescue operations continued in Punjab after recent deadly rains wreaked havoc and claimed at least 63 lives across the province. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that five more such spells of rain are expected in the coming days, leading to rising water levels, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The next spell is expected to begin from July 21 and last till July 28, while the fifth is expected in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week of August and the seventh in its third week.
“The flow of water in rivers is increasing due to monsoon rains and glacial melting,” a statement issued by the PDMA spokesperson said.
According to the data released by the Met Office’s Flood Forecasting Division at 6pm, there was a medium-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage with falling water inflow and outflow at the former, and rising flows at the latter.
There was a low-level flood at Tarbela Dam, as well as at Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh, as of 12pm.
By 6pm, water flow around at Guddu was normal, while Sukkur and Tarbela were still registering low flood.

In view of the situation, the PDMA issued a warning for an expected high-level flood at Kalabagh and Chashma during the next 24 hours.
“Activate flood monitoring and early warning systems,” the advisory said. It also ordered authorities to strengthen embankments, establish relief and medical camps, as well as stockpile essential medicines and food.
According to NDMA’s website, 15 people have died across the country in the last 24 hours as a result of the rains, while 53 have been injured. Eleven of these deaths were reported from Punjab.

Yesterday, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and left dozens dead.
This year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”, NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik was quoted as saying by APP.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza, in a statement, directed the Lahore Electric Supply Company to ensure uninterrupted power supply. He advised citizens to avoid electric cables and poles, as well as areas where water accumulates.
 






Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed and Vice-Chairman Chaudhry Shahbaz Ahmad visited various low-lying areas of Lahore, including Nakhuda Chowk, Bhaati Gate, Circular Road, Akbari Gate, Delhi Gate and Kotwali.
The Wasa top officials were briefed on the water drainage operations, a statement by the agency said. Ghufran ordered the teams to speed up their efforts and ensure that the machinery was fully functional.
 






Over 1,000 rescued along Potohar plateau: PDMA
Amid the ongoing situation, the PDMA DG directed the administration to stay on high alert.
“PDMA Control Room and District Emergency Operation Centres are monitoring the situation 24/7”, said DG Kathia in a statement, urging the public to take necessary precautionary measures, avoid unnecessary travel, and steer clear of electric wires and poles.
Detailing the PDMA’s rescue efforts in a statement, he said that “more than 1,000 people were rescued along the Potohar plateau, including 398 citizens in Jhelum, 209 in Chakwal, and 450 in Rawalpindi”.
“No loss of life has been reported yet due to anyone getting caught in the floodwater,” Kathia claimed.
The district administration and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the rescue operations, he added. Citizens were evacuated via helicopters in many areas where rescue boats were unable to reach.
 


DG PDMA stressed that “monsoon rains are predicted to be more than usual this year”, vowing that all resources would be utilised to protect citizens.
Separately, in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Farooq Ahmad, Punjab Rescue 1122 detailed the casualties and damages that occurred due to the recent monsoon rains since June 25.
Rescue 1122 stated that most of the casualties occurred in house collapse incidents  — 351 since June 25 — due to dilapidated buildings. It recorded 61 traffic accidents, 22 electrocutions and four lightning incidents, among others.
According to the statement, 15,000 rescue personnel were on high alert across Punjab with 800 boats.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.
Widespread monsoon rains expected across KP from July 20-25: Met Office
Another spell of monsoon rains accompanied by wind and thundershowers across most parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from the evening of July 20 to July 25, according to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
According to the Peshawar Regional Met Office, a new monsoon weather system is expected to enter the province during the said period. The system is likely to be further intensified by an incoming westerly wave, which may result in widespread rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds in multiple districts.
The areas likely to be affected include Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral (Upper & Lower), Dir (Upper & Lower), Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan (Upper & Lower), Kolai Pallas Kohistan, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, and North and South Waziristan (Upper & Lower).
The KP PDMA warned that the rains may include scattered heavy to very heavy downpours in some areas, along with lightning and strong winds, which may pose risks of urban flooding, landslides in hilly terrain, and disruption in daily routines.
Through a letter to all deputy commissioners, the PDMA has advised the authorities across the province to remain alert and take precautionary measures during the forecast period. The public and tourists too have been advised to take precautionary measures.

Pakistan and the US concluded a critical round of trade negotiations earlier this month, reaching an understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors.
While both sides reached an understanding, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.
According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb had a “productive meeting” with Lutnick and Greer in Washington DC, with both sides satisfied with progress made in enhancing trade ties.
“They (Pakistan and the US) reaffirmed their commitment to exploring opportunities to strengthen these ties in all possible areas of mutual benefit,” the statement read.
“Finance Minister Aurangzeb emphasised that the US remains Pakistan’s largest trading partner and underscored Pakistan’s interest in expanding cooperation in both traditional and non-traditional sectors, including IT and tech sector, minerals, and agriculture, to foster a mutually beneficial relationship.”
According to the finance ministry, both parties “expressed optimism” that ongoing trade talks would yield positive outcomes and economic benefits for Islamabad and Washington.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council partnered with World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance platform backed by United States President Donald Trump, to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption.</p><small>2025-07-18 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18151705c4b237c.png?r=151908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925000/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-baloch-others-on-15-day-physical-remand-again' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC sends Mahrang Baloch, others on 15-day physical remand again</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday handed Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days, marking yet another extension of their detention.
In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
On July 8, a Quetta ATC handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention. The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch.
Today’s hearing was taken up by ATC Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, while Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch and Advocate Shoaib Baloch, appeared in court.
On the request of the police, the judge handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody on a further 15-day remand.
Advocate Shoaib Baloch told Dawn.com that Dr Mahrang’s lawyers opposed the 15-day physical remand and told the court to ask the investigation team what was achieved in the previous 10-day remand.
“No response was given by the investigation team, and zero progress was made,” the counsel said. “Despite this, the court ordered a 15-day remand.”
Tight security arrangements were made today for the activist’s appearance in court.
On Tuesday, international human rights organisation Amnesty International called upon Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.
It called on CM Bugti to drop all charges and overturn detention orders against Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.
Subsequently, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch appealed to the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.
The petition alleged that her “repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion” and labelling her as a “sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
The same month, the Kech chapter of the BYC launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club in protest of the leadership’s arrests.
BYC’s Islamabad sit-in continues for 3rd day
Meanwhile, a sit-in of BYC supporters in Islamabad demanding the release of its activists continued for a third day.
Senior journalist Hamid Mir visited the demonstrators today and joined them briefly.
Sharing a picture of him sitting beside a girl, Mir said the girl was protesting the “disappearance” of his father in 2016.
 






The sit-in began on June 16, with leaders of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) visiting the protesters later that night to express solidarity.
TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai had spoken to police officials, criticising them.</p><small>2025-07-18 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18222139f11f584.png?r=222148' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925034/indian-right-wing-group-forces-fast-food-outlet-to-shut-its-doors-media-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Indian right-wing group forces fast food outlet to shut its doors: media reports</strong></a><br><p>A group of right-wingers in India forcibly closed an outlet of the fast food chain KFC to close, demanding a ban on the sale of non-vegetarian food during the Hindu month of Sawan, according to reports by Indian media outlets on Friday.
Sawan, also known as Shravana, is considered a holy month in the Hindu calendar where many observe fasts and refrain from consuming meat, alcohol and even onions and garlic, according to Indian daily The Hindu.
The Hindu reported that a group of demonstrators stormed the outlet in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh and confronted the staff, demanding that the restaurant’s operations be stopped.
“Visuals of the incident circulated widely on social media showed members of the outfit carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans such as ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’, while forcibly pulling down the shutter of the KFC outlet,” the newspaper added.
 






According to The Times of India, Pinky Chaudhary, the chief of the group, said, “Our message is clear: we are asking that all non-vegetarian outlets to refrain from serving such food during the Kanwar Yatra. If they want to remain open, they should serve vegetarian options only.”
The Hindu reported that opposition parties assailed the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the incident, holding it responsible for “a deterioration in law and order”.
The Indian Congress party’s National Secretary, Shahnawaz Alam, was quoted by the newspaper as saying: “Such actions are a violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. When there is no ban, how can individuals storm a food chain and force it to shut down?
“It is a design to create disorder in society through groups that have become mainstream after the BJP assumed power. Holy occasions are being used to fuel tension on communal lines,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-18 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/182001101e2feb2.jpg?r=200137' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925028/humaira-asghar-case-report-finds-no-sedatives-or-any-toxic-substance-in-body' target='_blank'><strong>Humaira Asghar case: report finds no sedatives or any toxic substance in body</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi University laboratory on basis of samples sent from actor Humaira Asghar’s body came to the conclusion that there were no traces of sedative or toxic substance in it, raising a strong possibility that the medico-legal section will likely to declare it as a “natural death”, it emerged on Friday according to a report and police officials.
A police investigative report released on Wednesday found that the evidence so far indicated that the actor’s death — whose body was discovered in a Karachi apartment on July 8 — was accidental or due to natural causes.
“No traces of any sedative, psychiatric, narcotics or any poisonous substances are found,” according to the contents of the report prepared by experts associated with the International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences of Karachi University (KU) and obtained by Dawn.com.
The Gizri police had sent the samples of the 42-year-old actor’s hair, lung and liver collected by Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Doctor Bakhtawar Khan on July 8. The KU lab performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) technique to analyse the said samples, the report said.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the police have received the report of the late actor’s body samples.
The senior officer hinted at the possibility that medico-legal officers and doctors would likely call it a “natural death”.
The South DIG said the investigators have also obtained the “medical history of the late actor from a private hospital in Clifton in the recent past”.
South-DIG Raza said that investigators have also received a DNA report from Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology Laboratory at the KU. Sharing findings of the forensic lab, the senior officer said the report stated that there was a “human blood on a stain section taken from shirt and trousers of Humaira Asghar.”
However, the DIG said it was a “meager amount of blood that might have been caused by biting insects.” He said as per concerned procedure, the MLOs and doctors would determine the exact cause of death in light of these findings of the both labs of the KU.
He said the police would submit the reports to the doctors and they expected that they would give their final version about cause of death on Monday.
Humaira was laid to rest in the Model Town Q Block graveyard in Lahore last week following a sparsely-attended funeral.
Earlier in the month, police formed a special investigation team to probe the actor’s death, whose body was found in a Karachi apartment on July 8.
The notification calling for the formation of the investigation team had directed them to inquire into the facts and thoroughly investigate the death of Humaira to ascertain the cause of death, whether natural, accidental, suicidal or murder, by utilising all available resources and submit a progress report to the SSP’s office on a daily basis.
An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed had confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
 
 

The autopsy report was released to the police, but the coroner could not determine the actor’s cause of death due to the level of decomposition.
Besides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.
She had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing arts, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1820134994a36f5.jpg?r=201650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925029/pakistan-records-annual-current-account-surplus-of-21bn-state-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan records annual current account surplus of $2.1bn: State Bank</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday announced that Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $2.1 billion during the current fiscal year.
Due to the widening trade gap and higher external debt servicing, the country posted a current account deficit of $103 million in May compared to a $47m surplus in the preceding month and $1.2bn in March.
According to SBP data, the current account saw a surplus of $2.1bn, compared to a deficit of $2.1bn during the previous fiscal year.
 






Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted the developments in a post on X, stating that the surplus was the highest in 22 years.
“[The] country’s current account for June 2025 closes in $328m surplus, taking full-year surplus to over $2.1bn,” he wrote.
Schehzad added that remittances surged by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach a “historic” $38bn.
He added that in the current fiscal year, textile exports increased by 7.4pc year-on-year to $17.9bn, while IT (information technology) and IT-enabled services exports climbed to $4.6bn — a year-on-year increase of 44pc.
“Last, but not the least, [the] Pakistan Equities Market (KSE-100) crossed 140,000 points, making a historic mark in its history, with market value crossing Rs 16.8 trillion (close to $60bn),” he wrote.
 






Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the current account surplus, calling it “very welcome”.
“Foreign exchange reserves have exceeded $19bn due to government measures,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from his office.
“The main reason for the stability in current account surplus is a significant increase in remittances and exports,” he added. “Improving financial and economic indicators show that the country’s economy is on the path of stability.”
Commending his team, the PM said that the government is taking priority steps to provide a business and investment-friendly environment in the country, according to the statement.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18193444c66bbfe.png?r=193650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925022/fo-says-pakistan-has-dismantled-terrorist-outfits-amid-us-designation-of-group-blamed-for-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>FO says Pakistan has ‘dismantled’ terrorist outfits amid US designation of group blamed for Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying that the country has “effectively and comprehensively dismantled” terrorist outfits.
The statement follows the US State Department’s decision on Thursday to designate a little-known group  called The Resistance Front (TRF) — responsible for the Pahalgam attack — as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) and specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) group.
The April 22 attack — which resulted in the deaths of 26 people — sparked a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
According to a BBC News report in June, the group had initially said it was behind the attack, but later disowned it.
The US State Department claimed that the little-known group was a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
“TRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,” the State Department said in a statement.
In a statement today, the FO said, “Any linkage with LeT, a defunct organisation banned in Pakistan, belies ground realities.
“Pakistan has effectively and comprehensively dismantled concerned outfits, arrested and prosecuted the leadership, and deradicalised its cadres,” it added.
“Pakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy.”
The FO highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, including the apprehension of Mohammad Sharifullah, who was the “mastermind” of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport.
The statement further said that the investigations into the Pahalgam incident were “still inconclusive”.
“While the issue under consideration pertains to US domestic laws, India has a track record of exploiting such designations to push anti-Pakistan propaganda with a view to divert international attention from its irresponsible and rogue behaviour, including ongoing human rights atrocities, especially in occupied Kashmir,” it added.
The FO’s statement also urged the international community to “adopt objective and non-discriminatory policies” to address terrorism.
“Terrorist organisations like Majeed Brigade must also be listed as [an] alias of BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army),” the FO asserted.
In 2022, an anti-terrorism court awarded a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart­ment.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog, in 2022 removed Pakistan from a list of countries under “increased monitoring”, also known as the “grey list”, after four years.
“It has two concurrent action plans. After a lot of work by Pakistani authorities, they have largely addressed all of the action plan items,” then-FATF president Raja Kumar said.</p><small>2025-07-18 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/181855368e515e3.jpg?r=185602' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925023/13000-to-15000-pakistani-students-go-to-uk-for-permanent-residence-every-year-senate-panel-told' target='_blank'><strong>13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to UK for permanent residence every year, Senate panel told</strong></a><br><p>Around 13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to the United Kingdom for permanent residence every year, a Foreign Office (FO) official told the Senate on Friday.
“Every year, 13,000 to 15,000 Pakistani students go to the UK for permanent residence,” a FO representative told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis in a meeting chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada.
“Pakistani students prefer to settle in the UK rather than return to the country,” the official added.
“These students are willing to work even for minimum wage.”
According to the official, Pakistani students then become part of the UK labour market.
The FO representative told the panel that there are currently 1.8 million Pakistanis living in the UK.
“Pakistani citizens face difficulties [in the UK] due to lack of English proficiency,” the official added.
Earlier in the week, UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
On Wednesday, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK.
In May, a British government official said that the government may restrict visa applications from students living in countries — including Pakistan — that are considered most likely to claim asylum in a move designed to bring down annual net migration.
The move came after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party was punished in local elections in England last week by voters angry over issues, including illegal immigration.</p><small>2025-07-18 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18175156c0eda2b.jpg?r=183205' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925017/pakistan-beat-india-3-0-in-asian-mens-u-16-volleyball-championship-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan beat India 3-0 in Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship semi-final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday beat India 3-0 in the Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship semi-final being held in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand.

“Stellar performances from Junaid, Faizan, Irfan, and Talha powered the Green Shirts into the Final and one step closer to glory,” the association said.
With this victory, Pakistan qualifies for the final, where they will face Iran on July 19 at 3:30pm PKT.
On Wednesday, Pakistan secured a place in the semi-finals of the Asian U-16 Volleyball Championship and booked their berth in next year’s FIVB U-17 World Championship after defeating Indonesia in straight sets in the quarter-final.
The national side had registered another 3-0 victory with set scores of 25-23, 25-20, 25-20. Key contributions came from Junaid, Faizan, Talha, and Saran, who were instrumental in maintaining Pakistan’s unbeaten run in the tournament.
 


“This win is not just about reaching the semi-finals; it’s about proving that Pakistan’s youth has the strength and skill to compete at the highest levels,” Pakistan head coach Kafiatullah had said. “Qualification for the FIVB U-17 World Championship is a moment of national pride.”

There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured in a blast that targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.
According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.”
“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.
Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.
He continued, “Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished.”
“A formal investigation into the attack has been launched, and the elements involved will be brought to justice,” he added.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing Fitna-Al-Hindustan — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
 






Earlier today, the spokesperson said that one Balochistan Constabulary officer was martyred and three others were injured in the incident.
“According to initial reports, the acting DSP’s vehicle was targeted,” Rind said in a statement.
The assailants opened fire on the vehicle near the Choto area of Mastung on the National Highway, the statement elaborated.
Rind stated that “a search operation is underway to apprehend the assailants, and security forces have been dispatched to the site of the attack”.
The injured officers were immediately rushed to Shaheed Nawab Ghaus Bakhsh Hospital in Quetta, he added.
On July 16, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this month, three cops were injured in an attack on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.
In a separate incident on July 9, unknown attackers hurled a grenade at a police checkpoint at the Sibi-Harnai railway crossing gate. The grenade exploded at the post, but no injuries were reported.
On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1817453032ae157.jpg?r=174657' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925019/first-batch-of-300-pakistani-agriculture-graduates-complete-training-in-china' target='_blank'><strong>First batch of 300 Pakistani agriculture graduates complete training in China</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday announced that the first batch of 300 Pakistani agriculture graduates had completed their hands-on training in China’s Shaanxi province as part of a joint agriculture training initiative.
Last July, it was announced that 1,000 students would travel to China for modern agricultural vocational training at the government’s expense. The first batch of students was sent to China at the beginning of the academic year 2024-25, while the next batch would be sent to Chinese agricultural universities after learning Chinese in Pakistan.
In a post on X, the PM said it was “very heartening” to hear that the 300 students completed their training “in important areas of water saving irrigation, seed production, animal husbandry, agriculture production and prevention of post-harvest losses”.
“My special thanks to the Chinese leadership, [the] Shaanxi Government and the two universities,” PM Shehbaz said, referring to North West Agriculture and Forestry University and Yangling Vocational and Technical College.
“Appreciation for [the] Ministry of National Food Security, HEC (Higher Education Commission) and Pak Embassy Beijing for their hard work in ensuring the success of this initiative,” he wrote.
 






The Chinese Embassy also published a post on X congratulating the graduates on completing their training.
“May these talented youths play an important role in promoting Pakistan’s agricultural modernisation and [Pakistani and Chinese] agricultural cooperation!” the embassy wrote.
 






Earlier this year, PM Shehbaz reiterated the government’s determination to transform the country’s agriculture sector on modern lines, emphasising that the sustainable development of this key sector of the economy is inevitable.
In the Pakistan Economic Survey released in June, the overall agriculture sector, which accounts for nearly 24 per cent of GDP, posted modest growth of 0.6pc in fiscal year 2024-25, falling well short of the 2pc target and significantly below the announced growth of 6.4pc.
Major crops such as wheat, cotton, and maize contracted by 13.5pc, a sharper decline than an estimated 4.5pc.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18162937d2d0756.jpg?r=162946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925009/security-forces-foil-infiltration-bid-by-terrorists-on-pak-afghan-border-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces foil infiltration bid by terrorists on Pak-Afghan border: state media</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run PTV News reported on Friday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“Pakistani security forces have foiled an infiltration attempt by Khawarij along the Pak-Afghan border,” PTV News reported, citing security sources.
Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
PTV said, quoting security sources, that on July 17, at around 5pm, Khawarij tried to cross the border and enter Pakistan, but the forces, on receiving immediate information, set up checkpoints at various places and prevented them from proceeding ahead with their attempt.
“The Khawarij advanced towards Azizkhel and Mandikhel, but due to the heavy presence of security forces, they were forced to take refuge in the mosque in Besikhel, where the forces immediately surrounded them and forced them to surrender,” the state broadcaster said.
All five suspects arrested are Afghan citizens aged between 15 and 18. Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.
Security authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, PTV added.
“Security sources say that India is giving full support to the Khawarij separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,” PTV News said.
ASI, constable injured in quadcopter attack: police
A police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP’s Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.
“The injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,” DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was “crucial for combating terrorists in the district”.
The DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.
“National unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,” the DPO said “Police alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.”
Earlier this month, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an “Indian proxy”, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.
On July 9, security forces killed eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.
Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.</p><small>2025-07-18 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1816122610859c8.jpg?r=171237' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925010/body-of-policeman-swept-away-in-jhelum-floods-found-laid-to-rest-with-honour' target='_blank'><strong>Body of policeman swept away in Jhelum floods found, laid to rest with honour</strong></a><br><p>The body of a police constable, who was carried away by flash floods during a rescue operation to evacuate stranded residents in Jhelum district, has been recovered after 24 hours and he was laid to rest with honour, the district police said on Friday.
Punjab government declared a state of emergency and imposed section 144 in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding across the province. Data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) showed 61 people were killed and 268 injured, while more rains are expected in the coming days.
Dozens of villages were inundated in Jhelum district after unabated rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday, and a rescue operation was launched by the district administration to evacuate residents stranded amid flash floods.
During the rescue operation in Chotala area, six police constables were boarding a tractor trolley to evacuate local residents when the vehicle overturned due to raging floodwaters.
Consequently, constable Haider Ali Hussain was swept away, while others managed to survive. His body was recovered by Rescue 1122 divers after an extensive search operation.
Jhelum District Police Officer Tariq Aziz Sindhu told Dawn.com: “During the rescue efforts, the water flow suddenly intensified, and while saving citizens, he (police constable) lost his own life.”
He said the policeman went missing in the floodwaters and an operation was launched to locate and retrieve him with the assistance of drone surveillance and diving efforts. He paid tribute to the “ultimate sacrifice of the martyred constable”.
Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Syed Meisam Abbas said the severe flash floods in Jhelum, Sohawa and Pind Dadan Khan tehsils were successfully handled with the rescue mechanism directly monitored by the chief minister.
Abbas added that no residents were killed, except for the police constable. He said rescue officials, police, civil defence, and army personnel with assistance of helicopters made concerted efforts to rescue over 450 residents and their cattle from risky situations.
The constable’s funeral was held at Police lines Jhelum and was attended by police officers and provincial adviser Dr Azhar Mahmood Kiyani.
Inspector General of Punjab Police Usman Anwar issued a message on X, expressing his grief over the incident. “The brave constable attained martyrdom while helping flood victims, and his services would long be remembered by the police department,” the police chief said.
In a post on X, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kiyani, who was monitoring the flood situation in his home district, paid homage and announced a financial compensation under the police martyrs’ package. He also appreciated the role of the district administration and rescue teams.
 






Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif, in a post on X on Thursday, expressed her “heartfelt appreciation to the brave officers of Jhelum Police for their extraordinary courage, swift response, and selfless commitment during the recent flash floods”.
“Rescuing over 400 stranded individuals in such perilous conditions is nothing short of heroic. Their unwavering dedication to public service is a testament to the strength and resilience of our law enforcement. They have proven themselves [as] the true guardians of our community,” she added.</p><small>2025-07-18 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18162519192cd44.png?r=163039' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925004/coas-munir-libyan-armed-forces-chief-agree-on-defence-industrial-collaboration-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir, Libyan armed forces’ chief agree on defence industrial collaboration: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and Libyan Armed Forces’ Commander in Chief Lt Gen Saddam Khalifa Haftar agreed on their countries’ collaboration in the defence industry, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.

Wildlife officials said one elephant was run over by a passenger train in the island’s northeast, while two others were found shot dead in the central and eastern regions.
Elephants are protected by law and considered sacred due to their significance in Buddhist culture, but farmers often kill them to protect their crops.
Human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka has resulted in the deaths of nearly 200 elephants and 55 people so far this year.
“We have launched investigations into the shootings of the two elephants, it looks like the work of local farmers,” a police spokesman in the capital Colombo said.
The train accident occurred in Gallella, the same area where seven elephants were killed by a locomotive in February, the worst incident of its kind in Sri Lanka. It happened despite speed limits on trains passing through elephant-inhabited forest areas.
A Sri Lanka railway official said an “internal investigation has been launched to establish if the driver had violated the speed limit”.
Wildlife authorities released six elephants, aged between five and seven, back into the jungle on Thursday after rehabilitating them under a conservation programme that began in 1998.
The Elephant Transit Home in Udawalawe, about 210 kilometres southeast of Colombo, cares for rescued animals and eventually returns them to the wild. The sanctuary is a major tourist attraction and holds 57 elephants that had been abandoned, injured, or separated from their herds.
Sri Lankan authorities believe the transit home’s strategy of rewilding rescued elephants, rather than domesticating them, has been successful.
The home has returned 187 elephants to the wild since 1998.
Conservation efforts have become increasingly urgent due to the escalating conflict between wild elephants and farmers.
Official figures from Sri Lanka’s wildlife department show that 4,835 elephants and 1,601 people have been killed in the worsening conflict since 2010.</p><small>2025-07-18 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18155355c11cdb1.jpg?r=160513' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925002/one-billion-africans-being-harmed-by-cooking-pollution' target='_blank'><strong>One billion Africans being harmed by cooking pollution</strong></a><br><p>One billion Africans have to cook on open fires or with fuel that is hazardous to their health and the environment, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.
The problem, which its report says can be easily solved, causes as much greenhouse gas emissions every year as the aviation industry.
Two billion people across the world still cook on open fires or with rudimentary stoves fed by wood, charcoal, agricultural waste or manure, the IEA report found.
“It is one of the greatest injustices of our time, especially in Africa,” IEA head Fatih Birol told AFP, where four out of five households rely on open fires and burning wood.
These fuels pollute the air both indoors and outdoors with fine particles that penetrate the lungs and cause multiple respiratory and cardiovascular problems, the report said.
It also adds to the destruction of forests, natural sinks that trap carbon and help fight global warming.
 






The IEA estimates that 815,000 premature deaths occur each year in Africa alone due to poor indoor air quality, largely resulting from a lack of access to clean cooking methods.
Women and children suffer the most, spending hours each day searching for fuel and keeping the fire going.
This takes time away from paid employment or education, the report said.
‘Can be easily solved’
A landmark IEA summit on the issue, held in Paris in May last year, raised $2.2bn in public and private sector commitments, as well as political pledges from 12 African governments.
Since then $470 million has been distributed, with concrete results already being seen, Birol insisted, citing a stove factory under construction in Malawi and an affordable stove programme developed in Uganda and Ivory Coast.
The IEA report assesses the progress made a year after the summit and sets out a roadmap for African countries to be able to use clean cooking methods at low cost before 2040.
Since 2010, nearly 1.5bn people in Asia and Latin America, particularly in Brazil, India, and Indonesia, have gained access to modern cooking stoves and fuels.
But the challenge remains immense in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of people without access to clean cooking methods continues to grow.
“For once and for ever, this problem can be solved with an annual investment of $2bn per year,” Birol said.
He stressed that the figure “is about 0.1 per cent of global energy investment, which is nothing”.
Alternative solutions are well known: electricity from solar panels, renewable gas and especially liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a fossil fuel, which, while not ideal, is preferable than the loss of carbon sinks due to tree felling, Birol said.
The IEA said this would prevent 4.7m premature deaths in sub-Saharan Africa by 2040 and reduce the continent’s greenhouse gas emissions by 540m tons per year, as much as the equivalent of the annual emissions of the global aviation sector.</p><small>2025-07-18 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1814054873c79ad.gif?r=140654' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924990/5-private-companies-submit-proposals-on-ferry-service-from-gwadar-to-gulf-region-maritime-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>5 private companies submit proposals on ferry service from Gwadar to Gulf region: maritime ministry</strong></a><br><p>Five private companies on Friday proposed routes for the newly announced ferry service from Gwadar to the Gulf region, according to the maritime ministry.
On July 1, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry chaired a meeting on the ferry service today to review the “technical and financial aspects of ferry operations”, a statement by his ministry said.
“Five private companies presented their proposals,” the statement added.
 
 

“The interest of the private sector in ferry service has increased,” Chaudhry said, adding that various routes were under consideration. “The ferry service will promote regional connectivity and trade.”
“The movement of passengers and goods from Gulf countries will become easier,” he noted, adding that the service will highlight Gwadar on the international maritime map.
The ministry also stated that the meeting included instructions to conduct further evaluations of the submitted proposals. “Authorities were directed to ensure that all regulatory, technical, and logistical considerations are fully addressed ahead of the ferry service launch,” it said.
During the meeting, the maritime minister held a phone call with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and discussed provincial cooperation. Bugti “assured full cooperation in the ferry service project”, according to the ministry.
In a statement on X, the Balochistan government said, “The meeting discussed important matters related to the development of Gwadar, public facilities, and increasing employment opportunities for the youth.”
CM Bugti was quoted as saying that the provincial government was giving “serious consideration” to the ferry service from Gwadar to Oman, which will “facilitate pilgrims and ease travelling for the local population”.
“Assuring full cooperation from the Balochistan government, the chief minister stated that this initiative will prove to be a milestone in strengthening regional connectivity,” the statement read.
 






The Balochistan government also vowed to provide cooperation and support at every level for the full operationalisation of Gwadar Port.
“All proposed development projects of the Gwadar Port Authority will be fully supported so that Gwadar Port can play a central role in the national economy,” the statement affirmed.
The statement also said that 1.2 million gallons of clean drinking water will be provided daily to Gwadar citizens through a desalination project that will be established under the Gwadar Port Authority, calling it a “significant step toward a lasting solution to the long-standing water issue”.
 
 

CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The government is committed to providing world-class training to the youth.”
The youth will be taught various skills under the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, while the provincial government’s program to train and provide overseas employment to 30,000 youths will be supported by the Pak-China Technical Vocational Centre, the statement added.
Today’s development comes after Chaudhry visited the Gwadar port on Wednesday to review various ongoing development projects.
 






The country has recently increased efforts on the commercialisation of the Gwadar Port, which was built more than a decade ago but remains a non-starter, turning the multi-billion-dollar infrastructure facility into a white elephant instead of becoming a transhipment hub.
Earlier this year, the government sought the private sector’s support in routing their cargoes through the port, seeking detailed proposals to enhance trade.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had issued directives for devising short- and medium-term strategies to operationalise Gwadar Port effectively within six months. He emphasised the importance of comparing Gwadar’s trade costs with other regional ports.</p><small>2025-07-18 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18125549f61a25a.png?r=125622' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924988/germany-deports-81-afghans-convicted-of-crimes' target='_blank'><strong>Germany deports 81 Afghans convicted of crimes</strong></a><br><p>Germany said on Friday it had deported 81 Afghan men convicted of crimes to their Taliban-controlled homeland, as Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s government looks to signal a hard line on immigration.
The interior ministry said a plane carrying the men took off Friday morning bound for Afghanistan, adding that all the deportees were under expulsion orders and were convicted by the criminal justice system.
The government of Europe’s top economy was forging ahead with a “policy change”, said Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who was hosting several European counterparts for a migration meeting.
“Deportations to Afghanistan must continue to be carried out safely in the future. There is no right of residence for serious criminals in our country.”
Berlin has had only indirect contact with the Taliban authorities through third parties with Friday’s operation executed with the help of Qatar, said the German interior ministry.
Germany had stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.
But expulsions resumed last year for the first time since the Taliban came to power, when the previous government of Social Democrat chancellor Olaf Scholz expelled a group of 28 Afghans convicted of crimes.
Rights concerns
Human rights group Amnesty International strongly criticised the renewed deportations to Afghanistan saying the situation in the country was “catastrophic”.
“Extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, and torture are commonplace,” the group said in a statement.
At the beginning of the month, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, accusing them of crimes against humanity over the persecution of women and girls.
Merz told a press conference on Friday that Germany wants to be an “attractive country for immigration”, to attract the best talent and fill gaping labour shortages,
The previous government’s policies had however left local administrations with too large a burden to carry, Merz said.
His government had “initiated corrections” to put migration policy on the right course, he said, including tightening border controls and limiting family reunifications rights for some refugees.
Merz said that policing Germany’s borders with its neighbours was only a “temporary” solution and a durable solution was needed at the European level.
Migration summit
Dobrindt was meeting his French, Polish, Austrian, Danish and Czech counterparts, as well as European Commissioner for Home Affairs Magnus Brunner, in southern Germany on Friday.
The objective of the meeting is to “strengthen European migration policy,” Dobrindt told the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.
A debate over resuming expulsions has flared as migration has risen up the political agenda in tandem with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The AfD scored a historic election result of over 20 per cent in February — its highest score at a national level — leaving the party nipping on the heels of Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc.
The controversy over immigration was fuelled by a series of deady attacks last year where the suspects were asylum seekers — including several from Afghanistan.
Germany’s new government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), has promised to expel more foreign criminals alongside a crackdown on irregular migration.
As well as carrying out deportations to Afghanistan, Dobrindt has said he was in contact with authorities to enable deportations to Syria, which have been suspended since 2012.</p><small>2025-07-18 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/18141254f332e71.png?r=141718' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924997/iran-says-europeans-have-no-grounds-to-trigger-sanctions-snapback' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says Europeans have no grounds to trigger sanctions snapback</strong></a><br><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told his European counterparts on Friday that they have no grounds for reactivating UN sanctions after they threatened to do so in the coming months unless there is progress in nuclear talks.
“If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they (have) absolutely no moral (or) legal grounds,” Araghchi said on X.
 






He added that “any new round of talks is only possible when the other side is ready for a fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial nuclear deal.”
The remarks came after Araghchi held a conference call with his British, French and German counterparts and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
The European diplomats told Araghchi of “their determination to use the ‘snapback’ mechanism — which allows for the reimposition of all international sanctions against Iran — in the absence of concrete progress” towards a new deal on Iran’s nuclear programme “by the end of the summer”, the French foreign ministry said.
French officials have previously indicated that this means by the end of August.
Last month, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the Europeans would be “justified” in seeking a snapback of UN sanctions lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, later abandoned by US President Donald Trump.
“Without a firm, tangible, and verifiable commitment from Iran, we will do so no later than the end of August,” he told reporters.
Last week, Araghchi urged the Europeans to play “a constructive role” on the nuclear issue.
“The threat of sanctions does not help diplomacy,” Araghchi told French newspaper Le Monde.
There has been much speculation about the status of Iran’s nuclear programme since Israel and the United States bombed key facilities last month.
A clause in the 2015 agreement allows for UN sanctions on Iran to be reimposed through a snapback mechanism in the event of non-compliance.
But the deal expires in October, giving the parties to it a fast-approaching deadline to invoke the clause.
Iran and the United States held several rounds of nuclear negotiations through Omani mediators before Israel launched its 12-day war on June 13. Trump’s decision to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities effectively ended the talks.
Since the end of the hostilities, both Tehran and Washington have signalled willingness to return to the table, though Tehran has said it will not give up its right to the peaceful use of nuclear power.
An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in matter of state, said on Monday that there would be no new nuclear talks with the United States if they were conditioned on Iran renouncing uranium enrichment.</p><small>2025-07-18 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1811114145e58eb.png?r=111354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924970/lightning-strikes-kill-33-people-in-indias-bihar' target='_blank'><strong>Lightning strikes kill 33 people in India’s Bihar</strong></a><br><p>Lightning strikes during monsoon storms in eastern India this week killed at least 33 people and injured dozens, officials said on Friday.
The deaths in Bihar occurred during fierce storms between Wednesday and Thursday, a state disaster management department statement said, with the victims mostly farmers and labourers working in the open.
More heavy rain and lightning are forecast for parts of the state.
Bihar state’s disaster management minister, Vijay Kumar Mandal, told AFP that officials in vulnerable districts had been directed to “create awareness to take precautionary steps following an alert on lightning”.
The state government announced compensation of 4 million Indian rupees ($4,600) to the families of those killed by lightning.
India’s eastern region, including Bihar, is prone to annual floods that kill dozens and displace hundreds of thousands of people during the peak monsoon season.
South Asia’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
 
 

The region is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
In May, Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.
At least 34 people died over four days in early June in India’s northeastern region after heavy floods caused landslides. Another four lost their lives in Bangladesh.
At least 243 died by lightning in 2024 and 275 the year earlier, according to the state government.</p><small>2025-07-18 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1812064317179bf.jpg?r=120729' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924967/dumper-truck-kills-motorcyclist-in-karachis-saudabad-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dumper truck kills motorcyclist in Karachi’s Saudabad: police</strong></a><br><p>A 59-year-old milk supplier was killed when a dumper (loaded truck) ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad on Friday morning, police said.
