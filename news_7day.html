<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/201737264a8aa60.png?r=174005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912186/cabinet-approves-coas-gen-asim-munirs-promotion-to-field-marshal' target='_blank'><strong>Cabinet approves COAS Gen Asim Munir’s promotion to field marshal</strong></a><br><p>The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq.
The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — General Mohammad Ayub Khan —  by the presidential cabinet in 1959.
The statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) issued today also said that the government unanimously decided to continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.
Gen Munir, commissioned via the Officers Training School Mangla into the Frontier Force Regiment, was promoted to three-star rank in September 2018 and assumed charge two months later, with his four-year term ending on November 27. Munir served as Military Intelligence chief in 2017 and briefly as Inter Services Intelligence chief in 2018, before being replaced within eight months on then-premier Imran Khan’s insistence. He later commanded the Gujranwala Corps for two years before becoming the quartermaster general at the General Headquarters.
“The government of Pakistan has approved the promotion of General Syed Asim Munir (Nishan-i-Imtiaz Military) to the rank of field marshal for ensuring the security of the country and defeating the enemy based on the high strategy and courageous leadership during Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos,” the PMO said after a federal cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Retelling the events of the military conflict with India, the statement further said that COAS Munir led the army “with exemplary courage and determination and coordinated the war strategy and efforts of the armed forces in a comprehensive manner”.
 
 

It added: “Thanks to the unparalleled leadership of the army chief, Pakistan achieved a historic victory in Marka-i-Haq.
“In recognition of his outstanding military leadership, courage, and bravery, ensuring Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and courageous defence against the enemy, the cabinet approved the prime minister’s proposal to promote General Syed Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal.”
It was also decided that officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army, war veterans, martyrs and citizens belonging to various sectors would be awarded high government awards in recognition of their valuable services during the operation, the statement said.
 






The statement added that PM Shehbaz met President Asif Ali Zardari and took him into confidence regarding this decision.
“Under General Syed Asim Munir’s leadership, the armed forces have successfully defended the homeland,” Zardari was quoted as saying in a statement from the presidency.
He said the army chief deserved the promotion for effectively countering Indian aggression, successfully defending the homeland and employing excellent military strategy.
 






He also congratulated Sidhu on the extension of his tenure.
 






“Today, Pakistan salutes Field Marshal Asim Munir as well as our brave countrymen, soldiers, martyrs, and their families,” PM Shehbaz also said on X.
 






Accepting the honour, COAS Munir said he was grateful to God for receiving the position, dedicating it to the “entire nation, the armed forces of Pakistan, especially the civil and military martyrs and veterans”.
“I am grateful to the president of Pakistan, the prime minister and the cabinet for their trust,” he said in a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), adding that the honour was the trust of the nation, for which “millions of Asims have sacrificed themselves”.
“This is not an individual honour but an honour for the armed forces of Pakistan and the entire nation,” he said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank and expressed his best wishes for the army chief.
 






“General Syed Asim Munir has achieved this position through hard work, talent and professional skills,” the interior minister said, according to a post on the ministry’s X account.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks. Officials from both countries confirmed that the ceasefire does not have an expiry date, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed.

Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China welcomed the two countries “handling differences through dialogue” as he met Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in Beijing.
Wang called Pakistan an “ironclad friend” and vowed to deepen the “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” between the two countries, a readout from China’s foreign ministry said.
Likewise, Dar appreciated China for firmly supporting Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The Foreign Office said Dar met his Chinese counterpart for in-depth discussions during his visit to discuss regional stability.
“Both sides exchanged views on evolving situation in South Asia, future trajectory of Pakistan-China friendship and CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) 2.0.
“Hailing all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and ironclad friendship between Pakistan and China, both leaders expressed satisfaction at the commonality of views on all issues of mutual interest and expressed their firm resolve to continue bilateral cooperation for regional peace, development and stability,” the FO said.
 






Earlier, Dar met Minister of International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Liu Jianchao.
The FO said both leaders agreed to deepen linkages between the political parties of Pakistan and the CPC. Liu reiterated that as “all-weather strategic cooperative partner” and “ironclad friend”, China would continue to prioritise its relations with Pakistan.
 






Dar arrived in Beijing yesterday on a three-day official visit on the invitation of his Chinese counterpart amid regional tensions, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
The visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following the ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.
On May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down five Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.
Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.
Prior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Dar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.</p><small>2025-05-20 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20191204f82bfab.jpg?r=192229' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912191/eu-britain-go-ahead-with-new-russia-sanctions-without-waiting-for-trump' target='_blank'><strong>EU, Britain go ahead with new Russia sanctions without waiting for Trump</strong></a><br><p>The European Union and Britain announced new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday without waiting for the United States to join them, a day after President Donald Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin without winning a promise for a ceasefire in Ukraine.
London and Brussels said their new measures would zero in on Moscow’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers and financial companies that have helped it avoid the impact of other sanctions imposed over the war.
“Sanctions matter, and I am grateful to everyone who makes them more tangible for the perpetrators of the war,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram.
But the new measures were unveiled without an immediate announcement of corresponding steps from Washington, despite intense public lobbying from leaders of European countries for the Trump administration to join them.
“We have repeatedly made it clear that we expect one thing from Russia — an immediate ceasefire without preconditions,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on the sidelines of a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels.
As Russia had not accepted a ceasefire, “we will have to react,” he said. “We also expect our US allies not to tolerate this.”
Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks in more than three years on Friday at Trump’s behest, but failed to agree on a truce after Moscow presented conditions that a member of the Ukrainian delegation called “non-starters”.
Ukraine says it is ready for an immediate ceasefire proposed by Trump, while Russia says it wants talks first. The Europeans say this is proof that Putin, who started the war by invading his neighbour in 2022, is not prepared to end it.
“Putin is clearly playing for time, unfortunately, we have to say Putin is not really interested in peace,” Germany’s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said.
‘Ball in Kyiv’s court’
Reacting to the new sanctions, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters that Russia would never bow to what she called ultimatums.
Putin, after his call with Trump, said that Moscow was ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum about a future peace accord.
“Now, accordingly, the ball is in Kyiv’s court,” Zakharova said.
Europeans have been working hard in public to persuade the Trump administration to join them in imposing sanctions.
The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland jointly travelled to Kyiv earlier this month and were filmed speaking to Trump on speakerphone with Zelensky.
Several European leaders phoned Trump again on the eve of Monday’s call with Putin, urging him to join them in imposing new sanctions if Russia rejected a ceasefire.
Brussels and London both suggested that more sanctions could still follow, making clear they have not given up hope of persuading Washington to act.
“Let us push Vladimir Putin to put an end to his imperialist fantasy,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said.
Britain’s Foreign Minister David Lammy said, “Delaying peace efforts will only redouble our resolve to help Ukraine to defend itself and use our sanctions to restrict Putin’s war machine.”
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said more sanctions were “in the works”.
But she made clear that action was needed from the United States.
“We all agreed and said […] that if they don’t agree to unconditional ceasefire, like Ukraine has agreed over 60 days ago, there will be strong action,” Kallas said.
“And that is what we want to see from all the parties who have said that they will act in accordance.”
The latest sanctions are aimed mainly at cracking down on a shipping fleet that Russia uses to export oil, circumventing a $60 a barrel price cap imposed by the G7 group of industrialised countries to limit Russia’s income.
Britain and the EU said they would also work to lower the cap, which imposes far less of a discount on Russian oil now that global prices have fallen this year.
Trump said on Monday that Russia and Ukraine were ready to start negotiations. Putin said the process would take time.</p><small>2025-05-20 14:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20191451f37d339.jpg?r=191534' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912155/sc-upholds-zahir-jaffers-death-sentence-in-noor-mukadam-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>SC upholds Zahir Jaffer’s death sentence in Noor Mukadam murder case</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer for the gruesome murder of Noor Mukadam nearly four years ago that had shaken the nation.
After the ruling by the top court, a presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had already been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).

A three-member bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, presided today over the third hearing of Zahir’s appeal against his death sentence.
The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence . The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.
The 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was reduced to one year. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs100,000 in February 2022.
The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.
The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their 10-year sentences were also taken up by the SC.
The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient.
“Therefore, by virtue of that, both will be released,” said Advocate Shah Khawar, the lawyer for Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam.

Zahir’s counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, concluded his arguments today, while Khawar also presented his.
A short order on today’s hearing is yet to be issued. It is expected to detail the court’s decision on an appeal by Shaukat against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer.
During the course of the trial, judges made demeaning comments about Noor for spending time alone with Jaffer, with Justice Kakar on Tuesday adding that it was “against our values”, according to AFP.
Farzana Bari, a women’s rights activist who attended the hearing, said the comments imply “that the man has some legitimate right to detain her, which is a harmful and regressive notion”.
“Such judicial attitudes contribute to a long and exhausting struggle for justice, often leading victims to lose hope and give up along the way,” she told the outlet.
Meanwhile, Shafaq Zaidi, a childhood friend of Noor, told AFP outside the court: “This is a victory for all the women of Pakistan. It shows that our justice system can deliver justice and should give women more confidence in the legal process
“This was our last resort, and it’s hard to put into words what this outcome means to us.”
Human rights defender, Tahira Abdullah, in a statement, said: “It is a milestone achievement in Pakistani women’s ongoing struggle for justice — and also against entrenched patriarchy, sexism and misogyny, openly expressed in court by the defence legal team today as well.”
During the previous hearing, the accused’s lawyer contended that no medical board was formed to assess his client’s mental state. Justice Kakar had observed, “A daughter was mercilessly murdered.”
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Zahir’s counsel contended that any evidence against his client “must be beyond doubt”, arguing that the court could not “go beyond the footage presented in the court”.
He said the prosecution presented the footage on a USB at the IHC, but it could not be played.
At this point, a lawyer for the two co-accused presented his arguments briefly. He detailed their sentences, recalling that the watchman and gardener were accused of “stopping the victim from fleeing”.
Justice Najafi observed, “If the suspects had not stopped the victim, then the situation would have been different.”
 
 

The lawyer asserted that the two co-accused had “no crime other than being present in the house” at the time of the murder.
“What was the need to work more than [what] the salary [is paid for]?” Justice Kakar remarked.
When the hearing resumed in the afternoon after a break, the counsel of Noor’s father presented his stance.
In his arguments, Khawar asserted that all evidence against the accused was part of the case record. “Noor Mukadam was kept in abduction for 40 hours.”
To this, Justice Kakar inquired, “How can you prove it was an abduction? It could be termed unjust confinement.”
Upon Justice Ibrahim asking the counsel to detail the DNA reports, Khawar said the assessments proved the charges. “Blood samples were taken, and the report of the dagger also came positive,” he said.
Shaukat’s lawyer then opposed Zahir’s appeal and concluded his arguments.
 
 

Here, the state lawyer came to the rostrum and said, “There should be no forgiveness for this heinous crime. This case should be made exemplary.
“The state views this crime very seriously. This is a very sad tragedy and the state wants such criminals to be punished as per law.”
Subsequently, the bench annoucned it decision, dismissing Zahir’s appeal and reducing the sentences of his two household staff to what they have served so far.
Case history
Noor was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. An FIR was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
 
 

In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing Zahir’s appeal, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
Brutal murder
After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021, over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father but were later acquitted.
In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad.
They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR.
 
 

The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said.
At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered.
Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR.
Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter.
Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder.

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir was handed the death sentence by a trial court, which he had challenged in the Islamabad High Court in 2023. The IHC too had upheld the sentence.
Subsequently, he approached the top court. The appeal was taken up for hearing by a three-member bench comprising Justices Hashim Kakar, Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi.
Here’s what lawyers had to say about today’s verdict.
‘Rare victory for women’
Lawyer Zainab Shahid said Zahir’s death sentence brought a sense of justice and closure to the gruesome episode of violence.
“It marks a departure from high-profile cases of violent crime in the past where perpetrators were acquitted by the highest appellate forum due to errors or failures by law enforcement agencies and state prosecutors in the investigative, evidentiary and trial stages of the case,” she said.
This sentence, Zainab continued, also served as a reminder that members of society otherwise considered too privileged could still be held accountable to the law, despite the avenues for coerced pardons created by the diyat laws.
“This verdict is a rare victory for the women of Pakistan and the protection of their lives against gender-based violence,” the lawyer added.
‘Justice has prevailed’
“Against all odds, and in a broken criminal justice system, justice has prevailed,” said Barrister Rida Hosain. However, she noted that the case underscored the need for gender sensitisation training of superior court judges.
“During the course of the hearing, Justice Hashim Kakar is reported to have made various insensitive remarks that reflect a deeply patriarchal mindset. It is not for judges to give lectures on morality. Nor is it for judges to pass adverse comments regarding a victim’s character and decision-making. It is not the victim who is on trial,” she noted.
The lawyer referred to Justice Kakar’s comments during today’s hearing, wherein he expressed displeasure over reports that Noor and Zahir were living together. “This happens in Europe, not here,” he said, adding that a man and woman living together out of wedlock was “unfortunate” and “against religion and morals”.
“Noor Mukadam came to [Zahir’s] house herself, would that not reduce the punishment for abduction?” he wondered.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Hosain regretted that “archaic and dangerous ideals of the ‘perfect’ victim still dominate our response” to cases of violence against women. “It is hoped that our justice system reaches a stage where we can break away and confront these dangerous stereotypes,” she added.
‘A credit to Noor’s family’
Barrister Asad Rahim Khan termed the order a “rare accomplishment”.
“It’s not common that rich, violent psychopaths are brought to justice by the court of last resort here. It is a credit to Noor’s family that they weren’t coerced by blood pardons, by the prosecutors who marshalled all the evidence, and by civil society that continued centring the senseless brutality of this murder.
“But for justice to be truly delivered to Noor’s loved ones, the sentence must be carried out,” he said.
‘SC judgment must be a harbinger for reforms’
Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig termed the SC order unexceptionable, given that there were “no legal lacunae” in the IHC judgment — wherein it had earlier upheld Zahir’s sentences.
“We need to understand that while the SC was hearing the appeals, it could not have reappraised the evidence but could have only considered if the trial court had misread the evidence or if it had misapplied the law in the case,” he noted.
“Given that this case has already gone through one round of appeal, I believe that the SC’s decision is unexceptionable. It reinforces the belief that there is no place for crime against women in society. Nonetheless, let us also bear in mind that the trial in the case and convictions awarded were partly because of the pressure mounted by civil society and the media,” Baig highlighted.
He added that there were a “number of Noor Mukadams across the country” who continued to be subjected to violence in all its forms and manifestations.
“So it is important for us to address structural issues that allow violence against women. This judgment must be a harbinger for much-needed reforms and changes in our criminal investigation and prosecution system. Otherwise, we continue to hear and read about cases like this,” the lawyer added.</p><small>2025-05-20 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20164611c2da42d.jpg?r=164733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912182/3-injured-in-finnish-school-stabbing-suspect-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>3 injured in Finnish school stabbing, suspect arrested</strong></a><br><p>Three students were stabbed at a primary and middle school in Pirkkala in southwestern Finland on Tuesday, and the suspect, a student at the school, was arrested shortly afterwards, police said.
The three wounded did not sustain life-threatening injuries, police spokeswoman Nina Juurakko told AFP, adding that police “were investigating” media reports that the suspect had targeted girls in the attack.
The Vahajarvi school has around 1,250 students aged six to 15, but the ages of those injured were not known immediately.
 
 

“The suspect in the act of violence is a student of the Vahajarvi school,” police said in a statement, adding that they were alerted to the attack at 10:42am.
Finnish public broadcaster YLE said the suspect was believed to have “published a manifesto in which he describes the reasons for his act and the instrument he used”.
The broadcaster said it had seen the manifesto but “has not been able to verify” that it was written by the suspect.
YLE images showed several emergency vehicles parked outside the school, which was cordoned off while students remained locked inside as a precaution, it said.</p><small>2025-05-20 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20165936d72e6b2.jpg?r=170009' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912175/talks-with-locals-underway-as-sit-in-against-alleged-strike-continues-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Talks with locals underway as sit-in against alleged strike continues in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>As a sit-in against the deaths of four children in suspected quadcopter munitions drop continued for a second day in the Mir Ali tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, police said talks with local elders on the matter were underway.
The suspected strike took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman, according to sources. Both security forces and the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) are known to have been using quadcopters.
North Waziristan District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed to Dawn.com that “negotiations are ongoing and results are awaited”.
Before the talks began, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar said: “The representative jirga (council of elders) has just arrived, and we will devise a plan together before proceeding with negotiations with them.”
Bahadar said he was leading a team in negotiating with the jirga members.
While local authorities were investigating the incident, there has been no official statement from the federal government on the matter. KP Relief Minister Haji Nek Muhammad Dawar had strongly condemned the strike and pledged to bring those responsible to justice.
Locals had staged a sit-in at the tehsil’s centre with the bodies, which continued today.
Allama Iqbal Dawar, a protest organiser and a local PTI leader, told Dawn.com that the locals have not buried the bodies as protesters want the authorities to verify the dead.
“We have not buried the four children and are demanding that the security officials come and see the bodies [to decide] whether they are terrorists.”
The PTI leader said there was a break in the sit-in until 3pm due to the severe heat. “Bodies are in vehicles and their air conditioners are on,” he said.
Dawar further said that residents had held a series of meetings with officials after previous such incidents, in which there were civilian casualties.
 
 

“But civilian casualties have not yet been stopped and another attack was conducted on Monday morning. People are now frustrated and insist that drone strikes on civilians must stop.
“We are protesting to get assurance but the authorities are not coming to talk to us,” he said, prior to the confirmation of the talks.
Dawar claimed that drones do not reach their targets to hit militants, but usually fall on the population. He stressed that locals also opposed the imposition of curfew and have discussed the issue with security officials.
In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.
An alleged drone attack in the Konrai Raghzai area of Upper South Waziristan district killed one person and injured three others in September last year. While the local sources confirmed the drone attack, there was no official confirmation of the drone strike.
Separately, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed alarm over the incident in a post on X.
The organisation said, “While the source of the strike remains unclear, the reportedly continued use of drones in civilian areas is deeply concerning and constitutes a grave violation of human rights, including the fundamental right to life.”
“HRCP supports the local community’s demand for an independent investigation into the incident.”
 






On Monday, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also addressed the incident in the National Assembly in the form of “positive advice” for the government.
He said the rulers and the establishment needed to think about giving strength, reassurance and confidence to the nation. “If today still drones fall in Waziristan […] how will we respond to the people?

“We don’t think it will lead to any outcome. We don’t know what will happen,” said Khamenei during a speech, adding that denying Iran’s right to enrich uranium was “a big mistake”.
Iran and the US have held four rounds of Omani-mediated nuclear talks since April 12, the highest-level contact between the two foes since Washington abandoned the 2015 nuclear accord.
The two sides had confirmed plans to hold another round of discussions during the latest meeting on May 11, which Tehran described as “difficult but useful”, while a US official said Washington was “encouraged”.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal but below the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the US, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
Iran has repeatedly insisted its right to maintain uranium enrichment was “non-negotiable”, while chief US negotiator Steve Witkoff has called it a “red line”.
On Sunday, Witkoff reiterated that the United States “cannot allow even one per cent of an enrichment capability”.
“If the US is interested in ensuring that Iran will not have nuclear weapons, a deal is within reach, and we are ready for a serious conversation to achieve a solution that will forever ensure that outcome,” said Iran’s Foreign Minister and lead negotiator Abbas Araghchi.
“Enrichment in Iran, however, will continue with or without a deal,” he said in a post on X.
 






‘Maximum pressure’
Iranian diplomats have said Tehran would be open to temporary restrictions on how much uranium it enriches and to what level.
Since returning to office in January, US President Donald Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” approach against Iran.
While backing nuclear diplomacy, he also warned of potential military action if it fails.
In recent days, Trump issued a warning that “something bad is going to happen “unless the Iranians “move quickly” towards a deal.
He earlier said that the United States was “getting close” to a deal with Iran that would avert military action.
Iranian officials, however, criticised what they described as “contradictory” positions by US officials along with the continued imposition of sanctions targeting Iran’s oil industry and nuclear programme despite the talks.
On Sunday, Araghchi said Tehran has been observing “dissonance … between what our US interlocutors say in public and in private. “</p><small>2025-05-20 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2012253643abcd5.png?r=122549' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912162/fo-rejects-indian-claim-of-pakistan-targeting-sikh-holy-site-golden-temple-in-amritsar' target='_blank'><strong>FO rejects Indian claim of Pakistan targeting Sikh holy site Golden Temple in Amritsar</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Tuesday rejected the claim made by India that Pakistan had attempted to attack the Golden Temple in Amritsar — one of the holiest sites in Sikhism — during the recent tensions with the neighbouring country.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
A day earlier, the Indian army claimed that Pakistan had attempted to target the Golden Temple and the attacks were “successfully thwarted”, The Hindu reported.
The management of the temple was allowed to deploy guns to “counter potential drone and missile threats from Pakistan”, a senior army official told ANI. He was quoted as saying, “Fortunately, we visualised what they [Pakistan] were capable of doing … They were more interested in creating confusion, chaos internally, and hence, we visualised that they would target our civil population and our religious places of worship.”
In a statement today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “We categorically reject the allegations that Pakistan attempted to target the Golden Temple, the most revered place in the Sikh faith.
“We hold all places of worship in the highest esteem and cannot think of targeting a holy site like the Golden Temple.”
He said that India had targeted different places of worship in Pakistan on May 6-7, adding that the allegations “cannot shift attention from this unacceptable act”.
The statement further said, “Pakistan is the proud custodian of many holy sites of the Sikh faith. Every year, it welcomes thousands of Sikh pilgrims from across the world.” He highlighted that the country provides visa-free access to the Gurdwara Sahib Kartarpur through the Kartarpur Corridor.
“In that backdrop, any claim concerning Pakistan’s attempt to target the Golden Temple is absolutely baseless and incorrect,” it added.
On Monday, the FO spokesperson dismissed reports of the Indian media claiming that Pakistan had used nuclear-capable Shaheen missiles. He said that the Indian army deleted the “misleading video” after realising that the claim was “unsubstantiated”.
“These fabricated stories align with New Delhi’s ongoing efforts to promote a misleading narrative regarding the ceasefire and baseless allegations of so-called ‘nuclear blackmail’ by Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-05-20 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2012444044538ff.jpg?r=124742' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912165/punjab-announces-much-needed-summer-vacation-for-schools-from-may-28' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab announces much-needed summer vacation for schools from May 28</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Minister for Education Rana Sikandar Hayat has announced summer vacation for all schools across the province from May 28 amid an intense heatwave.
In a statement issued by the education ministry, Hayat also announced revised school timings due to the rising temperatures. The new school timings will be observed from 7:30am to 11:30am effective from May 21 (tomorrow) until the start of the summer vacations.
The Punjab government has decided to give the summer vacation just a few days earlier than the scheduled date of June 1 due to the extreme heatwave prevalent in the province like elsewhere in the country.
The minister earlier said that consultations are underway regarding the announcement of the summer vacation and the decision will be made in a few days. He said efforts are being made to overcome the academic losses due to the closure of schools while ensuring the safety and well-being of students.
Hayat said safety instructions have been issued by the concerned departments amid the severity of the heatwave, adding that students can protect themselves from the effects of the blistering weather by following the guidelines.
Last month, schools across Punjab were advised to alter working hours or declare early summer holidays if excessive heat persists.
The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued urgent directives to educational institutions and district administrations across the province in view of heatwave threat. The institutions were advised to take immediate measures to protect students and staff from extreme heat.
The advisory included schools altering working hours or declaring early summer holidays if excessive heat persists, immediately suspending all outdoor sports and activities, ensuring uninterrupted availability of clean, cold drinking water and maintain functional ventilation, fans, and cooling systems at schools and students wearing loose, light-colour clothing.
A letter in this regard was sent by PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia to school education and higher education departments.
Another heatwave to grip country
The Met Department has issued an advisory for another heatwave from May 20 to May 24. The forecast for a heatwave comes on the back of a similar advisory issued on May 15.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), high pressure is likely to persist in the upper atmosphere during the ongoing week, with day temperatures soaring to four to seven degrees Celsius.
“A shallow trough of westerly wave is affecting upper parts of the country,” the advisory stated, adding that the weather system is likely to persist during the next four days.
Day temperatures are likely to remain 4 to 6°C above normal in Sindh, southern Punjab and Balochistan during the forecast period. In central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, the temperatures are likely to remain 5-7°C above normal.</p><small>2025-05-20 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/20113323c162da2.gif?r=113603' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912106/govt-fails-to-sell-three-inefficient-power-plants' target='_blank'><strong>Govt fails to sell three inefficient power plants</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government got an apathetic response to its auction for three inefficient power plants, compelling it to go for a second round of bidding by the end of this month.
Only a single bidder — Siddiqsons from Karachi — came up with a bid for Jamshoro Power Company Ltd (JPCL). Two other plants — Muzaffargarh and Faisalabad — did not fetch even a single offer. The government set a combined reserve price of Rs26.625 billion for the three plants with 2,362MW of cumulative generation capacity.
The auction was called through a ‘single-stage two envelop’ bid to ensure transparency, said the Ministry of Energy (Power Division), adding the bidding date was set for May 19. “Only one company, Siddiqsons, submitted a bid for JPCL. No company submitted any bid for Muzaffargarh and Faisalabad Power plants”, the Power Division said. The date for opening bids has been extended till May 30, it said in a statement.
The government held open bidding for the disposal of three old and defunct power plants on an “as-is, where-is” basis. These include 880MW Jamshoro Thermal Power Ltd, 1,350MW Northern Power Generation Comp­any Ltd-Muzaffargarh, and 132MW Central Power Generation Com­pany Ltd-Faisalabad Steam Power Station.

Jamshoro gets sole bid; Muzaffargarh and Faisalabad receive none

The Power Division said 29 power plants with a generation capacity of  4,074MW have been selec­ted for auction at a reserve price of Rs40.461bn. These inclu­de blocks and units from Jamshoro, Gud­­du, Muzaffargarh, Quetta and Faisalabad.
 
 

The bidding process for other plants of Genco-II, including the Guddu Thermal Power Plant and TPS Quetta, has been postponed. These assets will now be offered on May 30 in a separate round to ensure greater investor participation with improved terms of sale.
Chief executive officer of NPGCL Sabih-uz-Zaman Farooqi confirmed a lacklustre response from investors, adding that the auction of redundant and outdated power assets was always expected to proceed in phases due to the age and condition of the plants.
The process is technically complex, and investor appetite varies depending on plant location, efficiency, and future viability, he added.
Previously, the government sold seven thermal plants for Rs9.05bn — almost a billion rupee higher than the reserve price of Rs8.07bn. Three units were located at Kotri, Larkra, and Suk­kur, and four in Multan and Faisalabad.
“We will assess why there are no bids for Mu­­zaffargarh and Faisal­abad,” Mr Farooqi said.
Before bidding, prospective bidders had raised concerns regarding the applicability of income and sales taxes and the exemption of sales tax on metal scrap under prevailing tax laws.
However, NPGCL clarified that the assets were being auctioned on “as-is, where-is” basis and do not fall under the category of scrap.
Therefore, sales tax will be applied at the standard rate of 18pc for registered firms, with an additional 4pc for unregistered firms.
Also, 10pc advance income tax applies to bidders with active taxpayer status and 20pc for non-active taxpayers.
Bidders also requested a reduction in the performance security requirement from 10pc to 5pc of the total contract price. However, the NPGCL management insisted that bidders must adhere to the provisions outlined in the issued bidding documents.
The bidders also sought various other relaxations, including disclosure of item-wise reserve price, which was unacceptable to the auction team.

For generations, her family relied on Badin’s salty waters for fishing, but seawater intrusion turned freshwater ponds brackish and fertile lands barren.
This change, steady but not slow, left Fareeha in dire financial straits, forcing her husband and sons to work at brick kilns. But this wasn’t a permanent solution, she says. “The sea took our nets, then our dignity … we were eventually forced to move out.”
Fareeha’s plight resonates with almost 80 per cent of other fishing families in Badin, where, without compensation or adaptation, climate poverty has pushed hundreds into a chaotic storm of displacement.
While climate change is a global issue, its impacts, unfortunately, are spread disproportionately across the world. Despite having minimal contributions towards global greenhouse gas emissions, low-income countries tend to be extremely vulnerable to the disastrous effects of the crisis. Moreover, the increased frequency of extreme weather events, lack of resources and infrastructure, and limited access to climate finance make developing nations less resilient and more prone to climate poverty.
Pakistan is among these nations, having been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025. The floods that submerged over a third of the country three years ago affected more than 33 million people, resulting in the loss of 1,700 lives and $30 billion.
 
 

At the same time, droughts in Sindh and Balochistan in recent years have made water increasingly scarce, leading to parched crops and rising food prices, highlighting Pakistan’s severe vulnerability to disasters driven by climate change.
At the same time, climate change also deepens pre-existing inequalities, with marginalised communities facing a greater burden. Their vulnerabilities increase due to a myriad of socio-economic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and low income, which traps communities into a vicious web of climate poverty — when the conditions stemming from climate change destroy livelihoods, increase food and water scarcity, and displace communities.
According to the World Bank Group’s Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) for Pakistan, “the combined risks of extreme climate-related events, environmental degradation, and air pollution are projected to reduce Pakistan’s GDP [gross domestic product] by at least 18pc to 20pc by 2050.” This will significantly slow down economic progress and hinder efforts towards poverty reduction.
Engineered, not accidental
In Pakistan, 40 per cent of the population is highly vulnerable and frequently exposed to climate-induced disasters, including floods, cyclones, droughts, heavy rain spells, and extreme heatwaves. Marginalised urban residents, indigenous rural communities, small-scale farmers, and fisherfolk are among those at high risk.
A research report by Oxfam studying Pakistan’s rural disaster-prone communities in Badin (Sindh), Rajanpur (Punjab), and Khuzdar (Balochistan) found that they bore the brunt of climate-induced displacement, food insecurity and economic instability. In Badin, seawater intrusion has degraded freshwater resources, reducing fish and prawn catches and leaving many fisherfolk struggling to sustain their livelihoods. The increased frequency of cyclones and storms has further displaced coastal populations, many of whom lack the resources to adapt or migrate.
In Rajanpur, erratic rainfall patterns and intense flooding have destroyed agricultural lands, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to predict sowing and harvesting cycles. Meanwhile, prolonged droughts have rapidly depleted groundwater levels in Khuzdar, shrinking grazing lands and threatening livestock-dependent livelihoods. Across these regions, traditional methods are proving insufficient, pushing many families into seasonal migration in search of alternative sources of income.
 
 

In Pakistan’s urban centres, the poor are often pushed to the margins, forced to live in overcrowded, unsafe housing that not only endangers their lives but also intensifies the impact of climate-induced disasters. Take the port city Karachi as an example; prolonged power outages lasting between 10 to 16 hours severely impact low-income areas such as Shah Faisal Colony, Lyari, Bhit, and Baba Island.
These disruptions affect daily wage earners the most, making it increasingly difficult for them to sustain their livelihoods. Beyond economic strain, the lack of electricity poses serious health risks, particularly for the elderly, children, and pregnant women. With growing climate-related health issues, financial burdens worsen, trapping many in a relentless cycle of poverty.
In 2021, around 15,000 families living along the Gujjar and Orangi nullahs were displaced without rehabilitation in the name of flood mitigation and anti-encroachment campaigns. Government agencies seem to have not just failed in solving the housing crisis in the metropolis but also in implementing resettlement policies.
The authorities use the Supreme Court’s 2021 order of demolition while displacing people, but forget that the apex court had also issued directions for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the victims. To top it, the government displays impeccable punctuality and pace when it comes to demolition, while delaying tactics are used in relocation and resolution, keeping hundreds of families in limbo for years.
The impacts of climate change are also deeply intertwined with corporate accountability, such as the illegal development of Karachi’s waterfront, or Emaar’s $3 billion Bundal Island project, which blocks natural drainage and worsens urban flooding in nearby low-income communities.
This is why slum dwellers say, “As soon as the builders get permits, we (the poor and the vulnerable) get evicted.” Meanwhile, dozens of textile factories along Karachi’s Lyari River dump untreated sewage, making monsoon rains toxic, but that doesn’t even cross the ears of officials at Sindh’s Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). It’s right to say that climate vulnerability is not accidental. In cities like Karachi, they are engineered.
Where resilience becomes resistance
Meanwhile, statistics issued by the Pakistan Disaster Management Authority show that around $50 million in the World Bank’s flood resilience funds are tied up in bureaucratic delays. It is evident; when institutions fail, the poor drown twice — first in floodwaters and then again in departmental negligence.
The disproportionate cost of climate change is not limited to class but also seeps into gender, where women and girls face a higher risk and challenge. The United Nations concurs, highlighting in various reports how women make up 80pc of those displaced by climate change. In Pakistan, it is the women in rural areas who are the most vulnerable.
 
 

According to a 2021 study on vulnerable communities in Sindh, declining agricultural productivity and men travelling in search of work have left women with the dual burden of managing domestic and financial responsibilities, worsening their vulnerability to food scarcity, malnutrition, and health complications.
The situation is no different in Balochistan. “Our men have migrated; we (the women) have stayed to fight for the land,” said Rozina, 51. She leads a women’s collective for drought-resistant millet cultivation in Khuzdar. Her efforts are at odds with a system that denies women land title and ownership.
“And it is this land that we (women) are protecting,” Rozina stressed.
For Pakistan’s transgender community, the situation is even worse. Facing immense stigma and marginalisation, they are disowned by their families, limiting their access to education, employment, and proper housing. As a result, they are forced to live in informal settlements or slums, which are particularly susceptible to climate-induced disasters such as floods and extreme heat waves.
Moreover, due to systemic discrimination and exclusion, many are unable to access government relief post-disasters, as highlighted in the devastating floods of 2022, with a majority of those affected unable to access relief programs due to the lack of official identification documents. According to an NGO working for transgenders, 95pc of flood victims were denied assistance, discriminated against or excluded by design.
Here, resilience is resistance.
The path to recovery
But is there a way out of this toxic and repetitive cycle? Yes.
A working paper titled ‘The 24-Hour Risk City: A Framework for Thinking About Building Infrastructures of Climate Repair in Nairobi and Karachi’ introduces the concept of climate repair, describing it as a practice of maintenance and repair that focuses on both human and environmental well-being in the face of climate risks. It is framed as an ethic of care, emphasising the importance of continuous and deliberate efforts to sustain and restore urban and ecological systems.
Climate repair involves three different dimensions: bodily and familial, infrastructural, and connective-communal repair, particularly in low-income settlements where inadequate infrastructures and governance failures leave communities more vulnerable.
 
 

The paper highlights that climate repair is a gendered practice, often carried out by women and marginalised communities who engage in everyday forms of care and adaptation to combat the effects of extreme weather events, urban flooding, and heatwaves, especially in the absence of governmental or institutional support.
Therefore, it underlines the need for a holistic approach in policymaking, including not only the improvement of physical infrastructure but also strengthening social networks and integrating local solutions to build resilience towards adverse climatic impacts.
Encompassing infrastructural resilience, socioeconomic empowerment, and participatory governance, the idea of climate repair recognises that the most vulnerable communities must be at the centre of climate action. This approach calls for bottom-up, participatory strategies that recognise and integrate the lived experiences of vulnerable communities, rather than relying solely on top-down policy interventions.
Policy reforms must prioritise climate justice, ensuring that climate adaptation and mitigation efforts do not further marginalise but pay special attention to women, the elderly, children and the transgender community — all of whom are at the forefront of vulnerability to climate poverty. Women, in particular, should be recognised as leaders in climate adaptation, as their roles in managing water, food security, and family resilience make them key agents of change.
The idea of climate repair can be extended to rural communities, exploring local practices and maintenance work being carried out by smallholder farmers and fisherfolk to adapt to climate change. Their elaborate efforts and often resource-efficient strategies can help guide effective policymaking and pro-poor, participatory government interventions.

Fewer trucks rumbled through the gateway than expected. The usual cacophony of haggling voices was muted, replaced by pockets of anxious murmuring.
In the absence of major players like the Punjab and federal governments, most people like Yusuf expected a glut of wheat in the market. Instead, the piles of golden grains were noticeably smaller, scattered like hesitant guests at a wedding. “Where has the crop gone?” Yusuf, who has come from a neighbouring district to buy wheat for his large family at a fairly lower rate, asks a commission agent (arhti) in a raspy voice. Shrugging his shoulders, he replies that local investors are to be blamed for sweeping away whatever grain came to the market.
Islamabad used to procure at least one million tonnes of grain from Hafizabad until the 2024 season. But this year, it along with all four provincial governments absented itself from the wheat market under a condition of an International Monetary Fund loan. There was a whisper in the air that the wheat market will crash to Rs1,800 per maund this season against Rs2,900 per maund in 2024 and Rs4,000 in 2023. But to Yusuf’s astonishment the rate was hovering around Rs2,550.
As the final grains are gathered from the fields, a surprising resilience has emerged in the wheat market, confounding earlier anxieties of a price crash. Instead, the market is experiencing a bullish surge, with per maund rates having already climbed by Rs350.
Analysts predict this upward trajectory will persist as the open market supply diminishes. This contrasts sharply with previous years when the governm­ent’s active role in procurement extended the season until the end of May, ensuring a steady market flow. This year, however, central and southern Punjab grain markets were notably bare by the close of April, the typical peak of the harvesting period, with no visible glut of wheat.

Many farmers stock produce in anticipation of higher rates

Prior to the harvest, the Punjab government pledged to support wheat growers by facilitating private sector procurement. This involved incentivising flour millers with interest-free bank loans, backed by a Rs100 billion mark-up subsidy. In return, the industry was mandated to maintain wheat stocks equivalent to at least 25 per cent of their milling capacity.
Despite these measures, the anticipated large-scale buying by millers has yet to materialise. Instead, commission agents and local investors appear to be the primary buyers. Intriguingly, many farmers are reportedly holding onto their produce, anticipating higher prices once the harvesting season concludes.
Farhan Shaukat, a farmer owning 10 acres in Sheikhupura, reveals that he, along with numerous other growers, proactively acquired polythene bags in March to store their wheat, foreseeing the price dip in the government’s absence from the market.
Where has the harvested wheat gone?
Mansha Warraich, President of the Anjuman Arhtiyan in Hafizabad’s grain market, highlights the significant shift from the pre-2024 scenario. Previously, the government absorbed approximately 60pc of the produce offered by the growers after meeting domestic needs, with 20-25pc taken by the flour industry, and the remainder entering the open market.
This season, the government has exited the market, the industry is yet to fully engage, leaving arhtis; and local investors as the dominant players, he explains. This influx of local investment, he notes, has already pushed grain rates up by Rs350, from Rs2,200 to Rs2,550 per 40kg.
However, Warraich cautions that growers cannot afford to hoard indefinitely and will soon need to sell their surplus wheat to repay loans incurred for farm inputs, essential for securing new credit for the upcoming sowing season.
Adding another layer to the situation, allegations of significant cross-border smuggling are surfacing. Rao Ajmal, a PML-N MNA, claims that at least 1.2 million tonnes of grain have been illicitly transported to Afghanistan, where it fetches a lucrative price of Rs6,800 per 40kg.
The tightrope walk of price stability
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has touted the current lower wheat prices as a victory, particularly for urban consumers with limited incomes. Ajasim from Gujranwala echoes this sentiment, praising the Punjab government for the availability of grain in the Rs2,300-2,500 per 40kg range this year, a stark contrast to last year’s prices exceeding Rs3,000 and over Rs5,000 by the end of season.
The critical question, however, is the sustainability of these prices beyond the harvesting season. If investors, often perceived as hoarders, are not incentivised to remain active in the market, how will the government ensure price stability in the long run? So far, the government has relied on its existing grain reserves to manage market dynamics. The strategy for maintaining control once these reserves are depleted remains to be seen.
Historical trends indicate a potential for over 20pc price inflation during the winter months as consumption rises and harvest-time stocks dwindle.
Looking towards future harvests
Having faced financial setbacks in the past two seasons, many farmers are reconsidering their cropping choices. The pressing concern is how to encourage the farming community to continue cultivating sufficient wheat to meet national demand. Mian Umair Masood, General Secretary of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad, representing small landholders, points out the stark economic realities.
He estimates the average per acre production cost this year at Rs65,000 (excluding land rent), with yields ranging from 32 to 40 maunds. At a rate of Rs2,000 per maund, a farmer’s maximum earnings would be a meagre Rs15,000 per acre. This return is negligible and deeply discouraging considering the six months of labour, weather uncertainties and market risks involved, he laments.
Amanullah Chattha, Vice-President of Kissan Board Pakistan, recalls the government’s abrupt withdrawal last year, citing excessive moisture, leaving growers hesitant to plant wheat this season. Despite initial encouragement from the chief minister’s promises of incentives, farmers feel abandoned once again. The only incentives announced are a Rs5,000 per acre subsidy for landowners with up to five acres and interest-free loans up to 70pc of the produce’s value (through e-warehouse receipt, EWR) if stored in designated facilities for up to four months, Chattha explains.
He emphasises that the implementation mechanism for this scheme is still unclear, while the wheat crop has already been harvested and either sold or stored by farmers.
Chattha concludes that most farmers will likely grow wheat out of necessity, but a significant shift towards other Rabi crops like sunflower and other oilseeds is anticipated in the next season, signaling a potential challenge for future wheat production.

According to informed banking sources, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has been in discussions with these banks to revive their loan portfolio with Pakistan, and the finalisation of the loan is expected to occur very soon.
In the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, the government received about $504m from foreign lenders (mostly UAE-based), showing a minor recovery from commercial banks that had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year.
The government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign banks for the current fiscal year, but the actual realisation has been sluggish in the first nine months.
The government had also targeted $1bn in international bonds for FY25. Another projection of $9bn inflows from bilateral partners — China and Saudi Arabia — was targeted for the current fiscal year. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn China’s SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.

Aurangzeb touts economic stability in talks with lenders

On Monday, the Ministry of Finance said it had held virtual meetings with three UAE banks — Sharjah Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, and Ajman Bank — regarding their support for Pakistan’s development and fiscal objectives. Mr Aurangzeb led these discussions and interacted with the Standard Chartered Bank team.
He thanked Standard Charte­red Bank and Dubai Islamic Bank for their leading role in organising these interactions with Sharjah Islamic Bank and Ajman Bank as potential partners. The loans of $350m would be backed by guarantees provided by the Asian Develop­ment Bank (ADB). The finance minister also appreciated ADB’s collaboration and support to the Ministry of Finance for supporting Pakist­an’s fiscal and development goals.
He updated the managements of UAE banks about Pakistan’s steady progress toward macroeconomic stability, saying the country had come a long way and was on track to close FY25 with current account and primary surpluses as the forex reserves approaching $14bn, providing three months of import cover. He said inflation had eased to 0.3pc, and the policy rate had also come down significantly, showing a positive economic outlook.
The minister also informed the foreign banks about the structural reforms that formed the basis of this recovery and said the government was firmly committed to long-term reforms, including restructuring of state-owned enterprises, an active privatisation programme, and rightsizing of the federal government. “We have broken away from the old boom and bust cycle. Difficult but necessary reforms back the current stability — and we are staying the course,” the minister said in a statement.
On the revenue side, the minister said Pakistan was set to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.6pc by June, with a target of 11pc for the next fiscal year. The government is prioritising Federal Board of Revenue reforms and end-to-end digitisation to broaden the tax base and improve compliance, he said, adding the ongoing progress was backed by the approval of disbursement of the second tranche under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and approval of $1.3bn under the new Resilience and Sustainability Fund (RSF).
“Pakistan has met all quantitative targets under the IMF programme and has also achieved key structural benchmarks, including the introduction of agricultural income tax — a milestone measure in the country’s fiscal history”, the finance minister said, adding the recent improvement in Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating by Fitch was a reflection of market confidence.
Looking ahead, the finance minister promised Pakistan’s shift towards a productivity and export-led growth model and pointed to robust growth in the IT sector, with exports reaching $3.4bn in March and momentum in the minerals and mining sector. He said the Reko Diq project stimulated interest in Pakistan’s mining potential, and the government aimed to leverage copper reserves for exports and energy transition.

To Karachi Kings’ horror, the holders went on to post a mammoth total before bundling Kings out cheaply as Shadab Khan led from the front, contributing both with the bat and the ball.
The all-rounder’s batting effort — 42 off 19 with the help of three fours and as many sixes — was a cameo in the bigger scheme of things, which saw Sahibzada Farhan and Alex Hales smash blistering half centuries to help United to 251-5.
But Shadab’s leg-spin accounted for four wickets at the expense of 45 runs, and that performance eventually defined the match, choking Kings batters through the middle of their chase as United won by 79 runs eventually.
The result saw United replace Kings in the second spot in the PSL standings as the tournament’s league stage ended, earning a spot in Wednesday’s qualifier against Quetta Gladiators. Kings, meanwhile, dropped down to third and will take on Lahore Qalandars in the eliminator on Thursday.
Kings had a decent powerplay as they gathered 62-1 during the field restrictions while also losing opener Tim Seifert (26 off 17, five fours) to a toe-crushing yorker by pacer Salman Irshad.
They lost incoming James Vince as the Englishman was deceived by Imad Wasim’s left-arm spin before Salman got Saad Baig as the right-hander, slicing one to Shadab.
Imad then returned to clean up Kings captain David Warner (43 off 28, four fours and two sixes) and Shadab caught Khushdil Shah off his own bowling and saw Mohammad Nabi hole him out to Haider Ali to deep midwicket to leave Kings reeling at 107-6 by the end of the 12th over.
Shadab returned in the 14th over to get Irfan Khan before the spinner castled Hasan Ali. With Karachi in a mess, Abbas Afridi cleared deep extra cover, cow corner and long-on off Shadab for three sixes in the 16th over to give his team hope.
But the right-hander departed when Salman’s slower one took an edge off his bat for wicket-keeper Ghazi Ghori to take an easy catch as proceedings virtually ended before Salman (3-28) got Aamer Jamal.
Earlier, Farhan and Hales fired as United were put into bat. Farhan smashed 73 off 41 — an innings laced with nine fours and three sixes — while Hales plundered the Kings bowlers for 88 off 35 with the help of six fours and eight sixes.
The pair had made the most of the flat track to help United cruise to 76-0 in the powerplay. Farhan brought up his half century in 28 balls by the eighth over, until which he had demonstrated class with eight fours and a six.
The right-hander went deep into his crease to power Hasan’s pace high and long over midwicket to help United cross the 100-run mark before Hales hit three sixes and a four in the 10th over off Aamer as his team posted 130 at halfway stage.
After Kings spinner Khushdil was smacked for 20 runs in the 11th over for United to reach 150, Farhan finally faltered, chipping Mir Hamza to Abbas at short fine-leg.
The dismissal got Kings back into the game with Aamer seeing Rassie van der Dussen hole him out to Warner on the boundary before miscommunication between the incoming Salman Ali Agha and Hales got the former run out.
However, captain Shadab’s arrival injected impetus into United’s effort yet again, the right-hander hit sixes off Hasan, Aamer and Khushdil before Hales was castled by the spinner.
But Shadab kept going on, finding two boundaries through the off-side off Khushdil as United crossed the 200-run mark in the 17th over. The fireworks relented after that but sixes by Haider Ali and Ben Dwarshuis, along with two more boundaries pushed United to a total which proved to be far more than enough.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill convicted the accused, Hannan Abdullah, after finding him guilty and sentenced him to two years and six months in prison. He also imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on the convict.
The convict, who was on bail, was taken into custody from the court after the announcement of the guilty verdict.
The judge handed over the custody of the convict to Kot Lakhpat Jail officials.

The corporation’s highest-paid presenter had been due to front coverage of the 2026 World Cup and next season’s FA Cup. But this Sunday’s Match of the Day, on the last day of the Premier League season, will be his final show.
“Gary Lineker will leave his presenting role following the conclusion of Match of the Day for the 2024/25 season,” the BBC said in a statement.
“He will not be part of the BBC’s coverage of the 2026 World Cup or next season’s FA Cup coverage.” Last week Lineker shared an Instagram story about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult. He removed the post and apologised unreservedly, saying he would  “never knowingly share anything antisemitic”.
In a fresh statement on Monday, Lineker restated that he did not know about the post’s antisemitic connotations.
“I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am,” he said.  “Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.”
He added:  “Football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember — both on the pitch and in the studio.
“I care deeply about the game, and about the work I’ve done with the BBC over many years. As I’ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic — it goes against everything I stand for.”

He said this during a visit to the headquarters of the Chinese automobile company Chery Holdings Group (CHG) in Wuhu, China. Sindh Energy Minister Nasir Shah also accompanied him.
According to a statement issued by the Sindh Information Department on Monday, the delegation was received by CHG chairman Yin Tongyue.
During the meeting, the company expressed its willingness to install EV charging infrastructure across Sindh.
 
 

Mr Memon said that the establishment of EV charging stations at regular intervals would benefit owners of electric motorcycles, cars and trucks.
He also mentioned that the innovation is coming to the transportation system of Sindh and their vision is to promote environmentally friendly EV vehicles.
He added that the initiative would also create employment opportunities at the local level. In addition, an assembly plant for EV mini-trucks is being set up in Karachi, he said.
Mr Shah said that Chinese investors had also assured their cooperation in solar energy projects, particularly in rural areas of the province. The ongoing solarisation of homes, he noted, would help alleviate the energy crisis while supporting the shift to renewable energy.

Misri’s statement comes despite US President Donald Trump taking credit multiple times for his administration’s role in the truce, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also thanked him for.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
During a meeting yesterday of the parliamentary committee on external affairs, led by Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, Misri claimed that the offer for a ceasefire came from Pakistan and that no other country was involved in the negotiations, Hindustan Times reported, citing a “senior lawmaker”.
 
 

Asked by parliamentarians about Trump’s statements that Washington had helped India and Pakistan “settle” the “problem”, the report quoted Misri as saying: “New Delhi had routine talks with the US but there was no mediation.”
According to the report, this was Misri’s first appearance before the 31-member parliamentary panel. The meeting went on for more than three hours as members asked the foreign secretary numerous questions.
India’s Press of Trust India, citing sources, also stated that Misri “reiterated the government’s stand that the decision to stop military actions was taken at a bilateral level”, indicating no third-party role.
During the parliamentary panel’s moot, Misri was questioned about why the Indian government was giving Trump the centre stage and not refuting the US president’s claims on mediating the ceasefire.
However, Misri “did not give any answer” to the questions, Hindustan Times reported, quoting the lawmaker, whose name it did not specify.
“Trump publicly claimed at least seven times that he facilitated the ceasefire. Why was India silent?” India Today quoted an unnamed member of the panel as asking.
 
 

Another asked him why India “allowed Trump to repeatedly seize the narrative”, referring to the US president’s statements on the truce.
“The sense the MPs got was that India neither involved the US in the discussions with Pakistan nor was India involved in the US’s decision to announce it,” India Today stated.
Times of India similarly reported that Misri reportedly said Trump made his remarks on the ceasefire on social media and not through any official channel, where India could have put its point across.
During the in-camera session, the foreign secretary also ruled out the “restoration of normalcy with Pakistan in [the] near future”.
No ‘nuclear signalling’ from Pakistan: Misri
Misri also said that the recent military confrontation with Pakistan was “entirely in the conventional domain and involved no ‘nuclear signalling’ from the other side”, the Hindustan Times added.
 
 

While Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned of an “all-out war” prior to the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said last week that a nuclear war was never an option for the government.
During the meeting, Misri was also “pressed about the number of Indian aircraft lost during the hostilities”, referring to six fighters downed by the Pakistan Air Force, India Today reported.
However, the foreign secretary declined to comment, citing national security concerns, the outlet added.

Dark finger-like slope streaks extending across the dusty Martian surface in a region called Arabia Terra are seen in this NASA satellite photograph released on May 19, 2025. — NASA/Handout via Reuters

WASHINGTON: Images taken of Mars from orbit dating back as far as the 1970s have captured curious dark streaks running down the sides of cliffs and crater walls that some scientists have construed as possible evidence of flows of liquid water, suggesting that the planet harbors environments suitable for living organisms.
A new study casts doubt on that interpretation. Examining about 500,000 of these sinewy features spotted in satellite images, the researchers concluded they were created probably through dry processes that left the superficial appearance of liquid flows, underscoring the view of Mars as a desert planet currently inhospitable to life — at least on its surface.
The data indicated that formation of these streaks is driven by the accumulation of fine-grain dust from the Martian atmosphere on sloped terrain that is then knocked down the slopes by triggers such as wind gusts, meteorite impacts and marsquakes.
“The tiny dust particles can create flow-like patterns without liquid. This phenomenon occurs because extremely fine dust can behave similarly to a liquid when disturbed — flowing, branching and creating finger-like patterns as it moves downslope,” said Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher in planetary sciences at Brown University and co-leader of the study published on Monday in the journal Nature Communications.
“It’s similar to how dry sand can flow like water when poured. But on Mars, the ultra-fine particles and low gravity enhance these fluid-like properties, creating features that might be mistaken for water flows when they’re actually just dry material in motion,” Valantinas added.

ALI Khan Mahmudabad

NEW DELHI: The arrest of Professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad on Sunday under charges that point to sedition and for hurting religious sentiments for his comments on operation Sindoor has been criticised by opposition parties who said the move shows how “fearful” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is of critique, The Wire said on Monday.
Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra said that if an eminent scholar like Mahmudabad can be arrested “on Mickey Mouse charges & jailed then it is only because of his name.”
Ms Moitra also re-shared Mahuma­dabad’s post and said that nothing in it “is remotely offensive, let alone seditious”.
Prof Ali Khan Mahmudabad has noted in his social media post that while rightwing Indians rejoiced at Col Sofiya Qureshi’s briefings about operation Sindoor, they were insensitive to the lynchings and bulldosing of homes of Muslims in India.

Says move shows how ‘fearful’ BJP is of criticism

The opposition also said that in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s India, “hate mongers” like Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah can roam free while those calling for peace are arrested.
“The arrest of Ashoka University professor, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, shows how fearful the BJP is of any opinion, disliked by them,” said Congress president Malliakrjun Kharge in a statement on Monday.
Mr Kharge pointed to the vicious trolling of Pahalgam terror attack victim Lieutenant Vinay Narwal’s wife Himanshi, who had called for peace and condemned the hate campaign against Muslims and Kashmiris.
In Madhya Pradesh, BJP leader and cabinet minister Kunwar Vijay Shah called Colonel Sofiya Qureshi (who had conducted press briefings during Operation Sindoor) “sister of terrorists”, Mr Kharge recalled, and said that Mahmudabad’s arrest “follows a chain reaction”.
“Instead of sacking their own Madhya Pradesh’s Deputy CM & Minister, who made disgusting statements against our valiant armed forces, BJP-RSS is hell-bent on casting a narrative that anybody who represents pluralism, questions the government or simply performs his professional duty in the service of the nation, is a threat to its existence,” said Mr Kharge.
On Sunday, two FIRs were lodged against Mr Mahmudabad, one on the complaint of a BJP office-bearer and the other on the complaint of the Haryana State Commission for Women, days after its chairperson had summoned the professor over his social media posts against warmongering following the operation Sindoor against Pakistan.
The police confirmed his arrest in a statement posted on X. Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha said on Sunday that “critiquing the government does not amount to critiquing the nation”. “Let us repeat a hundred times and if required keep doing it continuously that critiquing the government does not amount to critiquing the nation — and this is a crucial distinction in any healthy democracy or society. A government (however powerful it might appear!) is temporary and made up of elected or appointed officials whose duty is to serve the people,” he said.
“Critiquing government policies, decisions, or leaders is often an act of patriotism, motivated by the desire to improve the nation and uphold its values. Loving your country sometimes means holding its leaders to a higher standard — because the nation deserves better. Therefore, to ask questions to those in power is not to abandon the land we love, but to guard it more fiercely — for a nation’s soul lives not in silence, but in the courage to speak.”
Mahmudabad scion’s arrest comes as multi-party delegations will be sent by the union government to different countries to “project India’s national consensus and resolute appro­ach to combating terrorism in all forms and manifestations”.
All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Asaduddin Owaisi, who will be a part of these delegations, called Mahmudabad’s arrest “utterly condemnable” and said that it “violates legal process”.
“It targets an individual for his opinions; his post wasn’t anti-national or misogynistic. A mere complaint by a BJP worker made Haryana police take action,” he said.
In a statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Sunday also condemned Mr Mahmudabad’s arrest and pointed to Shah roaming free even as the Ashoka University professor was arrested.

Sources told Dawn that the drone strike took place in Hurmuz village during day time, leaving four children of the same family dead and five others, including a woman, injured.
The incident caused panic in the area. Locals shifted the injured to the Mir Ali hospital. Sources said some of the injured were in critical condition.
Both security forces and outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan are known to have been using quadcopters.
Area people, including tribal elders, youth and children later took to the streets after the incident and staged a sit-in at Mir Ali Chowk against the suspected quadcopter strikes. Some of them also carried placards inscribed with slogans against drone strikes.
In a statement posted on social media, KP Minister for Relief Naik Muhammad Dawar condemned the attack and said the blood of innocent children would not go in vain.
He said the attack was a crime against humanity and they would raise voice against it on every platform. He said they would also make all-out efforts to ensure that the culprits are brought to book.
The KP minister said that they stood with the affected family and would extend every kind of support to them.
While local authorities were investigating the incident, there was no official statement from the federal government on the matter.
On the other hand, local elders termed the casualties a failure on part of the government, as North Waziristan was being targeted again.
They demanded an independent commission to probe the attack.
They vowed to continue their sit-in till they were satisfied with the outcome of the investigations.

By exploiting fears of nuclear escalation, they suspect, India sought to redirect attention from its own aggressive actions during Operation Sindoor and reinforce its narrative of moral and strategic superiority. The Indian action, therefore, highlighted the dangerous intersection of disinformation and nuclear signalling in a volatile region.
The baseless narrative, the officials, who spoke on background, argued is part of India’s broader strategy to frame Pakistan as a reckless nuclear actor amid mounting international concern over South Asia’s security volatility.
“The claim that Pakistan employed Shaheen-class ballistic missiles during the recent crisis appears rooted in a broader Indian — and now Western — effort to frame Islamabad as having crossed a nuclear red line,” a senior official told Dawn.
 
 

A video published and later quietly deleted by the Indian Army’s Western Command showed visuals of a Shaheen ballistic missile, sparking intense media speculation. Despite no official confirmation from Delhi, the video fueled allegations that Pakistan had used a nuclear-capable missile, even though no evidence supported such a claim.
Pakistani officials, therefore, believe the Indian move was an act of information warfare aimed at influencing global perceptions.
“The timing of this false narrative says it all,” the senior official stated. “It coincided precisely with External Affairs Minister Jaishankar’s diplomatic outreach to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, and with the dispatch of seven multi-party delegations to key global capitals.”
The Indian intent appeared to craft a narrative of unity and resolve in the face of ‘terror threats,’ while stoking international fears about nuclear escalation.
“Its objective is twofold: first, to recast India as a restrained power responding to nuclear intimidation; second, to portray Pakistan as reckless and destabilising — a complete inversion of the actual crisis conduct,” the official added.
The Shaheen missile, a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads, is among Pakistan’s most potent deterrent assets. Any suggestion of its use in an active conflict would signal a dangerous escalation.
 
 

Adding to the confusion, Indian media pointed to the Sarsawa Air Base as one of the Pakistani targets. Located over 400 km from the border, Sarsawa lies outside the range of conventional artillery and rockets, which some Indian analysts claimed as “evidence” of a longer-range ballistic missile being used.
Sarsawa base is a critical facility in Indian strategic programme.
However, Pakistani officials clarified that no Shaheen-class systems were deployed during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
The Foreign Office, categorically denying the use of Shaheen missiles, called Indian media claims “baseless and provocative”.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has firmly rejected the unfounded allegations circulating in certain segments of the Indian media, which falsely claim that Pakistan employed the Shaheen missile during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos (BM).”
 
 

The FO statement emphasised that the operations, which targeted Indian military sites in response to India’s May 7 strikes on Pakistani and Azad Kashmir territory was conducted using precision-guided Fatah-I and Fatah-II missiles, long-range loitering drones, and advanced artillery.
The Fatah series, with ranges of up to 400 km, are non-nuclear, guided munitions designed for deep precision strikes consistent with the strikes reported on Indian installations.
“The recent conflict saw the effective use of conventional missile systems that met all strategic and tactical needs. Employing a strategic system like Shaheen — designed for existential-level threats — would have been unnecessary and doctrinally inconsistent,” the official, who spoke about the background, maintained ISPR described Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as a “textbook demonstration” of synchronised multi-domain warfare involving air, land, sea, and cyber forces.
The four-day conflict ended with a US-brokered ceasefire on May 10.
 
 

Experts view the false missile claim as a classic case of hybrid warfare which manipulated media and digital tools to seed doubt and provoke reactions. The FO noted the potential dangers of such tactics in a nuclearised region.
“Disseminating unverified and inflammatory content not only undermines regional stability but also reflects poorly on the professionalism of official institutions,” the FO said.

• Reiterates Pakistan will give strong response to India if truce violated; lauds Trump for taking up Kashmir dispute
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday visited Karachi to pay tribute to the Pakistan Navy, which successfully safeguarded the sea lines of communication and ensured absolute maritime sovereignty through a layered seaward defence.
During the visit to Pakistan Naval Dockyard, the PM was briefed by officials on the Pakistan Navy’s strategic orientation, operational undertakings, and contributions during the recent conflict.
He praised the navy for its preparedness and said it would have given a robust response to India if the neighbouring country had tried to attack Pakistan using its fleet.
In his address, the prime minister said India’s aircraft carrier Vikrant retreated after sensing the preparedness of the Pakistan Navy. “Indian Navy’s (aircraft carrier) Vikrant had reached close to Pakistan by 400 nautical miles, but after suffering immense losses inflicted by Paki­stan Air Force and Pakistan Army (elsewhere), Vikrant retreated, sensing the preparedness of the Pakistan Navy to respond vigorously,” he added.
 


The premier also recalled the navy’s proud legacy of decisive operations, saying the naval force remained fully capable of executing high-intensity operations akin to the historic ‘Operation Dwarka’ (1965), whenever and wherever required.
“Strong coordination am­o­ng the armed forces is a golden chapter in the country’s history,” he said, adding that the ground forces targeted the enemy’s positions with precision using Fatah missiles and other weapons.
He also commended the Pakistan Navy for its resolute posture, operational dexterity, and effe­ctive deterrent response in countering adversarial maritime threats. The PM particularly praised the navy’s role in ensuring the uninterrupted flow of maritime trade.
 
 

Lauding the role of PN, the prime minister said the navy was ready to give a befitting response to India if the neighbouring country dared to attack Pakistan from the sea.
PM Shehbaz said that over the past 15 years, the Pakistan Navy has gained the latest technology. “I congratulate Pakis­tan Navy for the progress it attained during the last 15 years through indigenous technology,” he said.
The PM reiterated that Pakis­tan was ready to give a stronger response to India if the neighbouring country violated the ceasefire.
‘Man of peace’
He also called US President Donald Trump a ‘man of peace’ and expressed confidence that the US president would play an effective role in resolving the Kashmir issue.
“President Trump is a man of peace as he played a major role in averting war between the two nuclear states (Pakistan and India),” the prime minister said. PM Shehbaz said he wanted to express his gratitude to President Trump for his desire to play a “sincere role” for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
He also thanked the leaders of Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and China for supporting Pakistan.
 
 

The PM said these countries supported Pakistan’s stance that there should be an independent and transparent inquiry into the Pahalgam terror attack and questioned why India was not entertaining the offer.
Chief of Army Staff Syed Asim Munir and air chief Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also accompanied the PM, who was received and welcomed by the naval chief, Admiral Naveed Ashraf.

The forecast for a heatwave comes on the back of a similar advisory issued on May 15.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), high pressure is likely to persist in the upper atmosphere during the ongoing week, with day temperatures soaring to four to seven degrees Celsius.
“A shallow trough of westerly wave is affecting upper parts of the country,” the advisory stated, adding that the weather system is likely to persist during the next four days.
Day temperatures are likely to remain 4 to 6°C above normal in Sindh, sout­hern Punjab and Baloc­histan during the forecast period.

PMD urges citizens to avoid direct exposure to the sun from 11am to 4pm

In central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, the temperatures are likely to remain 5-7°C above normal.
 
 

The advisory warned of dust storms and gusty winds at isolated places over plain areas due to excessive heating during the forecast period.
The PMD advised citizens to avoid direct exposure to the sun from 11am to 4pm.
“Avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and remain hydrated,” the advisory added.
Farmers have been advised to manage their crop-related activities in view of the latest weather conditions and take care of their livestock.
The heatwave in northern areas may increase the rate of snowmelt on glaciers during the forecast period, the PMD warned.
Authorities have been advised to remain alert and take necessary measures to deal with any emergency during the forecast period.
 
 

Over the past 24 hours, hot and dry weather prevailed over most parts of the country with isolated rainfall in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Potohar region, and GB, the PMD said.
The highest temperature on Monday was recorded in Dadu and Jacobabad, where the mercury swelled to 48°C.
In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, daytime temperature swelled to 39°C. The temperature is expected to rise to 41 or 42°C during the next four days.

The current round of discussions, which will continue till May 23, will help determine whether Pakistan’s proposed bud­get meets the fiscal and reform targets agreed with the IMF under the Exte­nded Fund Facility (EFF).
An IMF delegation arrived earlier in Islamabad for the formal policy-level nego­t­­i­ations on budget final­isation, after last week technical discussions held via video link amid heig­htened tensions between India and Pakistan.
The Islamabad talks focus on revenue targets, expenditure controls, and budgetary projections as Pakistan grapples with mounting fiscal and external financing pressures.
An agreement between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year’s budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2.
IMF staff have emphasised the need to align budget priorities with programme goals of “restoring macroeconomic stability, building resilience through stronger reserve buffers, and advancing structural reforms for inclusive growth”.
Positive trends
One encouraging development is the turnaround in Pakistan’s external account.
 
 

From a deficit of 0.5pc of GDP during the July-March FY24, the current account has swung to a surplus of the same proportion in FY25, mainly due to a recovery in remittances and relative political stability. These inflows helped offset deficits in trade and primary income, underscoring the economy’s growing resilience.
Headline inflation, which had surged to nearly 40pc in mid-2023, dropped sharply to 0.7pc by March 2025. This dramatic disinflation allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut its policy rate by 10 percentage points since June 2024, bringing it down to 12pc by January. The easing of monetary policy is expected to support investment and consumption.
Sovereign risks have also moderated. The continuation of the IMF programme and a more disciplined fiscal approach have led to a sovereign credit rating upgrade and a narrowing of international borrowing spreads, reflecting greater investor confidence.
Challenges remain
Despite these gains, Pakistan faces a widening external financing gap, projected to reach $19.75 billion in FY26 and stay above $19bn through FY27. By FY28, the shortfall could exceed Rs8.8 trillion. While foreign exchange reserves may rise to $23bn by then, “no significant income is expected from privatisation before 2030.”
Remittances are expe­cted to remain steady at $36bn, while the current account deficit is projected to hover around $3.85bn.
The IMF has warned of risks to Pakistan’s economic outlook from global developments, noting: “Risks to the outlook remain significant, including from global financial conditions, commodity price volatility, and geo-economic fragmentation.” It noted regional tensions as a key concern, stating that “renewed clashes with India could unsettle financial markets, deter investment, and distract from reform implementation.”
The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year’s average of 5.1pc.
The Fund expects Paki­stani authorities to continue to focus on expe­ndi­ture control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to 20.3pc next year. But even then the exp­e­nditures wou­ld get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget est­imates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised exp­e­nditures, particularly tho­se that have ari­s­en recently due to the security situation.
The IMF wants Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year. The government is also being asked to maintain a primary surplus — revenues minus non-interest expenditures — of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability.
Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26.
