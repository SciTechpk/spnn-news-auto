Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation late on Saturday night, targeting groups responsible for recent attacks in its territory.
The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur, and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians.
Mentioning these incidents, Chaudhry said they were “linked” to Afghanistan-based actors, adding that it was subsequently decided to give a “decisive response” to the neighbouring country.







“As a result, our Air Force carried out strikes in three Afghan provinces, Paktika, Nangarhar and Khost on February 21,” he said, adding that there were reports of  the deaths of over 100 militants who “controlled terrorist networks” in the operation.
He said the February 21 strikes were “precise” and “intelligence-based”.
The minister insisted that they only targeted terrorists’ hideouts and training camps. He dispelled what he described as “false propaganda of civilians, mosques and seminaries getting hit” during the strikes.
Chaudhry warned that if terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil continued, Pakistan reserved the right to carry out strikes in its defence.
“We are not supposed to just attend funerals. The civilian leadership and armed forces are resolute that this cannot be tolerated anymore,” he asserted.
He said, “Every drop of blood of our martyrs, be they from the security forces or civilians, will be avenged. Every corner of the country will be defended.”</p><small>2026-02-23 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23234330049a0ac.' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975228/uk-police-arrest-ex-envoy-peter-mandelson-in-epstein-case' target='_blank'><strong>UK police arrest ex-envoy Peter Mandelson in Epstein case</strong></a><br><p>London police on Monday arrested Britain’s former ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, amid allegations over his ties to disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.
“Officers have arrested a 72-year-old man on suspicion of misconduct in public office,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
Images on UK television appeared to show Mandelson being driven away from his north London home accompanied by a man and a woman, after police raided his properties earlier this month.
“He was arrested at an address in Camden on Monday, 23 February and has been taken to a London police station for interview,” the Met added.
The arrest comes days after ex-prince Andrew, King Charles III’s younger brother, was arrested in a misconduct in public office probe also related to the latest release of documents related to Epstein.
Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics, is being probed over allegations that he sent sensitive documents to the late US sex offender Epstein when he was a government minister, including during the 2008 financial crash.
The ex-politician was sacked by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as envoy to Washington last year when an earlier release of documents linked to Epstein showed the extent of their friendship.
The latest Epstein files released by the United States on January 30 have resulted in the high-profile UK investigations.
Starmer has apologised to Epstein’s victims and accused Mandelson of lying about the extent of his ties to the financier during the vetting process for his appointment to Washington.
But Mandelson’s appointment has unleashed a political storm with two of Starmer’s top aides resigning over the row.
The government is to release tens of thousands of emails, messages and documents on Mandelson’s vetting procedure, which could ramp up the pressure on the prime minister and other senior ministers.
Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this month.
Officers from the Met’s specialist crime team were also deployed earlier this month to search two of his addresses, one in the western English county of Wiltshire and the other in London, according to the police.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23210449dc30531.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975221/abandon-this-dangerous-fantasy-senate-echoes-with-ppps-displeasure-over-remarks-on-creating-karachi-province' target='_blank'><strong>‘Abandon this dangerous fantasy’: Senate echoes with PPP’s displeasure over remarks on creating Karachi province</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Monday echoed with the PPP’s displeasure over recent statements regarding the creation of a separate Karachi province, asserting that it was an inseparable part of Sindh.
The development comes two days after the Sindh Assembly passed a resolution terming Karachi an “inseparable” part of Sindh and opposed any move that suggested otherwise. Opposing the resolution in the Sindh Assembly, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) had also declared it unconstitutional.
On Monday, PPP’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, Sherry Rehman, denounced recent statements by certain federal ministers, ostensibly a reference to MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal and Khaliq Maqbool Siddique.
Rehman said that such reckless talk was not only unconstitutional but also a direct provocation to the unity of the federation.
“Let me be clear: the PPP is the custodian of Sindh’s unity and no one will be allowed to undermine it,” she said.
She said Sindh had always opened its arms to everyone, adding that the province’s resources had always been shared with the country since 1947.
“To hear suggestions about dividing Karachi or Sindh is deeply alarming. This is not just an attack on a province, it is an attack on Pakistan itself,” she remarked.
Rehman reminded the House that altering a province’s boundaries was a constitutional matter that required a two-thirds majority.
“Those floating these ideas should first read the Constitution. Constitutional divisions require democratic majorities, not press conferences,” she remarked.
Speaking about coalition partners, she said, “Our friends in MQM-P have always been part of the federal government. They have governed with every administration. May God grant them even more respect, but let no one confuse local political debates with a licence to redraw provincial maps.”
She also stated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had said that no one would be allowed to divide Pakistanis based on language or identity.
“This party has shed blood, borne lashes, and endured imprisonment to uphold that principle,” she said. She further warned that Sindh had historically faced backdoor conspiracies.
“Let me say it plainly: the majority in Sindh belongs to the PPP. If that bothers someone, what can we do? If they want a majority, then earn it the democratic way — face the people, earn their votes, and withstand the political struggle like PPP workers have always done,” she said.
“From Shaheed Benazir Bhutto to President Asif Ali Zardari, our leadership has spent years behind bars for democracy. We have always put Pakistan before politics,” she said.
“Anyone dreaming of dividing Sindh should abandon this dangerous fantasy. We know how to resist, we know how to oppose, and we will not tolerate any assault on Pakistan’s federal unity. This behaviour is unacceptable and will never be allowed to succeed,” she maintained.
PPP Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi said that his party had always served the people without going into politics, whether or not people of any area voted for it.
He pointed out that both MQM-P and Jamaat-i-Islami each had three leaders who served as Karachi mayor.
“What had these six mayors given to Karachi? Nothing,” he said. He then said that the PPP’s mayorship of Karachi had delivered better results than MQM-P’s.
He pointed out that an education conference was held at the Governor’s House, which was also attended by Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. However, nothing about education was discussed, he lamented.
Meanwhile, MQM-P Senator Khalida Ateeb opposed the resolution passed by the Sindh Assembly, terming it against the Constitution.
Speaking on the floor of the Senate, she said the proposal to divide Sindh into rural and urban areas was initiated by the PPP-led Sindh government. She also questioned who introduced the quota system.
She made it clear that the MQM-P never advocated for dividing Sindh but said there were calls for administrative units in all provinces across the country.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232257121f26f07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975227/food-delivery-rider-killed-after-speeding-car-overturns-crashes-into-his-motorcycle-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Food delivery rider killed after speeding car overturns, crashes into his motorcycle in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A food delivery rider lost his life after a speeding vehicle flipped over and crashed into his stationary motorcycle in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area, according to police.
The video of the incident that took place on Sunday was widely shared on social media.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) told Dawn that the food delivery rider was on his motorcycle outside a bungalow in DHA’s phase IV when a speeding car turned over and crashed into his vehicle.
“Both the rider and the car driver were injured in the incident,” he said, adding that they were initially taken to a private hospital in the Clifton area. The rider was later taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in critical condition and died during treatment, the official said.
Meanwhile, the car’s driver was at the private hospital in Clifton, and a police mobile was deployed outside the facility for the arrest of the car driver after treatment, DIG Raza said.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232252577e9f6a5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975226/west-indies-thrash-zimbabwe-in-t20-world-cup-clash-after-piling-up-254-6' target='_blank'><strong>West Indies thrash Zimbabwe in T20 World Cup clash after piling up 254-6</strong></a><br><p>The West Indies blew away T20 World Cup surprise package Zimbabwe by a colossal 107 runs in Mumbai on Monday as Shai Hope’s team opened their Super Eights campaign with a dominant victory.
Shimron Hetmyer blasted 85 off 34 balls as the West Indies piled up 254-6, the second-highest total in the history of the tournament.
Zimbabwe, who stunned Australia and Sri Lanka to reach the Super Eights, got off to an awful start chasing a monumental 255.
They were reduced to 20-3 in the third over when two wickets fell to Akeal Hosein’s left-arm spin and never threatened to get close.
They were all out for 147 in 17.4 overs with Brad Evans hitting some lusty late blows before being last man out for 43 off 21 balls with five sixes.
Left-armer Gudakesh Motie was the pick of the West Indies bowlers with 4-28 as he found some sharp turn. Hosein took 3-28.
Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza won the toss and opted to bowl, then saw his bowlers flogged to all parts of the Wankhede stadium.
Only Sri Lanka, who made 260-6 against Kenya in 2007, have scored more in a T20 World Cup match.
Coming in at 17-1, the left-handed Hetmyer was given a life Zimbabwe would come to regret.
A routine catch at deep fine leg was spilled by Tashinga Musekiwa when the batsman was on nine.
Hetmyer took full advantage, racing to his fifty off 19 balls, equalling South Africa’s Aiden Markram for the fastest half-century of the tournament so far.
Hetmyer and Rovman Powell, who came in at 54-2, completed their century stand in 45 balls.
They had added 122 off 52 balls when Hetmyer became the third wicket to go down with 176 on the board in the 15th over.
Hetmyer, having been dropped for a second time on 70 by the hapless Musekiwa, this time was held in the deep by Brian Bennett having smashed seven sixes and seven fours.
Powell was out soon after for 59, off 35 balls, with four sixes.
Sherfane Rutherford took up the mantle and guided his side past 200 and then 250 as he scored 31 not out off 13 balls with two sixes.
Romario Shepherd joined in the fun by smacking 21, and Jason Holder took 13 off three balls as 38 runs were bludgeoned off the final two overs.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232226111d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975225/lets-sit-together-and-strengthen-charter-of-democracy-govt-invites-opposition-for-talks' target='_blank'><strong>‘Let’s sit together and strengthen Charter of Democracy’: Govt invites opposition for talks</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government invited the opposition on Monday to hold talks and “strengthen and take forward” the Charter of Democracy — a 2006 document signed by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and late Benazir Bhutto, with the commitment to struggle against dictatorship.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the Charter of Democracy”, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said while addressing a Senate session in response to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas.
Sanaullah said the government was willing to hold dialogue with the opposition, which would strengthen democracy, rather than opting for confrontation and deadlock.
“We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks even when the PTI was in power.
However, PTI founder Imran Khan was not ready to talk to politicians, he said, saying that his “stubbornness is a big hurdle” in the way of talks.
Without naming anyone but seemingly referring to the establishment, Sanaullah went on to say that the opposition wanted talks with those who did not want to talk to it.
He added that the government wanted the PTI to “become a part of Parliament by rejoining its standing committees”.
The PTI had resigned from the standing committees in September last year.
Sanaullah criticised the party on Monday for what he described as its “reluctance to become a part of the political process”.
Continuing his rebuke of the opposition, the PM’s adviser stated: “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so.” But, he added, the government was ready to move forward in a democratic manner.
He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations were held between political parties and not “through external forces”.
On Imran’s health, he said the matter was before the court, and the government had implemented court directives regarding the PTI founder’s treatment.
“On the PTI’s request, even an eye specialist was included in the medical board that examined Imran,” he highlighted.
The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
Speaking before Sanaullah, Opposition Leader Abbas criticised the authorities in connection with a recent days-long sit-in at the Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health.
He claimed that “Parliament was shut down to block the entry and exit of parliamentarians who were staging a peaceful protest”.
“Is this not an insult to Parliament?” he questioned.
Abbas said the protesters’ only demand was Imran’s medical treatment should be carried out in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family.
He neither wanted a release from jail, nor his family made any such demand, Abbas said, adding that the PTI founder only sought a fair trial for himself.
Calling for the need to restore confidence on both sides, he urged the government not to transform this issue into a “full-blown crisis” and move forward.
He also gave the assurance that the opposition would “never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government at the dictation of any dictator, despite the legitimacy of the [incumbent] government being questioned”. But, he stressed, the government should address and resolve the issue of Imran’s eye ailment and treatment.
He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions.
While Sanaullah was responding to Abbas’ allegation of “shutting down Parliament”, he said the opposition’s call to its workers to reach the protest venue prompted the police to “make security arrangements”.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23214345b45f9ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975223/israeli-minister-says-army-will-occupy-all-gaza-if-hamas-does-not-disarm' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli minister says army will occupy all Gaza if Hamas does not disarm</strong></a><br><p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday that Hamas may soon be given a deadline to lay down its weapons.
“We estimate that in the coming days, Hamas will be given an ultimatum to disarm and completely demilitarise Gaza,” Smotrich said in an interview with public broadcaster Kan.
Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in 2023, in retaliation for Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack.
Under the first phase of a US-sponsored ceasefire in Gaza intended to halt two years of Isreali onslaught in Gaza, the Israeli army withdrew to positions behind a so-called Yellow Line, but still controls over half of the territory.
Both Hamas and Israel accuse each other of near-daily ceasefire violations, with the health ministry in Gaza reporting 615 people killed by Israeli forces since the truce started.
The Israeli military says it has lost five of its soldiers during the same period.
If Hamas does not comply with the Israeli ultimatum to disarm, the army “will have international legitimacy and American backing to do it itself, and the IDF (military) is already preparing for this and is making plans”, said the minister, who is a member of Israel’s security cabinet charged with approving large-scale military operations.
The second ceasefire phase, which officially began last month, calls for a gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army and the disarmament of Hamas, which the militant group has vehemently opposed.
“The (Israeli military) will definitely enter and occupy Gaza if Hamas does not disarm,” Smotrich said.
Asked how the military would do this, he said, “There are two or three alternatives right now that we are examining”.
The peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump also calls for the establishment of a 20,000-strong peacekeeping force, called the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which several countries have committed troops.
Asked how the Israeli army would operate against Hamas when foreign soldiers were deployed on the ground, Smotrich said the latter would “pull out very quickly and allow the (Israeli military) to enter. This is coordinated with the Americans.”
“By the way, I don’t yet see them going in that fast,” he added of the ISF.
A security source in Gaza, meanwhile, said on Monday that Israeli forces shelled Beit Lahia in the north.
The source also said that Israeli tanks opened fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, where at least two air strikes were also conducted.
Israel’s military said Monday that Israeli troops “eliminated” a fighter who had crossed the Yellow Line into Israeli-held territory the previous day.</p><small>2026-02-23 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232214472c3d079.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975190/pm-shehbaz-lands-in-qatar-on-2-day-official-visit-to-explore-new-avenues-of-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lands in Qatar on 2-day official visit to explore new avenues of cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reached Qatar on Monday night on a two-day official visit, state-run PTV News reported.







He was received by Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer and other diplomatic staff at King Hammad International Airport, a post by PTV News on social media platform X said.
The premier is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and his aide, Tariq Fatemi, according to the post.
Earlier, the Foreign Office (FO) said the premier would meet the Qatari emir during the visit.
The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the FO said in a press release.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will hold a bilateral meeting with Sheikh Tamim, “covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership, and people-to-people exchanges”, the FO added.
“The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export.”
The FO highlighted that both countries shared a “longstanding partnership characterised by mutual trust and close coordination at regional and international forums”.







“The visit will also provide an opportunity for both leaderships to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest, reaffirming their resolve to work closely for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” the statement added.
“The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between the two countries and underscores their shared commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation,” the FO noted.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
PM Shehbaz undertook two visits to Doha in September 2025 — one to express solidarity after Israeli attacks on the country and a second to attend a joint summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
He had held meetings with the Qatari emir on both occasions, reaffirmed Pakistan’s “all-out support and solidarity” for the Gulf state.</p><small>2026-02-23 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2320381286c6ea4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975220/india-battle-for-t20-world-cup-survival-after-messing-up-on-grand-scale' target='_blank'><strong>India battle for T20 World Cup survival after ‘messing up on grand scale’</strong></a><br><p>Defending T20 World Cup champions India need “two big performances” to reach the semi-finals after Sunday’s huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.
India came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.
In their first chase of the tournament, India’s batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.
India collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa’s 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.
The magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.
Anything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.
“Very disappointed in the performance,” said Ryan ten Doeschate.
“When you set out to win a World Cup, don’t expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,” the assistant coach added.
“We’ve messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.”
India are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.
India next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.
South Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram’s side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.
‘Cloak came off’
“Obviously, with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it’s going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,” said Ten Doeschate.
India’s fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs.
Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.
India’s media tore into the team on Monday morning.
“The night the cloak came off,” blazed a headline in The Indian Express newspaper.
“Sloppy India reach point of no return,” said the Hindustan Times.
India’s ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.
Ishan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world’s top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.
“It’s certainly not panic stations,” said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India’s batting line-up.
“If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,” said Ten Doeschate.
“So can we get them to temper the way they’re playing and be a little bit smarter?
“Or do we just let them go on the way they are?
“Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?”
Captain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.
“Chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,” he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.
“We lost too many wickets in the power play.”
The 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.</p><small>2026-02-23 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2320093981ff743.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975219/trump-renews-attack-on-us-supreme-court-vows-other-tariffs-and-licences' target='_blank'><strong>Trump renews attack on US Supreme Court, vows other tariffs and licences</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump renewed his condemnation of the Supreme Court on Monday after it ruled against his sweeping tariff programme last week, vowing to turn to other tariff powers and licences but giving no details.
“The court has also approved all other Tariffs, of which there are many, and they can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used,” he wrote in a social media post.







Trump said on Saturday he would raise a temporary tariff from 10 per cent to 15 pc on US imports from all countries, the maximum level allowed under the law, a day after the court ruled that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority when he imposed an array of higher tariff rates under an economic emergency law.
In his post on Monday, Trump also pointed to the potential use of licences to pressure countries, writing that “incomprehensibly, according to the ruling, (I) can’t charge them a Licence fee — BUT ALL LICENCES CHARGE FEES, why can’t the United States do so? You do a licence to get a fee! The opinion doesn’t explain that, but I know the answer!”







Wall Street futures and the dollar dropped early on Monday amid confusion over the US trade policy, while oil prices initially fell over uncertainty for global growth and fuel demand over the latest tariff hike before being steadied by news of planned US-Iran talks.
The decision and Trump’s subsequent actions are already impacting his trade deals struck over the past year, with China urging Washington to scrap tariff measures, the European Union set to freeze its agreement and India delaying planned talks.
Trump used his social media post to again lash out against the justices who ruled against him, which included two whom he had appointed during his first term in the White House.
In its ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, the court reasserted its power to check the power of the president.
The president also expressed concern that the top court could rule against his administration’s bid to restrict birthright citizenship in its forthcoming decision in that case.</p><small>2026-02-23 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231610285f09b0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975204/3-federal-constabulary-men-martyred-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>3 Federal Constabulary men martyred in terrorist attack in KP’s Karak</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: Three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a terrorist attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district on Monday, according to officials.
In a statement, Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan said terrorists initially carried out a quadcopter attack on the Federal Constabulary fort in the Dargah Shaheedan area.
The spokesperson said that during the initial attack, the terrorists detonated four rounds of explosives, causing injuries to four Federal Constabulary personnel. However, the Federal Constabulary personnel retaliated.
The exchange of fire went on for a long time, he added. He said that Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident to rush the injured to a nearby hospital; however, the ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam, leading to the martyrdom of three Federal Constabulary personnel.
Three Rescue 1122 officials were left injured, he said. He added that following the attack, the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed.
Karak District Police Officer Saood Khan also confirmed that three Federal Constabulary men were martyred as the ambulance carrying the injured came under attack.
Separately, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Asif Khan, in a statement, said that two of the injured rescue personnel were in critical condition.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the attack, terming it “cowardly and inhumane,” as per a statement issued by the PPP’s media cell.
“Those who opened fire on an ambulance have proven that they reject the teachings of Islam,” Bilawal was quoted as saying.
Bilawal, as per the statement, paid tribute to the martyred personnel and offered condolences to their families.
He stressed that “a Muslim cannot even think of harming an animal, let alone a human being, in the holy month of Ramazan”.







Last week, a terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel.
On February 18, two Federal Constabulary personnel were injured when unidentified assailants attacked a checkpost in the Salgazi area of Wazir subdivision.
In November last year, in a major attack on the force, three Federal Constabulary personnel were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23131658217cbfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975194/opposition-leaders-stage-protest-outside-supreme-court-demand-immediate-scheduling-of-imrans-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition leaders stage protest outside Supreme Court, demand immediate scheduling of Imran’s cases</strong></a><br><p>Members of the opposition protested outside the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday to demand that the cases of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.
Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja participated in the protest, which ended at around 2pm.
Other leaders present included chief whip Amir Dogar, MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan and Shahid Khattak, MPA Shafiullah Jan, and Muhammad Hussain.
The protest participants also demanded that “a complete medical examination be conducted through his personal doctors”, according to a post by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on X.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was convicted in another case regarding state gifts recently.
His health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Abbas urged the government to take “confidence-building measures”, which included allowing Imran’s family and personal physicians to meet him.
“We consider these rulers Form-47 ones but any talks would still be held with them,” the Senante opposition leader said.







Speaking to reporters, the PTI secretary general said the party does not trust “any government report”, apparently referring to one submitted to SC by the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).
“This is not a moment where we organise a movement or hold talks,” Raja said, noting the concerns of Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum regarding her brother’s life.
Raja further lamented that they were unable to meet with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, adding that he would again attempt to meet him.
“Not just the PTI founder’s eye but his body needs a checkup,” he contended.
Ali Muhammad also demanded that Imran be taken to a hospital, adding that the ex-premier was “not asking for anything special”.
“It is through the leader’s eye that the nation sees its future,” the MNA remarked, calling for the PTI founder to be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as demanded by his personal doctors and family.







“With so much concerns being raised about Imran Khan’s eye issue everywhere especially at the level of apex court of the country, it’s strange the government has taken so long to take the critical decision of shifting him to hospital. It’s about time that government shouldn’t delay more,” he had said earlier on X.







Meanwhile, Khattak lamented that “our leaders’ treatment has been made into an issue of ego”.
He further said that Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi was also jailed in “political cases”. The lawmaker asserted that he and other party leaders would “again and again come here (to SC) and keep reminding” of the matter.
A video shared by the TTAP earlier in the day showed the opposition members sitting on the lawn outside the SC and talking amongst themselves.







Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the SC’s intervention earlier this month led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting outrage and protests from the opposition against his treatment.
The TTAP had held a sit-in at the Parliament House the previous week for the fulfillment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination, eventually calling it off after five days in deference to the holy month of Ramazan.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2319353519a4146.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975150/security-forces-kill-9-terrorists-during-intelligence-based-operations-in-balochistan-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 9 terrorists during intelligence-based operations in Balochistan, KP</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to statements issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
According to the military’s media affairs wing, an IBO in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan was conducted on Monday, on the “reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban.
The ISPR said that security personnel “effectively engaged the khawarij location” during the operation, and after an intense exchange of fire, four terrorists were killed.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from “Indian-sponsored killed khawarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Earlier in the day, ISPR shared the details of the IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin in a separate statement.
It said security forces had killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during that IBO on Sunday.
The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and sent to hell.”
Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists during the Pishin IBO as well, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Both statements by ISPR stated: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.“
Separately, the spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO in Pishin and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement.
He said that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Pishin, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”.
He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism.







Last week, on February 18, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD.
A day later, ISPR said security forces had also killed four “Indian-sponsored” terrorists in an IBO in KP’s Lakki Marwat district.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The ordinance was on the agenda for Monday’s session but could not be tabled due to a lack of quorum.
The amended ordinance, promulgated on Feb 17, introduces jail terms of up to 10 years and fines up to Rs10 million for the illegal possession of immovable property, while mandating that cases be decided within 30 days.
It amends the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 — operation of which was suspended by the Lahore High Court last year — to strengthen protection for lawful owners and streamline adjudication through newly empowered district-level tribunals.
Under the ordinance, a key structural reform is the establishment of the Punjab Property Tribunal in each district, to be presided over by a serving additional sessions judge, with exclusive jurisdiction to try offences under the Act and determine questions of title.
The tribunal is required to proceed on a day-to-day basis and conclude cases within 30 days of receiving a report from the scrutiny committee, limiting adjournments to no more than seven days at a time. Under the previous law, retired sessions judges were to be appointed to the post.
Further, now the tribunals cannot take up the cases already being heard by the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), Supreme Court (SC) and the LHC.
The district scrutiny committees. headed by deputy commissioners and comprising senior police and revenue officials, will examine complaints, scrutinise records, summon relevant persons and attempt amicable settlements within 30 days before submitting their reports to the tribunal.
Any person who directly or indirectly occupies property through fraud, force, coercion, forgery, misrepresentation or other illegal means will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment, extendable to ten years, along with heavy financial penalties.
Even attempts, abetment or facilitation of such offences will attract prison terms ranging from one to three years and fines up to Rs1m.
In a significant deterrent against misuse of the law, the tribunal has been granted powers to punish false, frivolous or vexatious complaints with imprisonment of up to five years and fines up to Rs500,000.
The tribunal may also award monetary compensation to lawful owners, not less than the officially notified value of the property, along with recovery of any profits gained through illegal occupation.
To prevent further complications during litigation, the ordinance declares that any sale, lease, gift, mortgage or other form of alienation of a disputed property after the filing of a complaint shall be null and void unless specifically permitted by the tribunal.
Appeals against final judgments will lie only before the LHC within 30 days, while interim orders will not be appealable. Bail for accused persons arrested under the ordinance may only be granted by the high court, reinforcing the exclusive authority of the tribunal system.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendments are aimed at strengthening the legal framework protecting property rights, ensuring faster dispute resolution, enhancing penalties to deter illegal occupation and removing obsolete provisions to create a more coherent and effective enforcement mechanism across Punjab.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231717000b4c88d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975195/ecp-to-hear-plea-against-victory-of-ppps-ali-hassan-zehri-from-hub-in-feb-8-elections' target='_blank'><strong>ECP to hear plea against victory of PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri from Hub in Feb 8 elections</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is set to hear a unique case on Tuesday (February 24), involving an increase of 10,000 in the number of polled votes and over 13,000 in the number of rejected votes for a Balochistan Assembly seat following a controversial recount.
The recount at 39 polling stations of PB-21 (Hub) took place two months after the Feb 8, 2024 general elections. The recount had declared PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri the winner, even though the original count had not even declared him the runner-up.
The original winner, Balochistan Awami Party’s (BAP) Muhammad Saleh Bhootani, who had secured more than double the votes obtained by Zehri, was pushed down to the third spot. After the recount, the percentage of polled votes had also changed from 55.15 per cent to 58.48pc.
It is worth mentioning that the significant change in the electoral figures was linked to a saga involving the arrest of five individuals from the strong room where the electoral record had been stored.
They were allegedly found with three plastic bags containing fake ballot papers and were attempting to tamper with ballot papers on Feb 11, 2024, hours after the ECP ordered a recount at 39 polling stations for the first time.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of rejected votes exactly matched the decrease in the votes originally secured by BAP’s Bhootani.
The votes secured by Bhootani were reduced from 30,910 to 17,403, translating into a difference of 13,507. The number of rejected votes increased from 3,648 to 17,155, also a rise of 13,507.
Meanwhile, the number of polled votes jumped from 76,976 to 87,483, showing an increase of 10,507 votes. Of these, 9,854 were secured by Zehri originally, taking his total from 14,120 to 23,974.
A further 441 votes were added to the tally of Rajab Ali, the initial runner-up, keeping his position unchanged, while the remaining 212 votes were distributed among other candidates, except Bhootani.
Zehri was notified as the winner from PB-21 on Dec 19, 2024. The ECP initially ordered a recount on Feb 11, 2024, but the process was marred by violence, arrests, and allegations of fake ballots. After multiple rounds of litigation, the Supreme Court on Nov 20, 2024, annulled all proceedings and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh.
Despite this, the electoral watchdog on Dec 16, 2024, in a split 3-2 decision, upheld the recount and notified Zehri as the winner, prompting Bhootani to approach the Balochistan High Court and later the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
Earlier this month, the FCC suspended Zehri’s notification and directed the ECP to re-examine the pending requests for a recount.
In its judgment, the FCC observed: “Recounting is always allowed on the basis of some material establishing illegality and irregularity in the count, and the powers to recount should be exercised sparingly after satisfaction, on the basis of material or evidence, that there has been any inclusion or exclusion of ballot papers in the count.
“The sanctity of the ballot is sacrosanct and, therefore, should not be permitted to be violated on frivolous, vague or indefinite allegations not supported by adequate statements of detailed material facts. It should only be allowed to do full justice between the parties, without a roving inquiry aimed at fishing for material to declare the election void,” it said.
It should be mentioned that last week, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail removed Zehri from the Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial cabinet with immediate effect. Zehri had earlier submitted his resignation to the chief minister.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2316213931f2b08.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975209/snoring-at-night-low-vitamin-d-might-be-playing-a-role' target='_blank'><strong>Snoring at night? Low vitamin D might be playing a role</strong></a><br><p>Snoring is often dismissed as a harmless habit or blamed on sleeping position, weight, or nasal congestion. But emerging research suggests there may be a less obvious contributor quietly influencing nighttime breathing: low vitamin D levels.
Vitamin D is best known for its role in bone health, but its influence extends far beyond that. It plays a crucial part in muscle strength, nerve signalling, and inflammation control — all of which are directly connected to how the airway functions during sleep.
A growing body of scientific evidence shows that vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired muscle performance. The muscles that keep the upper airway open during sleep rely on proper neuromuscular control.
When these muscles relax too much, airflow becomes turbulent, causing the vibration of soft tissues in the throat — what we hear as snoring. Weakened or poorly functioning muscles can increase this collapse, especially during deep sleep.
Inflammation adds another layer to the problem. Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties, and its deficiency has been linked to higher levels of systemic inflammation. Research published in Frontiers in Neurology and indexed on PubMed Central suggests that chronic inflammation can affect upper airway tissues, making them more swollen and prone to obstruction during sleep. This narrowing of the airway increases the likelihood and intensity of snoring.
One comprehensive review, published in 2023, examined the relationship between vitamin D deficiency, muscle dysfunction, and sleep-related breathing disorders. The authors noted that low vitamin D levels were associated with increased risk of upper airway collapse and poorer neuromuscular control, mechanisms closely tied to snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea.
While the study does not claim vitamin D deficiency directly causes snoring, it highlights a meaningful biological pathway that helps explain the connection.Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, even in sunny regions. Urban lifestyles, indoor work, limited sun exposure, air pollution, and dietary gaps all contribute. Many people with low vitamin D levels experience no obvious symptoms, making the deficiency easy to overlook.
Addressing low vitamin D is not a standalone cure for snoring, nor does it replace evaluation for conditions like sleep apnoea. However, clinicians increasingly recognise that correcting deficiency may improve muscle tone, reduce inflammation, and support better airway stability during sleep for some individuals.
Checking vitamin D levels requires a simple blood test. If levels are low, doctors may recommend controlled sun exposure, vitamin D-rich foods such as fatty fish and fortified products, or supplementation based on individual needs.
Snoring is often the body’s way of signalling that something isn’t quite right. In some cases, the issue may not be in the nose or pillow — but in a nutrient the body quietly depends on to keep breathing smoothly through the night.

The agency on Monday produced Hamza Ahmad Khan before a magistrate, who sent him to jail for 14 days on judicial remand.
On Sunday, police registered a case on kidnapping charges on the complaint of his friend. According to the first information report, Hamza went missing in the early hours of Feb 19 after leaving his residence in DHA Phase 10, according to the first information report (FIR) registered at the Defence-A police station.
On Monday, it emerged that Hamza was in NCCIA custody for allegedly making anti-state posts on social media platforms X and Instagram.
In the FIR registered against him by the NCCIA, the cybercrime agency said that during routine cyber patrols, accounts associated with Hamza were actively “disseminating misinformation and disinformation targeting the state institutions”.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered under sections 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) and 26A (spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.
“An initial analysis indicates that the content in question is being published intentionally and is publicly accessible. The nature of these posts is inflammatory and appears designed to incite public unrest, spread animosity, and undermine social order,” the FIR said.
It added that the propagation of such malicious content posed a “significant risk”, with the potential to cause severe reputational damage to the state of Pakistan, both domestically and internationally.
It added that during the course of inquiry, it was verified that Hamza was uploading “derogatory posts against the state functionaries and state institutions with the intention to harm the reputation of the state functionaries”.
It further added that the suspect was posting derogatory content to “defame and malign constitutional and political leadership of Pakistan, incite hatred and undermine the integrity of the state”.
“Such mischievous statements/posts render dire consequences nationally and internationally for the state of Pakistan,” the NCCIA said.</p><small>2026-02-23 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231757279da491f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975215/ihc-declares-chief-justice-sole-master-of-the-roster-recalls-july-2025-order-in-aafia-siddiqui-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC declares chief justice sole ‘master of the roster’, recalls July 2025 order in Aafia Siddiqui case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A larger bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) reaffirmed in a detailed judgement on Monday that the chief justice was the sole “master of the roster”, ruling that a July 2025 order by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan in the Aafia Siddiqui case was recalled for being issued by a forum that was not “lawfully constituted”.
Last year in July, Justice Khan had issued contempt notices to the prime minister and the entire federal cabinet over non-compliance with the court’s directions in a petition filed by Dr Fowzia Siddiqui seeking the release of her sister, Dr Aafia, from a US prison.
However, the registrar’s office did not execute the notices because the judge was not included in the duty roster approved by the chief justice. Later, the court registrar’s report had recommended that a larger bench should address questions concerning the validity of the July 21 hearing.
The central issue identified was that Justice Khan’s bench was not authorised to hear cases on July 21. The weekly roster approved by the chief justice had not assigned him any bench duties that day, and the official summer vacation roster also listed him as being on leave.
On Monday, the matter was fixed before the larger bench, comprising Justices Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Azam Khan.
The judgement, authored by Justice Minhas, stated that no bench could legally exercise jurisdiction unless constituted through a roster duly approved by the chief justice.
The bench observed that Justice Khan’s leave schedule had been publicly notified in advance, and in line with that schedule, his name was excluded from the weekly roster prepared by the deputy registrar (judicial) and approved by the IHC chief justice.
Despite this, the judge held court on July 21, 2025, heard cases, and issued directions, including those for the initiation of contempt proceedings against members of the federal government, the bench noted.
It observed that under the high court rules, the constitution of benches fell within the exclusive domain of the chief justice.
Moreover, the judgement recalled that in view of institutional and constitutional implications, the matter was referred to the IHC chief justice for the constitution of a larger bench to settle questions arising from the July 21 order.
The larger bench framed three key questions for determination: whether a bench existed in law merely because judges were present or only upon approval of the roster by the chief justice; whether a judge could self-assign or assume jurisdiction in a case; and whether the chief justice is legally obliged to obtain consent of a bench before consolidating identical petitions and reallocating them for hearing.
The bench examined Articles 175(2) and 202 of the Constitution in this regard, and noted that the former stated that no court shall exercise jurisdiction except as conferred by the Constitution or by or under law.
It held that jurisdiction was “not an abstract concept” attached to a “judge personally” but “flows from the lawful constitution of a bench in accordance with prescribed rules”.
The bench explained that while judicial power was vested in the high court, but exercising this power in a particular case required its “activation” through a lawfully constituted bench under the approved roster.
Merely the physical presence of judges in a courtroom did not create a bench in the eyes of law, the judgement said, adding that a bench came into “juridical existence” only when constituted by the chief justice through an approved roster or specific order.
It referred to chapter 10 of the High Court Rules and Orders, with the judges asserting that the constitution of benches is declared to be the “exclusive concern” of the chief justice.
The deputy registrar (judicial) may prepare a draft roster, but it would acquire legal force only upon approval by the chief justice, the judgement said. It declared that no judge or committee could independently constitute a bench or allocate judicial work.
To reach its conclusions in the judgement, the larger bench also relied on the Supreme Court’s precedents, including a decision in which it was held that benches could not self-constitute, self-select cases, or self-propagate proceedings.
The larger bench observed that permitting judges to sit and assume jurisdiction outside the approved roster would “undermine institutional discipline” and effectively make each judge the master of his own roster, a situation that it deemed would be incompatible with constitutional design.
On the question of self-assignment, the bench held that a judge could not take up or retain a case unless it had been lawfully assigned through the roster.
Any such assumption of authority amounted to exercising jurisdiction “without legal conferment and renders resulting orders void”, the judgement said.
Addressing the consolidation of cases, the bench ruled that the chief justice was not required to obtain consent of individual benches before withdrawing or consolidating identical or substantially similar petitions.
Consolidation, it held, was an institutional measure aimed at preventing conflicting judgements and ensuring coherence in the court’s jurisprudence.
Concluding its findings, the larger bench held that the proceedings conducted on July 21, 2025 in the Aafia Siddiqui case were undertaken by a forum that had not been “lawfully constituted” under the approved roster.
Consequently, it declared that the July 21 order was made without jurisdiction and recalled.
The judgment emphasised that adherence to the roster system was not a matter of administrative convenience but a constitutional requirement, designed to safeguard the rule of law and maintain orderly administration of justice within the high court.</p><small>2026-02-23 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23172202d3c94cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975214/australian-pm-backs-removing-prince-charles-brother-andrew-from-line-of-royal-succession' target='_blank'><strong>Australian PM backs removing Prince Charles’ brother Andrew from line of royal succession</strong></a><br><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he would back plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession to the British throne, according to a letter shared by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office.
Last week, a UK official said the British government was considering introducing legislation to ensure Mountbatten-Windsor, currently eighth-in-line to the throne, could never be king following his arrest as part of a police investigation into his ties with Jeffrey Epstein.
King Charles is not only the monarch and head of state in Britain, but also in Australia and 13 other countries.
In the letter, Albanese told Starmer that in light of the recent events, his government would agree to any proposal to remove Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession.
“I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation,” his letter said. “These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.”
Last week, Mountbatten-Windsor was released from police custody after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Epstein.
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, King Charles said in a statement that the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.

The remarks come after a fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths during CCD operations. It should be mentioned that the CCD had rejected the HRCP’s report, terming claims of staged encounters and extrajudicial actions as unfounded and contrary to the department’s operational framework.
In a statement issued on Monday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram questioned how so many deaths were possible in alleged encounters.
“During the last eight months, as many as 670 encounters and 924 deaths have been reported. What is happening in Punjab? Is it an official state policy?” Akram asked.
He asked why the government was silent on the report issued by the HRCP and why its findings were not being taken seriously.
“Will the law be enforced through courts or through encounters? Under which law have such powers been given to the CCD?” he asked.
Akram demanded that an independent judicial inquiry be conducted to investigate every reported death. He said that public trust would continue to dwindle if transparency was not ensured.
He said that no institution could be allowed to carry out extrajudicial actions under any circumstances.
Calling on the Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to clarify the powers granted to the CCD, he said: “No individual or institution can be given authority above the law.”
Last year, the Punjab government had formally approved the establishment of the CCD to curb organised crime and protect life and property in the province
Last week, however, the HRCP’s fact-finding report alleged that the department has adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”.
According to the HRCP, based on press accounts, at least 670 CCD-led encounters were carried out across Punjab over eight months in 2025. These operations reportedly resulted in the deaths of 924 suspects, while only two police officials were killed during the same time frame, it said.
The HRCP noted that the sharp disparity in casualties — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — alongside similar operational patterns reported across districts, pointed to what it described as an “institutionalised practice” rather than isolated incidents of misconduct.
Meanwhile, the CCD said earlier this week that a comparative review of crime data for the post-May period of 2024 and 2025 showed a significant reduction in crime across Punjab, particularly in Lahore.
In a press release, the department stated that it did not follow any policy of staged encounters and operated strictly within the Constitution of Pakistan, the Police Order 2002 and applicable criminal procedure laws. The department maintained that arrests remained the primary objective of its operations and that the use of force was governed by the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.</p><small>2026-02-23 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23162152649b76f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975208/t20-world-cup-pakistan-warn-englands-flaky-batting-to-expect-a-trial-by-spin' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: Pakistan warn England’s flaky batting to expect a trial by spin</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday warned England’s inconsistent batting line-up to expect a trial by spin when the teams clash in the T20 World Cup Super Eights.
Pakistan batsman Sahibzada Farhan told reporters that England struggled to 146-9 against Sri Lanka’s spinners on Sunday.
Farhan said that England can expect more of the same from Pakistan’s spinners when they meet on the same Pallekele ground in Kandy on Tuesday night.
Pakistan desperately need a win after their first match against New Zealand was washed out.

 

A defeat would put England, who skittled Sri Lanka for 95 to win by 51 runs, through to the semi-finals with a game to spare.
Pakistan would then need to beat Sri Lanka in their final Super Eights match and hope other results go their way to reach the last four.
“What we saw in the Sri Lanka-England game was that the ball was gripping and England struggled against spin,” said the in-form opener Farhan on Monday.
“Sri Lanka have one or two spinners but we have five in all so we will give England a tough time on a pitch that looks good and will grip,” said Farhan.
Pakistan’s spinners have taken 26 wickets in the four matches so far. Their seamers have dismissed only seven batsmen.
History will be against Pakistan as they have never beaten England in the three previous Twenty20 World Cup clashes.
“We are confident and our morale is high,” said Farhan, who scored an unbeaten 100 against Namibia in Pakistan’s final group match.
“We are focused on this match to win and progress.”
Farhan, who tops the T20 World Cup run-scoring chart with 220, said he was ready for the threat of England’s express pace bowler Jofra Archer.
“Facing Archer will not be difficult because I have faced similar bowlers in Pakistan,” said Farhan. “So if he has plans against me, I also have plans against him.”
Pakistan are likely to bring in spinner Abrar Ahmed in place of seaming all-rounder Faheem Ashraf.
England may name an unchanged side for the fifth match in succession with Liam Dawson, Will Jacks, Adil Rashid and Jacob Bethell providing their spin options.
Sri Lanka and New Zealand are the two other teams in Pakistan and England’s Super Eights group. They face each other in Colombo on Wednesday.
The top two teams will qualify for the semi-finals.</p><small>2026-02-23 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231349386d961f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975192/another-meltdown-at-psx-as-kse-100-loses-over-5400-points' target='_blank'><strong>Another meltdown at PSX as KSE-100 loses over 5,400 points</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark index KSE-100 began another week on a low note, losing more than 5,400 points during intraday trade on Monday.
The KSE-100 index declined 5,478.63 points, or 3.16 per cent, to stand at 167,691.08 points from the previous close of 173,169.71 points.
The index reached its intraday high of 174,336.85 points at 9:38am — higher than its previous close — but then plunged to an intraday low of 166,886.63 points at around 1:24pm, before regaining some ground to 167,691 points by market close.
The top active stocks were led by K-Electric Limited, falling 4.61pc to Rs7.66 with 36,062,769 shares traded; followed by Worldcall Telecom Limited, falling 4.35pc to Rs1.32 with a volume of 33,673,161; and Bank of Punjab, falling 8.63pc to Rs30.19 with a volume of 26,673,106.
The top advancing stocks were led by Itanz Technologies Limited, rising 10.01pc to Rs13.96, followed by Kohinoor Industries Limited, rising 10.00pc to Rs50.60, and S.S. Oil Mills Limited, rising 10.00pc to Rs563.62.
The top decliners were Trust Securities & Brokerage Limited (R), down 17.31pc to Rs0.43; First Capital Securities Corporation, down 15.74pc to Rs4.39, and LSE Capital Limited (Right), down 14.91pc to Rs0.97.



Monday’s bloodbath marks at least the third major meltdown at the PSX in the past two weeks, with KSE-100 previously losing 5,149.80 points on February 16 and 6,683 points — the steepest single-day decline in history — on February 19.
Last week, the PSX endured a difficult week as geopolitical strains between the United States and Iran, compounded by domestic political noise, triggered a significant sell-off, pushing the KSE-100 index below the 174,000-point level.
Analysts have been cautious but hopeful about the market’s near-term direction.
AKD Securities believed that geopolitical developments and the outcome of the upcoming IMF review mission, due to arrive next week, will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.

Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property, and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in GB and KP are vulnerable to the phenomenon, according to the Ministry of Climate Change.
The PMD, in its outlook, noted that due to reduced rain and “persistent clear-sky conditions”, temperatures across GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) from Feb 1 to 22 recorded an increase.
“Daytime (maximum) temperatures were recorded 3–5°C above normal, while nighttime (minimum) temperatures remained 1–3.5°C above the 1981–2010 climatological average,” the PMD said, adding that the highest warming was recorded in the regions of Gilgit and Bunji.
“Chilas and Bunji have shown notable increases in minimum temperatures, reducing overnight refreezing,” it added.
The PMD predicted that the “above normal” temperatures were “accelerating snow and glacier melt, particularly at mid to lower altitudes”.
“Reduced nighttime cooling further enhances meltwater runoff into glacial lakes,” it added.
The weather body warned that the rapid melting increases “water accumulation in both moraine and glacier-dammed lakes, raising the likelihood of Glof events in downstream valleys”.
PMD noted that if the warming trend continued, “the risk of glacier melt acceleration and potential Glof occurrences may increase in vulnerable areas such as Gilgit, Ghizar, Hunza, Bunji, Chilas and Astore”.
It added that PMD was monitoring the “temperature trends, glacier melt conditions, and hydro meteorological parameters and will issue timely advisories to relevant authorities and communities”.
Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.</p><small>2026-02-23 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23144829eba1944.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975200/iran-says-any-us-attack-including-limited-strikes-would-be-act-of-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says any US attack including limited strikes would be ‘act of aggression’</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Monday that any attack by the United States, including limited strikes, would be an “act of aggression” that would precipitate a response, after US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran.
“With respect to your first question concerning the limited strike, I think there is no limited strike,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said at a briefing in Tehran attended by an AFP journalist.
“An act of aggression would be regarded as an act of aggression. Period.
“And any state would react to an act of aggression as part of its inherent right of self-defence ferociously so that’s what we would do.”
Trump said on Friday he was considering a limited strike if Tehran did not reach a deal with the US.
“I guess I can say I am considering that,” he replied following a question from reporters.
The two countries concluded a second round of indirect talks in Switzerland on Tuesday under Omani mediation, against the backdrop of a major US military build-up in the region.

 

Further talks, confirmed by Iran and Oman but not by the US, are scheduled for Thursday.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the negotiations for Iran, while the United States is represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
Trump is wondering why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military deployment, Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday.
Baqaei responded on Monday by saying that Iranians had never capitulated at any point in their history.

The incident, believed to have been caused by a brake failure, took place on February 7, and the pilot ejected safely, according to The Times of India.
Following the accident, the entire fleet of about 30 single-seat Tejas jets was grounded to undergo comprehensive technical inspections, The Hindu added.
The latest mishap comes amid delays in the delivery of the Tejas Mk‑1A variant, according to Indian media outlets. HAL has faced repeated delays in supplying the jets, mainly due to GE Aerospace missing deadlines for engine deliveries.
The IAF has not released an official statement regarding the incident.
This is reported to be the third Tejas aircraft lost since induction. The first crash occurred near Jaisalmer in March 2024 after a firepower demonstration, with the pilot ejecting safely.
The second incident was reported in November 2025, when a Tejas jet crashed during an aerial display on the last day of the Dubai Airshow, the Middle East’s biggest airshow.
In February 2021, India’s Defence Ministry signed an INR480 billion contract with HAL for 83 Tejas Mk‑1A jets, followed by a separate INR623.7bn deal in September 2025 for 97 additional aircraft, Indian media outlets reported.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23104932b9641e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975158/jailed-pti-leaders-call-for-mpc-on-palestine-issue-following-board-of-peace-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Jailed PTI leaders call for MPC on Palestine issue following Board of Peace moot</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore on Monday called for an urgent multi-party conference in the wake of the recent Board of Peace meeting to build national consensus on peace and stability in Gaza, according to a statement released to the media.
The leaders — Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mahmoodur Rasheed and Ejaz Chaudhry — jailed for involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots issued the statement through their lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar Umar, from Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore.
The statement said that a multi-party conference should be held immediately on the “Palestinian issue”, saying that sustainable peace was not possible in the region without a “two-state solution and justice”.
It called on all parties to reiterate their support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
“Since the ceasefire was announced through negotiations, more than 600 deaths have been reported in Gaza as a result of continuous ceasefire violations,” the statement pointed out.
“Israel’s decision to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, its unilateral actions to change the legal, demographic and historical status of the occupied Palestinian territories, its refusal to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip, its refusal to allow reconstruction work before Hamas disarms, and its continued obstruction of the uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid are all undermining the 20-point peace plan.”
The leaders further highlighted a need to discuss why four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) were not ready to be part of United States President Donald Trump’s new Board of Peace, ostensibly established to settle the Gaza conflict.
“Is it fair that Israel should be given membership of the Peace Board while the Palestinians are kept out?” they asked, pointing out that Israel’s violations of international law and the UN Charter had further escalated Middle East tensions.
The US president’s board met for its inaugural session in Washington on Thursday, with a number of countries pledging money and personnel for rebuilding, more than four months into a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. However, the meeting offered no timeline for Hamas to lay down its weapons or for Israel’s army to withdraw from the shattered enclave.
The statement also addressed the recently brewing conflict between the US and Iran, expressing concern that Tehran’s failure to reach an agreement with Washington within 10 days “could push the region towards war”. It highlighted the significant consequences of instability in Iran and its impact on Pakistan.
“Since there has been no meaningful debate in parliament on the Palestinian issue and the rising tensions in the Middle East, an urgent multi-party conference is the need of the hour to build a national consensus for peace and stability in Gaza and the wider region,” the statement concluded.
The UN said on Thursday that Israel’s increased attacks and forcible transfers of Palestinians “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing” in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it added.</p><small>2026-02-23 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23120234c965b5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975161/new-york-city-declares-emergency-as-winter-storm-shuts-schools-disrupts-travel-across-northeast-us' target='_blank'><strong>New York City declares emergency as winter storm shuts schools, disrupts travel across northeast US</strong></a><br><p>Children across parts of the northeastern United States will stay home on Monday as a powerful winter storm forced school closures and pushed offices and transit systems onto emergency schedules, with officials across the region warning of heavy snow, strong winds and dangerous travel conditions.
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and ordered non-essential vehicles off city roads from Sunday night to noon Monday, saying plows and emergency crews needed the streets clear as snowfall intensified.
The city is under its first blizzard warning since 2017.
City offices will close for in-person services, and non-essential municipal employees may work remotely. “I’m urging every New Yorker to please stay home,” Mamdani said.
New York City, the nation’s largest school district, ordered all public school buildings closed for a traditional snow day, with no remote instruction and all after-school programs cancelled.
The storm has already snarled travel along the East Coast from Washington to New England, with airlines canceling thousands of flights and officials urging people to stay off the roads.
Winter weather in the Northeast may also slow the processing, transport and delivery of mail and packages, the US Postal Service said.



Regional emergencies
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had activated 100 National Guard members to assist in Long Island, New York City and the Lower Hudson Valley — areas expected to bear the brunt of the heavy snow and coastal winds.
The storm also forced closure of the United Nations (UN) headquarters complex in Manhattan on Monday.
Parts of the Northeast could see up to two feet of snow and wind gusts could reach 70 mph, raising the risk of falling trees and power outages, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
In an update on Sunday, the agency said despite its ongoing funding lapse, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (Fema) disaster‑response work continues uninterrupted, including staff travel, emergency operations, and critical assistance for people affected by active disasters, with life safety and property protection remaining top priorities.
Last week, Reuters reported that US President Donald Trump’s administration had ordered Fema to suspend the deployment of hundreds of aid workers to disaster-affected areas around the country while the DHS is shut down.



Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey declared an emergency and told state workers to stay home. Connecticut barred commercial vehicles from limited-access highways Sunday evening, exempting only emergency and essential deliveries.
New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill declared a statewide emergency effective noon Sunday and urged residents to take the storm seriously. “People need to take this very seriously,” she told CNN.
Travel disruptions
Air travel was among the earliest casualties. Flight-tracking site FlightAware showed more than 5,000 flights already canceled for Monday.
Aviation analytics firm Cirium said more than 25,000 flights were scheduled to depart from the United States on Monday, with cancellations also rising for Tuesday, especially at major Northeast airports.
NJ TRANSIT suspended bus, light rail and Access Link service Sunday evening and halted statewide rail service by Sunday night, with operations resuming only when conditions allow.
In New England, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority said it would suspend all service — including its RIde paratransit program — from Sunday night through Monday and would announce plans to resume service only when conditions improve.

“Pakistan has always chosen the path of dialogue and peaceful coexistence. But when Afghan soil continues to be used for proxy attacks, we have no choice but to defend our homeland. National security is non-negotiable,” Chaudhry said in a statement.
The PML-N MNA affirmed that the people of Pakistan “stand firmly” with their armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
He urged the Afghan government to take “decisive action to prevent its land from being used for cross-border militancy”, warning that lasting peace in the region depended on the “complete dismantling of terrorist sanctuaries”.
Noting that the recent operation “successfully neutralised militants involved in attacks on Pakistani soil”, Chaudhry stressed: “This action was aimed solely at those responsible for violent attacks inside Pakistan. Every precaution was taken to protect innocent lives.”
He also pointed to Afghanistan’s emergence as a “sanctuary for multiple terrorist groups”. Referring to a United Nations report, he noted that militants from 21 terror outfits were operating from Afghan territory, posing a serious threat to regional stability.
He specifically called out India’s “continued support for terrorist networks”.
“India is actively funding and training these groups, equipping them to carry out cross-border attacks against Pakistan. Such elements deserve no concessions,” the parliamentary secretary asserted.
His remarks came after Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation targeting groups responsible for recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.
The strikes killed “more than 80 terrorists”, according to security sources.
The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur, and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians. Authorities described the operation as intelligence-based and proportionate, aimed solely at those responsible for the attacks.
‘Decisive struggle against terrorism’
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi asserted that the country will “not allow our soil to be destabilised by forces operating from across the border in Afghanistan”.
In a post on X, he said: “The citizens of Pakistan, especially the resilient people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our armed forces and security institutions in the defense of our homeland.”
He further said: “The sacrifices of our martyrs bind us together as one nation. In this decisive struggle against terrorism, Pakistan stands united, resolute, and unwavering.
“Our sovereignty is non-negotiable, and the people of this country stand shoulder to shoulder with the state to protect it at all costs.”

In some towns, tourists and residents were urged to stay indoors, while truckers were advised to take safe routes or return to their depots until the violence abated.
Several airlines, including Air Canada, United Airlines and Aeromexico, on Sunday cancelled flights to Puerto Vallarta, a beachside resort town where stunned tourists filmed plumes of smoke rising into the sky from fires.
The burst of violence across more than half a dozen states painted a familiar scene for Mexicans who have spent two decades watching successive governments wage war on drug cartels, ravaging broad swaths of the country.
A member of Oseguera’s Jalisco New Generation Cartel told Reuters that the blazes and sporadic gunfire were carried out in revenge for the government’s killing of Oseguera, and warned of further bloodshed as groups move to take control of his cartel.

“The attacks were carried out in revenge for the leader’s death, at first against the government and out of discontent,“ the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“But later, the internal killings are coming, by the groups moving in to take over.”
In Mexico’s Pacific coast, a five-hour drive from the military operation in the town of Tapalpa that took down the leader of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, stunned beachgoers on a pier in Puerto Vallarta took out their cell phones to film thick waves of smoke obscuring blue ocean views, showed a video shared with Reuters.
Daniel Drolet, a Canadian who has wintered in Puerto Vallarta for years, said in a phone interview that he was concerned about a new era of violence taking root in the typically placid resort zone.
“I have never seen anything like this before,” he said.
In the state of Jalisco, authorities reported that gunmen had attacked a base for the National Guard military police, and recommended guests remain inside hotels and suspended public transit.
Other scenes of criminal activity and military response were captured in videos shared by government security sources with Reuters: A green military tank made its way through a residential neighborhood in the state of Aguascalientes.
Roadblocks paralyzed the highly transited Mexico-Puebla highway. In the state of Colima, cartel members standing in pick-up trucks blocked a road.
A trucking industry group said in a statement it was “profoundly worried” by the highway violence and recommended that truckers keep to safe areas or return to their operating yards until conditions improved.


People gather at the Guadalajara International Airport, as multiple flights are reportedly diverted or cancelled, following a military operation in which a government source said Mexican drug lord Nemesio Oseguera, known as “El Mencho,” was killed, in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, Jalisco, Mexico, February 22, 2026. —Reuters

The state of Guanajuato, a CJNG stronghold, reported 55 incidents across 23 municipalities, with 18 arrests, but said by evening all incidents were under control.
Carlo Gutierrez, who lives in Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital, said that friends on WhatsApp groups were encouraging people to stay home.
“There is fear and a lot of caution,” he said of the city, one of three main Mexican venues for World Cup soccer matches this summer.
Former cop turned kingpin
Oseguera, a former police officer, founded and oversaw the rapid rise of the CJNG, named for the western state of Jalisco that is home to one of Mexico’s biggest cities, Guadalajara.
In recent years, CJNG has expanded into one of Mexico’s most powerful cartels, known for violent tactics including forced labor and forced recruitment.
Under El Mencho’s leadership, CJNG also became a highly diversified criminal enterprise, expanding from drug trafficking to fuel theft, extortion, human smuggling, and complex financial frauds.

The cartel pioneered use of drones in attacks against civilians in remote regions of western Mexico as part of its rapid territorial expansion.
Sunday’s raid was one of Mexico’s highest-profile blows against drug gangs responsible for smuggling billions of dollars of drugs - including fentanyl - into the US.
In recent years, the leaders of the rival Sinaloa Cartel - Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada- were captured alive. Both are now in US prisons.
President Donald Trump’s administration lauded El Mencho’s killing, but the domestic violence it triggered highlighted the political balancing act Sheinbaum must strike as her government escalates its cartel offensive.
Security experts were watching whether the raid and death of the cartel boss will fracture CJNG leadership and trigger bloody infighting.
“There will definitely be skirmishes between the various factions, and these spasms of violence could last for years,” said Carlos Olivo, a former US Drug Enforcement Administration assistant special agent in charge and an expert in CJNG.
Violence in wake of cartel arrests, killings
Authorities have not reported any casualties beyond several cartel members and officials killed during the military operation.
Previous cartel arrests and killings have led to outbreaks of violence - whether by members avenging their fallen leader or rival gangs muscling in on their territory — prompting Mexican authorities to hesitate before launching major campaigns.

In 2019, Ovidio Guzman, a son of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, was detained but quickly released, setting off widespread gun battles. His arrest in 2023 set off more violence.
The 2024 arrest of Sinaloa Cartel boss Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada triggered a bloody power struggle in the criminal group that continues unabated more than a year later.
“I’m watching the scenes of violence from Mexico with great sadness and concern,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who previously served as ambassador to Mexico, in a post on social media.
“It’s not surprising that the bad guys are responding with terror. But we must never lose our nerve.”
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum in a social media post acknowledged the violence, but struck a tone of calm.
“In most of the national territory activities are happening with absolute normalcy,” she said.
Killing wins US praise
Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, previously ambassador to Mexico, said Oseguera’s killing was a “great development” for the US and Mexico, as well as the rest of Latin America.

In January after the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said “the cartels are running Mexico,” and warned “we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels.”
Sheinbaum said she would strengthen efforts to cooperate with the US to fight cartels., but vowed to uphold Mexico’s sovereignty and warned against any unilateral military action by the U.S. in Mexico.
Sheinbaum, in a social media post on Sunday, said security officials would provide information on the operation.</p><small>2026-02-23 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975119/delayed-appointment' target='_blank'><strong>Delayed appointment</strong></a><br><p>THE recent appointment of a chief election commissioner for Azad Jammu & Kashmir has once again shone a spotlight on the continuing delay in the appointment of a new CEC for the Election Commission of Pakistan. While the appointment was made more than a year after the office fell vacant, and uncomfortably close to general elections in the territory scheduled for July this year, the AJK process shows that constitutional offices can be filled smoothly when the state recognises its responsibility. It also raises the question: why has the federal government failed to do the same? Sikandar Sultan Raja’s five-year term expired on Jan 26, 2025. Although the 26th Constitutional Amendment allows an incumbent to continue until a successor is appointed, this provision was ostensibly aimed at preventing disruption in the ECP’s important functions, not justify prolonged inaction. Article 215(4) of the Constitution envisages that such vacancies should be filled within 45 days. That deadline passed about a year ago. The continued extension of the CEC’s expired tenure has only weakened the institutional credibility of the ECP and solidified perceptions that constitutional requirements have been rendered optional instead of binding.
These concerns have been magnified by the controversies that have surrounded the ECP in recent years. The conduct and timing of the 2024 general elections, decisions affecting the electoral participation of the PTI, and disputes over reserved seats all attracted criticism and formal litigation. The delay in fresh appointments to the ECP was previously attributed to legal and political hurdles that prevented the last opposition leader from working with the government. However, with the formal notification of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, the constitutional mechanism for consultation over the appointment is once again fully operational. The responsibility now rests squarely with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Mr Achakzai to begin formal consultations and agree on a mutually acceptable appointment. More delay will only be seen as political reluctance, which will reinforce perceptions of the ECP’s institutional fragility, deepen political polarisation and undermine public confidence in Pakistan’s floundering poll system. The PM and the leader of the opposition must, therefore, fulfil their obligation. A prompt and consensus-based appointment could restore confidence in the ECP and reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to democratic principles.
