India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions. A day ago, the PCA issued an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad today, the prime minister said: “I want to tell the enemy today that if you threaten to hold our water, then keep this in mind that you cannot snatch even one drop of Pakistan.”
The prime minister warned that if India attempted such an act, “you will be again taught such a lesson that you will be left holding your ears.”
 


The prime minister’s warning comes a day after former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the IWT’s suspension an attack on the Indus Valley civilisation and said the nation would not back down if New Delhi forced it into war.
“If war is waged, then from the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you,” he had said.
Similarly, while on a weekend visit to the United States, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir had reportedly warned that Pakistan would never allow India to choke the Indus River and would defend its water rights at all costs, even if the forces would have to destroy any controversial dam that India sought to build on it.
“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he reportedly told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”
Lauds role of minorities, announces laptop scheme
The prime minister also conveyed his wishes for Independence Day to the representatives of the Christian, Hindu, Sikh and Parsi communities present at the event.
“The brothers and sisters of the minority communities also played an integral role in the movement for Pakistan,” he said, adding that not only did they play a role in the founding of the country, but also played a role in its development of the country.
Speaking on the May conflict between Pakistan and India, the prime minister said: “The way we smashed the enemy in this conflict, they will remember it for a lifetime.”
He called upon the youth to play a role in the development of Pakistan and announced that 100,000 laptops would be distributed amongst the high achievers all over the country.</p><small>2025-08-12 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12184834e74409b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930456/24-arrested-as-several-injured-in-clash-during-protest-against-power-outage-in-kps-nowshera' target='_blank'><strong>24 arrested as several injured in clash during protest against power outage in KP’s Nowshera</strong></a><br><p>Twenty-four demonstrators were arrested after several people, including a police constable, were injured on Tuesday following a clash during a protest against power outages in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district.
A case was lodged by Station House Officer Aqib Khan at the Azakhel Police Station today under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 324 (attempted murder), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 427  (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The first information report (FIR) said that residents of Pirpai were protesting on the main Grand Trunk (GT) Road against excessive power outages.
“Police reached the scene upon hearing that the people had closed the road from both sides to protest against loadshedding,” the FIR reads.
It said that the protesters were led by the area’s local government representatives.
“Authorities held negotiations to open the road so that regular people would not face difficulty,” the FIR said, adding that the protesters did not disperse and began pelting stones and open firing at the police.
The firing resulted in injuring one police constable, it added.
The FIR named 24 protesters who were arrested, adding, “The remaining people, responsible for damaging public property and vehicles, managed to flee from the scene.”
A local activist present at the scene, Yasin Shah, told Dawn.com that several protesters were injured from police violence during the clash, adding, “They were just peacefully protesting for their rights and demanding a decrease in power outages.”
In June, protests against prolonged power outages erupted in different localities of KP, including Peshawar, Charsadda, Pejagi, Haji Camp and Sethi Town.
Last month, KP’s Special Assistant on Energy Tariq Sadozai urged the federal government to continue the collection of electricity duty through power bills on behalf of the province.
Sadozai said that in some instances, the government could not get electricity from cheap plants due to transmission constraints and was forced to purchase it from expensive ones. He said that the government should pay heed to addressing those issues to reduce power bills instead of violating the Constitution and bypassing the mandate of the Council of Common Interests.</p><small>2025-08-12 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121502181ea157d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930420/phc-halts-appointments-of-new-na-senate-opposition-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>PHC halts appointments of new NA, Senate opposition leaders</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate following the disqualification and removal of PTI’s Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz from their respective roles.
On August 5, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified Ayub and Faraz, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in three cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Subsequently, on August 8, both leaders were removed from their posts through notifications issued by the NA and Senate secretariats.
A division bench comprising Justices Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal took up separate petitions filed earlier today by Ayub and Faraz against the denotification of their parliamentary roles.
PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for both petitioners.
 
 

The bench issued notices to the ECP and other respondents, directing them to halt the appointments for the opposition leader in both houses of the parliament, which are currently vacant.
The court adjourned the hearing till August 15 (Friday), seeking replies from the respondents.
During the hearing, Gohar informed the bench of the details of recent developments. “When an MNA becomes the opposition leader, then the ECP’s role does not remain anymore,” he asserted.
“May 9 was an unfortunate incident, which should not have happened,” the PTI leader said. He contended that the ECP recently also disqualified MNA Abdul Latif from the NA-1 by “citing the wrong reference of the [2012] Azhar Siddique case”.
“We won 180 seats, entered the parliament with 90 seats, and are now left with 23,” the PTI lawyer lamented.
“Now the government wants to bring another party’s opposition leader,” Gohar claimed, requesting the court to issue directives to stop any further action against Ayub and Faraz.
A PHC bench comprising Justice Ali and Justice Farah Jamshed had also barred the ECP from taking any action against Ayub and Faraz on August 6, but to no avail since the order came a day after their disqualification.
The court had also granted the two leaders, as well as Zartaj Gul, protective bail till August 20.
Gohar laments ‘season of disqualifications’
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Gohar called for the “season of disqualifications” to come to an end.
“These disqualifications are not the solution to any issue,” the PTI leader emphasised. “I will request everyone to come to their senses now.”
Refuting reports of friction within the party leadership, he asserted: “There is no weakness in our team; we are being oppressed.”
Gohar also reaffirmed the PTI’s intention to stage gatherings across the country on August 14 to “celebrate Independence Day and raise voice” for ex-premier Imran Khan’s release, despite the government’s call to reschedule the protests.
 
 

A statement issued by the PTI and attributed to Imran has termed August 14 as the “next important day” of the party’s fresh protest movement.
However, Gohar also acknowledged the need for a dialogue to solve the ongoing political crisis.
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Ayub highlighted “rising” inflation in the country. “These people (government) are enjoying themselves by burdening the people of Pakistan,” he said.
He alleged: “There has been a scandal of more than Rs500 billion in the petroleum sector. There was another scandal worth Rs2,000bn which has come to light.”
Sentences against opposition pile up
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.
PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court on July 31 had senten­ced over PTI 100 leaders and workers to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the riots. Ayub, Faraz, PTI’s Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among the key opposition leaders handed rigorous imprisonment.
 
 

They were convicted under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in a case registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.
In another case registered at the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted.
In the case filed at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison and one person was handed a three-year jail term, while 77 were acquitted.
Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three cases.
The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.
 
 

Separately, on July 23, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at Sherpao Bridge. However, Qureshi and five others were acquitted.
The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced dozens of PTI leaders, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.
On December 21 and Dec 26 last year, a military court sentenced 85 civilians, including ex-premier Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
However, days later, the mercy petitions of 19 accused were later accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas had been processed to Courts of Appeal.
Issues of disqualifications, convictions can only be resolved by sitting down for talks: law minister
Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “Issues of disqualifications, convictions can only be resolved by sitting down for talks, not by waving documents in the air.”
Speaking in the Senate while addressing the opposition, Tarar said, “I will not go into debate on punishments, but on May 9, people saw Jinnah house burning.”
He added that if anyone commits a crime, there is a legal course which must be followed, and within that course, there are legal remedies like interim relief. “This is how the judicial system works,” he said.
He also spoke about PTI MNA Jamshed Dasti was provided relief by the Lahore High Court after his disqualification.</p><small>2025-08-12 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121809292a34ebd.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930460/35-police-personnel-suspended-in-gb-over-protest-for-daily-allowance' target='_blank'><strong>35 police personnel suspended in GB over protest for daily allowance</strong></a><br><p>Local police in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Hunza and Gilgit districts on Tuesday suspended 35 of their own personnel and halted their salaries after they staged a sit-in demanding benefits.
Last night, hundreds of police personnel, both men and women, protested in front of the Chief Minister’s House, demanding an increase in their daily allowances and continued the demonstration throughout the night.
In two separate notifications issued by the Reserve Police (RP) of Gilgit and the senior superintendent of police of Hunza, 26 police personnel were suspended in Gilgit yesterday, while nine more were suspended in Hunza today.
The notification issued by RP Gilgit cited “grave misconduct/violation of government servant conduct” as the cause of suspension, while the notification from the Hunza simply cited that they had participated in a protest.
Both notifications, copies of which are available with Dawn.com, added that the suspended personnel’s salaries had also been stopped.
The GB police claimed on social media that 63 personnel had been dismissed from service for breach of discipline, but no notification has been issued yet.
It also said that strict departmental action has been initiated against the personnel involved in a breach of discipline.
The department said that discipline was the “fundamental characteristic and key identity” of the police service, and that its violation would not be tolerated under any circumstances.
“Behaviours violating discipline will be dealt with strictly to maintain the transparency and efficiency of the institution,” it added.
Police officers had staged a separate sit-in two weeks ago. After failing to be dispersed by violent police action, they were persuaded to end the protest through negotiations.
However, due to a lack of progress and assurance that the issues would be resolved within the stipulated time, the protests began again last night.
The organisation of protesting police also announced that in the next stage of the protest, they would demand that security duties not be given to government officials, officers, religious figures and Chinese residents.
A sit-in protest by traders is also currently underway on the Karakoram Highway, entering its fourth week as of Sunday. The ongoing protest, which is against taxation policies and the suspension of customs clearance at Sost dry port, has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass.</p><small>2025-08-12 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12183300a501fed.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930465/pmd-forecasts-more-rains-thundershowers-across-country-from-aug-17-as-monsoon-activity-intensifies' target='_blank'><strong>PMD forecasts more rains, thundershowers across country from Aug 17 as monsoon activity intensifies</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday forecast widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers in most parts of the country in the coming days, with monsoon activity expected to intensify from August 17.
At least 312 people, including 142 children, have died and 740 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to updated daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country. The dead include 113 men, 57 women and 142 children, while the injured include 243 children, 209 women and 288 men.
In its latest weather advisory issued today, the Met Office said monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea were continuously penetrating the upper parts of Pakistan, while moist currents from the Bay of Bengal were likely to strengthen midweek.
A westerly wave currently affecting the region was also expected to intensify from Aug 17.
Under these conditions, rain-wind/thundershower with scattered heavy falls was expected in Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan from Aug 14 -17.
The wet spell was expected to last from Aug 18-21 in many northern areas, including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, and several districts of GB.
 






From Aug 18-21, KP would witness widespread rains, with heavy to very heavy falls in districts such as Dir, Swat, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Peshawar and Mardan.
Southern districts, including Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan, would also receive showers with occasional heavy spells.
Punjab, including Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Galliyat, Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot, and Faisalabad, was likely to experience heavy rains from Aug 18-21, with scattered activity in southern districts.
Parts of Balochistan, including Barkhan, Zhob, Khuzdar, Gwadar, and Panjgur, as well as several Sindh districts, including Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, and Tharparkar, were also expected to receive showers between Aug 18-22.
The PMD warned that heavy rains may generate flash floods in local streams and nullahs of KP, Murree, Galliyat, northeast Punjab and AJK from Aug 15-21, and hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern Balochistan from Aug 18-21.
Urban flooding was also expected in low-lying areas of Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Peshawar, and Nowshera during the same period.
Landslides and mudslides might disrupt roads in hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galliyat, and AJK, while heavy falls, windstorms, and lightning may damage weak structures such as rooftops, walls of mudhouses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
The public, travellers and tourists were advised to avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable areas and remain updated about the latest weather conditions.
All relevant authorities were urged to stay on high alert to prevent any untoward incidents.</p><small>2025-08-12 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121446342405144.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930408/pakistan-welcomes-us-designation-of-bla-majeed-brigade-as-foreign-terrorist-organisations' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan welcomes US designation of BLA, Majeed Brigade as foreign terrorist organisations</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Tuesday welcomed the US’ decision to designate the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade to its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list, according to a Foreign Office (FO) press release.
The US State Department made the announcement yesterday, stating that the designations demonstrated the US President Donald Trump’s commitment to counter-terrorism.
In today’s press release, the FO emphasised that Pakistan had proscribed the Majeed Brigade — BLA’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.  The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s list of proscribed organisations.
 






“BLA/Majeed Brigade is involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the heinous Jaffer Express terrorist incident and the Khuzdar bus attack that resulted in the loss of precious lives,” the release said.
At least 26 hostages lost their lives in the Jaffar Express attack in March, for which the BLA claimed responsibility. In the Khuzdar bus attack, 10 people — including two students — lost their lives during a suicide attack on a school bus in May.
The group was also behind the 2024 attack near the Karachi airport, which killed three people, including two Chinese nationals, as well as the Gwadar Port Authority Complex attack, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers.
“Pakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counter-terrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security.”
It added that the country remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. “Pakistan remains committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.”
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi welcomed the US decision and sincerely thanked US President Donald Trump and his administration.
“This is a major diplomatic victory for Pakistan and another defeat for our eternal enemy,” Naqvi was quoted as saying in a post on X by his ministry.
“This move by the US is an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s immense sacrifices in the war against terrorism,” adding that Pak-US cooperation against terrorism is welcome.
“A path has been created for action on a global level against the BLA and Majeed Brigade.”
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also welcomed the US’s decision while speaking to reporters at an event in Hyderabad.
He said organisations such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade used violence to target innocent civilians, especially hard-working labourers who went to Balochistan for work.
“When India and Pakistan fought a war, BLA and Majeed Brigade openly voiced support for Modi,” he said.
“Now the US has endorsed this point, which is a huge success for Pakistan.”
 






He noted that although it helps when other countries declare these groups as terrorist organisations, “we must try to declare it as such through the UN so that international financing, especially that of Indian intelligence agencies and facilitators, is tackled”.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that security sources said that Field Marshal Asim Munir’s recent visit to the US had significantly contributed to the global recognition of Pakistan’s stance on regional security and had once again “exposed India’s involvement in state-sponsored terrorism”.
According to the sources, “India’s covert support for terrorism has been brought to light through Field Marshal Munir’s successful military diplomacy.
“The US designation of BLA and the Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations is a direct outcome of the field marshal’s efforts.”
The sources emphasised that the US move to blacklist the BLA and Majeed Brigade as global terrorist organisations represented international validation of Pakistan’s position.
Security sources concluded by warning that India’s terrorist designs posed a serious threat not only to regional stability but also to global peace.
 






Islamabad had previously requested that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department labelled the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.
FTO designations are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.
SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under Executive Order 13224, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.</p><small>2025-08-12 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121456275402818.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930404/poliovirus-found-in-36pc-samples-across-87-nationwide-districts-tested-in-july' target='_blank'><strong>Poliovirus found in 36pc samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July</strong></a><br><p>The National Institutes of Health on Tuesday confirmed the presence of poliovirus in 42 of 117 sewage samples collected from 87 districts across the country in July.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a press release issued by NIH’s Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication, out of 127 sewage samples, the institute “confirmed 75 sewage samples as negative and 42 as positive”, while the remaining 10 were still being processed in the lab.
The positive results made up nearly 36 per cent of the total samples, compared to 32pc for June, based on NIH press releases.
However, the NIH said: “While the overall trend shows a decline in positive detections, reflecting the impact of high-quality campaigns, the virus continues to circulate in certain areas.”
“July data shows steady progress in containment,” it added.
Sindh reported the highest number of positive samples, with 19 positive samples out of 29 tested, followed closely by Punjab with 12 positive results out of 27.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, poliovirus was found in seven samples out of 31 sewage samples tested — equivalent to last month’s results but marking a sharp decline from 14 in January.
“Of these seven positive sites in July, three are from south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In Peshawar, four out of six sites tested negative,” the statement read.
Only one sample was found to be positive in Balochistan, down from four in June, while a whopping 22 results were negative. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, three out of the four samples were positive for the disease.
Four samples were under process in Punjab, three in KP, and one each in Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the NIH said.
The three sewage samples from GB and AJK have tested negative for the virus so far.
According to the latest data, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan, reported in 2025, stood at 19 — including 12 from KP, five from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and GB.
 
 

“Over the past year, the Pakistan Polio Programme has conducted six high-quality vaccination campaigns, four of them nationwide,” which aimed to vaccinate over 45 million children.
As per the press release, “These sustained efforts have significantly reduced both polio cases and positive environmental samples nationwide, demonstrating strong progress toward interrupting transmission.
“The next sub-national polio vaccination campaign is scheduled for September 1 – 7, 2025, which will aim to vaccinate 28m children across 91 districts in all provinces and regions,” according to NIH.
On July 3, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to intensify polio eradication efforts with the support of international, provincial, and local teams to achieve a polio-free country.
Last year, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-08-12 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121519344e3a397.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930419/strong-candidate-india-upbeat-about-2030-commonwealth-games-after-delegation-visit' target='_blank'><strong>‘Strong candidate’ India upbeat about 2030 Commonwealth Games after delegation visit</strong></a><br><p>Robust backing from the government and a desire to stage big-ticket events make India a strong candidate to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games, a top Indian Olympic Association (IOA) official told Reuters.
The world’s most populous nation is bidding for the 2030 edition of the Commonwealth Games in Ahmedabad to boost its bigger dream of hosting the 2036 Olympic Games at the western Indian city.
A Commonwealth Sports delegation visited Ahmedabad last week to share their experience from the previous Games and help the Indian organisers prepare a comprehensive bid to be submitted by the August 31 deadline.
“First and foremost, the mood of the country is upbeat for sporting activities and there is a strong will of the government to host global sporting events,” IOA executive council member Harpal Singh said by telephone.
“India wants to host larger sporting events — be it Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, or Olympics — and we have the full backing of the government.
“The existing infrastructure is very good, and the roadmap for future infrastructure gave a lot of confidence to the delegation.
“Overall, I would say India is a very strong candidate and we’ll be very competent to host the 2030 Games,” said Singh.
The IOA is not taking anything for granted, though, and is making sure Ahmedabad ticks every box to be unveiled as the host city at the Commonwealth Sport General Assembly in Glasgow in November.
“The delegation is looking into various issues — like sustainability, gender-balance and eco-friendliness,” said Singh, also a member of the sports committee of the Commonwealth federation.
“They are looking particularly into the sustainability issue. The Games has to be sustainable beyond 2030 and must also align with the UN sustainable development goals.
“It must inspire the youth of the Commonwealth community while showcasing our diverse culture.”
India hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, but the event was blighted by allegations of corruption and mismanagement.
The country is determined to make a better impression in 2030 to bolster its bid to host the Olympic Games six years later.
“We’ve not hosted (since 2010) a major sports event with so many countries across all six regions,” Singh said.
“So it will be a right step in that direction for our final dream of 2036.”
Canada and Nigeria are also in the fray to host the 2030 edition of the Games, featuring athletes from 70-odd Commonwealth nations and territories.</p><small>2025-08-12 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121346140a56925.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930407/fact-check-video-of-indian-army-chief-admitting-to-losing-6-jets-250-soldiers-during-may-conflict-with-pakistan-is-a-deepfake' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Video of Indian Army chief admitting to losing 6 jets, 250 soldiers during May conflict with Pakistan is a deepfake</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani users on social media platforms X and TikTok have been sharing videos since Monday that allegedly showed the Indian Army chief admitting to the loss of six jets and 250 soldiers in the recent military conflict against Pakistan. However, he made no such statement, and the viral video is a deepfake.
During the May 7–10, 2025, clashes between India and Pakistan, both sides issued conflicting claims about aircraft losses. Pakistan initially stated that it had downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7, later revising the figure to six, and claimed it had also destroyed India’s S-400 air defence batteries, unmanned aircraft, and disabled several Indian airbases. Pakistan denied losing any of its own aircraft during the fighting.
However, on August 9, Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh claimed that India had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other large aircraft, possibly a surveillance plane, mostly using its Russian-made S-400 missile system. He further alleged that Indian strikes had damaged additional Pakistani aircraft, including F-16s, while they were parked in hangars at airbases in Sindh and Punjab.
On August 11, a propaganda account on X shared a video claiming to show the Indian Army chief making a statement about heavy military losses.
The caption of the post said: “Breaking: Indian Army chief admits losing six jets and 250 soldiers in war against Pakistan.”
The transcript of the clip is provided below:
“Non-kinetic quadrant is something which you can start today, and the next war which we are looking at. It may happen soon, and we have to prepare accordingly, as already brought out by the director that in this we have to fight this battle together. This non-kinetic has to be fought together. We have already lost six jets and 250 soldiers, but we will never give up.
“We will learn. We have some deductions. So what are the deductions? That, as far as the whole nation’s approach will be there for the next war, it is not the military alone which will be fighting.
“Let me assure you very clearly this issue. As far as the grey zone is concerned, it is ever-present, and this will remain.”
The video gained 140,700 views.
The same clip, with a similar claim, was also shared by former provincial minister Jan Achakzai.
Multiple pro-military accounts shared the same claim as can be seen here, here and here.
Other X users also amplified the claim, with posts appearing here, here, here, here and here.
The same claim was also shared on TikTok.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the Pakistan-India conflict, particularly the issue of military losses.
Observing the clip showed that while the speech appeared normal at first, noticeable anomalies emerged around the 20-second mark. At this point, the lip-syncing became mismatched, the pace of the speech abruptly increased and the facial expressions appeared unnatural.
By the 26-second mark, the video returned to its normal state. These observations indicated that the segment between 20 and 25 seconds had been altered from the original speech.
For clarification, the complete speech of Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi was reviewed. The full video, dated August 10, 2025, was available on the Republic World YouTube channel, in which he was briefing the media about the India–Pakistan situation and addressing what he described as fake narratives.
 


At the 10:46-minute mark, General Dwivedi stated:
“Non-kinetic quadrant is something which you can start today, and the next war which we are looking at — it may happen soon, and we have to prepare accordingly. As already brought out by the director, in this we have to fight this battle together. This non-kinetic has to be fought together.”
His next sentence was: “So what are the deductions? That, as far as the whole nation’s approach will be there for the next war, it is not the military alone which will be fighting.”
The original speech did not have him saying anything about losing six jets and 250 soldiers.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows the Indian Army chief admitting to losing six jets and 250 soldiers in the recent conflict against Pakistan is false. The viral clip is a deepfake, and the Indian Army chief did not make such a statement.

Even though the 26th Amendment is still mired in controversy, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
With the 26th Amendment, the government introduced sweeping changes to the judicial framework. Sources had said certain contentious matters, such as a separate constitutional court, left unresolved in the 26th Amendment, would now be taken up in the new amendment.
Speaking to reporters in Hyderabad about the matter, Bilawal addressed the “baseless rumours”, stating: “So far, no federal minister, prime minister or party member has approached me regarding any amendments.”
He also highlighted that the 26th Amendment was passed after reaching a consensus with compromise from political parties. “PPP wanted constitutional courts, but we compromised,” he said.
In a post on X, the PPP quoted him as saying, “The 26th Constitutional Amendment is an eternal success. Judicial reforms and constitutional courts were a demand of the Charter of Democracy, but we prioritised a constitutional bench over a constitutional court for the sake of consensus.”
Though the speculations are rife, there has been no official word regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment. At present, the proposal to further reform the judiciary is at a very initial stage, but consultations are reportedly underway within the ruling PML-N and some legal circles. Despite these purported consultations, any draft for this proposed bill has yet to see the light of day.
 
 

On Sunday, PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser said that the party would approach the legal fraternity following “new drama” surrounding the legislation. “In this case, we will approach the lawyers’ community regarding this legislation,” he said, adding, “We will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.”
In June, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.
NFC award
While responding to a question about amending the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Bilawal said, “Absolutely. Further changes must come in NFC.”
He continued, “The previous NFC award was given before passing the 18th Amendment, which was before 2010.”
He said that various responsibilities of the federal government were handed to the provinces, adding, “But the NFC is the same as it was prior to the 18th Amendment.”
 
 

The PPP chairman continued, “The Constitution says that the NFC award must be regularly given after five years. It is already mentioned that the shares of provincial governments cannot be reduced in new NFC awards.”
“All provinces must be given more resources as per the increased responsibilities after the 18th Amendment.”
He added, “We must immediately call NFC and give new awards. All provinces must be given resources according to the 18th Amendment.”</p><small>2025-08-12 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1213204961b88b8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930394/new-unicef-representative-for-pakistan-reaffirms-commitment-to-protect-childrens-rights' target='_blank'><strong>New Unicef representative for Pakistan reaffirms commitment to protect children’s rights</strong></a><br><p>The newly appointed Representative of Unicef in Pakistan, Pernille Ironside, has reaffirmed the agency’s commitment to protect and uphold the rights of all children as she began her role in the country, it emerged on Tuesday.
The agency supports the government to “accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realise their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children”, Unicef Pakistan’s official website said.
After formally taking up the role, Ironside presented her credentials to Special Secretary (UN) Ambassador Nabeel Munir at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to a press release.
“During the meeting, Ms Ironside reaffirmed Unicef’s commitment to protect and uphold the rights of all children in Pakistan,” it read.
As the new Representative, she will provide “strategic leadership across Unicef’s country programme”, which “aims to nurture, educate, protect and support children from their earliest moments through adolescence” with a holistic approach.
Under her leadership, the agency will continue to support the government, delivering long-term development support and humanitarian assistance, the statement said.
“Key areas of focus include strengthening the education system to expand access and improve learning outcomes for children, enhancing maternal and newborn care, reducing child malnutrition, increasing access to safe water and sanitation, strengthening child protection, birth registration and gender equality, and protecting children from disasters, climate and environmental risks in Pakistan,” it added.
 






She was quoted as saying, “It is an honour to lead Unicef’s vital work for children in Pakistan. The needs of children are vast, and their potential is even greater.
“I look forward to building on strong foundations and working in close partnership with the government, UN and other development partners, civil society, the public and private sectors, and passionate child rights advocates. Together, we have a powerful opportunity to create positive, lasting change so that every child can truly thrive.”
The Unicef representative highlighted that nearly half of Pakistan’s population was under 18 and two-thirds were below age 30, holding “extraordinary promise”.
“This young population can be a catalyst for transformation. By investing in education, early childhood and neonatal care, nutrition, safe water, child protection, and increasing climate resilience, we can unlock the talent and creativity of children and young people to drive progress and prosperity,” she said.
“I look forward to leading Unicef’s mission and being a champion for every child.”
The press release also added that Ironside was a Canadian national with over 20 years of experience in international development, humanitarian action and child rights advocacy in diverse roles with Unicef.
She served as the deputy director of data, planning, analytics and monitoring at Unicef Headquarters in New York, deputy representative in Nigeria, chief of field operations in Iraq, chief of the Gaza Strip Field Office, senior global advisor on child protection in emergencies, child protection specialist in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, with additional deployments in Yemen, the Philippines and Pakistan.
Unicef’s ongoing initiatives in Pakistan currently benefit nearly six million children. These programmes aimed to protect children’s health, support their growth, enhance their skills, and empower them to realise their full potential, thereby contributing positively to Pakistan’s socio-economic development.
In May, the agency pledged support and protection for Pakistan’s children against the climate crisis and its impacts on their economic and social lives.</p><small>2025-08-12 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12133537e1c3202.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930386/cjp-afridi-questions-lhcs-final-observations-in-imrans-may-9-bail-cases' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi questions LHC’s ‘final observations’ in Imran’s May 9 bail cases</strong></a><br><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Tuesday raised questions over some observations made by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on former premier Imran Khan’s bail pleas in eight May 9 cases.
In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had denied Imran bail in the cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander.
The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also rejected by the LHC on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran moved the Supreme Court against the high court’s decision.
A three-member bench led by CJP Afridi, which also included Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the bail pleas today.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of Imran, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi was representing the state.
During the hearing, CJP Afridi took note of some “findings” issued by the LHC in its detailed verdict of dismissing Imran’s bail pleas.
 
 

“Can final observations be given in a case for bail?” the chief justice questioned rhetorically.
Based on the same principle, he said, “For now, we will not touch upon whether the findings in this case are right or not. We will not go into the legal matters at the moment.
“If we touch upon the legal findings, then the case for either [party] can be affected,” CJP Afridi explained.
He directed the counsels of both respondents to assist the court with legal questions and complete their preparations by the next hearing.
“The Supreme Court will not issue any such findings that may affect the case,” the top judge reiterated.
At one point, Safdar requested the court to allow him to speak at the rostrum but CJP Afridi denied that plea.
Subsequently, the bench issued notices to the Punjab government and adjourned the hearing till August 19.
‘Engineered and fabricated evidence’
A two-member bench of the SC had taken up Imran’s bail pleas on June 29, but adjourned the hearing without issuing notices as Safdar could not appear.
Imran’s appeal, filed through Safdar, claimed that the PTI founder has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.
However, at the time of the alleged offence, Imran was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible”, the petition argued.
On LHC’s rejection of the bail pleas, the fresh appeal claimed that the court relied on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.
In its detailed verdict, the two-member LHC bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Tariq Mahmood Bajwa observed that the prosecution had evidence that reflected Imran’s role in the violence that broke out on May 9 following his arrest.
The bench reproduced the statements of two police officials and prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended PTI’s meetings wherein Imran allegedly gave instructions to other leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The meetings were allegedly held at a rest area of Chakri, Rawalpindi, on May 4 and at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7-9, 2023.</p><small>2025-08-12 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12133807f028496.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930391/lahore-atc-orders-confiscation-of-properties-owned-by-dr-yasmin-rashid-other-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC orders confiscation of properties owned by Dr Yasmin Rashid, other PTI leaders</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Tuesday ordered the confiscation of properties owned by PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed a day after they were convicted in two May 9 cases.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill on Monday sentenced the four PTI leaders to 10 years in prison in the cases pertaining to the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House. The court, however, acquitted former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the cases.
Today’s hearing was also taken up by Gill, who ordered the confiscation of the convicted PTI leaders’ properties.
The judge issued jail warrants for the leaders and handed them to the jail superintendent.
In its verdict yesterday, the ATC had also fined Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rasheed Rs600,000. PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.
 
 

In a separate development today, Judge Gill ordered the release of Qureshi in the two cases.
“If Shah Mehmood Qureshi is not wanted in any other case, then he should be released,” Judge Gill said.
Despite the fresh acquittal, Qureshi will still not be released from jail as he has other cases pertaining to the May 9 riots pending before the courts.
On Saturday, the ATC had reserved its verdict in the two cases after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.
Last month, the Lahore ATC had acquitted Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p><small>2025-08-12 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30180744443de2b.gif?r=180757' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927616/when-zohran-mamdani-crashed-my-family-group-chat' target='_blank'><strong>When Zohran Mamdani crashed my family group chat</strong></a><br><p>Zohran Mamdani showed up in my family WhatsApp group. He also showed up in New York City politics, snatching a huge victory no one saw coming.
But his win wasn’t the point.
The point was that we had arrived — my family’s sudden competition to claim biradari with this kinetic smiling, charismatic new player. Could he be more than just a family friend? Could his family be in our faded photo albums? If we try hard, could he be a distant cousin?
The last time the lot of us were this giddy was, well, never. When was the last time a Kampala-born-desi-beard-trotting-Muslim had the white supremacists worried? Well, never.
More than just politics
All of us siblings were born in Kampala Nsambya Hospital. Like Mamdani’s family, Uganda is home. We have eaten its staple foods and lived its wars. For us, Zohran isn’t just a headline, and he certainly is not a meme. His dad, Mehmood Mamdani, was a friend of my dad’s since both were academicians — a visitor to our home, not just a name on a Wikipedia page. His mother, Mira Nair, filmed the critically acclaimed movie Mississippi Masala in Kampala’s streets. I’m hoping it’s true that we might’ve been extras behind Denzel Washington. No.
For us, Zohran is more than a fragment of the past; he is tracing the steps of historic exile routes our forefathers took in the chaotic aftermath of dictatorship and dispossession. Zohran’s ascent means more than just politics. It means we get to shape it. His proximity to power in America is where we can imagine a life where we immigrants weren’t kicked out on some nostalgia-driven nationalism. But we were, from India, Uganda, Pakistan, to now the United States, which reminds us of the Uganda of the 80s.
We pride ourselves on knowing men with unchecked anger. Idi Amin, the former Ugandan president whose shadow stretches long over Kampala’s vanished Asians, was our best prototype, against whom dutiful obedience was the only rational response.
 
 

Zohran Mamdani is helping us imagine a strange new world, Beatles style, where we didn’t have to be uprooted in the first place, nor silenced. A world where we are not just mentioned in the news, but are of it.
So no, our WhatsApp chatter is not delusional — we are rarely on the main stage like this. We get to be giddy. We will remain giddy. It is our time. The global muhajirs have the mic now.
The real political act
After generations of being on the margins of power, Mamdani’s mayoral campaign — a cocktail of audacity and humour — shook us to the core. He was not invited; he came anyway.
That is the real political act — not his win, but his irreverent entrance.
Conversely, the non-Mamdani rulebook of survival is — do not show up uninvited anywhere. When asked to leave, leave. If you’re built like us immigrants, you pour your identity hyphens into the American Dream. You show up for 50-hour workweeks, write a few books or make a few films, maybe save a life during a pandemic or build tech tools to improve tomorrow. You provide utility.
 
 

But run for office? Take on Trump? “To what end?” whispers my grandmother’s ghost.
If we wanderers take something on, we cannot come out as victims. In fact, we sort of hate victims of tyrants. We think it is a dumb way to die. We are the first to say we-told-you-so when they are squashed. Schadenfreude perhaps. We think that if an iron-fisted general wins and a revolutionary loses, that makes the most sense. Even if it is not moral, at least it is predictable.
Our elders survived through invisibility — never invited, never at any chief’s table, be it Ugandan, Pakistani, British or American. Even our nostalgia wears a warning label: “Things can always get worse than they already are.”
Strongmen do, however, lose their novelty after round one.
Idi Amin lost to Yoweri Museveni.
Others will lose it to others, over time.
Mamdani and the new America
Around 1990, as a kid, I may have handed welcome flowers to Museveni — Uganda’s current president — when he visited my father’s university. That was as close as my people had ever been to politics. Every revolution in our 35-year family home in Uganda left us with slogans to obey: “Uganda for Ugandans,” “Africa for Africans,” and for us ominously brown folk: “Shoot Asians at sight.”
Fear kept us small and silent.
Now that I’m in America, nostalgia is “Make America Great Again” hats and “Ultra MAGA” car stickers.
We are allowed to entertain. Our English has a lilt. Our self-deprecation fascinates. We’re exotic, right up until we’re too much — then it’s deportation notice: Next stop, South Sudan. That’s the game.
In this new America, Mamdani refuses to play.
He has gusto, he trolls the creeping-Shariah fearmongers and wields sarcasm like a shield. He called out Islamophobia in the press, poked fun at “go back to where you came from” by announcing that he is going back to Uganda. He went mocking up satirical magazine covers: “Kampala-etely Crazy!” Every insult he flipped became a lesson in not blinking. America’s youth, tired of being talked down, tuned in.
 






When American power flexes — defunds NPR, bullies universities for Gaza protests, scrubs aid records, calls off inconvenient investigations — you know for sure it is not democratic. We, the recovering targets of dictators, see it too clearly.
Mamdani has the legacy of that clarity, and he is undaunted. He’s marching where we used to tiptoe. We’re cheering, even if quietly, because he’s doing what we never dared to do. Nor would, frankly. The threat is not imagined; it is real.
But here’s the thing, assimilation is an illusion.
Even if you whisper, you get noticed; sometimes threatened, at times killed. My family learned this when gunmen broke into our house in Kampala’s peaceful teacher housing on campus, shot my mother near her foot, and just missed — “just” as a warning to stay in our place. From this incident, we learned that shrinking does not keep you safe.
The moment of revenge
How is Mamdani different from us lot?
He knows compliance does not guarantee safety. He knows that trying to act like the opposite of the brown savage stereotype will not spare you. The stereotype itself is a trap: perfect victims are easy targets. The world always prefers its brown people meek.
In fact, even brown people prefer brown people meek.
My two-decade-long Pakistani experiment taught me one thing — there is no room for a Mamdani among Pakistanis. They will be picked up and disappeared.
If there were a Mamdani way to do Pakistan, it would be to look like the power elite’s biggest nightmare (Ahmadi, Christian, Hindu, and Sikh), then step into office looking exactly like one.
Back to the real American contest: Not Democrat vs Republican, but David vs Goliath — we are always told ambition is dangerous, but without it, you become scenery.
Obama had his Americanism questioned. On CNBC, Colin Powell, the four-star general, was asked to answer if Obama had any Muslim ancestry at all: But instead, Colin Powell responded by pushing back on the indignity of the question: “So what if Obama is Muslim? Can’t he still be president?”
That’s America. That was 2008.
 


In 2025, Mamdani is that exact “what if?” kid — daring, public, and resolutely plural.
Our family, tucked safely behind digital borders, gives him the highest honour imaginable: thumbs-up emojis in our private group chat. When you win over the silent ones, you’re on to something.
America is not about this candidate’s win; sometimes it’s about who dares to try despite the threat. Mamdani raising his slingshot is a moment for every underdog.
Mamdani takes the hate, hears the death threats, but stands up to remind us that the world is not a monolith. He’s ready to pay the price for changing the narrative, and every family WhatsApp thread from Lyari to Kampala just got a little bolder, because he did.</p><small>2025-08-12 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121157441bd3a0b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930387/trump-signs-order-to-extend-china-tariff-truce-by-90-days' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order to extend China tariff truce by 90 days</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Monday ordered a delay in the re-imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese goods, hours before a trade truce between Washington and Beijing was due to expire.
The White House’s halt on steeper tariffs will be in place until November 10.
“I have just signed an executive order that will extend the tariff suspension on China for another 90 days,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. The truce on steeper levies had been due to expire on Tuesday.
 


While the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, bringing them to prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower them.
As part of their May truce, fresh US tariffs targeting China were reduced to 30 percent and the corresponding level from China was cut to 10pc.
Those rates will now hold until November — or whenever a deal is cut before then.
Around the same time that Trump confirmed the new extension, Chinese state media Xinhua news agency published a joint statement from US-China talks in Stockholm saying it would also extend its side of the truce.
China will continue suspending its earlier tariff hike for 90 days starting August 12 while retaining a 10pc duty, the report said.
It would also “take or maintain necessary measures to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures against the US, as agreed in the Geneva joint declaration,” Xinhua reported.
In the executive order posted on Monday to its website, the White House reiterated its position that there are “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits” and they “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”
The order acknowledged Washington’s ongoing discussions with Beijing “to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship” and noted that China has continued to “take significant steps toward remedying” the US complaints.
Trump-Xi summit?
“Beijing will be happy to keep the US-China negotiation going, but it is unlikely to make concessions,” warned William Yang, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.
He believes China sees its leverage over rare earth exports as a strong one, and that Beijing will likely use it to pressure Washington.
US-China Business Council president Sean Stein said the current extension is “critical to give the two governments time to negotiate an agreement” providing much-needed certainty for companies to make plans.
A trade deal, in turn, would “pave the way for a Trump-Xi summit this fall,” said Asia Society Policy Institute senior vice president Wendy Cutler.
But Cutler, herself a former US trade official, said: “This will be far from a walk in the park.”
 
 

Since Trump took office, China’s tariffs have essentially boomeranged, from the initially modest 10pc hike in February, followed by repeated surges as Beijing and Washington clashed, until it hit a high of 145pc in April.
Now the tariff has been pulled back to 30pc, a negotiated truce rate.
Even as both countries reached a pact to cool tensions after high level talks in Geneva in May, the de-escalation has been shaky.
Key economic officials convened in London in June as disagreements emerged and US officials accused their counterparts of violating the pact.
Policymakers met again in Stockholm last month.
Trump said in a social media post on Sunday that he hoped China will “quickly quadruple its soybean orders,” adding that this would be a way to balance trade with the US.
 


China’s exports reached record highs in 2024, and Beijing reported that their exports exceeded expectations in June, climbing 5.8pc year-on-year, as the economic superpower works to sustain growth amid Trump’s trade war.
Separately, since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has slapped a 10pc “reciprocal” tariff on almost all trading partners, aimed at addressing trade practices Washington deemed unfair.
This surged to varying steeper levels last Thursday for dozens of economies.
Major partners like the European Union, Japan and South Korea now see a 15pc US duty on many products, while the level went as high as 41pc for Syria.
The “reciprocal” tariffs exclude sectors that have been targeted individually, such as steel and aluminum, and those that are being investigated like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
They are also expected to exclude gold, although a clarification by US customs authorities made public last week caused concern that certain gold bars might still be targeted.
Trump said on Monday that gold imports will not face additional tariffs, without providing further details.
The president has taken separate aim at individual countries such as Brazil over the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of planning a coup, and India over its purchase of Russian oil.
Canada and Mexico come under a different tariff regime.</p><small>2025-08-12 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121155176c766fb.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930384/italian-athlete-dies-at-world-games-in-china' target='_blank'><strong>Italian athlete dies at World Games in China</strong></a><br><p>Italian orienteering athlete Mattia Debertolis died on Tuesday at the World Games in Chengdu, China after collapsing during competition, organisers said.
Debertolis, 29, was found unconscious during an orienteering event on August 8 and died four days later, said a joint statement from World Games organisers and the International Orienteering Federation (IOF).
The World Games is a multisport event held every four years for disciplines not included in the Olympics.
“Despite receiving immediate expert medical care at one of China’s leading medical institutions, he passed away,” the statement said.
It did not provide details on the cause of death.
Orienteering sees athletes navigate an unmarked course with a map and compass, punching in at designated spots along the route in the quickest time.
The event, held about 50 kilometres outside of central Chengdu, took place in intense heat and humidity, with temperatures above 30 degrees.
Debertolis, from Primiero in eastern Italy, was taking part in the final of the men’s middle-distance event when he collapsed.
The six-km course featured 180m of ascent and 20 control points that athletes must visit.
Footage from the World Games’ social media accounts showed athletes running through crop fields and villages on a largely rural course.
The winner, Switzerland’s Riccardo Rancan, completed the course in 45 minutes and 22 seconds.
“I needed to acclimatise quickly with hot and humid conditions. I think I managed quite well,” Chinese state media quoted Rancan as saying.
Debertolis was listed as “Did Not Finish” in official results, along with 11 other athletes.
He was ranked 137th in the men’s Orienteering World Rankings and had been competing since 2014, according to the IOF website.
He participated in several World Championships and World Cups as part of the Italian team.
Alongside his training, Debertolis was studying for a PhD at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he lived.
This is the 12th edition of the World Games and it runs until August 17, with approximately 4,000 athletes competing in 253 events.
The men’s middle-distance orienteering was the first medal event of the Chengdu Games.
World Games organisers and the IOF were “struck by this tragedy and extend their heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the athlete and the whole orienteering community”, the joint statement read.
“Our thoughts are with those touched by this event.” Organisers will “continue to support the family of Mattia Debertolis and the orienteering community in every possible way”, it added.</p><small>2025-08-12 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1211331786bcf49.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930380/another-3-terrorists-eliminated-in-zhob-anti-infiltration-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Another 3 terrorists eliminated in Zhob anti-infiltration operation</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have eliminated another three terrorists attempting to infiltrate via the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan’s Zhob district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
The military’s anti-infiltration operation, which began on the night of August 7, has so far killed 50 terrorists.
“On night [of] 10/11 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along [the] Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a press release.
“During the conduct of the operation, three more Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed khawarij,” the ISPR added.
 






Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR highlighted: “The number of khawarij killed in four days’ anti-infiltration operation has risen to 50.”
It noted that “47 khwarij were sent to hell” previously, following successful engagements by the security forces in the general area Sambaza of Zhob from August 7 to 9.
The military also shared collages of images showing an aerial view of the eliminated terrorists — all 50 of them numbered — as evidence.
 
 

“The security forces remain committed to secure the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,” the military reaffirmed.
Just a day ago, the US State Department designated the banned so-called Balo­chistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its combat wing, the Majeed Brig­ade, as a Foreign Terr­­orist Organisation.
The US said the move, long-desired by Pakistan, demonstrated its commitment to countering terrorism, while signalling strengthened cooperation and international coordination in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-08-12 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1210455481a52ab.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930260/protests-erupt-against-razing-of-mosque-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Protests erupt against razing of mosque in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Various religious groups joined hands on Monday to protest against the demolition of a mosque in the capital.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) along with other groups held a protest at the site of the demolished Madni mosque near Rawal Dam Chowk. The protesters also uprooted the saplings planted by the CDA on the place. The mosque had been demolished late Saturday night.
The JUI-F Member of National Assembly, Naeema Kishwar, also submitted a resolution condemning the demolition of Madni mosque.
 






Addressing the protesters, JUI-F Islamabad chapter Emir Mufti Owais Aziz announced that legal proceedings would be initiated against the demolition of the mosque. He said the government was planning to raze 50 mosques in Islamabad and vowed to resist the move.
He said the religious groups have unanimously agreed to get an FIR registered against Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and other officials under blasphemy laws.
“If the police refuse to register the case, we will consider them enemies of Islam,” Mufti Owais Aziz said, adding that razing mosques overnight was an act of hostility towards Islam.

He further said the Frontier Corps was illegally occupying greenbelts along Embassy Road and Margalla Road.
“While the mosques are being demolished in the name of beautification, no action was taken against the illegal occupation by FC on these prime roads,” he questioned.
As tension flared, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, along with commissioner Islamabad, inspector general of Islamabad police and deputy commissioner held negotiations on Sunday night with a delegation of clerics led by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidari. The delegation also included the leader of the Islamabad chapter of the proscribed Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan.
The statement issued by the JUI-F said it had been agreed that further progress would require 48 hours, and a final decision would be made after meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
Amid threats of violent protests by the clerics, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said spreading baseless rumours about madressahs and mosques was incorrect.
In a statement, he said the madressah located on Murree Road was relocated with the consent of its administration.
“A modern-style facility has been constructed on the new site at a cost of Rs40 million, which provided high-quality accommodation, meals and religious education to around 200 students,” the minister said in a statement.
He emphasised that any relocation of madressahs or mosques situated on greenbelts or unauthorised land would only be carried out in consultation with religious scholars and the administration.
Meanwhile, fire band cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz has issued a call for jihad and announced the launch of a civil disobedience movement against the government in response to the demolition of the mosque.
A video statement released by the Maulana showed him sitting inside Lal Masjid with a gun on his lap, hurling threats at the government.

During a debate on the law and order situation in the province with Speaker Babar Saleem Swati chairing the session, Mr Baz of the opposition Awami National Party insisted that the people displaced from his district due to a military operation against terrorismfaced multiple problems due to the government’s failure to cater for them.
He said that neither the provincial government nor the federal government had made any arrangements to meet the needs of displaced residents.
Mr Baz urged authorities to lift curfew to enable people to shift to safety.

Opposition demands end to curfew to help residents move to safety

“Almost the entire population is literally hostage to the curfew, which halted their migration. It’s astonishing why the government has imposed curfew in a situation when the people were relocating to safe areas,” he said.
The opposition lawmaker said that the displaced people were making arrangements on the self-help basis, with help coming in from some local political parties.
He complained that the government’s machinery was not visible in the critical situation. Mr Baz also said thatthe residents were struggling to move to safety due to a shortage of transport vehicles.
Mr Baz said thatthe displaced people had taken shelter in schools, while some had installed tents.
He complained that those residents lacked access to basic facilities, including food. He asked the provincial government on whose direction the curfew was imposed.
Ahmed Karim Kundi of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party said thatthe provincial government should clarify its position on the claim of interior minister Mohsin Naqvi that Chief MinisterAli Amin Gandapur was “giving extortion money”to terrorists.
“If terrorists are receiving extortion money from the chief minister, what will be the state of the common man’s security in this province?”
The opposition member said thatthe provincial government should reveal where it had utilised Rs700 billion received for fighting terrorism since 2010. He said thatthe province would getRs130 billion for the same purpose in the current financial year.
Mr Kundi said that the province’s people had lost trust in the chief minister about the law and order situation, especially in Bajaur district, as he had changed his statements about it multiple times.
“The chief minister issues one statement during meetings with those at the helm of affairs but releases another when in public,” he said.
The opposition lawmaker demanded that the chair forma house committee with representation from both treasury and opposition benches to make recommendations on the law and order situation after consulting all stakeholders.
Housing minister Dr Amjid supported the idea and said thatits recommendation should be taken up with Peshawar’s corp commander and the premier intelligence agency sector commander, who should also be called to the provincial assembly for a briefing on the security situation in the province.
Member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-InsafMalik Adeel Iqbal said thathis party always opposed military operations in the province because it made people stand against security forces.
He said that all controversial issues should be resolved through the traditional jirga system and talks. The chair later adjourned the session untilTuesdaydue to a lack of quorum.

According to CCD sources, the suspect ‘M’, a refrigerator mechanic residing in Kot Khan Muhammad locality on Satiana Road, had allegedly been raping minor boys and girls at gunpoint.
The sources say the suspect would also record videos while raping children through secret cameras and later blackmail the victims. More than two dozen pornographic videos of eight to 12-year-old children were recovered from his mobile phones, besides other objectionable and obscene videos.
The sources say that around a year ago, the suspect was caught red-handed raping a child, after which he fled to Multan. However, he returned to Faisalabad after six months and again raped an eight-year-old girl and made her pornographic videos.
According to sources, the suspect had also allegedly electrocuted 10-year-old Shoaib after raping him some years ago. The CCD arrested the suspect on a tip-off.

Pakistan’s basmati rice exports have witnessed steady growth in recent years. According to the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP), the country exported approximately 772,725 tonnes of basmati rice in FY24, generating $876.9m — up from 595,120 tonnes worth $650.4m in the previous fiscal year. The average export price per tonne also increased from $1,092.93 to $1,134.86.
Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform shows that between November 2023 and October 2024, the United States accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports through 1,519 shipments. Italy and the United Kingdom followed with shares of 14pc (908 shipments) and 11pc (716 shipments), respectively.
 
 

Together, these three markets consumed nearly 49pc of Pakistan’s basmati rice exports. Pakistan currently exports basmati rice to over 110 countries, with other key destinations including Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Basmati exports rose 35pc in FY24 to 772,725 tonnes, earning $876.9m

According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), rice imports in the US have grown steadily over the past three decades — from 7pc of the domestic market in 1993/94 to over 25pc by 2022/23. Over 60pc of these imports consist of aromatic varieties from Asia, mainly jasmine from Thailand and basmati from India and Pakistan.
While the US produces some aromatic rice domestically, these differ in quality and aroma from their Asian counterparts. The USDA projects continued growth in demand for aromatic rice imports in the coming years.
The tariff dispute emerged from US punitive measures targeting India’s trade and energy ties with Russia, resulting in broad tariffs on several Indian exports, including basmati rice, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Although some sectors later received exemptions, basmati rice remained subject to the full 50pc tariff. In contrast, Pakistani basmati rice continues to face a lower tariff of 19pc, giving it a distinct pricing advantage in the US market.
Indian media reports suggest that the tariff hike could reduce India’s basmati exports to the US by 50-80pc, with prices climbing to nearly $1,800 per metric tonne. Pakistani basmati, by comparison, remains priced at around $1,450 per metric tonne, making it more competitive for US importers and retailers.
Retailers across the US are already reporting increased interest in Pakistani basmati rice. Khan Mohammed, a salesman at Super Halal grocery in Springfield, Virginia, noted: “Pakistani rice is already popular.

The investigating officer of the case brought the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought his custody for 14 days for interrogation.
He informed the court that as per initial inquiry the suspect did not possess a licence to drive a heavy vehicle. He said he only had the licence to drive light transport vehicles (LTV) and that too had expired in 2016.
The IO asked for more time to get information regarding the owner of the dumper — involved in the accident — as well as need to verify the documents of the suspect.
After hearing the IO, the court remanded him in police custody for two days and directed him to submit a progress report at the next hearing.
Body formed to probe arson attacks
A high-powered committee was formed to investigate arson attacks, where miscreants torched seven dumpers after the fatal accident.

Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi are already facing imprisonment in connection with the same case.
The auction took place at the Patwar office in Bhara Kahu, overseen by an auction committee in the presence of Assistant Commissioner Secretariat Uzair Ali. The agricultural land, measuring 405 kanals and three marlas, located in Mohra Noor, was auctioned for Rs3.42 million per kanal.
In contrast, investors showed no interest in land owned by another absconder in the case, Farhat Shehzadi alias Farah Gogi. Her property, also located in the revenue estate of Mohra Noor in the Bani Gala area, remained unsold.
Earlier in the day, rumors circulated regarding the possible auction of Imran Khan’s Banigala residence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja tweeted at 11:50am about the alleged auction, expressing concern that if the news was true, it would have been a secretive process. He promised to verify and share accurate information.
 






Two hours later, at 2:15pm, Mr Raja tweeted an update, stating that according to information gathered by PTI’s legal team regarding NAB reference 19/2023 — the state vs. Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case — the auction was related to the properties of other accused who have been declared absconders. “Our legal team is keeping an eye on this issue,” he added.
 






Despite repeated efforts, Dawn was unable to confirm the identity of the successful bidder for Ali Riaz Malik’s land at the time of filing this report. At least two government officials contacted said they were unaware of the buyer’s name. “I have no idea who the successful bidder is, as the transfer deed is yet to be completed,” one official stated.
Recently, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) also conducted a public auction of six commercial properties linked to Malik Riaz and Bahria Town, as part of efforts to recover unpaid amounts related to the Al-Qadir Trust case.
These properties included five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad. Of the six, three were successfully auctioned: Rubaish Marquee sold for Rs508m, while Corporate Office-I and Corporate Office-II received conditional bids of Rs876m and Rs881.5m, respectively.

In a report by correspondents in Islamabad, New Delhi and Washi­ngton, the FT described what it called an “unexpected resurgence” in relations between Islamabad and Washington. The newspaper said Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir has twice been received in high-level settings in the US this summer,  most recently in Florida, where he attended the retirement ceremony of Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command.
According to the  FT, Munir also met President Trump in June for a two-hour private lunch,  just a month after Pakistan and India experienced their bloodiest confrontation in decades. The meeting was notable given Mr Trump’s  earlier public criticism of Pakistan.
Michael Kugelman, a non-resident senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation, told the FT:  “What’s happening in US-Pakistan relations is a surprise. I would describe the relationship now as one that’s enjoying an unexpected resurgence, even a renaissance. Pakistan has very successfully  understood how to engage with such an unconventional president.”
The FT attributed the change in tone to a diplomatic strategy by senior Pakistani officials, combining counterterrorism cooperation, outreach to individuals in Mr Trump’s business network, and agreements involving energy, mineral resources and cryptocurrency. These moves, it said, were accompanied by positive messaging towards the White House.
A key development cited in the report was the March arrest and transfer to US  custody of an ISIS-K suspect alleged to have organised the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. Mr Trump publicly commended Pakistan for the arrest in his State of the Union address.
 
 

The newspaper also detailed an April agreement between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency initiative, and Pakistan’s crypto council. One of the venture’s co-founders remarked during a visit to Pakistan on the scale of the country’s mineral resources.
 
 

On the regional response,  the FT said India reacted with “deep irritation” to the warming of ties,  particularly after facing a US tariff increase to 50 per cent, while Pakistan’s rate was set at 19 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi  disputed Mr Trump’s assertion that the US had mediated a May ceasefire between the two countries, with New Delhi emphasising that the agreement had been reached through direct channels between their armed forces.
