<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20145116dc56f0b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932049/unending-misery-for-many-karachiites-as-city-receives-rain-for-second-day' target='_blank'><strong>Unending misery for many Karachiites as city receives rain for second day</strong></a><br><p>Power was nearly restored across the city, and only a few roads had remained inundated after Tuesday’s heavy downpour before a late evening spell of heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds on Wednesday interrupted Karachiites’ hopes for a quick return to normalcy.
Tuesday’s rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupted industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet services outages which continued late into Wednesday, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery. Due to the severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration had anno­unced a public holiday in the city today.
 


Shortly after 2:30pm, rainfall was reported in Saddar, Malir, Malir Cantonment, Scheme 33, Gulistan-i-Jauhar Block 2, and near I.I. Chundrigar, Kala Pull Road, and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College (JPMC). Another spell dumped more rain on the city in the evening, triggering power outages even in areas where electricity had previously been restored.
By 8pm, Orangi Town had recorded the heaviest showers, receiving 37 millimetres in total from the two spells. The PAF Faisal Base on Sharea Faisal followed with 32mm, while Jinnah Terminal measured 18mm. Keamari received 13mm, and the Airport Old Area saw 11mm of rainfall. Other parts of the city experienced lighter showers, including Korangi with 6.8mm, the Met Office station on University Road with 7.6mm, Nazimabad with 2mm, the PAF Masroor Base in Karachi West with 2mm, and Surjani Town with 1.8mm. Several areas, such as Gulshan-e-Hadeed, Gulshan-e-Maymar, Saadi Town, and Bahria Town, recorded negligible or no rain during this period.
In an alert issued at 3pm, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had warned that rains with thunderstorms and strong winds were expected at most places in Karachi and its surrounding areas in the next two to four hours, while heavy showers were also forecast at some locations.
Warning of the risk of increased urban flooding, the PMD had advised the public to take necessary precautions and remain alert.
 






In a post on X, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab warned citizens: “It is expected to rain again from 2pm onwards. I would request people to avoid movement and if it starts to rain, please stay put where you are whether it is your office or residence.”
 






“We are expecting more intense rains,” Anjum Nazir, a spokesperson for Sindh’s meteorological department, as quoted as saying by Reuters.
NDMA warns of more rainfall
The NDMA’s National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday afternoon warned of heavy rainfall of 50-100 millimeters or more in parts of Sindh over the next 12 to 24 hours, highlighting the risk of urban flooding, waterlogging and disruptions to daily life.
A spokesman for the NDMA advised residents in vulnerable areas — including Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, and adjoining regions —to remain alert and closely monitor official updates to mitigate potential hazards.
The NDMA said urban flooding was expected to persist in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Mirpurkhas due to continued downpours and poor drainage infrastructure.
The authority warned that disruptions in power and telecom services were likely. Citizens were encouraged to stay informed through verified official sources and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities.
Electricity outages
In an update at 1:30pm, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said the company’s generation, transmission and distribution system was stable, with power supply continuing in the city through more than 2,000 of 2,100 feeders.
“As soon as rainwater drainage is completed and safety clearance is received from ground teams, the few remaining areas will also be restored soon,” he said, adding that the areas where power was being restored included Saima Pari Centre in Surjani Town; KDA Apartments; Hill View Apartments; Blocks A, C, D, I, J, K, R, and S in North Nazimabad; Block 10-A in Gulshan-i-Iqbal; Murtaza Chowrangi; Sector 21, and Sector 29 in Korangi, and Khyaban-i-Shamsheer, Shaheen, Gizri Boulevard and Commercial Street 1 to 4 in Defence Housing Authority.
“The public is urged to maintain safety precautions. Stay away from electrical installations and poles and exercise caution when using electrical appliances.
“In case of emergency complaints, contact the 118 call centre,” the spokesperson said.
 






In an update at 3:50pm, the Karachi Traffic Police said the following roads and underpasses were closed for traffic due to rainwater accumulation.
Shaheed-i-Millat Underpass at Tariq Road and Drigh Road Underpass towards the airport in District East; Nazimabad No. 1 and 2 underpasses, Liaqatabad No. 10 Underpass, Gharibabad Underpass and Sohrab Goth Underpass in District Central; both roads coming and going towards Qayyumabad at Korangi Crossing and both roads coming and going towards Korangi at EBM Causeway in Korangi District.
“The public is requested to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience and trouble. In case of any emergency, contact the traffic helpline 1915.”
 






The Sindh government had ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed today, after Wahab declared a rain emergency. However, Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah rebutted a “fake” notification of school closures for tomorrow and Friday, clarifying that the government had not issued any such directives yet.
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah⁩ chaired a meeting on Karachi’s rain situation.
“More rain expected, municipal and emergency teams are on alert. Continuous efforts underway for drainage and rescue operations,” said a post on his X account. It noted that 26 de-watering pumps had been deployed citywide to “ease flooding”.
 






CM Shah also visited Sharea Faisal and the Nursery area, where he spoke to the media and highlighted that the effects of climate change were visible around the world.
“Rainwater accumulated in the city, but you can see that the nullahs are flowing,” he said, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
“Did the nullahs get cleared within a night? No, the Sindh government had been working on it. But the media was saying that the city had drowned and the administration was not present, which is wrong.
“The entire city administration, municipality corporation’s staff, and I myself are on the streets,” the chief minister added.
State broadcaster PTV News uploaded a post to X stating that the Pakistan Army was continuing relief and rescue efforts in the wake of heavy rainfall in Karachi.
“Due to continuous rain, many vehicles were rescued with the help of [the] Pakistan Army’s relief vehicles,” the post said, adding that elderly people and children were shifted to safe locations by Pakistan Army personnel.
The post included a video showing army personnel working with civil personnel and towing stranded vehicles with heavy trucks.
 






Inundated roads as mayor stresses ‘climate change is a reality’
Floodwater was still accumulated on multiple roads across the city, including near I.I. Chundrigar Road, as Karachi did not witness any further rain till at least 2pm.
While the traffic police listed 10 bypasses and three main roads as being closed till at least 12pm due to urban flooding, Wahab presented a contrasting picture on his social media accounts, sharing videos of only those routes that were clear for vehicles.
The PPP mayor shared videos shot from inside a car of a drive along the Sher Shah Suri Road, Submarine Underpass, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Liaqatabad No. 10 leading to Daak Khana, which did not have any rainwater in the videos.
 

This Google Map screengrab shows road blockades across Karachi on Aug 20, 2025 as of 4:50pm, a day after heavy rainfall led to flooding in various areas.

In a post on X, Wahab urged citizens not to use Shaheed-i-Millat Road at the moment as “work is being carried out to clear the underpasses”. He suggested using Stadium Road or Shahrah-i-Quaideen as alternative routes.
 






Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Wahab said: “Climate change is a reality. If you want to make someone a target of criticism and say whatever you want, you can. But, you can see how huge a challenge climate change is for any government, state, or administration around the world.”
Noting that Pakistan faced “different challenges” from the developed countries, the PPP mayor said climate change had wreaked havoc in other parts of the country too in recent weeks.
He underscored that people had two options: either change their behaviour to combat climate change, or criticise others. He compared yesterday’s torrential rains in Karachi to those that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, other northern areas and Islamabad faced this monsoon.
Wahab detailed that there were two rain spells on Tuesday, with the first one ending by 9:30am, allowing the city administration to work on removing the rainwater. “By 12:30pm, the situation had been fixed and the main arteries of your city were open.”
 
 

However, the second spell began at around 1:15pm and continued “non-stop” till 6pm, the PPP mayor highlighted. Even after that, rain continued “on and off” till around 8pm with each spell lasting 10 to 12 minutes, Wahab added.
Noting that 235 millimetres of rain occurred in only Manghopir in 12 hours yesterday, Wahab stressed that Karachi’s nullahs had a capacity of 40mm so rainfall above that would result in a spillover effect. He asserted that a nullah situated in the Nursery area was fully functional and had no blockage.
Rain started again while Wahab was holding the media talk, with the mayor saying he was ready to continue the press conference in the same outdoor setting, and later pushed back an umbrella someone else was holding for him.
According to the rainfall record issued by the PMD at 8am for the previous 24 hours, Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the highest amount of rain (178mm), with Keamari following close (173mm).
Airport Old Area recorded 164mm of rain, Jinnah Terminal 156mm, Nazimabad 150mm, Surjani Town 151mm, North Karachi 149mm, Saadi Town 146mm, DHA Phase 7 138mm, Met Office at University Road 145mm, Korangi 139mm, PAF Faisal Base at Sharea Faisal 133mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar (Jamia Rasheed) 103mm, PAF Masroor Base (Karachi West) 101mm, Orangi Town 81mm and Bahria Town witnessed the lowest 5mm.
 






Deaths from rain-related incidents rise to 8
According to separate statements issued by Karachi Rescue 1122, two more people died in rain-related incidents, in addition to yesterday’s six deaths.
Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of a 50-year-old man, identified as Abbas Mohsin, who went missing in a nullah near the Gurumandir area yesterday, Rescue 1122 said. His body was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).
 
 

In Defence Housing Authority’s (DHA) Phase 5, Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Yasir, after being informed about an electrocution incident. The man’s body was shifted to the JPMC.
A man and a woman were injured after part of an old building collapsed in the Ranchore Line area, a statement from the Edhi Rescue service said. Both were taken to CHK in an ambulance.
According to statements by Sindh Rescue 1122, “several people” were rescued from Karachi’s Sukhan Nadi, while 18 men and 12 women were evacuated safely from a call centre in PECHS Block 6 after they were trapped there due to rainwater accumulated inside the building.
Among the six people who died yesterday were four members of a family who lost their lives after the walls of a house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12 collapsed during the heavy rain. According to a JPMC statement, a boy aged between two to four years and a six to seven-year-old girl were among the deceased, while a fifth relative was injured.
In another similar incident in Orangi Town, an eight-year-old child lost his life. An unidentified man, aged 20-24 years, died in a suspected electrocution case in DHA’s Phase 7.
Yesterday’s rains severely flooded Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road, and I.I. Chundrigar Road, with hundreds of cars and motorcycles submerged and commuters stuck in traffic jams for several hours. Many had to wade through waist-deep water in the business district as they tried to return home.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept across the city, plunging several areas into darkness. Even upscale neigh­bourhoods, such as DHA and Clifton, were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the residents’ misery.
The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport were also affected, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to an alternative airport due to inclement weather.
More rains expected in Sindh, Balochistan
The PMD has forecast torrential rains in Sindh, parts of Balochistan, and other regions of the country in the coming days, advising the provincial disaster management authorities to make necessary arrangements.
According to the PMD, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Karachi, Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar and Jamshoro.
Scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
 






In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro.</p><small>2025-08-20 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201929340437a51.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932084/pakistan-mens-t20-squad-arrives-in-dubai-ahead-of-asia-cup-tri-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan men’s T20 squad arrives in Dubai ahead of Asia Cup, tri-series</strong></a><br><p>The national men’s T20 squad arrived in Dubai for the upcoming Asia Cup and Tri-Nation series, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Wednesday.
The tri-series against Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, which starts on August 29, and the Asia Cup from September 9 will both take place in the UAE.
In a post on X, the PCB said the team arrived in Dubai in four groups, adding that it would participate in a pre-series training camp from August 21-27 and take part in a training session at the ICC Cricket Academy tomorrow.
 






The squad departed from Pakistan in four different groups “to ensure a smooth and organised arrival of players and support staff in Dubai”, state media PTV reported.
While the ICC Cricket Academy will serve as the “primary training facility” for players, the team was scheduled to play a T20 practice match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, the state broadcaster said.
All training sessions and practice matches will take place in Dubai according to the official schedule, PTV stated, adding, “This setup is designed to provide players with the ideal environment and facilities to prepare thoroughly ahead of the two major tournaments.”
The PCB announced on Sunday that Pakistan have left out Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from the T20 squad.
Babar and Rizwan have been star performers in the shortest format in the past, but have not played since December, which head coach Mike Hesson put down to other players performing well while addressing a press conference.
Since Hesson took over as head coach in May, Pakistan have played three T20 series — winning 3-0 at home but losing 2-1 away to Bangladesh. They then beat the West Indies 2-1 in the United States.
All-rounder Salman Agha will lead the side, which also sees the return of fast bowlers Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza.
Pakistan squad: Salman Agha (captain), Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Sahibzada Farhan, Hasan Nawaz, Salman Mirza, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hussain Talat, Sufiyan Muqeem, Abrar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah, Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Wasim.</p><small>2025-08-20 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20173213a8cea00.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932040/pm-shehbaz-visits-kps-flood-affected-areas-as-14-more-bodies-recovered' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz visits KP’s flood-affected areas as 14 more bodies recovered</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner and Shangla in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as 14 more bodies were recovered from debris in Swabi’s Dalori.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc across the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accompanied by federal ministers and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner, and Shangla,” the Press Information Department said in a press release.
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, while speaking to the media in Peshawar, expressed gratitude to the federal and provincial governments, Pakistan Army, political parties and their organisations, as well as all individuals and institutions that came forward to provide aid during the floods.
 






Earlier in the day, fourteen bodies were recovered from underneath debris in Dalori, a cloudburst-hit region in KP’s Swabi district, bringing the number of bodies recovered in the region to 37, according to rescue officials.
According to the latest data from the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority, 385 people have died in rain-related incidents since August 15, with Buner reporting the highest toll at 228. Another 182 people are injured, including 145 men, 27 women and 10 children.
High-level visit
The prime minister and COAS also received a comprehensive briefing on ongoing rescue and relief operations in KP, the PID added.
 






Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam, and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal accompanied PM Shehbaz.
During their interaction with flood victims, the prime minister assured them of the government and the army’s unwavering commitment to extending maximum support to them “in this critical hour”.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the tireless dedication of the armed forces and civil administration, reaffirmed solidarity with the flood-affected population and assured them of all possible assistance, according to the PID.
The prime minister emphasised that every available national resource will be mobilised to accelerate recovery efforts and restore normalcy in the affected areas.
Encroachments on riverways condemned
Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister also drew attention to illegal encroachments, the timber mafia, and stone crushing activities, especially in the region’s waterways, which have contributed greatly to the loss of lives and damages.
“After the 2022 floods, I saw with my own eyes that on the sides of nullahs, rivers  — In fact, even inside the rivers — that hotels and houses had been made. There is no law in the entire world that allows you to construct dangerous hotels in such places,” he regretted.
He said Pakistan must act as a ‘hard state’ where no one is above the law and necessary actions are taken against violators without distinction, according to the PID.
Field Marshal Asim Munir also interacted with the troops, police and civil administration personnel involved in rescue efforts, lauding their selfless commitment in assisting victims of floods and torrential rains.
The COAS directed ground formations to approach the responsibility with utmost devotion and to spare no effort in alleviating the hardships of flood-stricken families, the PID said.
“He underscored that the safety and relief of fellow citizens remain the foremost priority, commending the forces and civil administration for their untiring service,” the PID statement added.
The prime minister and participants earlier also offered prayers for those who lost their lives in the floods.
On Tuesday, the premier had ordered a week-long, uninterrupted supply of electricity to the flood-hit areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and KP, while road and power supply were being restored in these areas.
Tragedy in Dalori
Dalori, the site where the bodies were recovered from on Wednesday, is a far-flung village in the mountainous regions of Gadoon Amazai, Topi, a sub-tehsil of Swabi.
Dalori was hit by a cloudburst on Monday morning, resulting in complete destruction of 12 houses and people were buried under the debris. By Tuesday, the death toll in the Gadoon Amazi area had surged to 24, including eight children.
According to the KP PDMA, the number of dead in Swabi rose to 41 on Wednesday.
 






Swabi Deputy Commissioner Nasarullah Khan told Dawn.com, “With the recovery of 14 more dead on Wednesday, we have completed the task and all 37 dead bodies from the debris at Dalori village have been recovered.”
The district administration has completed the task, satisfying the local people who assisted them and monitoring the entire operation, which was continued round the clock since Monday, he added.
“Eight dead bodies were recovered on Monday, 15 more were extracted on Tuesday and 14 on Wednesday,” he said.
Officials in hospitals said that a total of eight people were injured in Dalori village and they were provided free health services.
DC Nasarullah said: “Now we will shift to relief operation to rehabilitate the locals affected by the cloud burst.”
In a separate incident, four people were killed in Sarkoi Bala village. The dead bodies from there were recovered on the very first day of the incident.
“So far, a total of 29 dead bodies, including children, women and men, have been recovered from the debris in this ill-fated and natural calamity-hit village,” District Emergency Officer (DEO) Rescue 1122 Swabi Muhammad Awais Babar had told Dawn.com earlier.
DEO Babar said the district administration has decided to continue its search operation in the area till the task is completed, with locals assisting and monitoring the efforts, which have been ongoing since Monday.

A total of 110 rescue staff had been deployed at the Dalori village site, as per the DEO. “Rescue 1122 of Nowshera, Haripur and Mardan districts have been assisting them in the continued operation for the last three days.”
Pakistan army soldiers, civil defence volunteers, members of Al-Khidmat Foundation and various locals from different villages in the Gadoon Amazai belt participated in the operation.
However, Topi Mayor Rahim Jadoon said the exact number of missing people was still unknown, but confirmed that the cloudburst had destroyed 12 houses.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur said yesterday his government would provide all possible assistance to flood-hit people to help them pick up the pieces.
UK’s King Charles condoles death of flood victims, extends solidarity
Also on Wednesday, the United Kingdom’s King Charles condoled the death of flood victims and expressed solidarity with those affected by the flooding.
“My wife and I have been desperately saddened to learn of the tragic loss of life and widespread devastation caused by the recent monsoon flooding in Pakistan, and of the horrendous helicopter crash during rescue operations,” the British monarch said in a statement.
“The scale of suffering is truly heart-rending, and our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with all those who have lost loved ones, homes and livelihoods,” the statement quoted King Charles as saying.
The British monarch also extended “heartfelt condolences to those affected and stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan during this most difficult time.”
The statement added that he was especially mindful of the enduring bonds between the two nations, and of the many families in the United Kingdom with close ties to Pakistan.
He also commended the commitment of the emergency services, volunteers and local communities, “who are working so hard and against such overwhelming odds to rescue those in danger and to provide vital relief to those whose lives have been so cruelly disrupted.”</p><small>2025-08-20 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201914122a2842c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932087/pakistan-uk-pledge-deeper-cooperation-on-democracy-reforms-facilitating-overseas-pakistanis' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UK pledge deeper cooperation on democracy, reforms, facilitating overseas Pakistanis</strong></a><br><p>Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Danyal Chaudhry on Wednesday met British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott to discuss cooperation between Islamabad and London.
Pakistan and the United Kingdom have been engaged in the Enhanced Strategic Dialogue (ESD) since 2011, which has deepened and broadened the dialogue between the two countries, covering areas such as trade, economic growth and development, cultural cooperation, security, and education.
During the meeting, held in Islamabad, Chaudhry highlighted Pakistan’s ‘democratic trajectory’ and emphasised that constructive dialogue and strong institutions were essential for a sustainable democracy.
“The meeting also touched on matters concerning Pakistani-origin citizens in the UK, including taxation and general facilitation,” the press release read. “Marriott welcomed ongoing efforts to support overseas Pakistanis and expressed interest in further collaboration to enhance services for the diaspora.”
Chaudhry stressed, during the discussion, the importance of empowering local governments to deliver services and advance development, the press release said. He also highlighted efforts being made by Pakistan’s government to counter misinformation and project its narrative internationally.
He also invited Marriott to observe educational reforms undertaken in his constituency. “His efforts focus on building international-standard institutions and increasing enrollment in public schools,” the press release read.
“The meeting participants also discussed different strategies to alleviate poverty and improve the standard of living of people living below the poverty line.”
Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had undertaken a two-day official visit to the UK, where he not only met British counterpart Angela Rayner, but also with British lawmakers of Pakistani origin, as well as Kashmiri leaders.
 






Earlier this month, both nations pledged to deepen their partnership across key sectors, with a renewed focus on defence cooperation and strategic dialogue. This consensus was reached during a meeting between Mariott and Minister for Defence Production Muhammad Raza Hayat Harraj in Rawalpindi.
“Pakistan considers the United Kingdom a close friend and a genuine development partner,” Harraj said, according to a statement. “Frequent interaction has been useful in coordinating our approaches to various bilateral, regional and international issues. The two sides agreed to enhance cooperation in all fields, including defence.”</p><small>2025-08-20 16:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201843360c2a275.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932073/pakistan-china-afghanistan-commit-to-bolstering-joint-efforts-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China, Afghanistan commit to bolstering joint efforts against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, China and Afghanistan on Wednesday committed themselves to bolstering joint efforts against the menace of terrorism and deepening their collaboration in key spheres.
A statement to this effect followed the Sixth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue held in Kabul between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese and Afghan counterparts, Wang Yi and Amir Khan Muttaqi, respectively, on the topics of political, economic and security cooperation.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism. They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan,” the Foreign Office (FO) said on the meeting.
 






Before the meeting, Dar met FM Muttaqi on the sidelines and the two are said to have noted the positive movement in political and economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They also reaffirmed their commitment to working closely on counter-terrorism and ensuring peace and stability in the region.
 






The FO said the two welcomed the recent elevation of diplomatic representation between the two countries from the chargé d’affaires to the ambassadorial level.
Its statement said both had noted with appreciation that most decisions from recent interactions had either been implemented or were nearing completion, adding that these efforts had significantly strengthened bilateral relations, particularly in the areas of trade and transit.
FM Dar “acknowledged the encouraging progress in political and commercial ties, while expressing that progress in the security domain, especially in counter-terrorism, continues to lag behind,” the FO said, adding that Dar had highlighted a recent surge in terrorist attacks inside Pakistan perpetrated by groups operating from Afghan soil.
The FO added that he urged the Afghan authorities to take “concrete and verifiable measures” against proscribed groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the Balochistan Liberation Army/Majeed Brigade.
The FO said Muttaqi reaffirmed Afghanistan’s commitment to ensuring its territory was not used by any terrorist group against Pakistan or other nations.
 






FM Dar landed in Kabul earlier today for the trilateral meeting and was received by Afghan Deputy FM Dr Mohammad Naeem, other Afghan officials, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani.
 






On May 21, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed in principle to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging ambassadors — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
The understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing. The talks were part of Beijing’s broader effort to ease regional tensions and advance connectivity through its Belt and Road Initiative.
Pakistan and China had also noted that there was an agreement on the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.
China, which has strategic interests in regional stability and economic integration, hosted the gathering to help resume the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue, which had been paused since 2023.
The key outcomes from the Beijing meeting also included commitments to enhance cooperation in security and counter-terrorism, including joint action against militant groups and external interference and an understanding to formally resume the trilateral process by convening the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue in Kabul.
Earlier that month, the Afghan government had called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.
The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.</p><small>2025-08-20 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2013511936c58ee.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053/imran-khan-nominates-mahmood-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader-swati-for-senate' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan nominates Mahmood Achakzai as NA opposition leader, Swati for Senate</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan has nominated Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the post of Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, PTI Secretary-General Salman Akram Raja said on Wednesday.
“Azam Khan Swati has been nominated as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,” Raja added. He also said Imran has asked for five names to decide on his nominee for the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly.
The announcement comes after the Election Commission of Pakistan earlier this month disqualified PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan as the NA opposition leader and Shibli Faraz from the same role in the Senate, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in May 9 cases. Both PTI opposition leaders were formally removed from their posts on August 8.
Speaking to reporters outside the Supreme Court, Raja said that Imran had nominated Achakzai, who currently leads the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), to take Ayub’s place.
“The PTI founder has entrusted the matter of by-elections [to seats vacated after recent convictions of lawmakers in May 9 cases] to the party’s political committee,” he said.
“A political committee meeting will be held later today, where a decision will be made in this regard.”

‘We need to fight this war’
In a separate address in Lahore, Raja highlighted that the people need to come together and stand up against oppression, adding that they need to fight for their rights as enshrined in the Constitution.
“It doesn’t matter where you’re from or what party you belong to; if you have empathy, we are all together,” he said. “For the permanence of humanity and dignity, we need to fight this war.”
The PTI general secretary highlighted that anyone can be detained for any reason, warning that nobody has freedom.
“There is only one law in this country, its name is fear,” he emphasised.
 






“We will take your struggle to every stage we can,” Raja said, indirectly addressing party supporters.
“We are all part of one big struggle for human rights. What does the supremacy of law and the Constitution mean? It means having the right to stand up and protest, as in Article 17. Article 15 allows free movement. Article 19 says we can raise and spread our voice together.
“We have to fight for the farmers and the downtrodden,” he added. “I listened to people in Sindh, it brought tears to my eyes, but this is not only in Sindh, it is commonplace.”
Raja emphasised that “we all have rights and we are all human”, adding that the people need to stand up for a common agenda.
“We can see in these floods, they are not purely natural disasters: there is a human hand and greed involved,” Raja declared. “We need to eradicate this greed in the same way as our forests are being cut down. If we do not stand up, we will not be able to raise our voices again.”
Last week, the Peshawar High Court had issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the NA and the Senate. The bench also issued notices to the ECP, seeking its response to two separate petitions filed by Ayub and Faraz. The petitions challenged their disqualification and de-notification as MNA and Senator, respectively.
The PTI is a part of a coalition of six opposition parties, working under the banner of TTAP, which was formed last year.
Earlier this month, the opposition alliance had organised a multi-party conference, following which it had appealed for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy.
The TTAP formalised its organisational structure in July, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests. During a press conference, Raja had announced Achakzai’s appointment as TTAP chairman, with PTI’s Asad Qaiser as the Secretary General.</p><small>2025-08-20 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201651320d451c3.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932074/government-establishes-pakistan-digital-authority-to-implement-digital-master-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Government establishes Pakistan Digital Authority to implement ‘digital master plan’</strong></a><br><p>The federal government officially established the Pakistan Digital Authority (PDA), appointing a chairperson and one other member to the body, it emerged on Wednesday.
As one of three bodies formed under the Digital Nation Bill — approved by the federal cabinet in June — the PDA will comprise a chairperson and two members, who will work to develop, implement and monitor the national digital master plan. The authority will also establish a monitoring and evaluation framework for digital transformation projects.
The Digital Nation Bill aims to create a digital identity for citizens in order to centralise social, economic and governance data, and to provide for the transformation of Pakistan into a digital nation, enabling a digital society, digital economy and digital governance, according to its stated objectives.
According to a pair of notifications from the Cabinet Division — dated August 19 and available with Dawn.com — Dr Sohail Munir has been appointed as the PDA chairperson, while Dr Muhammad J. Sear has been appointed as one of the authority’s two members. Both appointments have been made by the prime minister. One other member is yet to be named.
Dr Munir and Dr Sear have been appointed “under [the] Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication on [a] contract basis for a period of five years, with immediate effect and until further orders”, the identical notifications read.
Dr Munir is a “digital futurist” and a “leading expert” in the field of government digital transformation, according to his LinkedIn profile. He currently works in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as an adviser to the Abu Dhabi government’s Department of Government Enablement.
Dr Sear is also an expert on digital transformations in government and has worked as an adviser to governments and the private sector. He is currently the CEO of well-being startup Simpli Human in the UAE, according to LinkedIn.
In June, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a search and selection committee to recommend the appointment of PDA members. Federal Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja was appointed convener of the search committee.
The authority’s other functions include facilitating coordination between different stakeholders; establishing an evaluation frame for projects under the digital master plan; reviewing plans relevant to the master plan; developing and enforcing a national data strategy and comprehensive data governance framework within government entities and across public and private sectors, as well as recommending governance, standards and operational compliance of cloud infrastructure within the public sector among others.</p><small>2025-08-20 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20170401931bb41.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932076/why-have-cloudbursts-killed-hundreds-in-pakistan-and-india-this-monsoon-season' target='_blank'><strong>Why have cloudbursts killed hundreds in Pakistan and India this monsoon season?</strong></a><br><p>Massive, sudden downpours of rain known as cloudbursts have struck Pakistan and India during this monsoon season, killing hundreds of people in the flash floods and landslides they have triggered.

Why are cloudbursts and why do they occur?
By a widely accepted definition, a cloudburst means more than 100 mm (4 inches) of rainfall in one hour, over a small area.
This year, the monsoon, which originates in the Bay of Bengal and then sweeps westwards across northern India to Pakistan every summer, has brought deadly cloudbursts.
Weather studies say cloudbursts typically occur in South Asia when warm, monsoon winds, laden with moisture, meet the cold mountain air in the north of India and Pakistan, causing condensation. With a warming planet, the monsoon has hotter air, which can carry more moisture.
India’s weather department data shows cloudbursts are most common in the Himalayan regions of Indian Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
Fahad Saeed, a senior climate scientist at Berlin-based Climate Analytics, said that in the mountains of northern Pakistan, the warm monsoon system coming from the east was meeting colder air coming from the west, from the subtropical jet stream — a high-altitude weather system that originates in the Mediterranean.
Global warming is pushing this jet stream further south in summer, he said, where it can now combine with the lower-level clouds of the monsoon in Pakistan, forming a tower of clouds which then generates intense rain.
Similar intense rainfall, though triggered by different local factors, takes place around the world, such as the floods in Texas in July, when more than 300 mm of rain fell in less than an hour, sending a wall of water down the Guadalupe River.

Why is the region being hit so badly by cloudbursts?
This monsoon season has so far seen at least four major deadly cloudbursts, including in Uttarakhand, India, where video captured the moment when village buildings were swept down a mountain, and in Buner, in the Hindu Kush mountain range in Pakistan, where more than 200 people died after at least 150 mm of rain fell within an hour.
S.D. Sanap, a scientist with the India Meteorological Department’s Pune office, said such cloudburst events were becoming more frequent in the western Himalayas, which run across India and into Pakistan, but pinning the rise on a single cause was not easy.
The cloudburst events on both sides of the border were triggered the same way: very moist monsoon air, upslope winds, and storms that stalled over valleys, said Moetasim Ashfaq, a weather expert based in the US.
If a cloudburst happens over flat land, the rainfall spreads over a wide area, so the impact is less severe, said Pradeep Dangol, a senior hydrology research associate at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, based in Nepal.
But in steep mountain valleys, the rain is concentrated into narrow streams and slopes, with the potential to trigger flash floods and landslides, he said.

Can cloudbursts be predicted?
Forecasting such events days in advance is nearly impossible, though radars can track the build-up of dense cloud formations and give short-term warnings of intense downpours, Sanap said.
To strengthen monitoring, the India Meteorological Department has installed new radars across the Himalayas and set up observatories aimed at improving early warnings and understanding of these extreme weather events.
Syed Muhammad Tayyab Shah, who leads risk assessment at Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority, said that it was possible to warn about the general area, but not possible to pinpoint the exact location in advance where a cloudburst will happen.

The remarks come nearly two months after Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following its 12-day war with Israel in June.
Iran has cited the IAEA’s failure to condemn Israeli and American strikes on its nuclear facilities as the reason for its decision, which saw the watchdog’s inspectors leave the country following the passing of new legislation by parliament.
“We cannot completely cut cooperation with the agency,” Araghchi said, noting that new fuel rods need to be installed at Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant in the coming weeks, which will require the presence of IAEA inspectors.
 
 

“Under the law passed by parliament, the return of inspectors will be possible through a decision of the Supreme National Security Council,” he told the official IRNA news agency in an interview published on Wednesday, referring to Iran’s top security body.
In mid-June, Israel launched an unprecedented attack targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, but also hitting residential areas.
The United States launched its own attacks on nuclear facilities at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.
The war derailed talks between Iran and the US on a new nuclear deal to replace the one abandoned by US President Donald Trump during his first term in 2018.
Iran has since said cooperation with the agency will take “a new form” and earlier this month, the agency’s deputy head visited Tehran for talks.
At the time, deputy foreign minister Kazem Gharibabadi said Iran and the agency had agreed to “continue consultations”.
In recent weeks, Britain, France and Germany have threatened to trigger a snapback of UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 accord if Iran fails to agree a deal on uranium enrichment and cooperation with the IAEA.</p><small>2025-08-20 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20171406244b3ef.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932077/india-china-agree-to-resume-direct-flights-boost-business-links' target='_blank'><strong>India, China agree to resume direct flights, boost business links</strong></a><br><p>India and China agreed on Tuesday to resume direct flights and step up trade and investment flows as the neighbours rebuild ties damaged by a 2020 border clash.
The Asian giants are cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy, staging a series of high-level bilateral visits.
The two countries would resume direct flights and boost trade and investment, including reopening border trade at three designated points, and facilitate in visas, the Indian foreign ministry said.
Direct flights have been suspended since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. No date was given for their resumption.
The latest statements came at the end of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s two-day visit to New Delhi for the 24th round of talks with Indian National Security (NSA) Adviser Ajit Doval to resolve their decades old border dispute.
The border talks covered issues related to pulling back troops both countries have amassed on their Himalayan border, delimitation of borders and boundary affairs, the Indian ministry said.
Both countries have agreed to set up a working group to consult and coordinate on border affairs to advance demarcation negotiations, a Chinese foreign ministry statement released on Wednesday showed.
It said the mechanism will extend talks to cover the eastern and middle sections of the border. Meanwhile another round of talks on the western section will be held as soon as possible, the ministry said.
Beijing also said both countries agreed to meet again in China in 2026.
“Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X after meeting Wang.
 






Modi is scheduled to travel to China at the end of this month to take part in the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation — his first visit to the country in more than seven years.
Tibet dam
A readout from the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang told Doval that “the stable and healthy development of China-India relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries’ people.”
The two sides “should enhance mutual trust through dialogues and expand cooperation”, Wang said, and should aim for consensus in areas such as border control and demarcation negotiations.
 
 

India said Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had underlined in his talks with Wang India’s concerns with regard to the mega dam China is building on the Yarlung  Zangbo river in Tibet.
Yarlung  Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra as it flows into India and Bangladesh, a lifeline for millions.
The dam would have implications for lower riparian states and the need for “utmost transparency” was strongly underlined, New Delhi said.
To that, China agreed to share with India emergency hydrological information on relevant rivers on humanitarian principles, China’s foreign ministry said.
Both sides agreed to engage an expert-level mechanism on cross-border rivers, and maintain communication to renew flood reporting arrangements, the ministry said.
Chinese officials had previously said hydropower projects in Tibet will not have a major impact on the environment or on downstream water supplies, but India and Bangladesh have nevertheless raised concerns.
Earlier on Tuesday, an Indian source said Wang had assured Jaishankar that Beijing was addressing three key Indian concerns — the need for fertilisers, rare earths and tunnel boring machines.
The Indian foreign and mines ministries and China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><small>2025-08-20 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20152344524d4e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932061/talks-expected-soon-between-pti-govt-officials-imrans-release-not-on-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>‘Talks expected soon between PTI, govt officials; Imran’s release not on agenda’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has said he expects negotiations between the PTI and the government to start in a few days, but Imran Khan’s release from jail would not be part of the discussion.
Since Imran’s incarceration last year in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply. Last year in November, protests by the party had escalated into violence amid state repression.
Subsequently, in December last year, Imran Khan had formed a five-member committee to hold talks with “anyone”, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to set up a counterpart panel. Despite several rounds, however, the talks ended abruptly and without results. Ties have been further strained after several PTI leaders’ recent convictions in May 9 cases.
In an interview on DawnNews TV programme Doosra Rukh, aired on Tuesday night, the minister said that he saw negotiations “starting in a few days”.
“PTI leaders have contacted us as well as other leadership, and are convincing us that negotiations should open up again,” he said, adding that the opposition was also in consensus that they wanted “some pathway out” after the sentencing and disqualifications of PTI leadership in the wake of the May 9 riots.
He said that the negotiations would be held between the PTI’s team and a committee formed by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
He stressed, however, that these negotiations would not include a discussion on Imran’s release, as this was “not in the government’s power”.
“We have told them a dozen times to take the route of the courts, to prove his innocence in court,” he said. “His release is only possible that way. The government cannot provide him freedom or release in any way.”
He added that if there was any issue that party members wanted to discuss; if they wanted to talk about “political space or political issues”, such discussions would be welcome.
Malik also said that the PTI would have to “convince” them as to the necessity of forming a judicial commission for an investigation into May 9 at the current stage in the proceedings, as many cases had already been decided.
“If they have a convincing argument, then they can bring it to that session and convince us,” he said, adding that the evidence already provided in these cases was already admissible and had been taken into account in the trial stages.
 


Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9. In July, he filed an appeal in the Supreme Court after being denied bail by lower courts. That appeal has yet to be decided, with the hearing put off again today.
Earlier this month, PTI’s Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, and Opposition Leader in the Senate, Shibli Faraz, were removed from their seats after being convicted in May 9 cases by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza, and other PTI lawmakers were similarly disqualified from their seats following their convictions in cases related to the riots.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20154429316b6da.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932065/data-protection-standards-issued-for-companies-to-safeguard-citizens-personal-information' target='_blank'><strong>Data protection standards issued for companies to safeguard citizens’ personal information</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Emergency Services Response Team (PKCERT) on Wednesday issued data protection guidelines for organisations handling citizens’ personal information, citing an increasingly insecure cyberspace environment.
PKCERT is a federal entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
The advisory, applicable to companies holding Personally Identifiable Information (PII), prescribes immediate, medium- and long-term measures, which include classifying data sets based on their sensitivity, advanced encryption methods, multi-factor authentication, and others.
Organisations collecting, processing, storing, or transmitting PII may include “financial services, telecommunications and internet providers, commerce and logistics [companies], government agencies, healthcare institutions, educational entities, as well as third-party and outsourced service providers,” the notification said.
In its recommendations, PKCERT instructed companies to keep their PII handling systems updated, retain PII only for legally required durations, and dispose of outdated information lest it be stolen.
It also urged organisations to align their practices with the National Cyber Security Policy 2021 (NCSP) as well as the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016.
The NCSP “mandates safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of citizens’ personal data as a matter of national security and public trust,” reads the advisory.
 
 

PKCERT also called for an immediate review of the systems organisations have been using to handle PII, recommended security training for all staff handling personal information, as well as continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorised access.
 




Recomendations made by the PKCERT advisory.

Outlining possible vulnerabilities and threats, the cybersecurity body underscored the need for data protection, noting that in light of “the growing sophistication of cybercriminals, the widespread exploitation of misconfigured systems, and negligent data handling practices, urgent remediation measures are required.”
 


The advisory detailed that threat actors may include:

Cybercriminal Gangs: Monetising stolen PII via identity fraud, phishing kits, and dark web
marketplaces.
State-Sponsored APT Groups: Using compromised citizen data for surveillance, political manipulation, and intelligence gathering.
Hacktivists: Targeting organisations for ideological reasons, often leaking sensitive records publicly.
Malicious Insiders: Employees or contractors exploiting privileged access for personal gain or revenge.

According to PKCERT, inadequate data protection can lead to “identity theft, fraud, mass privacy breaches, operational disruption, erosion of public trust, national security risks and legal and regulatory consequences.”
In its recommendations to individuals, the advisory outlined preventative measures such as submitting CNIC and personal documents only when necessary, using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and avoiding sharing personal information online.
In May, PKCERT issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan had been stolen in a global data breach, and urged citizens to take immediate protective measures.
In March 2024, a Joint Investiga­tion Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) had found that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million citizens had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201503331ff0270.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932060/murtaza-solangi-appointed-spokesperson-for-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Murtaza Solangi appointed spokesperson for President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>Senior journalist and former caretaker information minister Murtaza Solangi has been appointed spokesperson for the President of Pakistan, he confirmed on Wednesday.

Swiatek — who on Monday had battled through a two-hour tussle with Jasmine Paolini to win the Cincinnati Open — looked full of energy as she and Ruud powered into Wednesday’s semi-finals.
Swiatek and Ruud needed just 39 minutes to dispatch the US pairing of Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe 4-1, 4-2 in their opening game at Arthur Ashe Stadium, and then reappeared roughly 20 minutes later to defeat Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti 5-3, 4-2 in their quarter-final clash.
The victories capped a gruelling 24 hours for Polish star Swiatek, who hot-footed it to the airport after Monday’s win in Cincinnati and only arrived at her
hotel in New York in the early hours of Tuesday.

“Honestly the last two days have felt like one day, but I’m super happy to be here,” Swiatek said.
Ruud and Swiatek had just enough time to fit in a quick practice before taking to the court in their first match as a doubles pairing.
“I was happy to team up with Iga,” Ruud said afterwards.
“She’s on the winning train these days so I’m just jumping on the train and let’s see if we can win some more before the mixed doubles is over.
“I was super happy to team up with Iga — I think everyone should show some appreciation to Iga today. She only got to her hotel 12 hours ago at 2:30am, and she’s here playing.”
McNally and Musetti had progressed to the last eight earlier Tuesday after taking care of Naomi Osaka and Gael Monfils 5-3, 4-2.
In other early results on Tuesday, US tennis icon Venus Williams and partner Reilly Opelka exited against Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev, losing 4-2, 5-4.
Italy’s reigning champions Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani ousted second seeds Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz 4-2, 4-2.
Earlier on Tuesday, world number one Jannik Sinner’s withdrawal from the mixed doubles was confirmed as expected.
Sinner, who retired due to illness in the first set of his Cincinnati Open final with Carlos Alcaraz on Monday, was due to partner Katerina Siniakova in the doubles.
Sinner and Siniakova were replaced in the draw by the American duo of Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison.
This year’s US Open mixed doubles competition is being held over Tuesday and Wednesday in the week before the main singles draws get under way.
The tournament is using a modified scoring system, with short sets to four games, no-advantage scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point match tiebreak in lieu of a third set.
The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games, featuring no-advantage scoring, with tiebreakers at six-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker instead of a third set, with the winning pairing pocketing $1 million.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2011083125535a6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932044/china-to-showcase-latest-military-hardware-at-september-parade' target='_blank'><strong>China to showcase latest military hardware at September parade</strong></a><br><p>China will unveil a slate of new domestically produced military hardware that will showcase its “powerful capability to prevail in modern war” at a parade next month, officials said on Wednesday.
The event, marking 80 years since the end of World War II, will see President Xi Jinping inspect troops in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and other world leaders expected to attend.
Millions of Chinese people were killed during a prolonged war with imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, which became part of a global conflict following Tokyo’s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The ruling Communist Party has held a series of blockbuster events in recent years to commemorate its wartime resistance.
On September 3, China’s military will showcase its latest equipment, “reflecting the evolution of modern warfare”, said Major General Wu Zeke, an official at China’s military commission.
“All of the weapons and equipment taking part in this review were selected from domestically produced, currently active main battle systems, with a significant proportion being newly unveiled equipment,” Wu told reporters at a briefing.
These will include strategic heavy weapons, hypersonic precision systems, as well as unmanned and counter-unmanned equipment making their first public debut, he added.
The parade, which will last around 70 minutes, will “fully showcase our military’s powerful capability to prevail in modern war”, Wu said.
It will also feature ground troops marching in formation, armoured columns, aerial echelons and other high-tech fighting gear.
The Kremlin has confirmed Putin will attend, and Chinese officials said other world leaders are also expected to take in the scene.
China in March raised its defence spending for 2025 by 7.2 percent.
The increase comes as Beijing’s armed forces undergo rapid modernisation and eye deepening strategic competition with the United States.
China has the world’s second-largest military budget, but lags well behind the United States, its primary strategic rival.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a4de08c4e6c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931920/medium-level-flood-in-river-indus-at-taunsa' target='_blank'><strong>Medium-level flood in river Indus at Taunsa</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Taunsa Barrage on the Indus River is having a flood situation where water flow has reached a critical 500,000 cusecs and it is expected to rise further.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Tuesday issued a high alert as flood situation intensifies across Punjab as the water in rivers is rising due to ongoing monsoon rains that lashed the upper regions of the province.
The PDMA directed the district administration to immediately evacuate the citizens living on or near the riverbeds in Taunsa and launch emergency rescue operations. All relevant administrations should remain present in the field to coordinate relief efforts.
Commissioners of Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur, along with deputy commissioners of Layyah, Kot Addu, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur have been put on high alert.

Boats used to rescue people in Mianwali; more rainfall expected across Punjab

The flood threat is compounded by heavy thunderstorms predicted across most districts of Punjab from Aug 19 to 22. Rainfall is expected in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, and Rajanpur, raising concerns about urban flooding in major cities and flash flooding in the seasonal streams and drains.
The river situation across Punjab is becoming increasingly precarious. At Tarbela, the Indus is flowing at low-level flood with 309,000 cusecs while Kalabagh is experiencing medium-level flooding of 440,000 cusecs.

“Seventy-six citizens of the country… lost their lives in the incident, and three others were seriously injured,” Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi, Herat provincial government spokesman, said in a statement.
Police in Guzara district outside Herat city, where the accident took place on Tuesday night, said the bus collided with a motorcycle and a truck carrying fuel, sparking a fire.
The bus was carrying Afghans recently returned from Iran to the capital Kabul, Saeedi told AFP on Tuesday.
At least 1.5 million people have returned to Afghanistan since the start of this year from Iran and Pakistan, both of which have sought to force migrants out after decades of hosting them, according to the UN migration agency.
The state-run Bakhtar News Agency said Tuesday’s accident was one of the deadliest in the country in recent years.
Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, due in part to poor roads after decades of conflict, dangerous driving on highways and a lack of regulation.
In December last year, two bus accidents involving a fuel tanker and a truck on a highway through central Afghanistan killed at least 52.</p><small>2025-08-20 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a5054044b4f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931979/pm-shehbaz-orders-probe-into-rs50bn-gas-bill-shock' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz orders probe into Rs50bn gas bill shock</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an independent probe into the controversial Rs50 billion gas billing dispute involving influential consumer groups and the gas utility sector.
The investigation will be led by former federal secretary Shahid Khan, following complaints from industrial and CNG consumers who received sudden bills for past gas dues, dating back to 2015.
Sources confirmed that the prime minister has constituted a special inquiry committee to examine the matter. The dispute centres around the Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Company Ltd (SNGPL), which issued revised bills for the period between April 2015 and June 2022. These bills were based on updated notifications from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to these notifications, the industrial sector owes Rs14.4bn, the power sector Rs40bn (ultimately payable by electricity consumers), the CNG sector Rs3.8bn, and the fertiliser sector Rs2.4bn. The total payables amount to Rs59.8bn, including Rs51.3bn in differential gas charges and approximately Rs8bn in general sales tax (GST), in addition to late payment charges.
 
 

The issue has sparked concern, particularly among the industrial sector, which claims to have secured stay orders in the past to avoid such payments. Around 2,950 industrial consumers and 1,200 CNG consumers have protested, arguing they have strong legal grounds to challenge the additional charges. These groups assert that over the past decade, they have either exported or sold products and had no means to pass on the extra billing costs.
This billing dispute is further complicated by a Rs76bn subsidy claim against the government. The differential in Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) prices for export-oriented industries and the fertiliser sector is subsidised by the government, but the amounts recoverable from consumers have been billed.
Both Ogra and SNGPL have blamed each other for the legal errors. SNGPL sources explained that Ogra issued actualised RLNG prices for the period from April 2015 to June 2022 in December 2024, but later removed the revised notifications from its website following amendments requested by Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL). Ogra subsequently re-issued the RLNG prices on March 28, 2025, covering a period of 84 months. SNGPL has charged the differential amount to RLNG consumers under the gas sales agreement (GSA) clause 3.
The sources further argued that Ogra should not have revised the RLNG rates from ten years ago. Instead, they suggested the authority should have pursued recovery of the differential amount between the provisional RLNG prices and the actualised rates on a prospective basis, similar to how the fertiliser sector handled its payments.
They warned that retroactive claims could be nearly impossible to collect, with consumers likely to seek stay orders in court. This could undermine confidence in the regulated gas sector and fuel the growth of private entities outside the regulatory framework.
Ogra spokesperson Imran Ghaznavi defended the regulator’s actions, stating that it had been determining monthly provisional RLNG prices, which were now actualised. He clarified that, according to the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) and the SNGPL Consumer Service Manual, the differential between the provisional and actual RLNG prices was recoverable in future bills, not in a single bill.

The rains also delayed export shipments as goods carriers were unable to move due to flooded roads and overflowing nullahs.
The industrial sector, which typically operates in three shifts, faced significant disruptions. The morning shift was only partially affected, but the torrential downpour in the afternoon led to widespread flooding, which caused a complete halt to the second and third shifts. Many industrialists had to reschedule export shipments planned for the evening, while some were forced to delay deliveries until Wednesday.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Junaid Naqi said that 20-30 per cent of workers in over 4,000 industries in Korangi could not make it to work due to the rains. Those who did arrive opted to leave early as the rains worsened in the afternoon.
“Overall, productivity in the area was 50pc lower due to workers leaving early,” Naqi said, adding that many workers were stranded on the roads due to the submersion of main thoroughfares.
 
 

In addition, many workers’ children were also reportedly stuck at their educational institutions until late at night, further compounding the situation. Industrial operations typically run across three eight-hour shifts, but the absence of workers due to the rains led to the cancellation of afternoon and night shifts.
Site Association of Industry (SAI) President Ahmed Azeem Alvi reported that while production remained normal in over 3,500 units, many workers left by 4pm, only to find themselves stuck in traffic caused by flooded roads and overflowing gutters. “Women workers in particular faced severe difficulties due to the lack of public transport in the evening,” Alvi said, adding that the cancellation of shifts would pose problems for export-oriented industries.
Alvi also pointed out that some workers had been forced to stay at the factories due to road closures and transport shortages. “It’s disappointing that no city authority has taken responsibility for managing the drainage system, despite Karachi’s vital role in generating revenue,” he said.
Sheikh Mohammad Tehseen, President of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), said attendance at over 1,000 units in F.B. Area was down by 20-25pc. He predicted that Wednesday would be even more challenging, as many workers who had struggled to return home on Tuesday may be unable to make it to work depending on the weather. “If the rains continue for another two or three days, industrial production will be severely impacted,” Tehseen warned.
In the retail sector, trading activity in the old city area, home to over 10,000 shops, was almost negligible. Sharjeel Gopalani, Patron-in-Chief of the All City Tajir Itehad, said that many shop owners stayed home after the morning rains, while those who did show up left by 3pm as rainwater flooded markets.
Haji Shahjehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, reported that the footfall of customers in the New Subzi Mandi Super Highway wholesale market had been very low due to the heavy downpour. Additionally, supplies of vegetables from the upcountry were delayed.
With more rain forecast for the coming days, the industrial sector and retail markets in Karachi face an uncertain future, as widespread flooding continues to hamper both production and transport.
North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI) President  Faisal Moiz Khan said 80pc of the 4,500 units in the area halted production due to worker absenteeism. With 70pc of NKATI’s industries export-oriented, the suspension of second and third shifts will cause major disruptions. He added that rain and road closures have severely affected the supply chain for goods and raw materials.

“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” said an official announcement quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative, as saying at a high-level meeting.
The meeting was convened to review preparations for the forthcoming session of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) of CPEC, as well as the prime minister’s scheduled visit to Beijing.
While the JCC is expected to meet in October, official sources said the prime minister will travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO) summit (Aug 31-Sept 1). On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Both sides expected to set clear priorities, agree on tangible outcomes for the new phase

The planning minister stressed that the future of CPEC “must be anchored in quality rather than quantity,” emphasising that only carefully selected, high-impact projects should be advanced to ensure sustainability and institutional strengthening.
He also disclosed that during his recent visit to China, he had conveyed PM Shehbaz’s invitation to President Xi to visit Islamabad in 2026 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China.
 
 

Underscoring the need to expand Pakistan’s trade and export footprint in China, the minister directed the authorities concerned to resolve visa processing delays on priority to facilitate genuine businesspersons. He also instructed the preparation of an outcome-focused plan to diversify exports, enhance industrial linkages, and maximise benefits from market access under CPEC.
On human resource development, Mr Iqbal highlighted the importance of utilising the 10,000 training opportunities offered by China across multiple sectors. He stressed the need for a transparent framework to ensure that the right people receive training aligned with institutional needs, enabling Pakistan to secure durable capacity-building gains.
The meeting also reviewed progress in priority areas, including the Multan-Sukkur Motorway, IT graduate training, computational infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI), industrial relocation, industrial parks, mining, special economic zones, and agriculture.
It was decided to conduct data-driven studies on China’s industrial relocation trends and to map market segments where Pakistan has export strengths.
The minister noted that with China importing goods worth over $2 trillion annually, Pakistan should strategically aim to capture at least $30-50bn of this trade by building competitiveness and sectoral readiness.
He directed completion of an outcome-oriented study to identify high-potential export sectors, with the goal of creating an exportable surplus, attracting sustained investment, and strengthening the balance of payments over the medium term.
Calling for policy continuity and institutional reforms, the minister stressed the need for close engagement with the private sector, academia, and research institutions in areas such as industrial cooperation, technology, agriculture, energy, and human resource development.
According to projections, AI could contribute Rs24.9tr ($88.31bn) to Pakistan’s economy by 2030, raising the projected GDP of Rs171tr by 14.56pc. Agriculture, which makes up 24pc of GDP, could see 20+30pc productivity gains through AI-powered precision farming, while manufacturing and mining (15.1pc of GDP) may achieve 20-25pc improvements via automation.
Similarly, fintech (2pc) and the software industry (1.5pc) are projected to grow 20-30pc, while energy (3.8pc), defence (3.5pc), law & judiciary (1pc), and international collaborations (2pc) also hold 10-20pc growth potential, the minister said.

• Other telcos also experience data service disruptions
ISLAMABAD: Heavy rainfall in Karachi caused widespread disruptions to PTCL internet and Ufone services, affecting subscribers across the country.
Since other telecom operators purchase wholesale internet from PTCL, users of Jazz, Zong and Telenor also experienced data service disruptions.
Netblocks, a global internet watchdog, confirmed a major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan, with PTCL being significantly impacted. National connectivity dropped to 20 per cent of ordinary levels.
Responding to a query, a PTCL spokesperson acknowledged the issue. “Our teams are diligently working to restore the services as quickly as possible. We regret any inconvenience caused,” the spokesperson said but did not mention the cause for the nationwide outage.
Sources in the Ministry of IT and Telecom suggested that the disruption might be due to a technical fault at the landing station of submarine cables in Karachi’s Clifton area.
“No submarine cable issue has been reported, so the problem is likely at the landing station and some technical fault in the main hub,” and official said. “As a result, it’s a nationwide outage now with upstream traffic facing issues too.”
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that technical teams were working to resolve the issue.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima attributed the disruptions to power outages and network congestion, with many towers down in Karachi.
“The other localised issue is temporary choking of the network as too many people were stranded at the same spot and almost everyone was either making calls or receiving them. And now with PTCL going dead, all connectivity has shifted at telephony creating more choking,” Ms Fatima added.
Karachi’s 12 million mobile phone subscribers were affected, with the load shifting to the remaining three telcos after Ufone’s service disruption.
A PTA official noted that running generators for 12 hours was not feasible, and supplying diesel to towers was challenging in the current situation.
He added that more than 200 telecom sites (towers) were damaged in the flood in KP and most of the towers were restored in flood-affected areas of Swat, Buner, Shangla, etc, and the teams were ensuring restoration of remaining sites.
As heavy urban flooding hit Karachi, residents faced telephony disruptions in many areas, losing connections with each other.
Saher, a Gulistan-i-Jauhar resident, expressed concern: “I received one call from my husband, Jamal, saying he was stuck on the street, but his phone isn’t connecting since sunset. I’m really worried.”
