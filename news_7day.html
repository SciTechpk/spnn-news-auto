The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on August 22. He was then sent on a five-day physical remand and later to jail for 14 days on August 28.
Today’s development comes a day after Shershah’s triathlete brother, Shahrez Khan, was also granted bail in a similar case. Shahrez was picked up on August 21 and was handed over to police custody for eight days before his judicial remand and bail.
His lawyer, Barrister Taimur Malik, also confirmed the development on X.

The assistant commissioner of Daril, Waseem Abbas, told Dawn.com that the flood occurred at 6am on Friday due to heavy rains, which engulfed the Gamari area and resulted in damage to twenty houses, of which five were completely demolished.
“In addition, crops and trees were also damaged,” Abbas said, adding that there were reports of flooding in other drains as well.
According to locals, many people fled when the flood hit, with dozens moving to safer places.

Should we really give a dam?</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is flooded, again. A large part of Punjab is under water, while Sindh braces for torrents from the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab to converge at the Panjnad — where all of the country’s five rivers unite — and move south. All of this has created a never-before-seen situation: three of Pakistan’s five rivers are in super floods, all at the same time.
Entire communities have been displaced, and millions of acres of farmland that sustain much of our economy are now in ruins. Disaster management authorities continue to issue fresh warnings after urban flooding overwhelmed major cities — from up north to down south — during the monsoon season.
The headlines are grim, the warnings frequent, and the patterns familiar. The reflex is familiar too: build more storage. But a dam-first playbook cannot carry a 21st-century river system through climate volatility, geopolitical shocks and decades of misaligned land use. We need to change the way we decide, before we decide what to build.
Here, we are less interested in winning an argument for or against dams and more interested in asking better questions before building one. And, the record already urges us to do so.
A systems lens
The season’s death toll has climbed, and tens of thousands have been told to move to higher ground as flood waves roll down the eastern rivers. If this year feels like déjà vu, it is. The 2010 super floods affected around 20 million people. The 2022 deluge caused roughly $30-$40 billion in economic losses. These were not freak events; they were warnings from a changing river system.
The changing climate makes this warning harder to ignore. As the Hindu Kush–Himalaya warms, studies project substantial glacier loss this century, even under lower-warming scenarios. The shift will alter when the Indus delivers water and how reliably it does so, which is the pattern much of our infrastructure was built around.
Downstream, the delta is already straining from less freshwater and less silt. Research and field reports document chronic shortfalls in environmental flows below Kotri and the steady advance of seawater. None of this is theoretical. It is visible on the coast, on farms, and in the lives of people who depend on the river reaching the sea.
 
 

This year’s floods have also arrived in a tense transboundary moment. India has suspended participation in the Indus Waters Treaty process, which adds uncertainty to how and when water information and releases move across the border. In moments like this, the argument returns almost by muscle memory: build more dams.
The instinct is understandable, but it is incomplete. If the aim is genuine security in water, food, power and livelihoods, the question is no longer simply about how much storage. It is about the kind of storage and its operation in a river system that is fast-changing.
A systems approach starts from that reality. A dam is never just a dam. It sits inside a moving network of rivers and glaciers, power grids and crop calendars, cities and ecosystems, budgets and borders. Change one piece and the whole machine responds. A systems lens does not mean no dams. It means testing choices against the system we actually have, not the averages we wish we still had.
A volatile Indus system
Pakistan will keep needing storage. The question is what kind, where, and with what operating rules, given climate physics, silt, winter dryness, power demand, crop calendars and downstream ecosystems. The Indus system is already volatile. In a single season, our reservoirs faced opposite problems.
After a dry winter, Mangla hit dead level and Tarbela hovered near it earlier in March, which cut hydropower and squeezed irrigation releases. By mid-July, Tarbela’s spillways were opened to pass flood peaks. One season, we cannot store enough. Next, we cannot release fast enough. This swing should make us pause before assuming that more of the same automatically buys security.
 
 

Layer onto this the retreat of the Himalayan ice. Even if total annual water holds for a time, the meltwater memory that steadies the shoulder seasons fades. More of the year’s water can arrive in shorter bursts. Storage planned around historical timing can sit underfilled in dry winters and overwhelmed in short, intense monsoons.
None of this is an argument against dams. It is an argument for widening the lens. A project that looks elegant in a single hydrology scenario can stumble in the real Pakistan, where sediment rides the summer flood and eats live storage, where evaporation quietly taxes open water in hotter summers, and where operating rules must juggle three competing goals: monsoon flood cushion, reliable Rabi releases and summer megawatts.
In a systems view, the task is to build a balanced storage portfolio with operating rules that can flex as conditions change.
Reading the notes
So where does that leave us in the middle of another unrelenting monsoon?
With a change in the order of operations. Start by accepting that the Indus basin today is defined by timing and variability. Then judge any new dam by whether it adds flexibility rather than rigidity, whether its design and operating rules can adapt when winters run dry, summers arrive in pulses, and diplomacy turns noisy.
Be honest about the downstream coast that needs freshwater to hold the line against salt. Keep investing in complementary ways of holding water, including off-channel storage and managed aquifer recharge, so big reservoirs are not asked to do every job alone. If we do that, the debate shifts from concrete as a reflex to concrete as part of a system. That is a conversation that, hopefully, our decision-makers are having.
 
 

None of this is as exciting as a groundbreaking ceremony. It is, however, more honest about what the river is telling us. We cannot outbuild volatility with one instrument. We can make the Indus steadier by matching decisions to its dynamics and by admitting that infrastructure and policy are part of the same machine. A systems lens is, at heart, humility in planning. Test projects as parts of a whole. Price their fragilities alongside their benefits. Prefer flexibility in an age when timing, not just totals, is shifting.
Pakistan can still build great things. But the river has been leaving us notes — dead levels in March and spillways in July, encroached floodplains reclaimed by the rivers, glaciers shedding their memory of winter. Reading these notes is not anti-development. It is the way development stands.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0411390724ba8e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939636/pm-shehbaz-due-to-meet-chinese-premier-today-preside-over-business-conference' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz due to meet Chinese premier today, preside over business conference</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is due to meet the Chinese Premier Li Qiang today, with the pair set to discuss “bilateral ties, regional and international cooperation,“ The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.

The verdict comes after a trial in the federal court in San Francisco over allegations that Google, over an eight-year period, accessed users’ mobile devices to collect, save, and use their data, violating privacy assurances under its Web and App Activity setting.
The users had been seeking more than $31 billion in damages.
The jury found Google liable on two of the three claims of privacy violations brought by the plaintiffs. The jury found that Google had not acted with malice, meaning it was not entitled to any punitive damages.
Google plans to appeal, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said.
“This decision misunderstands how our products work,” Castaneda said. “Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalisation, we honor that choice.”
David Boies, a lawyer for the users, said in a statement they were “obviously very pleased with the verdict the jury returned.”
The class action lawsuit, filed in July 2020, claimed Google continued to collect users’ data even with the setting turned off through its relationship with apps such as Uber, Venmo and Meta’s Instagram that use certain Google analytics services.
At trial, Google said the collected data was “nonpersonal, pseudonymous, and stored in segregated, secured, and encrypted locations.” Google said the data was not associated with users’ Google accounts or any individual user’s identity.
US District Judge Richard Seeborg certified the case as a class action covering about 98m Google users and 174m devices.
Google has faced other privacy lawsuits, including one earlier this year where it paid nearly $1.4bn in a settlement with Texas over allegations the company violated the state’s privacy laws.
Google in April 2024 agreed to destroy billions of data records of users’ private browsing activities to settle a lawsuit that alleged it tracked people who thought they were browsing privately, including in “Incognito” mode.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041107547dd206f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939628/stargazers-to-witness-rare-blood-moon-during-total-lunar-eclipse-across-asia-europe-and-africa-on-sunday' target='_blank'><strong>Stargazers to witness rare ‘Blood Moon’ during total lunar eclipse across Asia, Europe, and Africa on Sunday</strong></a><br><p>Stargazers will have a chance to see a “Blood Moon” on Sunday night during a total lunar eclipse visible across Asia, as well as swathes of Europe and Africa.
When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
People in Asia, including India and China, will be best placed to see Sunday’s total eclipse, which will also be visible on the eastern edge of Africa as well as in western Australia.
The total lunar eclipse will last from 1730 GMT to 1852 GMT (10:30pm PKT to 11:52pm PKT).
Stargazers in Europe and Africa will get a brief chance to see a partial eclipse just as the Moon rises during the early evening, while the Americas will miss out.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
Blue wavelengths of light are shorter than red ones, so are more easily dispersed as they travel through Earth’s atmosphere, he told AFP.
“That’s what gives the moon its red, bloody colour.” While special glasses or pinhole projectors are needed to safely observe solar eclipses, all that is required to see a lunar eclipse is clear weather — and being in the right spot.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022.
Milligan, a self-described “solar eclipse chaser”, said he considered Sunday’s event a prelude to what he called the “big one” next year.
A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.
For more than a decade, Milligan has travelled the world to witness 12 totalities, which is when the Moon completely obscures the Sun.
Next year’s totality —  the first in mainland Europe since 2006 — will be visible only in Spain and Iceland, though other countries will be able to see a significant partial eclipse.
In Spain, the totality will be visible in a roughly 160-kilometre (100-mile) band between Madrid and Barcelona, but neither city will see the full phenomenon, Milligan said.
It will be the first total solar eclipse since one swept across North America in April 2024.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041006549e66ad9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939600/theme-park-owner-arrested-for-raising-illegal-scheme-in-ravi' target='_blank'><strong>Theme Park owner arrested for raising illegal scheme in Ravi</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has arrested the owner of Theme Park, an ‘illegal’ housing scheme raised in the river bed of Ravi.
The scheme was completely inundated by the swollen river last week.
“Khushi Muhammad built this illegal housing scheme in the Ravi land, made residential plots on 12,000 kanals inside the river bed and sold them to citizens by fraud. The suspect had not built the society as per law and even couldn’t establish any kind of sewage system in the fake housing scheme and since the entire area was inside the river, therefore, all the houses in the illegal housing scheme were submerged by the floodwater,” an ACE spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.
He said the ACE had also sought record of all illegal housing schemes established in the Ravi bed from the River Urban Development Authority (Ruda) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) so that action could be taken against those housing schemes as per the law.

ACE seeks record from Ruda, LDA: promises strict action

“Theme Park was not approved by the relevant departments. Keeping in mind public complaints, the ACE has decided to take strict action against all such illegal housing schemes which are established on river land,” he said and added the construction of housing societies on river land could not be permitted at all and indiscriminate action would be taken against already-established illegal housing schemes as well.
 
 

A source said Khushi Muhammad was a police constable before he kicked off this project — Theme Park — with a small piece of land.
“By exploiting the loopholes in the system and greasing the palm of the officials concerned, he continued acquiring more land in the river bed and sold the same to the citizens. He also managed to transfer billions of rupees abroad.
Interestingly, it is the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) which usually initiates action against the housing societies involved in fraudulent activities but in this case the ACE stepped in first.
“It will be a test case for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz whether she successfully lays hands on those involved in this mega corruption housing scam along the river bed or buckles under the pressure of those who have strong connections in certain corridors,” an official source said and added not only the owners of such societies but top officials in bureaucracy that helped them build structures on the river land with impunity should be taken to task.
Federal Minister for Communication Aleem Khan, also the president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) which was dubbed as king’s party at the time of its inception in 2023, had got a major relief same year following NAB’s decision to close an inquiry against him for allegedly occupying and encroaching public passages and illegal extension of the Park View housing society both in Lahore and Islamabad under the new accountability laws.
The property tycoon was accused of illegally occupying ‘public passages’ and illegal extension of River Edge Housing Society Lahore and also illegal extension of a housing society (Park View) in Islamabad, thus minting money from general public by selling plots in unapproved phases.
The LDA had raised an objection saying the housing scheme was situated in a river area which could not be utilised for any residential purposes. “It is not safe for the people’s lives to allow residential construction there (Ravi area),” the LDA had informed NAB.
“The land also fell in an agricultural area and did not carry the characteristics of urban property thus the scheme was not approved. Despite this, Aleem Khan and others started selling the plots falling in the area for which approval was refused,” NAB had alleged. It is a big question mark how come RUDA, LDA or TMAs approved structures along the river bed.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises in Lahore. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by RUDA.

Officials said the M-10 project is a mega initiative that has evolved from a  simple bypass upgrade. It involves upgrading the Northern Bypass and constructing a new 134-kilometer six-lane  motorway through the Kirthar Range.
Additionally, a 23-kilometer stretch will be upgraded to a  six-lane road, transforming the entire route from Karachi Port to M-6 in  Jamshoro into a high-capacity motorway.
The project was discussed on Wednesday at a meeting between Communication Minister Aleem Khan and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah at CM House.
 







Nespak is conducting a feasibility study on the proposed 134km M-10 project, Communications Minister Aleem Khan tells CM Murad

The meeting was informed that the M-10 project was currently in the feasibility study stage, being conducted by National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak).
Federal Minister Aleem Khan stated that the project’s core objective was to decongest Karachi by creating a direct high-speed link between the port and the national motorway network. The chief minister welcomed the federal government’s support as the federal minister assured him that the communications ministry and the NHA were committed to completing both M-6 and M-10 projects in a timely and transparent manner.
Earlier in May, the federal communication minister had said that construction of both the M-6 and M-10 motorways would now begin simultaneously, with the aim of connecting them directly to Karachi Port.
It may be noted that the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives had expressed serious concerns over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project and urged them to commence work without further delay by October, warning that the matter would be referred to the Upper House for intervention.
Welcoming the federal government’s support, the chief minister said that both projects were “vital not only for Sindh but for the entire country’s economy”.
Rs363bn for M-6
The chief minister said that M-6 would unlock opportunities for the youth of interior of Sindh through enhanced connectivity, while M-10 would “resolve Karachi’s traffic bottlenecks once and for all”.
A statement issued from CM House said that Federal Communications Secretary Ali Sher informed the meeting that the M-6 project had received final approval under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) with a budget of Rs363 billion.
He said that the project would be implemented in five phases by the National Highway Authority, with the Islamic Development Bank committing to fund two sections and a Chinese company expressing interest in undertaking all five sections.
The meeting was told that the M-6 project would complete Pakistan’s north-south motorway backbone, linking Peshawar to Karachi, and enhance trade, logistics, and regional development. The project is expected to reduce travel time, improve safety, and facilitate port-to-upcountry connectivity.
The meeting was attended among others by Provincial Ministers Sharjeel Inam Memon, Syed Nasir Hussain Shah and Ali Hassan Zardari, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Planning and Development Chairman Najam Shah and Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh.

World number one Sinner swept aside 10th seed Musetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in the first all-Italian men’s quarter-final in Grand Slam history.
“It was a great performance, very solid. I started the match very well,” said Sinner, who faces Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semi-finals on Friday.
 






Auger-Aliassime has won two of three previous meetings but Sinner thrashed him for the loss of just two games in Cincinnati last month.
“Every player who is in the semis of a Grand Slam can say they’re playing their best tennis,” added Sinner.
The 24-year-old Sinner also tied Nicola Pietrangeli for the most Grand Slams win by an Italian man with his 86th victory.
Auger-Aliassime overcame Alex de Minaur in a four-set battle lasting over four hours to reach his second US Open semi-final.
The 25-year-old Auger-Aliassime is back in the last four of a Grand Slam for the first time since the 2021 US Open after beating eighth seed De Minaur 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 7-5, 7-6 (7/4).
“Some days you won’t feel your best but I was willing to dig really deep and do everything I can,” said Auger-Aliassime.
“It feels amazing. Four years ago, it feels like more. It was a tough couple of years but it feels even better now to be in the semi-finals.”
Australia’s De Minaur, 26, has now lost all six of his Grand Slam quarter-finals.
“Right now I’m looking at this like a wasted opportunity,” De Minaur said.
Anisimova delivers payback
Anisimova rebounded from her disastrous double-bagel defeat at the hands of Swiatek at Wimbledon two months ago, beating the second-ranked Pole 6-4, 6-3 in New York.
“I’ve been having the run of my life here,” said Anisimova, the American eighth seed.
“The first day I got here I was like ‘OK, let’s try and get through one round… This has been such a dream. To come back from Wimbledon like that is really special to me.”
 






Six-time major winner Swiatek entered the US Open as the bookmakers’ favourite, after she followed up her maiden Wimbledon title with victory at the Cincinnati Open WTA 1000 event.
Swiatek broke in the first game of the match but Anisimova hit back immediately and snatched the opening set when her rival ballooned a forehand long.
Anisimova again had to rally after falling behind early in the second set.
She broke back for 2-2 and then moved a game from victory as Swiatek coughed up a costly double fault.
Swiatek saved two match points but a net cord in Anisimova’s favour sealed the win and a sense of redemption for the 24-year-old.
“Today is definitely the most meaningful victory I’ve had in my life,” said Anisimova.
Swiatek accepted she didn’t play well enough.
“I kind of have to let it go and just focus on the next one,” said Swiatek.
Osaka beat Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) to extend her deepest run at a Grand Slam since returning to tennis after the birth of her daughter in 2023.
The Japanese star hit 30 winners in a smooth performance reminiscent of the player who lifted the trophy here in 2018 and 2020.
“It’s been a while since I’ve been in this position,” said Osaka, who has gone on to win the tournament every time she has reached the last four of a major.
“You play the best players in the world towards the end of a Slam. We’re all hoping to achieve the same thing. It’s kind of like boxing, but with a tennis ball,” said Osaka, the 23rd seed.
However, she has lost both previous matches with Anisimova — at the Australian Open and Roland Garros in 2022.</p><small>2025-09-04 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68b901f3a4751.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939571/wapda-seeks-to-double-revenue-requirement' target='_blank'><strong>Wapda seeks to double revenue requirement</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has sought about a 91 per cent increase in its revenue requirement to Rs365 billion for the current fiscal year (FY26), up from Rs191bn in FY23.
This would translate into an estimated 90pc increase in the bulk hydropower rate to about Rs11.55 per unit (kilowatt hour) from Rs6.10 per unit, an official told Dawn.
The additional revenue of about Rs174bn demanded by Wapda for FY26 also covers an unaddressed financial gap of Rs22.35bn for FY23, Rs56bn for FY24 and Rs61bn for FY25. The Rs365bn revenue requirement further includes Rs29.5bn net hydel profit (NHP) to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Rs1.55 per unit, Rs11.7bn to Punjab at Rs1.47 per unit, and Rs5bn in water use charges to Azad Kashmir at Rs1.10 per unit.
 
 

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has scheduled a public hearing on September 11 to assess whether Wapda’s claim is justified for an 85pc increase in return on investments and operations and maintenance (O&M) to Rs179bn in FY26, compared to Rs97bn determined in FY23.
This includes Wapda’s demand for raising O&M expenses from Rs24bn in FY23 to Rs30.665bn in FY24, Rs36.374bn in FY25 and Rs39.59bn in FY26 — a 67pc increase. The claims also include a depreciation charge of Rs7.924bn in FY24, Rs8.611bn in FY25 and Rs8.7bn in FY26. Nepra has also raised questions about Wapda’s demand for a weighted average cost of capital (WACC)-based return on power stations of Rs31.582bn, Rs32.294bn and Rs32.011bn for FY24, FY25 and FY26, respectively.
Similarly, the request for WACC-based return on investment in power projects amounting to Rs59.783bn, Rs78.408bn and Rs99.642bn for the same three years is under scrutiny.
Overall, Wapda has sought its own revenue requirement at Rs318.5bn for FY26 — an almost 166pc increase compared to Rs119.962bn in Fy23. In addition, Wapda has kept its estimates relatively stable for levies and dues payable to the provinces and AJK on account of NHP and water use charges.
Annual NHP payments to KP are estimated at Rs29.53bn for FY26 compared to Rs30bn in FY23. Similar payments to Punjab are booked at Rs11.969bn for FY26 against Rs11.867bn in FY23, while water use charges for AJK are projected at Rs5.085bn in FY26 against Rs4.222bn in FY23. Wapda’s power generation from all assets is projected at 31,563 gigawatt hours (GWh) in FY26, slightly up from 31,286GWh in Fy23.
A key issue for scrutiny will be Wapda’s request to carve out 20MW for a wheeling arrangement to Sky47 — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) of Mari Energy — for data centres of strategic and commercial use, in line with the competitive trading bilateral contract market (CTBCM), along with provisions for post-retirement benefits of Wapda employees.

The event took place at the Forest, Parks, and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit, with numerous outfitters and hunters participating in the bidding, during which the department auctioned permits for the trophy hunting of four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibexes, and 14 blue sheep.
The second-highest permit for an Astore markhor sold for $286,000, while the top permits for a blue sheep and a Himalayan ibex went for $40,000 and $13,000, respectively.
“This is a record for the highest markhor hunting permit bid in the world and in Pakistan,” GB conservator for Parks and Wildlife Khadim Abbas told Dawn.

Top permit for Astore markhor sold for $370,000

He noted that the previous highest-priced permit in Pakistan was auctioned by the Khyber Pak­h­tunkhwa wildlife department in Chitral last year for $271,000.
Shikar Safaris Owner Raja Farhad Maqpoon placed the winning $370,000 bid for a permit in the Nanga Parbat conservancy area.
The other two Astore markhor permits sold for $270,000 and $240,000. The highest bids for both the blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits were won by M Ali Nagri of Markhor Safaris.
For the upcoming season, the department raised the base price for an Astore markhor permit to $200,000, up from $150,000 last year.
The base prices for blue sheep and Himalayan ibex were set at $30,000 and $10,000, up from $9,000 and $5,500, respectively. In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor was $161,000.
However, some local outfitters and tour operators argued the sharp fee hikes are discouraging international clients and could harm their businesses.
“If the true spirit of conservation is replaced with short-term financial gains for local communities, the model will lose its foundation and is likely to collapse within a few years, leaving both wildlife and communities at a greater loss,” said Ikram Baig, president of the GB Association of Tour Operators.
The trophy hunting programme in Gilgit-Baltistan was launched in 1990 and is credited with helping protect endangered species.
Under the programme, local communities receive about 80 percent of the revenue from hunting permits to be used for conservation and development projects. Stakeholders now fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.

The committee also suggested placing the authority under the Finance Division rather than the Cabinet Division.
During discussions on the government’s Virtual Assets Bill 2025, PMLN Senator Afnanullah Khan accused the Secretary of Law of plagiarism. He claimed that he had originally tabled the bill, which was later “copy-pasted” by the Ministry of Law and introduced as the government’s version.
“This is shameful,” he said, adding that the government’s draft was identical to the one he had proposed, which had been opposed by the government earlier.
 






Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, who chaired the meeting, criticised the practice of the government claiming credit for draft laws initially proposed by members. He pointed out that such instances had occurred multiple times in the past, with the government only acting when parliamentarians introduced new bills. Senator Dilawar Khan likened the situation to someone claiming ownership of Mirza Ghalib’s poetry.
Secretary of Law Raja Naeem Akbar denied having seen Mr Khan’s private member bill until the Senate panel provided it. However, Senator Afnanullah maintained that the law minister had seen and opposed his bill when it was first introduced. He proposed a privilege motion in the Senate, accusing the Law Secretary of misleading Parliament by claiming the bill was never presented.

Recommends barring PVARA members from trading; proposes placing authority under Finance Division

The committee also recommended setting eligibility criteria for members and the chairman of PVARA, including a minimum of five years of experience and an age limit of 55 years. Senator Afnanullah suggested stronger safeguards for data privacy, and proposed that service providers be held accountable for privacy violations.
 
 

Senators Mandviwalla and Mohsin Aziz raised concerns over the $10,000 limit on virtual asset transactions, suggesting that there should be no such cap if the government is determined to regulate virtual assets.
The government had issued a presidential ordinance on July 8 to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and service providers. The regulator will have comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, and prevent illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing, in line with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
PVARA’s board will include key government figures such as the State Bank’s governor, and the secretaries of finance, law, and information technology, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and Digital Pakistan Authority. Two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance, or technology will also be appointed by the federal government.
 
 

Under the bill, any person or company wishing to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by PVARA. The bill outlines a structured licensing regime with specific requirements for operational capacity, compliance frameworks, and reporting obligations.
The bill aims to ensure investor protection, promote transparency, and foster innovation in the virtual asset market.
The government has also ensured that the regulatory framework will be compatible with Islamic finance principles by mandating the creation of a Sharia Advisory Committee to advise PVARA on Sharia compliance for virtual asset products and services.

The US-based Muslim Charity Helping Hand for Relief and Development (HHRD), largely run by Pakistani Americans, spent the day on Capitol Hill, highlighting the urgent need for food, clean water, medical assistance, and long-term rehabilitation for millions of people affected by the floods.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, described the floods as “an unprecedented disaster that has set back economic growth, and continues to cause devastation across the country”.
Warning that next year’s monsoon could arrive earlier and bring even greater devastation, he called Pakistan “a frontline state” in the fight against climate change.
“Governments will do what they can, but all should come forward and help. The world must form a collective strategy to deal with recurring disasters,” he said.

Pakistani Americans highlight urgent need for food, clean water, medical aid and rehabilitation for millions hit by floods

The HHRD also announced dedicating an initial $5 million for relief and rehabilitation work and pledged to expand its efforts. The Pakistani community is holding fundraising events across the United States and Canada to supplement the relief efforts.
HHRD officials told lawmakers that the floods have directly affected more than five million people, with over 20 million at risk, underscoring the urgency of global support. Since late June, torrential rains and flash floods have battered Pakistan, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The floods have killed 881 people, injured more than 1,100, destroyed 11,000 homes, and damaged 250 bridges and 415 miles of roads. Some 1.2 million hectares have been submerged, including 853,000 hectares of cropland.
A UN report, released on Wednesday, warned that “the situation remains highly fluid, with reservoirs at full capacity and heavy rainfall forecast in early September, cautioning that new surges along the Chenab and other rivers could impact downstream districts in South Punjab”.
HHRD officials said their teams have been providing mobile clinics, water filtration systems, search-and-rescue operations, cooked meals, hygiene kits, mosquito nets, milk, and “Smile Boxes” for children. By early September, their relief teams had reached over 62,000 people across 13 districts, including Lahore, Sialkot, Swat, Neelum Valley, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Officials emphasised that this initial $5m is a starting point and that the organisation intends to expand its reach in the coming weeks and months.
Ambassador Sheikh also highlighted the proactive spirit of Pakistanis, noting that citizens often take initiative in disaster response without waiting for government intervention.

In a set of proposals, the SCBA highlighted that open hearings will not only ensure internal accountability but also reaffirm the constitutional guarantee of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution.
Once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should conduct open proceedings subject to reasonable safeguards of dignity and decorum while deciding references within a fixed timeframe, preferably six months.
The 12-page set of proposals seeking to amend the SC Rules-2025 was furnished by SCBA President Mian Mohammad Rauf Atta and senior advocate Hafiz Ehsan Khokhar and were made known to the media at a press conference on Wednesday.

Set of proposals made public ahead of SC full court meeting

Considering the adverse reaction by the top lawyer’s bodies including the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and SCBA, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had constituted a committee under Rule 1(4) of the new rules to suggest recommendations for addressing any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to provisions of the new rules.
The proposals will be taken up by the full court on Sept 8.
The written proposals request immediate withdrawal of recent increase in court fees, setting up a timeline for lawyers representing different parties to present arguments, deciding every case filed in the Supreme Court within a year, issuing orders of court proceedings the same day and reserved decisions within a month.
According to the set of proposals, suggestions were made to ensure the implementation of legal provisions under Articles 4, 10A, 25, and 37(d) that guarantee equality before law, fair trial, and the right to inexpensive and expeditious justice.
It was noted that as SC’s sanctioned strength has been enhanced to 35 judges, including the CJP, this moment presents a unique opportunity for structural reforms.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees, stating the recent increase in court fees should be withdrawn to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany where only nominal fees were charged.
One of the proposals deals with the right of audience for counsel by ensuring uninterrupted opportunities for lawyers to present their case, similar to structured models in Norway, France and Germany, while another asked for increase in working hours and urgent benches of the court as practised in India, the UK and the US.
The right of access to justice enshrined in Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution requires not merely the availability of judicial forums but also their effective and timely functioning, it was emphasised.
The pendency of cases before the SC that had reached unprecedented levels demands innovative approa­ches to maximise court’s productivity. One effective reform would be the extension of working hours for hearings and the creation of “late benches” dedicated to urgent matters such as bail, human rights petitions, election disputes and stay ap­­plications. Comparative practices il­­lustrate that this model has proven highly effective in other jurisdicti­o­­ns, the proposal said, adding the Su­­p­reme Court of India regularly constitutes vacation benches and late benches to address urgent relief during recess and after-hours sittings.
For Pakistan, the adoption of extended hours and urgent benches would not only address the backlog but also reinforce public confidence in the judiciary’s responsiveness, thereby fulfilling the constitutional promise that justice will be administered without delay or denial.
Another proposal stated the Arti­c­les 175 and 184 envisioned the Sup­r­e­me Court as the apex judicial auth­ority, with mandate to adjudicate ma­­tters of constitutional, tax, civil, criminal, and regulatory importan­­ce.
On cause list and adjournment of cases, the proposal asked for adopting India’s continuous listing and China’s AI-driven scheduling to curb adjournments.
It asked for the issuance of short orders the same day followed by detailed reasons, consistent with the practice in Germany, Turkiye, and France.
About digitisation, it asked for e-filing, online tracking, and automation modelled on systems in Singapore, China, and Norway.

The remarks were made during a press conference, where leaders of the political alliance criticised the government’s response to a natural disaster affecting numerous districts.
“Punjab is also facing severe floods, but the provincial government has completely failed,” said TTAP Secretary General Asad Qaiser, who was joined by Salman Akram Raja, Raja Nasir Abbas and others.
“Instructions have been passed that relief activities cannot be done without pictures of Maryam Nawaz. Only media campaign is going on and no relief has been provided.”

TTAP accuses officials of using relief efforts to run media campaign for CM

Mr Qaiser, stating that he also belongs to a flood-affected area, spoke of the human toll of the disaster. “I also belong to areas affected by flood and know a house in which 13 family members died,” he said.
He called for a comprehensive plan to build small dams and suggested that an emergency be declared. Mr Qaiser also blamed illegal housing societies for flooding in Lahore and urged the government to re-launch the Billion Tree Tsunami project to prevent disasters in future.
He contrasted the current situation with the 2022 floods, claiming the former PDM government sought international funds but failed to act. He also alleged the current Punjab government was preoccupied with social media.
“Punjab government was busy on TikTok and was doing nothing,” Mr Qaiser said, noting that livestock was suffering without care while officials were making visits to Japan instead of supporting the people.
 
 

Salman Akram Raja, who also spoke at the conference, warned of economic consequences. He said destroyed crops would lead to higher prices for rice and wheat.
“The import-export gap has been increasing due to which inflation will increase,” Mr Raja said.

This combination of growth with inflation portends trouble because it is a sign that the economy is trying to serve levels of demand that its productive apparatus is not capable of meeting.
Over-extraction is something similar, but on the opposite end of the spectrum. This is when a state tries to extract for itself resources from an economy that the productive apparatus is not able to supply. And that is where we have reached in Pakistan. We are now in a situation where the state is trying to extract dollars and revenues from an economy in quantities that the productive apparatus cannot supply.
 
 

Consider the state’s growing appetite for dollars. One data series illuminates this. Look at the net foreign assets, or NFAs, in the State Bank’s monetary data series. This data measures the total foreign currency liquidity in the system. You’ll notice three entries. One tells you how much of the NFA is held by the State Bank. The second tells you how much is held by commercial banks. And the third entry is the total.
Notice that total NFAs are negative for a long time. Start from July 2023, when they are negative Rs1.7 trillion, and notice how the line moves in one long, slow, agonising upward trajectory, pock-marked with dips along the way, until it finally breaks into positive territory on the last day of March 2025. This long, slow, agonising climb out of negative territory is one of the two key elements of what they call ‘stabilisation’, because so long as NFAs are negative, it means the foreign currency liabilities on the system are larger than the assets.

The state is trying to extract more revenues, and more dollars from an economy that is not able to supply these.

It took years for this figure to break out above the x-axis of the graph, and the journey was marked with strong devaluation of the rupee, strangulation of imports, sharp curbs on cross-border payments, administrative measures on land border crossings, threats and cajoling for money changers and incentives for banks to rake in more remittances through formal channels. In short, it took nearly the full might of the state and central bank, for well over 20 months, to pull this line up from its low point back then to positive territory today.
 
 

Now look at the series for NFAs held by the State Bank. Notice how it breaks out above zero back in August 2024 and keeps rising from that point, suffering a few setbacks along the way in late December and early January. By June 2025, it hits a peak of Rs657 billion. Not bad considering its journey began from negative Rs883bn back in June 2023, on the eve of the stabilisation programme. That’s an increase of Rs1.5tr.
Notice how in June this figure drops suddenly back into negative territory, then leaps out of it the next week to a new peak of Rs968bn. This is a sudden outflow due to repayment of a Chinese bond, followed by an equally sudden inflow due to a rollover, so the same liquidity flows out of the system with the repayment and back in again once the rollover is finalised from the Chinese side.
Then look at what happens after that. State Bank NFAs rise massively to Rs1.45tr, and remain stable more or less at the level till today. Meanwhile, NFAs held by private banks plunge, falling from negative Rs353bn when the rollover happens to negative Rs741bn today.
Once plotted on a graph, these three lines will tell a stark story of how all the foreign exchange that flowed into the country once the current account was stabilised with great pain and sacrifice somewhere in the early months of 2023 was then bought and stashed away by the central bank in order to build its reserves. And this frenzied buying is being carried out at a price dictated by the government.
The fact that NFAs of scheduled banks remain negative through all this entire period as the State Bank’s assets rise to levels not seen for years tells us that the state is basically taking all the foreign exchange flowing into the country for itself. And the data shows that this process is intensifying from May 2025 onwards.
This helps explain the rising pressures on the exchange rate in these months. It also helps explain why maybe exporters are holding back export proceeds in anticipation of a potential exchange rate devaluation.
 
 

It also helps us understand why money changers were called in one more time a few weeks ago and told to stop trying to sell their dollars in the black market. It helps us understand why the State Bank is not cutting interest rates even though inflation has fallen to historic lows. It also helps explain the large spread between the price of the dollar in the interbank market versus the hundi or hawala market, which probably reflects the true price more accurately.
We hit peak stabilisation somewhere in the early months of 2025. From there, we have now moved into over-extraction mode. The state is trying to extract more revenues, and more dollars from an economy that is not able to supply these. At least not as presently constituted. So the state resorts to heightened coercive measures, which is what gives the whole enterprise the look of extraction. This is no longer the pursuit of macroeconomic stability that we are in. This is now a state bleeding its own economy to feed its appetites.
The balance-of-payments crisis that Pakistan faced in the summer of 2022 is what happens when you gun an overheating economy to grow harder and faster. The present juncture is what you get when you try to extract dollars and revenues from a stagnant economy. We have gone from overheating to over-extraction. And the only way out is to either reform, or find an external bailout.

• Move to have family courts hear polygamy cases gets full court nod
ISLAMABAD: Despite strong resistance from senior judges, a full court meeting of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adopted the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025.
The rules were passed by a slim majority, while a proposal from two  judges, seeking changes to the meeting’s agenda, was rejected.
According to the agenda, the full court had been convened to deliberate on three key issues: amendments to the law related to polygamy, structural flaws in the IHC building, and the adoption of the service rules.
The meeting was attended by all 11 judges, including Chief Justice Sardar Moham­mad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Jus­tice Tariq Mehmood Jahan­giri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ish­aq Khan, Justice Khadim Hus­sain Soomro, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, Justice Moham­mad Azam Khan, Jus­t­ice Moham­mad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas.
Polygamy law, building flaws
Sources said the full court unanimously approved the amendment to the polygamy law, under which such cases will now be tried by family courts instead of executive magistrates.
It also decided to refer the IHC building case to the federal government for a thorough investigation into persistent issues. An inquiry conducted by the public works department earlier pointed out several defects in the elevators.
The inquiry report noted that the elevators lacked certain features promised in the prototype and the specifications, but it failed to identify those responsible for the fau­lty installation and maintenance.
Apart from the elevators, the IHC building continues to suffer from multiple problems, including an ineffective cooling system and inadequate parking facilities for litigants and lawyers.
The judges observed that instead of referring the matter directly to the National Accountability Bureau or the Federal Investigation Agency, the federal government should be asked to carry out a comprehensive probe and take corrective measures.
CJ’s powers
Unlike these two agenda items, the proposed IHC Rules, 2025 triggered  a sharp division among the judges. While the chief justice strongly supported them, senior judges, including Justice Kayani, Justice  Jahangiri, Justice Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Imtiaz, opposed their adoption and urged amendments.
A day before the meeting, Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had written letters to their colleagues, voicing serious concerns that administrative powers were being misused to sideline dissenting judges.
 
 

Both judges strongly objected to a new circular requiring judges to obtain a No-Objection Cert­ificate (NOC) from the chief justice for foreign travel.
They alleged that case assignments were being manipulated to benefit judges transferred to the IHC alongside the chief justice, while permanent judges who had opposed his transfer were being sidelined.
The letters also challenged the chief justice’s use of the “master of the roster” power to transfer part-heard cases.
Justice Khan also took exception to the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR), reminding his colleagues that PPR had already been gazetted without approval or even proper discussion by the full bench.
He noted the voluminous document, spanning more than 600 pages, had been provided only a day and a half before the meeting, reducing consultation to a mere formality and making meaningful input impossible.
Justice Khan dem­anded that five additional agenda items, including these objections, be formally taken up for “proper deliberations” in the full court meeting, signalling his refusal to let the controversy be ignored.
Voting and objections
According to sources, Chief Justice Dogar rejected any alteration in the agenda and proceeded to call a vote.
Six judges, including the chief justice, approved the rules, while five opposed them and resolved to record their objections in writing.
During the proceedings, the dissenting judges questioned whether those voting in favour had even read the new rules. The response, sources claimed, was negative.
Some judges, noting the massive length of the document, requested the chief justice to postpone the meeting, but their plea was turned down. Ultimately, the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were adopted by a razor-thin majority, leaving the full court deeply divided.

This is a welcome step considering the increasing use, application, availability and risks of AI in technology-related sectors, as well as the increased societal use of it. Whereas the policy outlines an ambitious plan related to AI in Pakistan, it can benefit with several additions, and the addressing of contextual realities including impact and risks that the plan does not acknowledge.
The AI policy created a National AI Fund (allocating 30 per cent of Ignite’s Research and Development fund), Centres of Excellence, an AI Council/Directorate, regulatory sandboxes and national compute/data infrastructure.
 
 

The policy prioritises sector pilots in health, education, agriculture and governance, plus public awareness. Targets include training up to one million professionals by 2030; 3,000 scholarships annually, paid internships and alignment with global standards on ethics, cybersecurity and data protection. Implementation will follow a master plan and action matrix overseen by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom.
The policymaking process was not inclusive, as a multi-stakeholder dialogue has not included cross-cutting segments of society, including environmentalists, civil society, digital rights experts, media and the healthcare and education sectors; and there is no transparency around the stakeholder engagement process.
Significantly, there is no legislative basis for taking these decisions, as no parliamentary debate (including in the IT committees) has taken place, other than the IT ministry formulating the policy through a nontransparent process.
For starters, the policy does not acknowledge the limitations in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure, including a jarring digital divide, which will impact the implementation of the AI policy equitably. For instance, there was a three-week mobile internet shutdown across Balochistan last month, and internet connectivity remains limited in several other parts of the country, including KP’s western districts.
 
 

The policy speaks of including AI in public school curricula, but thousands of schools across the country are devoid of functional computer labs. For instance, according to reports, 1,482 government-run schools in KP lack computer lab facilities. How then can AI be taught to students who do not even have access to computers?
Furthermore, the policy does not take into account the dynamic nature of AI and technology, and outlines no strategy on how curricula for AI in the education sector will be updated with changes in technology, something that may render earlier curricula obsolete.

The policy does not take into account the dynamic nature of AI and technology.

Whereas the policy mentions use of AI for the environment, it completely ignores the climate-related risks of AI data centres in Pakistan, which, besides being a water-scarce country is acutely vulnerable to the impact of climate change. A large data centre for AI can require up to 5m gallons of water per day — this is the daily amount needed for a town of around 50,000 people.
 
 

As Pakistan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, over 80pc of its population faces water scarcity. Therefore, any AI policy with proposals for local data centres should include a mandatory environmental impact assessment condition.
The AI policy includes plans for E-khidmat centres for public services, health, education, sanitation, energy, security and other government services through AI chatbots, smart reporting and centralised service delivery. This raises surveillance risks, especially in the face of the absence of a data protection regime. Further, overreliance on AI when people need assistance and interface with government officials will only mirror current portals and helplines where people never hear back.
There are significant rights implications of this policy, in particular relating to privacy rights and freedom of speech impacts. It is alarming that the policy has been formulated in the absence of a data protection regime in Pakistan as the Personal Data Protection Bill is yet to be passed; however, the AI policy refers to aspects of the bill despite the status of the law remaining unclear. If a strong data protection regime does not exist, it raises serious concern around privacy risks around the large language models that fuel AI systems.
 
 

Furthermore, the policy details how an AI directorate will be formed to provide regulatory guidelines to address “disinformation, data breaches and fake news”. It is necessary that such steps entail a robust and inclusive parliamentary process, as such language raises alarms related to freedom of expression.
The policy does not mention the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, which deals with issues such as disinformation and ‘fake news’ in its amended form as of February 2025, and the overlap that the work of this directorate may have with that of the Social Media Regulatory Authority that the Peca amendments proposed.
The Digital Rights Foundation in its analysis of the policy stresses the “serious questions around transparency, ethical safeguards and protecting marginalised communities from discrimination”, which is imperative considering the risks of discrimination that automated systems in AI pose. In the absence of provisions in the policy on human rights risk assessments, the human rights impact of AI systems in the country are likely to create new issues rather than address existing ones.
Relatedly, the policy includes proposals for special training programmes for women and persons with disabilities, but it does not address the expanded role AI is playing in technology-facilitated gender-based violence.
At an event on TFGBV, a Pakistani man noted that “previously men would throw acid at women to destroy their lives, but now men have to create an AI-generated video to destroy the life of a woman”. This shows the gendered risk that AI poses to Pakistani women and gender minorities in particular, and it should be reflected in the policy.
Lastly, whereas the AI policy addresses expanding AI systems in Pakistan and supporting innovation and education related to it, there need to be specific provisions around developing machine-learning models in languages most common in Pakistan so that reliance on foreign languages reduces and inclusive expansion of AI tools are available to speakers and readers of Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashto, Seraiki, Balochi languages.

• WFP says it has supplies, funds for only four weeks
KABUL/GENEVA: Afghanistan airdropped commandos on Wednesday to pull survivors from the rubble in areas ravaged by earthquakes that have killed more than 1,400 this week, as a United Nations agency warned that food aid for victims would run out soon without urgent funding.
Meanwhile, the UN refugee chief has called on Pakistan to pause its expulsion of Afghan refugees, as returns continued despite the weekend’s deadly quake.
The latest expulsions come as already impoverished Afghanistan responds to a devastating 6.0-magnitude  earthquake that wiped out villages along the border that were home to many recently expelled migrants.
More than 1,400 people were killed in the disaster. More than 1.2 million Afghans have been made to leave Pakistan since 2023, including more than 443,000 this year alone, according to the UN.
At the Chaman border crossing, “more than 4,000 people have left ever since the deadline ended”, local administrator Habib Bangulzai told AFP.
In Spin Boldak on the Afghan side, migrant registration official Abdul Latif Hakimi estimated that “250 to 300 families are returning” daily since August 31.
At the Torkham crossing further north, more than 6,300 PoR holders returned on Tuesday alone, according to authorities managing the terminal. They estimated that nearly 63,000 PoR cardholders have entered Afghanistan since April.
Afghan refugees, some awaiting relocation overseas, reported police raids as well as extortion and harassment by authorities in the lead-up to the latest deadline.
Search and rescue
Dozens of commando forces were being airdropped at sites where helicopters cannot land, to help carry the injured to safer ground, in what aid groups said was a race against time to rescue those still stuck under rubble.
Time was also running out for those who survived the two devastating quakes in the remote eastern region of the impoverished country, the World Food Progra­m­­me (WFP) warned on Wednesday.
John Aylieff, the head of WFP in Afghanistan, told Reuters that the agency only has enough funding and stocks for the next four weeks.
“Four weeks is just not enough even to meet the basic, essential needs of the population struck by the earthquake, let alone put the victims on a path back to rebuilding their lives,” Aylieff said.
The toll stands at 1,457 deaths, 3,394 injuries and more than 6,700 destroyed homes, the Taliban administration said. The UN has said the toll could rise, with people still trapped under rubble.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
Households wiped out
Entire households were wiped out in some villages in Kunar province, where the majority of casualties were reported from, with a dozen dead and hundreds hurt in nearby Nangarhar and Laghman provinces. Survivors sifted through rubble looking for families, carried bodies on woven stretchers and dug graves with pickaxes.
Access remained difficult, as aftershocks caused rockfall, stymying access to already isolated villages and keeping families outdoors for fear of the remains of damaged homes collapsing on them.
Flimsy or poorly-built homes made of dry masonry, stone and timber gave little protection from the quakes, in ground left unstable by days of heavy rain, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

• UN Committee on the Rights of Persons says 21,000 children disabled in the conflict
DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates warned Israel on Wednesday that annexation in the occupied West Bank would be a “red line” that would severely undermine the Abraham Accords that normalised relations between the two countries.
The comments came as US President Donald Trump, who first brokered the accords, seeks to expand them in his current term, though efforts have stalled amid growing international criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war.
The warning followed an announcement in August by Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich that work would start on a long-delayed settlement intended to divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem. Smotrich has also called for annexing the West Bank.
“From the very beginning, we viewed the Accords as a way to enable our continued support for the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspiration for an independent state,” United Arab Emira­tes’s Assistant Minister for Political Affairs and Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lana Nusseibeh told Reuters. “We call on the Israeli government to suspend these [settlement] plans.”
 
 

Ms Nusseibeh added that annexation “would constitute a red line for the United Arab Emirates,” as it would undermine the “vision and spirit” of the accords and end the pursuit of regional integration.
The Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, on Wednesday, Smotrich said maps were being drawn up for annexing territory, though it was unclear if he had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s support.
Gaza offensive
The diplomatic friction comes as the Israeli military pushed deeper into Gaza City, with soldiers and tanks entering Sheikh Radwan, one of the urban center’s most crowded neighbourhoods.
Residents said the military destroyed homes and tent encampments that housed Palestinians displaced by the war.
According to local health officials, at least 24 Palestinians, including children, were killed across Gaza, most of them in Gaza City, on Wednesday.
“Sheikh Radwan is being burnt upside-down.
The occupation destroyed houses, burnt tents, and drones played audio messages ordering people to leave the area,” said Zakeya Sami, 60.
“If the takeover of Gaza City isn’t stopped, we might die, and we are not going to forgive anyone who stands and watches,” she told Reuters.
Witnesses said the military also dropped grenades on three schools in the Sheikh Radwan area sheltering displaced families and bombed a medical clinic, destroying two ambulances.
Netanyahu has ordered the military to take the city, which he describes as the last stronghold of Hamas.
In Israel, public sentiment has increasingly favoured ending the war in a deal to release the remaining prisoners.
In Jerusalem on Wednesday, protesters climbed the roof of Israel’s national library, displaying a banner that read, “You have abandoned and also killed.”
Children disabled
The war’s devastating toll on civilians was highlighted in a United Nations report Wednesday, which found that at least 21,000 children in Gaza have been disabled since the conflict began.
The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that of the 40,500 children who have suffered new war-related injuries, more than half have been left disabled.
The committee reported that Israeli evacuation orders were “often inaccessible” to people with hearing or visual impairments. Committee member Muhannad Al-Azzeh cited the example of a deaf mother in Rafah killed with her children, unaware of evacuation instructions.
Restrictions on humanitarian aid have disproportionately affected people with disabilities, who face severe disruptions to assistance, leaving many without food, water, or sanitation.
The committee noted that 83 per cent of disabled people have lost assistive devices like wheelchairs and walkers, which Israeli authorities often consider “dual-use items” and exclude from aid shipments.
“We can’t expect children with disabilities… to be able to run and go to the (aid) points,” Mr Azzeh said. “This is why one of our main recommendations is that children with disabilities must be reached out to.”

The ‘Rapid Needs Assessment’ report prepared by UN-OCHA says Buner recorded the largest losses of agricultural land with 1,157 acres affected, followed by Swat with 853 acres, Shangla with 559 acres, and Swabi with 330 acres.
Over 80 per cent of people reported crop losses which were significant in Battagram and Mansehra, while Lower Dir and Torghar reported smaller but notable losses, further threatening food security and livelihoods, the UN-OCHA report says.
People lost about 6,206 livestock across the affected areas of 10 districts. Buner reported the highest losses with 4,818 animals, followed by Swat with 618, Shangla with 295, Battagram with 219, and Swabi with 105. Smaller but significant losses were recorded in Bajaur, Mansehra, Torghar, and Upper Dir, while Lower Dir reported minimal impact.

Report says over 80pc of people reported crop losses; 6,206 livestock lost

The loss of livestock further weakened the livelihoods of rural households already facing crop damage and displacement.
Across most flood-affected areas, market access has remained relatively stable. Overall, 77 per cent of markets were reported as accessible, with full access in districts such as Bajaur, Battagram, Lower Dir, Tor Ghar, and Upper Dir.
Swat and Mansehra also reported high levels of access, showing that even in areas severely hit by floods, physical access to markets was somehow maintained. However, Buner had the lowest access at only 35 per cent, leaving people there with limited options for essential supplies.
Despite this physical access, food and non-food availability in markets remains a challenge across many districts.
 
 

The regular supply of essential commodities was disrupted in 55 per cent of the affected areas, with Swabi, Shangla, and Swat facing the most significant interruptions.
This means that while people in several districts can reach markets, goods they need are often either unavailable or supplied inconsistently, affecting food security and basic household needs.
Despite considerable efforts by the KP government and humanitarian actors, the assessment data reveals that many affected people continue to face critical gaps in assistance across multiple sectors.
Food assistance reached the largest proportion of affected households at 42 per cent overall, with significant support reported in Buner, Swabi, and Shangla districts.
However, in Battagram, Lower Dir, Torghar, and Upper Dir districts, people reported no or very limited food assistance. Similarly, health services were the second-most supported sector, reaching 39 pc of the affected population.
Major health interventions were reported in Buner (82pc), Swabi (50pc), and Shangla (22pc), but Torghar and Upper Dir districts reported no health assistance at all. In terms of shelter support, only 20 per cent of households reported receiving assistance.
Districts like Swabi (50pc) and Buner (31pc) reported the highest coverage, whereas most other districts reported minimal or no assistance despite extensive housing damages. Nutrition support was reported by just 15pc of people, largely concentrated in Buner (48pc), with almost no coverage in other districts, leaving children and pregnant women at risk.
The education sector was the least supported, with only 2pc coverage, despite widespread damage to school infrastructure in districts like Buner, Swat, and Shangla, potentially impacting thousands of children.
Overall, the data highlights that while food and health received the most attention, shelter, nutrition, and education remain critically underserved, requiring targeted and sustained interventions to bridge the assistance gaps across all affected districts.

• ‘Hot mic’ catches Xi and Putin discussing biotechnology, prospects of prolonging human life
• PM meets Chinese businessmen, tours Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital
BEIJING: President Xi Jinping warned the world was facing a choice between peace or war, as China showcased its military arsenal at a massive parade on Wednesday.
“Today, mankind is faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” Xi told a crowd of more than 50,000 spectators at Tiananmen Square, adding that the Chinese people “firmly stand on the right side of history”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sha­­r­if was also in attendance, alon­g­side Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and North Kor­e­an Leader Kim Jong Un, Iran­ian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, and a host of other world leaders.
The event to mark 80 years since Japan’s defeat at the end of World War II was designed to project China’s military might and diplomatic clout.
It managed to get a rise out of US President Donald Tru­mp, who wrote an acidic post on his Truth Social Platform.
“Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,” Trump added.
The Kremlin said Putin was not conspiring against the Uni­ted States and suggested Tru­mp was being ironic in his remarks.
Military hardware and a ‘hot mic’
Riding in an open-top limousine, Xi then inspected the tro­ops and cutting-edge military equipment such as hypersonic missiles, underwater dron­es and a weaponised ‘robot wolf’.
Helicopters trailing large banners and fighter jets flew in formation during a 70-minute showcase that culminated in the release of 80,000 ‘peace’ birds.
New underwater drones and supersonic missiles counted among the gear on display, as well as the ICBMs.
Donning a tunic suit in the style worn by former leader Mao Zedong, Xi earlier greeted more than 25 leaders on the red carpet, including Indonesia’s Prabowo Subianto who made a surprise appearance despite widespread protests at home.
Seated between Putin and Kim in the viewing gallery during the parade, Xi repeatedly engaged in conversations with both leaders as thousands of troops and materiel passed before them. It marked the first time the trio have appeared together in public. At a lavish reception after the parade at the Great Hall of the People, Xi told his guests that humanity must not return to the “law of the jungle”.
Earlier, when Russian President Vladimir Putin walked shoulder to shoulder with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a hot mic caught them discussing organ transplants and the possibility that humans could live to 150 years old.
The moment was carried on the livestream provided by state broadcaster CCTV.
 
 

As Putin and Xi walked toward the Tiananmen rostrum where they viewed the parade with Kim, Putin’s translator could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”
The translator added, after an inaudible passage: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and (you can) even achieve immortality.”
In response, Xi, who was off camera, can be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”
Kim was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi, but it was not clear if the conversation was being translated for him.
PM Shehbaz’s schedule
On Wednesday, PM Shehbaz visited Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital, and directed Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to establish simple, robust and sustainable infrastructure at Islamabad’s under-construction hospitals, including Jinnah Medical Complex, to deliver high-quality medical facilities, modelled on Chinese standards.
 
 

He also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing to boost business-to-business (B2B) investment cooperation between the two countries.
The prime minister emphasized that industrial cooperation remains the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a defining pillar of the high-quality development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it enters into its second phase.
He invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into Special Economic Zones.

• PDMA chief fears renewed flooding in central Punjab as Indian dams near max capacity;
says ‘Ravi flowing backwards’ instead of merging with Chenab
• 3.7m affected across province, death toll jumps to 46; another massive surge expected at Multan tomorrow
LAHORE: As the confluence of the swollen Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal threatens the districts of Multan and Muzaffargarh, provincial authorities on Wednesday braced for an unprecedented disaster in light of a “dual threat”, which persisted despite several controlled breaches over the past week.
The water level at Muhammadwala and Sher Shah was recorded at 412 feet, only five feet below critical level. The authorities termed the next 12 hours critical, as the pressure at the breaching points continued to increase after the convergence of the Ravi and Chenab rivers near Khanewal.
In order to save urban centres along the eastern rivers, the Punjab government has been following a policy of controlled breaches to relieve pressure on barrages and main embankments to protect densely populated cities. A decision on whether to conduct a breach at Head Muhammadwala, Sher Shah Flood Bund, and Rangpur is expected within hours to save Multan and Muzaffargarh, with 17 points identified.
However, the situation in these two districts is compounded because of an enormous surge of approximately 550,000 cusecs that crossed the Marala and Khanki Headworks and was recorded passing through Qadirabad Headworks with an intensity of 530,000 cusecs. Officials projected that this powerful surge would reach Trimmu Headworks on Thursday and is expected to arrive in the Multan region by Friday.
“The next 12 hours are extremely critical,” stated a Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) official closely involved in crisis management. “We are facing a dual threat: the existing high water from the confluence of the rivers and a new, massive wave heading directly for us. All resources are being mobilised,” he said.
 
 

On the other hand, the railway traffic to Karachi and vice versa was suspended from Faisalabad after a bridge on a railway track on the Chenab River came under water in Abdul Hakim.
Flood warnings
In a press conference on Wednesday ev­­ening, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the flood crisis was set to intensify as all three major Indian dams were expected to reach their maximum capacity within the next 72 hours, exacerbating an already catastrophic situation in the Punjab river system. Addressing a press conference, DG Kathia revealed that his office had received three separate flood warnings in the past 24 hours alone.
He confirmed that while the water level in the Chenab River was currently stable, previously affected districts along its cou­rse were likely to face renewed flooding.
The Sutlej River has been in a flood-like condition for the past two months, while the Ravi River was experiencing rising levels at the Jassar monitoring point. “The next 72 hours are critical,” he stated.
“Thein Dam is already full and will continue to release water into the Ravi for the next two to three weeks. While the situation in Ravi will not be as severe as before, water levels will definitely increase.”
In an alarming development, the DG explained that instead of merging with the Chenab as normally expected, the Ravi’s waters are flowing backwards, preventing any decrease in its water levels. “Until water levels decrease at Ahmadpur Sial, we will not see any reduction at Sidhnai,” he clarified.
 

THIS map shows the locations of controlled breaches, carried out by authorities so far to save major urban centres in Punjab. According to PDMA, arrangements are in place to breach more dykes at Head Muhammadwala, Shershah and Rangpur.

The presser came after Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz conducted a personal assessment of the critical Head Muhammadwala site. DG Kathia said they were facing a major challenge here because it had only four to five feet of capacity remaining before reaching critical levels.
“At Sher Shah Bridge in Multan, there’s significant water pressure with only a two-foot margin remaining,” he revealed. “Im­­portant decisions regarding a controlled breaching in Multan have already been made to prevent uncontrolled overflow.”
Speaking about the damage, the DG said that more than 3,900 villages and a population exceeding 3.7 million had been affected across Punjab. The death toll has risen to 46 people, while over 1.4m residents and 1m animals had been relocated to safer locations.
 
 

The relief effort has expanded to include 409 flood camps where all essential facilities are being provided to approximately 25,000 displaced persons currently taking shelter.
In the Khanewal and Toba Tek Singh districts, the flooding has already affec­ted 136 and 75 villages, respectively, with numbers expected to rise in light of renewed surges.
Punjab CM’s visit
Earlier, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visited flood relief camps in Multan and directed the district administrations to ascertain the scale of damage caused by the floods.
She directed the deputy commissioners to conduct surveys in the flood-affected areas and also provide clean drinking water. She also ordered fumigation and dry germicidal sprays in the flood relief camps and tent cities in the flood-affected areas.
River flows
As of 11pm on Wednesday night, the Marala Headworks on Chenab reported a flow of 444754 cusecs, which was falling, while both Khanki (steady) and Qadirabad Headworks (rising) were holding steady with extremely high flows of 558,683 and 557,440 cusecs, respectively.
A point of vigilance was the Chiniot bridge, where a rising trend was noted with 291,558 cusecs, and Head Muhammadwala, which was also rising at 413.25 feet against a danger level of 417.50 feet. Rivaz Bridge was steady at 519.90 ft (max level 526 ft) and Trimmu Headworks was steady at 265,837 cusecs.
For the Ravi River, the upstream point at Jassar was falling with 82,140 cusecs, indicating a receding trend.
All subsequent points had stabilised, including Ravi Syphon (79,800 cusecs and rising), Shahdara (78,340 cusecs and rising), Balloki Headworks (114,130 cus­e­­cs), and Sidhnai Headworks (152,480 Cu­­secs and falling), reporting steady conditions.
The Sutlej River system was completely stable across all monitoring stations. Key points included G.S. Wala (319,295 cusecs and steady), Sulemanki Headworks (132,492 cusecs and steady), Islam Headworks (95727 cusecs and steady), Panjnad Headworks (159,662 cusecs and steady), and Malsi Syphon (86,085 cusecs).

Trump has been frustrated at his inability to put a halt to the fighting, which began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after he initially predicted he would be able to end the war swiftly when he took office in January.
Trump said he would be holding talks in the next few days. A White House official said Trump is expected to speak on the phone on Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The French presidency said earlier today that several European leaders, including Zelensky and France’s Emmanuel Macron, would call Trump on Thursday afternoon.
That call was expected to follow a mostly virtual meeting on Thursday, hosted by France, of some 30 countries to discuss their latest efforts to provide Ukraine with security support once there is a peace agreement with Russia. The European leaders were also expected to denounce Moscow’s unwillingness to negotiate.
Putin has shown little interest in ending the war after he and Trump voiced optimism about making progress during their meeting in Anchorage on August 16.
“I have no message to President Putin,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he met Polish President Karol Nawrocki.
“He knows where I stand, and he’ll make a decision one way or another. Whatever his decision is, we’ll either be happy about it or unhappy about it, and if we’re unhappy about it, you’ll see things happen,” he said.
Trump did not explain what he meant, but he has talked about the possibility of imposing more sanctions on Russia.
Putin tells Ukraine to end war via talks or he will end it by force
Russian President Vladimir Putin told Kyiv that there was a chance to end the war in Ukraine via negotiations “if common sense prevails”, an option he’d prefer, but that he was ready to end it by force if that was the only way.
Speaking in China at the end of a visit there, Putin said that he perceived “a certain light at the end of the tunnel”, given what he said were sincere efforts by the US to find a settlement to Europe’s ‘biggest land war’ since World War Two.
“It seems to me that if common sense prevails, it will be possible to agree on an acceptable solution to end this conflict. That is my assumption,” he told reporters in Beijing.
“Especially since we can see the mood of the current US administration under President Trump, and we see not just their statements, but their sincere desire to find this solution.
“And I think there is a certain light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s see how the situation develops. If not, then we will have to resolve all the tasks before us by force of arms.”
Putin did not, however, indicate any willingness to soften his long-standing demands that Ukraine abandon any ideas of joining Nato, reverse what Moscow has described as discrimination against Russian speakers and ethnic Russians, or step back from the idea that Moscow must have full control of at least the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine.
He said he was ready to hold talks with Zelensky if the Ukrainian president came to Moscow, but that it remained to be seen whether such a meeting was worthwhile.
He repeated his view that Zelensky, who has not faced re-election due to martial law despite his official term in office expiring, was illegitimate. Kyiv flatly rejects that, saying it is impossible to hold meaningful elections at a time of war.
Zelensky has been pressing to meet Putin to discuss the terms of a possible deal, even though the two sides remain far apart, urging Washington to sanction Moscow again if Putin does not agree.
Trump has also said he wants the two leaders to meet and spoken of but not yet imposed secondary sanctions on Russia.
Putin told reporters he had always been open to meeting Zelensky, but reiterated the Kremlin’s oft-repeated stance that such a meeting had to be well prepared in advance and lead to tangible results.
“As for a meeting with Zelensky, I have never ruled out the possibility of such a meeting. But is there any point? Let’s see,” said Putin.</p><small>2025-09-03 18:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0321500168f9e0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939456/death-toll-in-suicide-bombing-at-bnps-quetta-rally-rises-to-15' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in suicide bombing at BNP’s Quetta rally rises to 15</strong></a><br><p>The death toll in a suicide bombing near Shahwani Stadium in Quetta’s Sariab the previous night rose to 15 on Wednesday.
The attack occurred shortly after the conclusion of a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) held to mark the death anniversary of the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal. The banned militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility today for the attack, AFP reported.
Addressing a press conference today, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat said that the suicide attack claimed 15 lives and injured 32 others.
He said the explosion occurred approximately 500 metres from the exit point of the rally, adding that the rally had officially concluded hours earlier, with the blast taking place at 9:45pm in a poorly lit area near a graveyard.
Shafqaat said that the attacker was unable to breach the main gathering due to stringent security measures, including the deployment of 120 police personnel.
He added that this forced the assailant to detonate the device away from the crowd. “The remains of the bomber, believed to be under 30 years old, were recovered, and authorities estimate that around eight kilogrammes of explosives were used,” he said.
Shaqaat said that the chief minister had announced a compensation package of Rs1.5 million for families of the deceased, Rs0.5m for each injured individual and Rs 200,000 in support for minor victims.
He said Section 144 has been enforced across Balochistan till September 15 and a province-wide high alert remains in effect, adding that authorities have also prohibited public gatherings and processions after sundown, especially during Eid Miladun Nabi, to ensure public safety.
Shafqaat urged the public to trust law enforcement agencies, follow security protocols and report any suspicious activity.
CM Bugti orders swift action against perpetrators, calls for unity
Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, declaring that terrorists would not be allowed to destabilise the province’s peace.
The chief minister expressed these remarks during a high-level meeting on law and order convened in the wake of the attack.
 






During the meeting, Shafqaat and Acting Inspector General of Police Saeed Wazir presented a detailed briefing on the incident. CM Bugti emphasised the need to strengthen security protocols and assured that there would be zero tolerance for lapses in public protection.
He directed Shafqaat to keep both the public and media informed with verified updates to counter misinformation.
“The terrorists behind the Shahwani Stadium blast will be brought to their logical conclusion and held accountable under the law,” Bugti added, reaffirming the government’s solidarity with the victims’ families.
He said that critically injured individuals would be transferred to Karachi via government air services if necessary to ensure optimal medical care.
The chief minister urged political parties and citizens to cooperate with law enforcement agencies during the current threat alert.

The 25-year-old employee allegedly jumped from the eighth floor of the school building on September 1, according to a first information report (FIR) registered at Brigade police station.
According to the complainant, who was the victim’s brother, “On September 1, he (the victim) left home at around 8:15am for work. At around 9:35am, I received a phone call informing me that my brother’s health had deteriorated and he was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).”
The complainant said that when he arrived at JPMC, the school’s administration staff was also present and they informed him that his brother fell from the eighth floor of the building at around 8:45am.
He added that when he reached the emergency room, he saw that his brother was dead.
“It later transpired that my brother had left a message on social media, naming three men who ‘mentally tortured’ him,” the complainant stated.
He alleged that his brother ended his life because of mental pressure and wanted to pursue legal action against the three people named in the social media post.
The police invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 322 (punishment for manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the suspects.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the victim’s cause of death was “injury to thoraco-abdominal contents”.
She added that multiple bones found fractured in the body. “Thoraco-abdominal cavities found full of blood and there were lacerated wounds on the back,” she continued.
“Visceral samples have been collected to rule out intoxication.”</p><small>2025-09-03 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0318312501aede8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939439/lahore-atc-grants-bail-to-imran-khans-nephew-shahrez-in-may-9-riots-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC grants bail to Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez in May 9 riots case</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Wednesday granted bail to PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023, riots.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict that was reserved earlier today on Shahrez’s bail petition and ordered his release subject to paying a surety bond set at Rs100,000. Shahrez’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar, confirmed the development to Dawn.com and PTI lawyer Taimur Malik also said the same.
 






Lahore Police had picked up Shahrez, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from his mother’s Lahore residence on August 21. His brother Shershah Khan was also arrested the next day over similar allegations, and sent on physical remand and then to jail.
Shahrez was sent on 14-day judicial remand by the Lahore ATC on August 30.
During today’s hearing on Shahrez’s bail petition, Advocate Mudassar argued that the athlete was accused of inciting party workers, adding that the investigation was approached from multiple angles, with geo-fencing carried out as well, and yet no evidence was found against Imran’s nephew.
“Everything is clear in the challan, it mentions named and unnamed suspects but Shahrez is not mentioned at all, no investigator gave any statement. He was arrested after 28 months and his mother — the PTI founder’s sister —  is raising her voice for his release. This arrest was made to suppress their voice,” he said.
The lawyer argued that Shahrez was in Chitral during the riots and several people had submitted affidavits in this regard. He said the athlete was also due to go abroad to compete in a sporting event.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their concerns over the arrests, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI had challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-09-03 15:18</small></div><hr>
