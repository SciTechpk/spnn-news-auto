It would witness “rain-wind/thundershowers with a few moderate to isolated heavy falls/ very heavy falls”, the forecast said.
According to DawnNewsTV, Bahria Town, Liaquatabad, FB Area and North Karachi began receiving rain today evening. Rainfall was also reported in North Nazimabad, Scheme-33, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and the M-9 motorway.
According to the forecast by the Met Office, this spell of rain will possibly continue till Thursday “with occasional gaps” and may cause urban flooding and waterlogging in low-lying areas.
At 5pm, the Met Office issued a weather warning, directing all concerned authorities to remain on high alert for the duration of the rain spell.
 

The weather warning issued by the Met Office on Sept 7.

Earlier, the Met Office also predicted “widespread rain wind/thundershower with scattered heavy to very heavy falls” in Sindh’s Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Jamshoro till Thursday with occasional gaps.
It has also forecast “widespread rain wind/ thundershower with scattered moderate to isolated heavy falls” in Larkana, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Sukkur, Jacobabad and Ghotki districts of Sindh till Thursday with occasional gaps.
Meanwhile, DawnNewsTV reported that a fresh spell of rains had also begun in Umerkot, Tharparkar and Tando Muhammad Khan.
Last month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.
All teams are on alert amid the ongoing rain, says mayor Wahab
“All teams are on alert after the ongoing rain in the city,” Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab was quoted as having said in a press statement.
Municipal services staff are present at selected locations with machinery, Mayor Wahab added.
Rapid response teams have also been deployed to deal with any emergency situation, he added.
“Along with this, city wardens and anti-encroachment staff will also be present on the roads for the relief of citizens,” the Karachi mayor said.
The staff should be in constant contact with the officers; strict action will be taken in case of negligence, according to Wahab.
A rain emergency centre will be established in case of further or heavy rain, he added.</p><small>2025-09-07 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07195202e2cf1f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940297/pakistan-win-toss-to-bat-first-against-afghanistan-in-t20-tri-series-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan win toss, to bat first against Afghanistan in T20 tri-series final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan men’s captain Salman Ali Agha won the toss and elected to bat first in the final of the Twenty20 International tri-series in Sharjah on Sunday.

“Many of our friends already watched the film, and they were amazed we hadn’t yet,” Kato told AFP as she emerged from a Tokyo cinema on a recent weekday.
“I read the original novel,” her husband Kuni said.
Lasting almost three hours, “Kokuho” is about two “onnagata”, male players of female roles in kabuki, a rarefied form of classical Japanese theatre.
Lee Sang-il’s film, shot by Tunisian cinematographer Sofian El Fan, follows the friendship and rivalry of the son of a slain yakuza gangster and a boy born into a kabuki family.
The plot is gripping but markedly more sedate than this summer’s other hit, the second movie from the “Demon Slayer” anime and manga mega-franchise.
That dark fantasy, the first of a trilogy, is about sword-swishing Tanjiro Kamado’s final showdown to slay demons and make his sister human again in a kaleidoscopic castle.
It has set records, just like its predecessor in the series and other anime films, becoming Japan’s fastest film to gross 10 billion yen ($67 million).
It overtook “Titanic” to become the third-highest-grossing film in Japan, behind the last “Demon Slayer” and Studio Ghibli’s more highbrow — but still animated — “Spirited Away”.
Heartthrobs
Anime is king in Japan. Of its top 10 films, only three are live action, and just one of those — “Bayside Shakedown 2” — is Japanese-made.
The others are “Titanic” and the first “Harry Potter”.
The same is increasingly true elsewhere — Chinese animated fantasy “Ne Zha II” is the highest-grossing film of 2025.
On streaming platforms, Netflix’s most-watched movie ever is the animated “KPop Demon Hunters”, and the firm says its viewers watched anime over a billion times in 2024.
But “Kokuho” is a hit in Japanese cinemas at least, the fastest domestic-made live action film to pass 10 billion yen since “Bayside” in 2003.
It helps that both the main actors — Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama — are heartthrobs in Japan.
“Ryo Yoshizawa has this beautiful face,” gushed Toyoko Umemura, 65, who came with her daughter to watch the film.
“His acting was also great,” she told AFP.
Godzilla roars
“Kokuho” has even revived flagging interest in kabuki, according to Shochiku, the entertainment company that manages the famous Kabuki-za theatre in Tokyo’s Ginza district.
The movie benefited from its distributor being Toho, the Japanese giant behind “Godzilla”, and from the deep pockets of Sony.
Toho’s internal projections were for a few billion yen in revenues, business daily Nikkei reported, until “Kokuho” premiered at Cannes in May.
Then it took off, and Toho used some of the same techniques from its anime hits – not least “Demon Slayer” – to generate buzz on and offline.
The film’s run in theatres has also been extended, while word of mouth spread. Many people went to see it twice.
According to Parrot Analytics, demand — a measure based mainly on actual consumption plus search and social media activity — was 25 times higher than the average film in Japan.
Former Warner Bros executive Douglas Montgomery, CEO of Global Connects Media and a Temple University professor, said anime provides a “more consistent return” for studios, not least from merchandising.
“The film functions as a marketing lead to the (intellectual) property, where the real money is made later. This makes it tougher for live-action films as the revenue streams are fewer and shorter,” Montgomery told AFP.
“The lesson (from ‘Kokuho’) for the Japanese film industry is that it can pay to take chances on something different,” he said, with the warning that reproducing such a “rare gem” would be tough.</p><small>2025-09-07 15:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07172804068b3aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940286/pti-terminates-basic-party-membership-of-11-gb-lawmakers-including-cm-gulbar-khan' target='_blank'><strong>PTI terminates basic party membership of 11 GB lawmakers, including CM Gulbar Khan</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has terminated the basic party membership of 11 legislators of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly, including Chief Minister Gulbar Khan, saying that they made a forward bloc and voted against the party decision, it emerged on Sunday.
Most of these legislators are also members of Gulbar Khan’s cabinet, who was elected as the CM while leading a forward bloc in the PTI.
Apart from the CM, the almost identical termination notices — dated September 5 and available with Dawn.com — were issued to Abdul Hameed, Haji Shah Baig, Mushtaq Ahmad, Syed Amjad Ali Zaidi, Shamsul Haq Lone, Dilshad Bano, Raja Nasir Ali Khan Maqpoon, Surayya Zaman, Raja Azam Khan Amacha and Raja Fazal Rahim.
The notices stated that the decision to terminate memberships was effective immediately and in line with the PTI’s policy and procedures.
“The reason for your termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, especially making a forward block and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy. Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” the notices read.
The lawmakers were also asked not to use the party’s “name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action”.
Moreover, the PTI also issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon.
The show cause notice, also dated September 5 and available with Dawn.com, said it had come to the PTI’s notice that Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Gulbar Khan — a disgruntled member of the PTI — had replaced party’s Khalid Khurshid as the GB chief minister in July 2023, after the latter was disqualified by the GB Chief Court for obtaining a licence from the GB Bar Council allegedly based on a fake education degree.
His disqualification had led several PTI lawmakers to switch sides, and ultimately, a coalition government, comprising PTI’s disgruntled members and PML-N and PPP lawmakers, was formed in the region, with Gulbar Khan as the CM.
Prior to that, a Dawn report had cited sources as saying that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in consultation with the PPP, had nominated Gulbar for the coveted role.
Following Gulbar’s election, the PTI, through its Central Media Department, had issued a statement condemning the “robbery of public mandate in Gilgit-Baltistan in broad daylight”.
Later, the PTI had issued show cause notices to 11 of its members for voting in favour of Gulbar Khan. Those served notices also included Gulbar Khan, Amjad Zaidi, Shams Lone, Abdul Hameed, Dilshad Bano, Haji Shah Baig, Surayya Zaman and Raja Fazal Rahim — all of whom were sent termination notices on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-07 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07184116b741e10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940293/social-media-influencers-kidnap-bid-case-islamabad-court-extends-remand-of-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>Social media influencer’s kidnap bid case: Islamabad court extends remand of suspect</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Sunday extended the remand of a suspect, who allegedly threatened and attempted to abduct social media influencer Samiya Hijab.
The suspect was arrested on Monday and a case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code. He was later remanded in police custody by a judicial magistrate.
According to a copy of the court order issued today, available with Dawn.com, police requested that the suspect be further remanded for eight days, but the court ordered three days.
“Learned counsel for the accused has opposed the request of the IO (investigating officer) and submitted an application that on a previous date, two days [of] physical remand was granted, thus the accused was supposed to be produced on [September 4], however, has been produced today,” the order read.
The court ordered that the suspect be produced before it on September 10.
The hearing
The suspect was produced in court before Duty Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Azhar Nadeem today after completing five days of physical remand. Police stated that the suspect had a two-day remand before his defence counsel, Chaudhry Zubair Gujjar, noted that the suspect had been produced after five days.
“We can see the first remand order,” Gujjar argued, to which police responded by saying that the two-day remand was a clerical error that was quickly resolved.
 
 

Meanwhile, the suspect’s transaction history with the social media influencer, as well as a video statement of her addressing her parents, were presented before the court.
“The suspect and the plaintiff are engaged,” Gujjar stated, showing photographs of their engagement.
However, the prosecution said that Rs45,000 had been recovered from the suspect and that his alleged accomplices needed to be arrested.
“[The suspect] got bail in one case but was deliberately arrested in another case,” Gujjar argued. “The suspect was in the Jinnah Super area at the time of the incident.
 
 

“When [the suspect] demanded money back from Samiya Hijab, false receipts were given,” he added.
The influencer alleged in a first information report (FIR) that the suspect had stalked her for several days. She added that last Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house.
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.</p><small>2025-09-07 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071812509f225a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940262/japan-pm-ishiba-resigns-after-bruising-election-losses' target='_blank'><strong>Japan PM Ishiba resigns after bruising election losses</strong></a><br><p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba resigned on Sunday, ushering in a potentially lengthy period of policy uncertainty at a shaky moment for the world’s fourth-largest economy.
Having just ironed out final details of a trade deal with the United States to lower President Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs, Ishiba, 68, told a press conference he must take responsibility for a series of bruising election losses.
Since coming to power less than a year ago, the unlikely premier has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.
He instructed his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) — which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war period — to hold an emergency leadership race, adding he would continue his duties until his successor was elected.
“With Japan having signed the trade agreement and the president having signed the executive order, we have passed a key hurdle,” Ishiba said, his voice seeming to catch with emotion. “I would like to pass the baton to the next generation.”
Ishiba has faced calls to resign since the latest of those losses in an election for the upper house in July. The LDP had been scheduled to hold a vote on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election on Monday.
Koizumi, Takaichi among possible successors
Concern over political uncertainty prompted a sell-off in Japan’s yen currency and its government bonds last week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hitting a record high on Wednesday.
Investors are focusing on the chance of Ishiba being replaced by an advocate of looser fiscal and monetary policy, such as LDP veteran Sanae Takaichi, who has criticised the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hikes.
Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in last year’s LDP leadership run-off. Shinjiro Koizumi, the telegenic political scion who has gained prominence as Ishiba’s farm minister tasked with trying to cap soaring prices, is another possible successor.
“Given the political pressure mounting on Ishiba after the LDP’s repeated election losses, his resignation was inevitable,” said Kazutaka Maeda, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
“As for potential successors, Koizumi and Takaichi are seen as the most likely candidates. While Koizumi is not expected to bring major changes, Takaichi’s stance on expansionary fiscal policy and her cautious approach to interest rate hikes could draw scrutiny from financial markets,” Maeda said.
Since the ruling coalition has lost its parliamentary majority, the next LDP president is not guaranteed to become prime minister, although that is likely as the party remains by far the largest in the lower house.
Whoever becomes the next leader may choose to call a snap election to seek a mandate, analysts said. While Japan’s opposition remains fractured, the far-right, anti-immigration Sanseito party made big gains in July’s upper house election, bringing once-fringe ideas into the political mainstream.
Nearly 55pc of respondents to a poll by Kyodo news agency published on Sunday said there was no need to hold an early election.
Michael Brown, senior research strategist at financial markets brokerage Pepperstone, said there was likely to be further selling pressure on the yen and long-dated bonds on Monday.
“That selling pressure is likely to come first from the market now needing to price a greater degree of political risk, not only in terms of the LDP leadership contest, but also the potential for a general election to be held if the new leader seeks a mandate of their own,” Brown said.
‘No time to lose’
Ishiba, a party outsider who became leader on his fifth attempt last September, wrapped up his brief tenure by completing the trade deal with the United States, Japan’s biggest trading partner, pledging $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs.
US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, especially those targeted at Japan’s critical automotive sector, had forced Japan to downgrade its already weak growth outlook for the year.
Ishiba said he hoped his successor could ensure the deal is executed and Japan continues generating wage gains to assuage voter concerns over living costs.
He also expressed concern about the security environment his successor will inherit, pointing to an unprecedented gathering of Chinese, Russian and North Korean leaders in Beijing for a massive military parade last week.
Yoshinobu Tsutsui, chairman of Japan’s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, said there was “no time to lose” with mounting domestic and international challenges.
“We hope the new leader will foster unity within the party, establish stable political conditions, and move swiftly to implement necessary policies,” Tsutsui said.
Some voters, too, are hoping for a steady hand in uncertain times.
“With all the turmoil around tariffs right now, I hope the next prime minister will be someone who can properly manage the tariff issues and handle diplomacy more effectively,” Maki Utsuno, a 48-year-old chemistry researcher, told Reuters outside a busy train station in downtown Tokyo on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-07 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07161336291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940279/swabi-tiktoker-held-for-making-videos-while-dressed-as-a-woman-police' target='_blank'><strong>Swabi TikToker held for making videos while dressed as a woman: police</strong></a><br><p>Swabi police have arrested a TikToker who was allegedly making videos while dressing as a girl and uploading them to his account to “mislead people, especially the youth”, senior police officials said on Sunday.
Swabi Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ijaz Abazai and Saidul Amin, Station House Officer (SHO) at Swabi city police station, told Dawn.com that the TikToker was filming videos while dressing as a woman and “striking controversial poses”.
“There was severe resentment and anxiety among society,” SHO Amin said. “Aamir Khan, the in-charge of Bamkhel outpost, traced the TikToker, and police have taken immediate action and arrested the suspect, a resident of Bamkhel.”
A first information report (FIR) has been filed against the TikToker at the Swabi city police station — available with Dawn.com — stating that the police came to know that he was making videos performing obscene acts on social media, “which had a very bad impact on society”.
The FIR was registered under Section 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which “makes it an offence to commit any obscene act or sing, recite, or utter obscene songs, ballads, or words in or near a public place to the annoyance of others, punishable with imprisonment up to three months, a fine, or both.”
After being arrested, the suspect confessed to the crime and promised to refrain from such immoral activities in the future.
The TikToker said in a video recorded by police: “I belong to Jafarkhail, a Mohallah of Bamkhel village. I was making videos and uploading to my TikTok account. I will not make such videos in the future.”
SHO Amin said that the content creator had been presented in a local court and “would face the law of the land”.
DSP Abazai said that it was very sad that he was making videos in Swabi’s traditional chail, a chador proudly worn by women in the district. Aziz Manerwal, a renowned writer, told Dawn.com about the significance of the chail.
“No one can deny the importance of the Swabi chail. It has cultural and traditional significance,” he said.
“The women here wear it with great pride. It is said that a battle took place here in history, and when women placed their white shawls on the dead bodies of their husbands, they would create red dots, and since then, women here have been wearing white shawls with red dots.”</p><small>2025-09-07 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0718015859e3768.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940291/how-will-japan-pick-its-next-leader' target='_blank'><strong>How will Japan pick its next leader?</strong></a><br><p>With Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announcing his resignation, attention turns to who will next steer the world’s fourth-largest economy.
The process to pick Japan’s next leader is more complicated than before, as Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period, and its junior coalition partner lost their majorities in both houses of parliament during his tenure.
Party leadership race
First, the LDP must pick a new president to replace Ishiba. The date has not been set yet.
In the last party leadership race in September 2024, candidates needed to secure 20 nominations from the party’s lawmakers to be eligible to run.
Candidates will embark on a period of debates and campaigns across Japan, culminating in a vote by lawmakers and rank-and-file party members. In the last race, there were nine contenders, and Ishiba won in a run-off.
LDP vote
Based on the last leadership race, each lawmaker has a vote with an equal number distributed among the rank-and-file members in the first round of voting.
A candidate securing a simple majority in that poll becomes party leader. If no one secures a majority, a run-off vote follows between the two candidates with the most votes.

In the second round, each lawmaker again gets one vote, but the share of the rank-and-file drops to 47 votes, one for each of Japan’s prefectures.
In the unlikely event of a tie, the winner will be decided by lot. That has never happened in a leadership contest, but was used in 2010 to decide who would chair the LDP’s upper house caucus.
Parliament votes
Since the party does not have a majority in either house, it is not guaranteed that the LDP president will become prime minister.
In 1994, the LDP formed a three-way alliance with its arch rival, the Japan Socialist Party and a smaller startup party to regain power, having socialist leader Tomiichi Murayama elected as prime minister.
Based on precedent, the more powerful lower house will first vote on its choice for prime minister. Lawmakers can nominate any candidates from the chamber and historically, the leaders of opposition parties have been put forward for the vote.
Any candidate who secures a simple majority in the first round wins approval. If no one secures a majority, a run-off poll follows between the two candidates with the most votes.

Voting then passes to the upper house, where a similar process begins, although only members of the lower house are eligible to be prime minister.
If there is a disagreement between the houses, the choice of the lower house prevails.
This happened in 2008 when the lower house chose the LDP candidate and the upper house picked an opposition candidate.
The new prime minister may also call a snap general election to seek a national mandate.</p><small>2025-09-07 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071511276dc4f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940274/in-a-first-pakistan-to-host-t20i-tri-series-afghanistan-and-sri-lanka-to-visit-in-november' target='_blank'><strong>In a first, Pakistan to host T20I tri-series; Afghanistan and Sri Lanka to visit in November</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to host a T20 International (T20I) tri-series for the first time from November 17 to 29, according to a press release issued by the country’s cricket board on Sunday.
Apart from Pakistan, the “three-nation tournament” would feature Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, the press release said.
 






It added that the series was organised to “provide all teams with valuable preparation” ahead of next year’s International Cricket Council Men’s T20 World Cup, which will take place in India and Sri Lanka.
Detailing its schedule, it further stated that the hosts would take on Afghanistan on November 17, marking the beginning of the series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. It also mentioned that “will be Afghanistan’s first-ever T20I in Pakistan”.
“On November 19, Sri Lanka will face Afghanistan at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, while the remaining five T20Is of the tri-series, including the final on November 29, will be played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore,” the press release said.

In his statement included in the press release, Pakistan Cricket Board Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmed Syed said: “We look forward to hosting Sri Lanka and Afghanistan for Pakistan’s maiden T20I tri-series. This event will not only offer excellent preparation for next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup but also present fans with exciting cricket across venues.
“Earlier this year, [the] PCB successfully delivered the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. These achievements underline our capacity and readiness to host back-to-back international events at the highest level.”
International cricket had dried up in Pakistan following a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore. Consequently, the Green Shirts were forced to play international matches at neutral venues such as the United Arab Emirates.
In 2017, international cricket began gradually returning to Pakistan with the Green Shirts playing against the ICC World XI in a series of three T20 internationals.
Earlier this year, the country hosted the ICC Champions Trophy in February and March, though India played their matches in Dubai. It was the first time that the Pakistan hosted an ICC event after 1996.
A day ago, the PCB also announced that South Africa’s team would be visiting Pakistan in October and November for a series of Test, One-Day International and T20I matches.</p><small>2025-09-07 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07164558ee84bd8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940282/15-school-principals-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-suspended-over-poor-matric-results' target='_blank'><strong>15 school principals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa suspended over poor matric results</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Workers Welfare Board has suspended 15 principals across the province following poor performance in the matriculation examinations, it emerged on Sunday.
According to a September 4 notification seen by Dawn.com, the suspensions were carried out “on account of producing poor results in SSC annual examinations 2024-2025”.
The suspended principals include those at schools in Akora Khattak, Aman Garh, Ghoriwala and Haripur-II. Similarly, the principals of schools in Hattar, Karak, Kohat-I, and Kohat-II have also been removed.
The action further extends to the principals in Peshawar-II, Mardan, Shehbaz Azmat Khel, Swabi and Swat, along with the principals of an institution in Takht Bhai and a higher secondary school.
“The vice principals of the concerned schools shall look after the duties of principal as [a] stopgap arrangement in their own pay scale till further orders,” the notification read.
“However, where the vice principals are not available, the seniormost employee (BPS-16/17)/acting vice principal shall look after the duties of principal as [a] stopgap arrangement in their own pay scale till further orders.”
KP Labour Minister Fazal Shakoor Khan told Dawn.com that the suspension was solely based on the performance of the teachers.
‘’We have zero per cent results in the mentioned schools,’’ he said. “The department has enough teachers, but we lack specialists in subjects other than Islamiyat and Pashto.”

This isn’t diplomatic wishful thinking; it’s exactly what happened in the 1950s when these nations came together to forge the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
While headlines today focus on border skirmishes and political discord between India and Pakistan, this remarkable partnership of countries quietly built something extraordinary: a regional public good that has fed 300 million people, powered two economies, and survived the Cold War and border skirmishes for over 60 years.
THE STAKES — THEN AND NOW
When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, potential water wars in the Subcontinent posed a global threat. Rather than leaving it to chance, the international community acted decisively.
 
 

Each country brought different strengths — financial resources, technical expertise, diplomatic capital and local knowledge — to build infrastructure and institutions that have lasted over six decades.
Today, both India and Pakistan stand at critical economic junctures. India races to realise its potential as a global economic powerhouse. Pakistan struggles with economic stability amid mounting climate threats, economic instability and regional tensions that have begun eroding half a century of development gains.

Forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers, the treaty is a stunning example of international cooperation that has survived wars and nuclear stand-offs. Now, it faces a new enemy in political collapse and climate change…

For India, continued cooperation isn’t diplomatic nicety. It is an economic necessity. The country’s ambitious manufacturing and technology sectors depend on stable agricultural supply chains and regional trade routes. Water conflicts would disrupt these foundations just as India seeks larger shares of global markets.
Pakistan faces starker realities. Climate change has intensified flooding and drought cycles, making predictable water flows guaranteed by the treaty literally lifesaving. The country’s economic recovery plans depend heavily on agricultural exports and energy generation, both impossible without the water security the IWT provides.
Regional trade between these nuclear neighbours remains far below potential, partly due to political tensions. This precarious situation is exactly what the treaty’s architects sought to prevent, building a system so robust it has defied the odds for over six decades.
WHY THE TREATY WORKS
The IWT represents something unique in international relations: a genuine multilateral success story, where developed and developing nations pooled resources to create lasting regional prosperity. What economists call a “regional public good” — a resource that benefits everyone in a region regardless of contribution — was deliberately constructed through unprecedented international cooperation.
 
 

The scale of commitment was extraordinary. The founding partners, working through the World Bank (WB), invested what amounts to $8 billion in today’s money. This wasn’t charity. It was strategic investment in regional stability and economic development that has paid dividends for decades.
The treaty succeeded because it aligned individual national interests with collective regional benefits. Every participating country gained something valuable: India and Pakistan secured predictable water access, contributing nations advanced regional stability objectives, and the WB established a template for successful development cooperation.
The numbers demonstrate the treaty’s economic impact. The Indus basin supports the world’s largest contiguous irrigation system, feeding millions directly. The Green Revolution that transformed South Asia from food-deficit to food-surplus was built on the foundation of reliable water-sharing provided by the treaty.  Rice paddies in Punjab, wheat fields in Sindh, and cotton farms across the basin all depend on this cooperative framework.
This ingenious treaty not only serves as an economic engine, but also functions as a bulwark against a shared and devastating failure.
THE COST OF FAILURE
Without this framework, agricultural collapse would trigger food insecurity across South Asia and beyond. The treaty prevents what economists call “tragedy of the commons” — destructive competition over shared resources that leaves everyone worse off.
Beyond immediate economic benefits, the Indus Basin represents something more profound: a piece of humanity’s shared heritage that transcends national boundaries. The Indus Valley was home to humanity’s earliest civilisations, where agriculture, cities and trade first flourished 5,000 years ago. The river system that sustained those ancient societies continues to support one of the world’s most densely populated regions today.
The scientific community increasingly recognise major river systems, such as the Indus, as global commons — ecosystems whose health affects the entire planet — joining other critical systems such as the Amazon Rainforest, the Congo Basin, the Great Barrier Reef and Antarctica, which are viewed as a common heritage of humankind. The Indus basin’s glacial systems help regulate regional climate patterns. Its wetlands provide crucial biodiversity habitat. Its agricultural output contributes to global food security.
The treaty’s importance will only grow as climate change intensifies. The Himalayas, source of the Indus system, are warming faster than the global average. Glacial melt patterns are shifting. Monsoon cycles are becoming less predictable. Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity.
 
 

These changes don’t respect national borders. India and Pakistan must adapt together or fail separately. The treaty’s existing framework for data sharing, joint technical committees and dispute resolution provides institutional foundation needed for emergent issues. Article VII of the treaty provides the legal foundation for “future cooperation” and “optimum development” of the rivers, yet it has remained largely unutilised.
Forward-looking economists argue that disaster-resilient infrastructure and cooperative resource management will be key competitive advantages in the coming decades. Countries that maintain stable agricultural production, reliable water supplies and peaceful regional relationships will attract investment and trade partnerships.
The model that averted failure — and managed complex pressures — now serves as a blueprint for the world.
THE GLOBAL BLUEPRINT
The WB’s role demonstrates how international institutions can facilitate regional public goods, while maintaining neutrality. Despite governance structures that give major donors significant voting power, the WB keeps treaty functions strictly neutral and technical. This preserves credibility as an honest broker, while ensuring stakeholders maintain oversight.
 
 

The Bank served as both architect and guarantor of the IWT, channelling international contributions while maintaining operational independence necessary for neutral facilitation. This governance model — combining board oversight with institutional neutrality — has proven remarkably durable, surviving multiple wars, political crises and leadership changes in all participating countries.
This model has global implications. From the Mekong River in Southeast Asia to the Nile in Africa, transboundary water systems worldwide face similar pressures. The IWT offers a template for how international coalitions can facilitate regional public goods that benefit entire regions while respecting national sovereignty.
THE PATH FORWARD
The IWT stands as proof that international partnerships can create enduring regional public goods when they commit sufficient resources and design proper institutions. The choice facing the original coalition partners isn’t about water allocation — it’s about preserving a mechanism that has served global stability for over six decades.
The smart economic choice, the environmentally responsible choice and the globally minded choice all point toward protecting this remarkable achievement. In a world seeking models for successful multilateral cooperation, this eight-nation vision offers a blueprint for the kind of collective action that will define prosperity and stability in the 21st century.
However, the original leadership now faces a critical choice. Their investments in regional stability, their stake in South Asian prosperity, and their share in global trade and resilience all depend on preserving this cooperative framework. As nuclear tensions rise and climate pressures mount, these eight partners must actively intervene to protect not just a treaty, but their own strategic interests in regional peace, economic stability, and the multilateral cooperation model they pioneered.
The IWT isn’t just South Asia’s treasure — it’s proof of what the international community can achieve when it commits to building something bigger than itself.

Pakistan and Kazakhstan maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with bilateral trade worth $239 million, according to its envoy Yerzhan Kistafin.
Nurtleu will undertake an official visit to Pakistan from September 8 to 9, the FO said in a statement, adding that the trip will serve as a precursor to Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s visit scheduled in November 2025.
During his stay, the visiting dignitary will “hold a tête-à-tête” with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, followed by delegation-level talks.
 






Nurtleu is also expected to call on President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif, according to the FO.
“The discussions will provide an opportunity to review preparations for the upcoming presidential visit and to deliberate comprehensively on the entire spectrum of Pak-Kazakh bilateral cooperation, with particular focus on trade and investment, agriculture, education, cultural and tourism exchanges, regional connectivity and logistics, and collaboration at multilateral fora.”
Nurtleu will be accompanied by a high-level 13-member delegation, including the Transport Minister Nurlan Sauranbayev. The Joint Working Groups meetings on agriculture and IT will also be held on the sidelines of the visit.
The Kazakh deputy PM’s visit will “further cement the longstanding Pakistan-Kazakhstan ties and contribute to deepening bilateral engagements in diverse fields, for the benefit of the people of the two countries”, the FO statement added.
Kazakhstan is Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries, but exports dropped sharply by 47.12pc in the fiscal year 2025. It is also among the biggest importers of Pakistani mangoes.
 
 

In July, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed an agreement for a joint study on a major railway project intended to connect Central Asia with Pakis­tani seaports via Afghanistan.
Later that month, the Central Asian nation’s senior military officials also attended the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference held in Islamabad.
In April, Pakistan and Kazakhstan agreed to sign a transit trade accord for the movement of goods through three Pakistani ports — Karachi, Bin Qasim and Gwadar — and to engage other regional landlocked nations for opening multiple trade corridors.
Both sides also agreed to promote tourism by sharing lists of certified tour operators and launching joint promotional activities. In August last year, Ambassador Kistafin highlighted the opportunity of a direct flight from Kazakhstan to Skardu.</p><small>2025-09-07 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071343041f2db52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940268/microsoft-cloud-platform-hit-by-cable-cuts-in-red-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Microsoft cloud platform hit by cable cuts in Red Sea</strong></a><br><p>Global tech giant Microsoft on Sunday said network traffic for its Azure cloud computing platform was experiencing increased delays in parts of the Middle East due to “undersea fibre cuts” in the Red Sea.
Microsoft did not provide an explanation for what caused the cuts to the submarine lines, but noted its network had been affected since Saturday.
“Network traffic that does not traverse through the Middle East is not impacted,” the company said in a statement.
The internet access monitoring organisation NetBlocks noted that a series of submarine cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in several countries, including in India and Pakistan.
Global internet and telecom cables have followed shipping routes through the Red Sea, but there has been growing anxiety about the state of the lines after Yemen’s Houthi rebels began attacking passing merchant vessels in late 2023, in actions the group said were in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israeli war on Gaza.
The laying and operation of underwater cables have long been the preserve of a consortium of large telecoms operators, but internet giants have largely taken over in recent years as they strive to keep up with ballooning flows of data.
 
 

About 1.4 million kilometres (nearly 900,000 miles) of fibre optic cables are laid on the ocean floor, enabling the provision of essential services such as trade, financial transactions, public services, digital health and education around the world.
Damage to submarine cables is not uncommon.
According to the International Cable Protection Committee, there are an average of 150 to 200 outages per year worldwide, or around three incidents a week.
Fishing and anchoring are believed to be responsible for the vast majority of recorded damage to the lines.
Natural hazards to the cables also include ageing, abrasions and equipment failure.</p><small>2025-09-07 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0714493644e4030.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940271/italian-teen-who-died-of-leukaemia-in-2006-becomes-first-catholic-saint-of-millennial-generation' target='_blank'><strong>Italian teen who died of leukaemia in 2006 becomes first Catholic saint of millennial generation</strong></a><br><p>A teenager who died of leukaemia in 2006 became the first Catholic saint of the millennial generation on Sunday, in a Vatican ceremony led by Pope Leo and attended by thousands of young worshippers from dozens of countries.
Carlo Acutis, a British-born Italian boy who died aged 15, learned computer code to build websites to spread his faith. His story has drawn wide attention from Catholic youth, and he is now at the same level as Mother Teresa and Francis of Assisi.
Leo, the first US pontiff, canonised Acutis on Sunday along with Pier Giorgio Frassati, a young Italian man who was known for helping those in need and died of polio in the 1920s.
In impromptu remarks to crowds in St. Peter’s Square at the opening of the event, Leo said Acutis and Frassati were examples of holiness and of helping those in need.
“All of you, all of us together, are called to be saints,” the pontiff told the young crowd, which had spilt out of the square down the main boulevard into the Vatican from Rome.
Acutis’ canonisation had been hotly anticipated by many Catholic youths for months. It was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Pope Francis.
Sunday’s event is the first time that Leo, elected pope by the world’s cardinals in May, has presided over such a ceremony.
Antonio D’Averio, 24, who was at the ceremony, called the canonisation “a hand extended by the Church toward us young people.” D’Averio said he was a computer programmer and identified especially with Acutis’ story.
“He too was passionate about computer science,” said the young man. “For a saint, it’s certainly something new. It’s also something that, in my opinion, was needed.”
‘We want to follow their steps,’ said Clara Marugan Martin, aged 20, who came from Spain for the event.
“We are very pleased to be here because Carlo and Pier Giorgio are two examples of young people full of God, full of grace, and we want to follow their steps,” she said.
Being made a saint means the Church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven.
Other saints who died young include Therese of Lisieux, who died at 24 in 1897 and was known for promoting a “Little Way” of charity; and Aloysius Gonzaga, who died at 23 in 1591 after caring for victims of an epidemic in Rome.
As Acutis progressed along the Church’s official path to sainthood, his body was moved to a church in the hill town of Assisi in central Italy, where St. Francis was from, in line with Acutis’ last wishes.
The new saint’s final resting place, where Acutis is entombed with a wax mould of his likeness placed over his body, wearing his track top, jeans and trainers, has become a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day.</p><small>2025-09-07 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0712511517a4519.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940264/air-force-day-air-chief-sidhu-says-paf-committed-to-advancing-capabilities-in-electronic-warfare-cyber-tech' target='_blank'><strong>Air Force Day: Air chief Sidhu says PAF committed to advancing capabilities in electronic warfare, cyber tech</strong></a><br><p>Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Sunday said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was committed to advancing its capabilities in electronic warfare and cyber technologies.
He made the remarks while addressing the central Martyrs’ Day ceremony held at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, as the nation observes the Pakistan Air Force Day to honour PAF martyrs.
“He (ACM Sidhu) affirmed that Pakistan Air Force would remain committed to advancing its capabilities in space, electronic warfare, cyber technologies, niche domains and indigenous defence production to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation,” said a press release by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The PAF solemnly observed Martyrs’ Day across all its bases nationwide, ISPR noted.
The day commenced with special prayers and recitation of the Holy Quran, “dedicated to the martyrs of the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as to all those who have rendered the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty since the creation of Pakistan”.
 






Addressing the ceremony as the chief guest, ACM Sidhu underscored the proud legacy of sacrifice, courage and professionalism that defines the PAF.
He emphasised that Martyrs’ Day “symbolises the extraordinary bravery, impeccable professionalism and unparalleled spirit of sacrifice demonstrated” by the armed forces.
The air chief stressed that well-cognisant of the fast-changing security dynamics, the PAF stood committed to its mission with singularity of purpose.
“The latest link in [the] chain of victories secured by PAF in Marka-i-Haq / Bunyanum Marsoos has once more proved our will and capability to guard the aerial frontiers of our motherland,” he was quoted as saying.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The martyrs of Marka-i-Haq — the term used for the period of conflict with India — along with the country’s military and civilian leadership, were conferred with a total of 488 national awards on August 14. These included eight Sitara-i-Jurat, seven Sitara-i-Basalat, 23 Tamgha-i-Basalat and 79 Imtiazi Sanad for PAF personnel.
 
 

In his address today, the PAF chief reiterated his firm resolve to make “every possible effort for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan in the evolving global environment”, the ISPR statement said.
Paying “heartfelt tribute” to the fallen heroes of PAF, the air chief said, “We owe our heroes an eternal debt of gratitude for their supreme sacrifices, which serve as an enduring example for future generations.“
He further expressed unwavering solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir in their “legitimate and indigenous struggle for the right to self-determination”, the press release added.
ACM Sidhu also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered fateha for the departed souls to pay homage to the martyrs.
To mark the Defence and Air Force Day, the PAF released a new song titled “Shaheen”.
 


President, PM hail PAF’s ‘decisive role’ during India conflict
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the PAF’s “decisive“ role during the military conflict with India in May, when the air force shot down six Indian jets.
“In recent history, the Pakistan Air Force, together with the armed forces, played a decisive role in Marka-i-Haq [and Bunyanum Marsoos] and the way it defeated the enemy on all fronts amazed the whole world,“ PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
“Undoubtedly, this high-level performance of the Pakistan Air Force was a manifestation of fearless leadership, the skill of the fighter sons, superior strategy, and effective implementation of multi-faceted combat capabilities,“ he added.
 






“The invincible multi-faceted combat capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force are a testament to its innovation in recent years.
“I am particularly proud that the Pakistan Air Force, while keeping its glorious historical tradition alive, defeated an enemy many times larger than itself,“ the premier emphasised.
“Our heroes of the Pakistan Air Force proved with their bravery that no matter how strong and well-armed the enemy is, it can never defeat passion and courage,” he observed.
The prime minister paid tribute to the PAF’s “unparalleled performance”, observing that the martyrs’ “immortal sacrifices are illuminated in history”.
PM Shehbaz said: “Undoubtedly, the founders of the Pakistan Air Force laid its foundation as a high-class and leading institution in accordance with the vision of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
“Pakistan Air Force continues to perform well in all professional aspects and is no less than any other air force in the world in terms of professionalism,” the premier added.
“We are proud that the Pakistan Air Force has shown its professionalism and immense strength in [the] last decades during air combat.“
 






In his statement, President Zardari said: “Whether it was the 1965 war or the more recent Marka-i-Haq Bunyanum Marsus, our air warriors have always risen to the challenge, giving the enemy a decisive response and filling the nation with pride.”
The president highlighted that the world had “witnessed the remarkable skill and professionalism of PAF”, hailing its evolution into a “modern, capable, and highly professional institution”.
“My heart goes out in deep respect to our martyrs and ghazis whose courage and sacrifices continue to inspire the nation,” President Zardari said.
 
 

He recalled: “In 1965, our air warriors, against overwhelming odds, wrote a story of extraordinary bravery and determination. Their daring actions not only defended our skies but also lifted the morale of an entire nation.
“That spirit of sacrifice and excellence remains alive in every generation of the PAF,” he added. The president paid tribute to the martyrs’ families for bearing the “greatest sacrifice of all”, as well as the warriors for their resilience and dedication.
“I am confident that the Pakistan Air Force will continue to protect our skies and sovereignty with the same resolve and passion that has always defined it.”

Along with regional bragging rights, the T20 competition will serve as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka. The eight-team event in the United Arab Emirates begins when Afghanistan play minnows Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi.
Arch-rivals India and Pakistan clash in Dubai on September 14, with Pakistan bowling great Wasim Akram saying players and fans from both teams should “remain disciplined and not cross the line”.
The neighbours have not met on either side’s soil in a bilateral series since 2012 and only play each other in international tournaments on neutral ground as part of a compromise deal.
 
 

The two Asian cricketing giants have been clubbed together in the same group and could potentially meet three times in the tournament, which concludes on September 28.
There have been tensions in the build-up after Pakistan and India fought an intense four-day conflict in May — their worst since 1999 — when the two countries stepped back from an all-out war in the aftermath of the April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
India blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, while Islamabad strongly denied the allegations. New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan on May 7, in response to which the Pakistan Air Force downed six Indian jets. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In a sign of lingering bitterness, an Indian team of retired players withdrew from their semi-final with Pakistan in the World Championship of Legends in July-August in England.
Led by former international Yuvraj Singh, the Indians also refused to play Pakistan in the group stage of the tournament, as clamour grew among fans to boycott the games.
 
 

Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh was part of the veterans team and has strongly opposed the Asia Cup game.
“Blood and sweat cannot co-exist,” Harbhajan told The Times of India. “It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket.
“Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter.”
India strong favourites
India and Pakistan last met in cricket, again in Dubai, in February in the 50-over Champions Trophy, with India winning by six wickets and going on to lift the title.
They are also defending Asia Cup champions and led by Suryakumar Yadav are clear favourites against their old foes with a 10-3 win record against Pakistan in T20 internationals.
Pakistan will be without star players Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, both dropped from the shortest format because of poor form.
 
 

India won the previous Asia Cup, which was played in a 50-over format in 2023, when they beat hosts Sri Lanka in the final in Colombo. India are strong favourites to retain their crown.
The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka — earned automatic qualification to the tournament.
They are joined by Hong Kong, Oman and the UAE, teams that secured their spots by finishing in the top three of the ACC men’s Premier Cup.
Group A is made up of India, Pakistan, hosts UAE and Oman.
Group B comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. The group stage will be followed by a Super Four round, followed by the final in Dubai.</p><small>2025-09-07 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07094451a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940026/nine-judicial-officers-terminated-for-misconduct-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>Nine judicial officers terminated for misconduct, corruption</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court Chief Justice SM Attique Shah has dismissed from service nine judicial officers, who were restored early this year, as they were found guilty of ‘misconduct, corruption, and inefficiency’ in a fresh inquiry against them.
The dismissed judicial officers include four additional district and sessions judges Malik Amjid Rahim, Manzoor Qadir, Qaiser Rahim and Ms Riffat Aamir; four senior civil judges named Safeer Qaiser Malik, Adil Akbar Khan, Rashid Rauf Swati and Shah Hussain, and a civil judge Tasawar Hussain.
The high court had initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2011 on charges of misconduct, corruption, and inefficiency against the said officers, according to a press release issued here on Friday.
The inquiry into the charges was conducted by a PHC judge, who found the officers guilty and recommended the imposition of a major penalty.

PHC CJ imposes major penalty after inquiry

“Upon receipt of the inquiry report, the chief justice, being the competent authority, issued final show-cause notices and afforded each officer an opportunity of personal hearing,” the release stated.
“After hearing the accused officers, the chief justice found them guilty of the charges and imposed the major penalty of dismissal from service,” it concluded.
 


It merits a mention here that the said officers were reinstated in April this year after eight years of their removal from service orders, which were set aside last year by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal.
A notification was issued for their reinstatement by the high court stating that in pursuance of the judgment of the Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal of July 26, 2024, and recommendations of the administration committee of the high court given in a meeting on April 8, 2025, the competent authority (chief justice) had reinstated the said judicial officers.
However, the notification provided that their reinstatement would be without any back-dated benefits and would be subject to the outcome of de-novo inquiry proceedings against them as well as pending appeals filed by the high court before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
While terminating their services along with two other judicial officers in April 2017, the high court had announced that those judges had violated the disciplinary law.
At that time, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi was the chief justice of the high court.
The high court had declared that after those judicial officers were found guilty, the chief justice with the concurrence of the administration committee had imposed the major penalty of removal from service on them.
Last year, the service tribunal had ordered reinstatement of 11 judicial officers, including the present nine officers and a district and sessions judge, Sardar Mohammad Irshad and an additional district and sessions judge, Abdul Hakeem Hashmi.
However, as Sardar Irshad had attained the age of superannuation and Abdul Hakeem had passed away, therefore, their names were not included in the reinstatement notification.
These judicial officers had contended before the tribunal that merely over allegations about their general reputation, social contacts and conduct they could not be removed from service.
Full court meeting
A full court meeting of the judges of the Peshawar High Court was held here on Friday under the chairmanship of Chief Justice SM Attique Shah.
The chief justice apprised the judges of the initiatives undertaken to ensure expeditious and comprehensive dispensation of justice.
He emphasised the vigorous application of information and computer technology-based solutions to address challenges relating to court and case management, enhance facilitation for litigants, and safeguard people’s fundamental rights.
The judges reaffirmed their commitment to translating the chief justice’s vision into reality within the shortest possible time.
The chief justice expressed satisfaction over the performance of the district judiciary, acknowledging both the quality and quantity of their output as well as their sense of duty and commitment.
He also appreciated the constructive role of the bar as an integral partner in the administration of justice.
He also recognised the contribution of the court staff, and said that individuals found indulging in malpractice would soon be dealt with firmly.
A comprehensive agenda comprising 20 items was deliberated upon during the full court meeting.
The meeting concluded with a unanimous resolution that the new judicial year would usher in greater achievements and continued success for the institution.

This concept has become a critical junction in today’s urban planning. For most of human history, we have designed in harmony with other species. This is important to keep in mind for architects and developers exploring the spatial, cultural and ecological impacts of the industrialised, built-environment.
However, this is not the case in Karachi. As the urban flooding across the city on August 19, 2025 in the aftermath of torrential downpour demonstrated yet again, Karachi’s ‘urban planning’ has left the city and its inhabitants standing at a perilous juncture. The relentless building of high-rises, destruction of coastal lines, lack of city planning and brazen flouting of building safety laws have led to Karachi literally drowning in infrastructural problems.
So how did Karachi end up in such a mess? The reasons are multi-layered and are the consequence of decades of neglect and misplaced priorities. Over the years, Karachi has seen its master plans being routinely disregarded, zoning laws becoming ineffective, high-rises being built without consideration for safety regulations and rampant commercialisation in urban centres that simply lack the infrastructure to support such relentless ‘growth’.

The havoc wreaked by the recent rains in Karachi was a reminder that the megapolis exists today in a fragile ecosystem, due in large part to rampant urban ‘development’ and aggressive real-estate projects. How did the city arrive at this juncture and can it still be saved?

As a consequence, Karachi has many densely built localities where people have no choice but to live in poorly ventilated, poorly lit, tightly-packed buildings in the middle of urban centres that are already wrestling with issues of traffic congestion and sanitation. Beyond this, the environmental ramifications of such unregulated urban development and the systematic erasure of so many green spaces across the city has only served to increase the likelihood of urban flooding in Karachi.
 
 

Land use in Karachi is entirely determined by land value. As a result, the majority has always witnessed slow violence in the form of pollution, environmental degradation, congestion and degradation of the right to life. It is established that the temporalities of development and urban interventions have not catered to the needs of the majority.
Karachi’s vertical expansion illustrates the city’s isolated high-stakes approach to urban development, where real estate developers are scrambling to exploit the bubble formed over mixed-use land. Enabling legal frameworks and a lack of adherence to master plans have allowed the city to undergo major transformations since the early 2000s, when major road arteries were commercialised by the former mayor of Karachi Naimatullah Khan. The impact of unchecked urban development and commercial pattis [rows of shops] located below high-rise residential buildings is cause for great concern.
But before diving into the specifics of Karachi’s urban development issues, it is imperative to understand how the changes in the city’s social demography and the rise of the nuclear family model catalysed the haphazard ‘development’ path Karachi has been on for decades.
UNDERSTANDING THE URBAN FAMILY MODEL
Contrary to what some may think, high- and mid-rise development in Karachi is not a new phenomenon. Since the time of the British, areas such as Saddar featured commercial strips, with owners residing in the upper floors, culminating in mixed-use urban form that has persisted post-Partition.
These high-rise buildings often housed tight-knit communities, bound by ethnicity, religion or class, creating cross-functional networks of care and trust. This social architecture softened the blows of Karachi’s sprawling heterogeneity.
 
 

As Partition gradually reshaped the city’s demography, the development of high-rise residences laid a particular emphasis on housing particular ethnic groups, such as Sindhis, Parsis, Memons etc. However, this devolved into a utilitarian model based solely on profit, as the real estate economy grew in the city at an alarming pace.
Over the past few decades, residential buildings have evolved into multi-ethnic hubs retaining the built form: commercial pattis tucked between stacked apartments based more on functionality than rigid zoning. This organic ‘development’ shaped Karachi’s economy, creating a kind of vertical densification.
According to Amber Ali Bhai, head of the non-profit Shehri - Citizens for a Better Environment, “It’s basically a mental ghetto of the people, and that’s how they feel comfortable… they feel it’s about safety in numbers.”
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) rise in the late 1970s radically altered Karachi’s social fabric, where safety became a heightened concern. The concept of a high-rise — due to more people together, one entrance and a watchman to guard it — grew popular among the middle class. Political violence forced the people of Karachi to retreat behind closed doors and gates.
The shift towards high-rise residential buildings catalysed the transition of joint-family systems into nuclear families, with women gaining more autonomy within the home. Ethnically skewed master plans, once a tool of segregation, lost their importance in the face of undocumented wealth and increased private mobility. Accessibility became a given, as people moved beyond their designated enclaves, perpetuating fractured urban identity.
So, if the city’s master plans have become less and less important over the years, what rubric is being followed when copious amounts of real-estate projects are being green-lit across the city?
 

As demonstrated by these satellite images, Karachi has the lowest green cover among the world’s major cities, making luxury ‘eco-developments’ pure performance, not protection

THE CRUMBLING IMPORTANCE OF MASTER PLANS AND CONVENTIONAL PLANNING
Over the years, Karachi’s master plans have been reduced to suggestions rather than law. The city’s urban and infrastructural development has grown speculative and disconnected from the ecological realities of the region. As the world moves towards efficient city planning, Karachi’s government remains rooted in conventional methods.
These plans are created by the same regulatory bodies tasked with enforcement, such as the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), creating a conflict of interest. The city finds itself grappling with a top-down approach, where high-rises appear in low-density zones and civic infrastructure is either reactive or entirely missing. Karachi’s land-use policy continues to fragment its urban fabric, inviting irreversible damage through poorly conceived flyovers, commercial encroachments and the destruction of green buffers.
Political misalignment has cost Karachi far more than the Sindh Government is willing to admit. Naimatullah Khan’s controversial commercialisation of major road networks in the early 2000s set a precedent for bypassing city-level planning in favour of short term revenue. This divorce between the policymakers and key stakeholders continued with disjointed policies, such as the Sindh High Density Act 2010 that was introduced by the prime minister at the time without due consultation with urban planners.
This results in a governance model where decisions about a city’s future are made without architects, urban planners and the public. Barring key stakeholders from decision-making ensures that development serves capital, not communities. Infrastructure falters, as essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity buckle. This is all the more evident in the poorly planned commercial centres that litter the city.
COMMERCIAL-ORIENTED GROWTH CENTRES
Markets, over the course of history, have been at the gravitational core of cities, surrounded by homes, institutions and power. Karachi mirrors this historical blueprint with a contemporary evolution — its markets are malls. Dolmen City, Lucky One and Dolmen Mall Tariq Road are examples of how new markets serve as hyper-condensed urban cores.
Using satellite imagery over the past 15 years, negative (open) spaces were mapped to showcase urban development around these nodes. Their placement is strategic. Through the absorption of consumer attention, these malls anchor surrounding high-rise development and create retail-service ecosystems that uphold the precedent set by older commercial pattis.
 
 

Yet, in Karachi’s context, this urban density comes at a grave cost. Unlike historic centres that grew in response to public need, the emergence of mall-centric cities reflects French sociologist Henri Lefebvre’s concept of “abstract space”, which is conceived by and for capital, often disconnected from infrastructural and ecological realities.
Water lines remain unchanged, sewerage systems overloaded, while vertical real-estate forests grow around malls, prioritising accessibility for consumption over sustainability. This evolution reshapes the city’s skyline, replacing communal space with transactional zones.
So who is to blame for this unregulated transformation of Karachi’s cityscape and why are the laws designed to prevent such issues proving to be ineffective?
ZONING LAWS AND THE POLITICS OF COMMERCIALISATION
The fault in this regard lies not in our stars, but in ourselves — so let’s illustrate this issue with an example.
On March 13, 2025, the SBCA proposed to amend Chapter 19 of the Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations (KBTPR) 2002. This clause allowed the redefinition of plots meant for “residential use” to more revenue-driven establishments, including educational centres, healthcare clinics and for other recreational purposes. Framed as “a change for the public good”, it obscured the distinction between residential, amenity and commercial plots, disrupting legal and architectural zone-planning.
 
 

However, the SBCA’s proposition faced widespread criticism for breaching constitutional and administrative jurisdiction. Civil society actors, including Shehri - Citizens for a Better Environment and the Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan (PILAP), among other public-interest petitioners, highlighted to the Sindh High Court that the role of re-categorising land-use is reserved with planning authorities such as the KDA or the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), instead of the SBCA.
Petitioners further referenced Articles 9 and 14 of Chapter 1, Part II of the Constitution of Pakistan, in particular the right to life and privacy — highlighting that this attempt to broaden the scope of “residential use” unilaterally was an unlawful exercise of power that threatened the existing legal framework, public space protection and civic amenities. Bhai stated that these “cul-de-sacs are being turned into cash-cows”, transforming the built-environment of residential neighbourhoods without any public input.
The High Court acknowledged the matter on April 8, 2025 and issued notices to the SBCA, KDA and KMC, halting the implementation of the clause. Met with increasing civic pressure, legal review and questions over jurisdiction, the SBCA withdrew the notification on May 13, 2025.
 

Multiple high-rises can be seen surrounding the area where the Homi Katrak Mansion stands on Abdullah Haroon Road: areas such as this, with high cultural nodes and low-density architecture, have now been surrounded by vertical construction

However, this incident is far from an isolated episode and merely sheds light on a broader pattern of unplanned development and legal circumvention. In the 1980s, zone-planning across Karachi generally allowed neighbourhoods around Gulshan-i-Iqbal and North Nazimabad to develop buildings that were ground floor plus one (G+1) and ground floor plus two (G+2). High-rises were scarce and necessitated civic infrastructure guarantees.
By the 1990s, however, there was a significant shift: commercial corridors were planned along previously low-density areas such as Sharae Faisal, Tariq Road and University Road, opening the door to mid-rise G+4 developments.
During the 2000s, the KBTPR 2002 institutionalised this shift in development by upgrading the Floor Area Ratios (FARs) from 1.75:1 to 3:1, or even 4:1 — which allowed the construction of more total covered floor space on the same plot of land, thus leading to much more vertical development — and enabling developers to escape liability by paying amnesty fees, allowing practices that benefit the builders. As architect Arif Belgaumi notes, “Nobody builds 100 percent of what is allowable, they build 120 percent.”
Once, a single family was housed on a residential plot in areas such as Gulshan, Hyderi or Jauhar. Now, 50 to 60 families, often over 1,000 people, including service staff, occupy the same space in high-rises reaching G+40. This increases the burden on the nearby roads and on G+2/3 buildings, in terms of water, energy and waste management.
 
 

This desire for high-rise construction is a constant cause of concern, because such projected structures hinder wind rotation and sunlight, thereby worsening air quality. Despite these pressures, the SBCA’s intervention is rare.
Despite the Supreme Court ban on using residential and amenity plots for commercial use, 930 conversions have taken place in Karachi since the start of 2024, as per the SBCA’s own admission. This increasing disconnect between law and implementation reveals what urban planner Ananya Roy calls “informality from above”, when the state selectively enforces or suspends rules to enable speculative development under a façade of legality.
This prompts an important inquiry into where our policies go from here, emphasising the role of legal mechanisms in pushing public interest development or facilitating selective evasion of laws. Such regularised inconsistency makes urban governance unpredictable in issuing and amending commercialisation laws.
THE COLLAPSE OF REGULATIONS
The issue of scale plays a critical role in a city such as Karachi, where most of the development takes place under the aegis of the builder mafia, without any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or structural research and development.
No Objection Certificates (NOCs) have existed since pre-Partition, while EIAs became mandatory in 1994 under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act of 1997. They were designed to ensure sustainable urban development, without causing lethal damage to the ecology. However, they have been reduced to hollow bureaucratic rituals, routinely used to fast-track construction with little oversight.
Belgaumi and urban planner Farhan Anwar deem Karachi’s EIA process as a “bureaucratic formality.” Assessments are typically carried out by builder-hired consultants focused solely on individual plots, ignoring neighbourhood-level impacts. Public hearings are treated as technical requirements rather than spaces for genuine scrutiny. Mitigations are rarely explored, and community feedback is sidelined.
The Bahria Icon Tower on the Clifton Promenade is a prominent example of carrying out construction without paying much heed to EIAs and the legal viability of a project — while also endangering heritage sites for its construction.
 
 

Endangered heritage sites are often scapegoated for disrupting ecology, but it is powerful developer groups that are reshaping Clifton’s landscape. In Old Clifton, developers, supported by the police, reportedly demolished a heritage bungalow to make way for a high-rise, destroying banyan trees and displacing migratory birds in the process. Due to such constructions, Clifton is now a concrete expanse, commodified at the expense of ecological and cultural memory.
Over 200 high-rises along major arteries, such as Sharae Faisal, were built without proper planning, fire exits or emergency systems. The SBCA issued NOCs and completion certificates without site inspections or consulting the KMC. There are countless such examples.
Hence, EIAs and NOCs are no longer safeguards. They legitimise reckless development and ignore transparency and public accountability. The disastrous impact of this is on display across the city.

ECOLOGICAL DISPARITIES
The ecological toll caused by unregulated high-rise developments is undeniable. Bhai notes the increasing vertical growth in KDA schemes. These areas were never designed for such high density. Consequently, parking needs, unfiltered carbon monoxide and unsanctioned commercial activities worsen residential life.
She also highlights the sewerage outbursts under the Clifton Bridge, which lead to unhygienic living conditions. Residents report that in places such as Gulshan, hot, dust-heavy wind flows in one direction, or not at all, while natural light is blocked due to narrow setbacks and cantilevered floors.
Continuing from Amber Ali Bhai’s argument, urban planners also critique not adhering to zonal planning. The vertical construction is widely critiqued because areas meant for G+1 or G+2 are obliterated by the seepage of high rises into them. Belgaumi furthers this critique by emphasising how high-rise construction has eliminated gardens and permeable surfaces, aggravating flood risks and temperature rises. The risk of flooding across Karachi is on display every year during the monsoon season in the city.
As a result, it is the citizens inhabiting these urban spaces that are forced to contend with the hard realities of living in such localities.
SOCIAL RELATIONS IN URBAN BUILT-ENVIRONMENTS
In densely populated Karachi neighbourhoods such as Gulshan and Hyderi, the wall-to-wall vertical expansion has hindered the natural light and ventilation flow. Residents living in bungalows and on lower floors of high-rises are subject to accumulated heat and lack of air circulation.
Architect and urban planner Arif Hasan describes the absence of fundamental necessities and notes, “Everybody has a right to some fresh air and some light.”
 
 

Such eco-spatial limitations then materialise into psychological and physiological concerns, and residents report increased mental strain and respiratory problems. A 2021 survey conducted by the Urban Resource Centre (URC) in Karachi found that nearly 64 percent of respondents living in newer vertical buildings in Gulshan Block 13-D and Hyderi complained of chronic discomfort related to heat and poor air flow.
Using 15 years of satellite imagery, this research mapped the changing landscape of Clifton Block 1 and Gulistan-i-Jauhar in five-year increments. The results reveal an uneven and increasingly stark ratio between green space and high-rise construction, especially in the case of Clifton Block 1.
While Gulistan-i-Jauhar could already be considered dense and a heavily developed neighbourhood in 2010, Clifton Block 1 highlights a sharper trajectory. While green spaces shrink at an alarming pace in both zones, the latter witnesses an aggressive rise in vertical construction, with little thought given to the residents living in its shadows.
The reformation of roads such as Rashid Minhas Road and Bilawal Chowrangi into commercial corridors has not only significantly eradicated green spaces but worsened traffic congestion, noise pollution and water accumulation during the rains.
Over the course of history, zones, including Gulshan-i-Iqbal and Kharadar, were distinguished by their interwoven community living, inclusive of shared alleyways, courtyards and parks that allowed for everyday, informal human interaction. Instead, the proliferation of towering structures and high-rise-living has substituted social engagement with an isolated anonymous lifestyle. The lack of communal spaces has drastically decreased neighbourhood monitoring and reduced social cohesion.
Both the social and ecological ramifications of this kind of construction are resulting in immediate consequences and also more long term issues, and no amount of real-estate projects presented under the garb of ‘sustainability’ can help reverse the damage — instead, they only exacerbate it.
THE GREENWASHING OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT
While Karachi chokes on and drowns in the ecological cost of vertical expansion, a more insidious form of development plays out along its coastline.
Real-estate giants often market projects as sustainable utopias that feature biodiversity parks and oceanfront boardwalks. But this is greenwashing, not conservation. Some are aggressively changing the landscape of Clifton by buying out old historical properties and turning them into vertical dreamscapes. And other developers are developing projects on contested lands. Across Sindh’s coastal belt, from Hawke’s Bay to Thatta, Sujawal and Badin, ecological zones once designated for preservation are now being transformed into peri-urban real-estate hubs.
 
 

This is happening despite initiatives such as the internationally backed Delta Blue Carbon project, which aims to restore mangrove forests and generate carbon credits. Some projects misappropriate the language of climate action, however, without offering genuine environmental benefits. Built on reclaimed tidal lands, they displace mangroves, reduce biodiversity, and fail to contribute to verified carbon offsets.
Gated developments in Korangi Creek and DHA Phase VIII have further narrowed creeks, shrunk fish nurseries and worsened urban flooding. Certain projects at Hawke’s Bay violate environmental laws and erase fisherfolk communities, undermining climate resilience. In a city where EIA systems fail centrally, what chance does Karachi’s fragile coastline have?
Mangroves are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on earth. Their destruction is not just an ecological loss, it’s a carbon bomb. No amount of rooftop gardens can change that.
MAKING THE CULPRIT PAY
So, as South Asian cities hurtle toward hyper-urbanisation, the question is no longer whether development will continue, but how it can sustain rather than destroy. Karachi’s unregulated vertical growth collides with ecological fragility. Amid this, the Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) offers a path toward accountability.
First introduced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1972 and endorsed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the PPP has gained new traction at recent UN climate summits as a framework for loss and damage financing. Its logic is simple: those who profit from environmental harm must be financially and legally responsible for mitigation and restoration.
At the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27), then-climate change minister Sherry Rehman championed climate justice and the operationalisation of PPP. But this commitment remains largely rhetorical at home. Pakistan demands justice globally but falls short in regulating local polluters, especially in booming sectors such as construction.
 
 

Cement, for instance, accounts for approximately eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Karachi developers must shift to low-carbon alternatives such as green cement, and the SBCA must enforce this shift, particularly for high-volume projects.
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification offers another pathway. While optional globally, SBCA could mandate a Karachi-specific version, requiring just one to two percent of project budgets for green roofs or solar panels. This small investment brings huge environmental returns.
In a region where the urban poor suffer from climate change the most, the PPP isn’t just policy — it’s a means for justice. If Karachi is to grow upwards, it must also grow responsibly, ensuring that those who profit also protect.
SAVING THE CITY FROM ITSELF
Karachi has evolved into a metropolis that is increasingly hostile to its own residents, where floods, heat and congestion are not natural inevitabilities but man-made crises. To help reverse this tide, Karachi’s development paradigm must shift. This means, among other things, reviving long-neglected master planning processes with genuine community participation, holding polluters accountable and embedding environmental safeguards in real-estate projects.
The illusion of progress in Karachi cannot only be measured by skylines. Instead valuing breathable air, accessible green spaces and social cohesion must be seen as markers of true urban prosperity. Without such a recalibration, the city risks drowning further — not only in rainwater, but in its own failures of imagination.

During a meeting at the CM House on Friday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah proposed to Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi that technical experts from both Sindh and PR should jointly work out the modalities of the project.
According to a statement issued by the CM House, the chief minister stressed the urgent need to revive the KCR and expressed frustration over the project’s continued delays.
The statement said that the KCR would serve an estimated 650,000 passengers daily and provide critical east–west and north–south connectivity across Karachi. However, it added, the updated feasibility still awaits approval from Chinese authorities as the project is set to be executed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
 






The chief minister proposed to the minister a collaborative approach, suggesting that the Sindh government and PR jointly develop the project, with involvement from donor agencies and the private sector.
The federal government decided to execute the project under CPEC, and as per the approved plan, the KCR has a 43.2-kilometre route, including 25.51km elevated and 17.7km on ground, and it would have 24 stations — 13 elevated and 11 on-ground.
The meeting was informed that anti-encroachment drives had already cleared over 11 acres of railway land along Drigh Road, Karachi University, Urdu College, and Gillani stations, but “problematic encroachments” remain near Liaquatabad and Urdu College.
 
 

The chief minister assured the minister that the Sindh government would continue to support PR in anti-encroachment operations and urban rehabilitation measures linked with the KCR route.
The meeting agreed that experts from both sides will jointly work out the final modalities of the KCR project, station outsourcing, and new train services.
The railway minister endorsed the chief minister’s proposals and gave assurances of full federal support.

Sabalenka ruthlessly attacked Anisimova’s shaky service game to complete a 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium, which cements her status at the pinnacle of women’s tennis.
The 27-year-old from Belarus had gone into Saturday’s final knowing it was her last chance to grab a Grand Slam crown in 2025 after agonising losses in the Australian and French Open finals.
Sabalenka duly atoned for those defeats to end Anisimova’s hopes of a remarkable redemption just two months after her traumatic 6-0, 6-0 thrashing by Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon final.
 


“It’s crazy, all those tough lessons were worth it for this one,” said Sabalenka after becoming the first woman to successfully defend the US Open since Serena Williams in 2014. “I’m speechless right now.”
Anisimova had won six of nine previous encounters against Sabalenka, a run which included a victory in the semi-finals at Wimbledon.
But a determined Sabalenka, playing in the seventh Grand Slam title game of her career, brought all her experience to bear as she slammed the door on Anisimova’s dream of a maiden Grand Slam title.
“Losing in two finals in a row is great but it’s also super hard,” Anisimova said. “I think I didn’t fight hard enough for my dreams today,” revealing that the lighting under the arena’s closed roof had made it difficult to serve.
“There was no way of adjusting, because I could not see the ball when I was serving, and that was a huge shock to my system,” she said.
 


Tiebreak streak
Sabalenka clinched victory after once again demonstrating her incredible prowess in tiebreaks — winning her 19th consecutive breaker 7/3 to clinch in one hour and 34 minutes.
Anisimova, meanwhile, was left ruing her inability to make the most of break points at key moments, in sharp contrast to Sabalenka who converted five of her six break point chances.
That imbalance was on display early in the first set, when Anisimova failed to convert three break-point openings as Sabalenka took a 2-0 lead.

Yet Anisimova hit back in the third game, lasering a backhand winner into the corner to earn a break point before unfurling a rasping forehand winner to break back before holding for 2-2.
With the momentum behind her and her groundstrokes forcing Sabalenka around the court, Anisimova then broke again for a 3-2 lead.
But that was the catalyst for Sabalenka to raise her game and she broke to love before holding to edge back in front.
Anisimova’s faltering serve again betrayed her in the eighth game, the eighth seed double-faulting twice in quick succession to hand Sabalenka two break points at 15-40.
Sabalenka needed no further encouragement and she duly converted before holding to take the first set.
Sabalenka punished another wayward service game from Anisimova early in the second set and looked in complete control at 3-1.
Yet Anisimova wasn’t quite finished, and she held confidently before breaking back to love to level it at 3-3.
The fightback was short-lived, however, and when Anisimova thumped a wide-open forehand long to gift Sabalenka a 15-40 lead, the Belarusian once again seized her chance for a break.

Sabalenka held for 5-3 and was soon serving for the match at 5-4. Yet she allowed Anisimova off the hook after ploughing a wide-open smash into the net.
Instead of giving her a match point, Anisimova had a break point, which she took to give her a lifeline.
But in the tiebreak, Sabalenka reasserted her control and she sprinted into a 6-1 lead before closing out victory.
Anisimova laments ‘lack of fight’
Anisimova felt she didn’t “fight hard enough” in her US Open final loss and admitted to suffering a recurrence of nerves in her second Grand Slam final.
The 24-year-old American, runner-up at Wimbledon in July, again fell short in her bid for a breakthrough major title.
Anisimova caused problems for Sabalenka with her powerful game, but could not maintain a consistent level against her more experienced Belarusian rival.
“Losing in two finals is great but it is also super hard. I didn’t fight hard enough for my dreams today,” said Anisimova.
 


“I didn’t win today, so of course I didn’t do enough. That’s just the reality, and I have to accept that.
“I feel like if I fought harder, then maybe I would have given myself more of a chance, but I feel like I was really kind of in the back seat today.
“I just felt like throughout the match I wasn’t playing my best tennis.”
After a traumatic 6-0, 6-0 loss to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, Anisimova said she was “frozen by nerves” at the All England Club.
 
 

It is an aspect of her game she is continually trying to prove as she challenges for the sport’s biggest prizes. “I feel like with finals I have a lot of nerves, and it’s something I’m trying to work on, but I just wish I played more aggressive,” said Anisimova.
“Of course, she (Sabalenka) was playing amazing. She was playing very aggressive and doing all the right things, so she made it very difficult for me today.”
Anisimova had her chances in the first set against Sabalenka after digging herself out of an early hole with two service breaks for a 3-2 lead. But Anisimova couldn’t consolidate that position, finding it difficult to pick up the ball with the roof closed on Arthur Ashe Stadium after a torrential downpour in the area. Sabalenka won the next four games to take the set.
“I haven’t played on the court during the day with the roof closed, and it was literally, like, white, and I couldn’t see the ball when I was serving,” said Anisimova.
“That was a huge shock to my system,” she added. “It was extremely frustrating for me.”
 


Anisimova was repeatedly playing catch-up in the second set and although she broke Sabalenka with the top seed serving for the match, Anisimova’s challenge fizzled out in the tiebreak.
“Making it to the final is obviously really special, but it would have been a dream come true to make it all the way,” said Anisimova. “I hope I can keep working really hard to give myself more opportunities to be in more and more finals.“</p><small>2025-09-07 04:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/070827493c66548.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940035/punjab-housing-dept-cancels-leaves-of-all-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab housing dept cancels leaves of all officials</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: In view of the flood situation and anticipated rains, the leaves of all officers and staff of subordinate institutions of the Punjab Housing Department have been cancelled.

It is pertinent to mention here that many temporary protective dykes built by locals at various places in the 160 kilometer-long Sutlej belt in Bahawalnagar have broken. Due to this, thousands of acres of land have been submerged and dozens of villages of Minchinabad, Bahawalnagar and Chishtian have been affected by the river and they have been cut-off from the cities.
On Thursday night, another large protective dyke near the bridge connecting Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal at Bhukan Pattan on Arifwala Road broke, not only flooding several settlements, but also raising concerns that Bahawalnagar will be cut off from other cities.

Youth drowns in floodwater

However, the locals were making every effort to repair the dyke. On the other hand, the district administration issued an alert to the relevant departments expressing fears of extremely high levels of flooding in the Sutlej and also appealed to the public to take precautionary measures.
Meanwhile, a teenager died by drowning in the floodwater in Chishtian on Friday.
Rescue officials said that deceased Shahzad (16) worked at the house of a landlord in the Sial settlement of Jhaiduan mouza. They said that the settlement was surrounded by floodwater on all sides, but most of the residents had not moved to safer places.
According to the officials, Shahzad slipped and drowned in the deep floodwater after leaving the house. He was later pulled out by the locals.
Rescue 1122 shifted the body to Chishtian THQ for legal formalities.

The subcommittee of the Senate House Committee headed by Senator Nasir Mehmood met on Friday. The participants stressed that there was no justification for further delay.
Senators Danesh Kumar, Hidayatullah Khan and Poonjo Bheel also attended the meeting.
The committee noted with concern that although the project was approved as far back as 2009 to meet the growing accommodation needs of parliamentarians, it has remained plagued by repeated delays.
 







CDA says work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political gatherings near site

CDA officials said work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political disruptions near the site. In 2015, the contractor demanded a steep cost escalation, leading to prolonged litigation. The committee was told that in 2025 a revised PC-I was approved at a cost of Rs7,170 million, and the contract was awarded to Mian Usman Umer & Company.
The committee observed that the prolonged delays have multiplied costs, adding with Rs3.5 billion already available, there was no justification for further inaction. Senator Mehmood directed CDA to immediately commence work and said timely completion is essential to avoid yet another cycle of cost escalations and litigation.
The committee further directed that the ministries of interior and planning must conduct site visits and submit progress reports to ensure consistent progress and transparency and accountability in the work. The committee will also visit the site.
On the matter of renovation of existing lodges, the committee expressed dissatisfaction over the deteriorated condition of the buildings despite claims of heavy expenditures.
 
 

The members said that thorough inspections will be carried out, and CDA was tasked to provide lodge-wise details of renovation costs, materials used, and justification for excessive spending.
The head of the committee remarked that accountability in the use of public money is non-negotiable and that disproportionate spending on a few lodges will not be tolerated.
The committee directed the chairman CDA to constitute an internal committee comprising well-reputed officers to conduct the initial investigations into the quality of the work and spending of amounts on each lodge during last two years.
The convener of the subcommittee pressed for transparency, demanding that CDA submit an internal inquiry report within 21 days.
The committee also raised the issue of poor cleanliness standards at Parliament Lodges. Members noted that janitorial staffers deputed for the task were not performing their duties effectively. Details of the janitorial contract, staff deployment and associated costs were sought.
The chairman CDA highlighted the additional financial burden on the civic agency due to the absorption of PWD employees after the department’s closure.
He requested supplementary funding to meet salary obligations.
The committee directed the ministries of finance and interior to resolve the matter on priority, stressing that institutional gaps should not hinder operational efficiency.

Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique confirmed the incident to Dawn.com in Khar tehsil’s Kausar Cricket Ground and said the blast was carried out through an improvised explosive device.
“It appears to be a targeted attack,” he added.
Last Saturday, two people, including a police official, were wounded after terrorists attacked a police station in the district’s Laghari area of Lowi Mamund tehsil through a quadcopter.
Sources said police constable Mohammad Habib and civilian Najeeb Khan were injured in the attack, which also damaged a vehicle parked on the premises.
Israr Khan, a public relations officer of the district police, had told Dawn that the injured were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Khar.
He also said terrorists launched another attack on the police station through a quadcopter but it missed the target.
