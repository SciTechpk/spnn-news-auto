<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05202625a3740ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953321/ptis-gohar-terms-27th-amendment-attack-on-the-house' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Gohar terms 27th Amendment ‘attack on the House’</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said that he and his party would continue to raise their voices against it.
According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
Addressing the National Assembly today, the PTI chairman spoke about the proposed amendment, remarking that when the 26th Amendment was being passed, the PTI “made great efforts” with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
“Maybe this time we won’t need to visit his (Fazl) home, or sit with you in committee,” Gohar said, directly addressing the deputy speaker, who was chairing today’s session. “We will raise our voice against it as it is an attack on the House.”
Gohar added: “Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs.”
 


The PTI chairman said the 27th Amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urging that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
“Amending the Constitution is this House’s right, and in this House, it is the right of those exact people who have the people’s mandate,” Gohar said. “Our democracy is very fragile; the people have no faith in the courts.”
He told the deputy speaker that when the 18th Amendment was passed in 2010, it was “passed with consensus and unity with the people”.
“The world acknowledged and celebrated it,” Gohar said. “However, when you presented the 26th Amendment, you brought 56 amendments, which were reduced to 25, then 18. We strongly opposed four of those amendments, including the constitutional bench, the tenure of judges and the preservation of the Election Commission.
“This is a time when the nation is very divided; tensions are high, terrorism is on the rise, the deficit is rising and people cannot bear further problems. Please, be concerned about Pakistan’s security.”
PTI submits resolution in NA
Meanwhile, a resolution was submitted by PTI members in the National Assembly to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran Khan, with PTI members signing the resolution.
“This House affirms that consultation between elected representatives and their political leadership is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy,” stated the resolution.
Recognising that lmran remains the head of the largest political party in the KP Assembly, the resolution said that the CM, as the constitutional head of the provincial government, “must be able to consult his leader on matters of governance and public mandate”.
“This House considers the denial of such access a violation of democratic
norms and an affront to the constitutional spirit that upholds dialogue and accountability,” it said.
Through the resolution, the PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the orders of the Islamabad High Court pertaining to the CM’s meeting with Imran in letter and spirit.
“This House further declares that such a meeting shall constitute an official
and legitimate consultation between the Chief Executive of the Province and the Leader of the largest parliamentary party, consistent with the principles of representative democracy and federal comity,” the resolution stated.
Last Thursday, CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the fourth time since assuming office.
Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister in October.</p><small>2025-11-05 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05202155dceb79e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953320/islamabad-atc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-omar-ayub-asad-qaiser-shibli-faraz-5-other-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues arrest warrants for Omar Ayub, Asad Qaiser, Shibli Faraz, 5 other PTI leaders</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad on Wednesday issued arrest warrants for eight PTI leaders, including Asad Qaiser, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub and Ali Nawaz Awan, in a case registered under terrorism provisions.
Today’s hearing was presided over by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, with none of the PTI leaders appearing before the court despite being repeatedly summoned.
Expressing displeasure over their continued absence, the judge ordered their arrest and directed authorities to produce them before November 11. The hearing was subsequently adjourned until the next date.
The case was registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) against the PTI leaders under relevant sections of the anti-terrorism act with charges of involvement in activities falling within the ambit of terrorism-related offences.
Non-bailable arrest warrants for Gandapur
In a separate development, Additional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Baloch issued non-bailable arrest warrants for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the audio leak case.
The judge expressed anger over Gandapur’s failure to appear for indictment proceedings, noting that neither he nor his legal representative attended the hearing.
The court had fixed the proceedings for indictment; however, the process could not be completed due to Gandapur’s absence. The judge postponed the hearing and adjourned the case until December 5, directing the police to arrest Gandapur and produce him before the court.
The case against Gandapur was registered at the Golra Police Station after an audio leak surfaced in which he was purportedly heard asking about the number of weapons, licences and people for a PTI protest.
The recording reportedly prompted a police investigation into the nature and intent of the conversation.</p><small>2025-11-05 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0515360210fe9d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953300/president-zardari-offers-expansion-of-defence-collaboration-to-qatari-emir' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari offers expansion of defence collaboration to Qatari emir</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha on Wednesday and offered to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of defence and defence production between Pakistan and Qatar, a statement issued by the Presidency said.
According to the statement, the Qatari emir “responded positively” to the offer and said he would instruct the relevant authorities to initiate discussions with Pakistan in this regard immediately.
The bilateral meeting was held on sidelines of the  Second World Summit for Social Development, which is being held in Qatari capital Doha from November 4 to 6. President Zardari is representing Pakistan at the moot.
The Presidency’s statement said that the Qatari leader also “expressed satisfaction at the recent Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence agreement”.
 






“It was a welcome and timely step that should have happened earlier,” the statement quoted al-Thani as saying. He also noted Pakistan’s “unique position as a country maintaining strategic ties with China, the West and the Gulf states at the same time”.
In September, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hinted that it was rooted in current world affairs and reflected the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
On the matter of recent clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Qatari emir expressed “hope that Pakistan and Afghanistan would resolve their current issues and move beyond recent challenges”.
Qatar is one of the two mediators in talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, which were held in Doha and Istanbul following border clashes between the two sides last month. Another round of talks between them is set to begin tomorrow (Nov 6) in the Turkish capital.
According to the Presidency’s statement, al-Thani told Zardari that “Qatar is proud of Pakistan and its achievements, and deeply values the contribution of the Pakistani community to Qatar’s development”.
He expressed the desire to see their number “increase significantly” in the coming years, the statement said.
For his part, President Zardari conveyed “warm greetings and best wishes” from the government and people of Pakistan to the Qatari emir, expressing “deep admiration for Qatar’s remarkable progress and visionary leadership”.
Moreover, the statement said that President Zardari also “proposed enhancing cooperation in agriculture and food security” during the meeting. He also welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two nations.
He lauded Qatar’s growing global role as a “centre of dialogue and humanitarian diplomacy and paid tribute to its leadership in advocating a ceasefire and humanitarian relief for the people of Gaza”.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the Gulf nation, he highlighted Islamabad’s “strong condemnation” of Israel’s aggression against Qatar and its continued diplomatic support for Qatar’s sovereignty at international forums.
The president welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two countries under the Qatari emir’s leadership, the statement said.
The president “also commended the contributions of the Qatar Fund for Development, the Education Above All Foundation, and other Qatari humanitarian initiatives, paying special tribute to  Sheikha Moza bint Nasser and Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al Thani for advancing education and cultural exchange,” the statement read.
It added that President Zardari further appreciated Qatar’s role in hosting and facilitating the UN-led Doha Process meetings on Afghanistan, including the first and second rounds held in May 2023 and February 2024, which have supported international coordination on humanitarian, development and security issues.
He invited the Qatari emir to Pakistan to further strengthen “partnership with Qatar for regional peace, progress, and shared prosperity”, the statement said, adding that the Qatari leader said he would visit Pakistan early next year.
Both leaders also discussed ways to further strengthen cooperation in political, economic and cultural spheres, the statement said, adding that they “reaffirmed the historic and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, rooted in faith, mutual trust and shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and the advancement of the Muslim Ummah”.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was also present during the meeting, the statement said.
Meeting with Qatari defence minister
The president later met Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and underscored the close and historic ties between their two countries, particularly in the field of defence and security cooperation.
“He expressed satisfaction over the existing collaboration between the armed forces of the two countries in training, capacity building and defence production.
“President Zardari emphasised the importance of expanding cooperation in joint exercises, defence technology and exchange of expertise, noting that such initiatives would further enhance regional peace and stability,” said a statement from the PPP.
 






The Qatari defence minister commended the professionalism of the Pakistan Armed Forces and reaffirmed his country’s commitment to deepening defence relations with Pakistan.
He reiterated Qatar’s interest in joint defence production and collaborative defence projects, expressing readiness to expand such initiatives in the future. He also assured Qatar’s support for facilitating peace and stability in the Afghan conflict.
The president appreciated Qatar’s continued support and said that Pakistan remained committed to further strengthening its strategic partnership with Qatar in diverse fields, including defence and security.
Meeting with Chinese vice president
Earlier, the president also met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng in the Qatari capital who appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability, a separate statement issued by the Presidency said.
According to the statement by the Presidency, during his meeting with the Chinese vice president, Zardari recalled his recent visit to China, saying that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners”.
“He thanked China for its consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan through all challenges, reaffirming that friendship with China remains the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” the statement said.
 






The president also commended “China’s continued partnership in the successful implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has now entered its second phase of high-quality development,” it added.
For his part, the statement said, Han Zheng  appreciated “Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability” and reaffirmed the “enduring strength of the Pakistan-China friendship”.
The vice president also conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s warm greetings.
He stressed that China would “continue to support Pakistan’s economic development under the second phase of CPEC, particularly in transport and infrastructure, information technology, agriculture, and vocational training”.
According to the statement, the two leaders “reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership based on mutual trust, respect, and a shared vision for regional peace and prosperity”.
“They also agreed to continue close cooperation on issues of mutual interest at regional and international fora,” the statement added.
President Zardari was accompanied by MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s ambassador to Qatar during the meeting.</p><small>2025-11-05 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051955132199565.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953318/gaza-hospital-says-received-15-palestinian-bodies-under-ceasefire-exchange-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Gaza hospital says received 15 Palestinian bodies under ceasefire exchange deal</strong></a><br><p>Gaza’s Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis on Wednesday said it had received the bodies of 15 Palestinian prisoners under the US-brokered ceasefire exchange deal.
“The tenth batch of the bodies of Palestinian martyrs has arrived at Nasser Medical Complex in the Gaza Strip, numbering 15 martyrs,” the hospital said in a statement, noting that 285 bodies were received under the agreement in total.
They were returned in exchange for the latest hostage body handed back from Gaza on Tuesday, that of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen.
Under the terms of the US-brokered agreement in effect since October 10, Israel returns 15 bodies of Palestinians for every body it receives of an Israeli hostage who had been held in Gaza.
At the start of the truce, Hamas held 48 hostages in Gaza — 20 alive and 28 deceased.
The militants have since released all the surviving captives, as well as 21 of the deceased’s remains.
Israel has accused Hamas of dragging its feet in returning the bodies of deceased hostages, while the Palestinian group says the process is slow because many are buried beneath Gaza’s rubble.
The group has repeatedly called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide it with the necessary equipment and personnel to recover the bodies.</p><small>2025-11-05 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051835311c58f40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953317/man-arrested-after-groping-mexican-president-sheinbaum' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested after groping Mexican president Sheinbaum</strong></a><br><p>A man has been arrested for allegedly groping and trying to kiss Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum as she greeted supporters in the country’s capital.
The incident occurred on Tuesday as Sheinbaum walked to an event near the presidential palace, shaking hands and taking pictures with people along the way, videos on social media showed.
The man approached Sheinbaum, put his arm around her shoulder and with the other hand, touched her hip and chest while attempting to kiss her neck. A member of the presidential security detail pulled away the man, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Despite his behaviour, Sheinbaum treated the man politely, agreeing to take a picture with him, then patting him on the back.
Security authorities later reported that the man had been arrested.
The head of Mexico’s Ministry of Women — a department created by Sheinbaum – commented on the incident.
“We condemn the act that our president experienced today,” Minister Citlali Hernandez said in a post on X that also slammed what she called macho attitudes that normalise unwelcome intrusions on women’s personal space and bodies.
 






The events highlight a latent problem in Mexico. Some 70 per cent of Mexican women aged 15 and over experience at least one incident of sexual harassment in their lives, according to data from UN Women.</p><small>2025-11-05 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05173948c1d8717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953315/in-pictures-sikh-devotees-celebrate-guru-nanaks-birth-anniversary-in-nankana-sahib' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Sikh devotees celebrate Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary in Nankana Sahib</strong></a><br><p>Sikh devotees on Wednesday gathered to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, in Punjab’s Nankana Sahib.
On Tuesday, Pakistan had welcomed dozens of pilgrims from India in the first major crossing since deadly clashes in May closed the Wagah-Attari border in Punjab between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
More than 2,100 pilgrims were granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, Pakistan’s High Commission (embassy) in New Delhi said last week.

The arguments are set to begin at 10am EST (1500 GMT) after lower courts ruled that Trump’s unprecedented use of a 1977 federal law meant for national emergencies to impose the tariffs exceeded his authority. The challenge involves three lawsuits brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led.
Trump has heaped pressure on the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to preserve tariffs that he has leveraged as a key economic and foreign policy tool. The tariffs could add up to trillions of dollars for the US over the next decade.
If the justices strike them down, “we would be defenceless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our nation”, Trump wrote in a social media post on Sunday.
Highlighting the importance of the case to the administration, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent plans to attend Wednesday’s arguments in person. Trump earlier had spoken of attending but decided against it.
If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, these tariffs are expected to remain as the administration switches to other legal authorities, Bessent told Reuters.
While the Supreme Court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing arguments, the Trump administration has asked it to act swiftly in this case.
Pushing the boundaries
 
 

The justices will consider Trump’s actions invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The law allows a president to regulate commerce in a national emergency but does not specifically mention the word tariffs.
Trump is the first president to use IEEPA in this manner, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials and domestic military deployments.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to impose taxes and tariffs. Trump’s Justice Department has argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to “regulate” imports to address emergencies.
The IEEPA-based tariffs have generated $89 billion in estimated collections between February 4 and September 23, when the most recent data was released by the US Customs and Border Protection agency. Trump has imposed some additional tariffs, invoking other laws. Those are not at issue in this case.
The Supreme Court has backed Trump in a series of decisions issued this year on an emergency basis. These have let Trump policies that were impeded by lower courts amid questions about their legality proceed on an interim basis, prompting critics to warn that the justices are refusing to act as a check on the president’s power.
The tariffs case marks the first time the court has heard arguments on the legal merits of one of Trump’s policies this year. It heard arguments in May in a case concerning Trump’s effort to restrict birthright citizenship, but focused not on the legality of his policy but on the authority of federal judges to block actions nationwide.
Global trade war
 
 

Trump instigated a global trade war when he returned to the presidency in January, alienating trading partners, increasing volatility in financial markets and fueling global economic uncertainty.
He invoked IEEPA in slapping tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, as well as in February, as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the US.
Trump has wielded tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a cudgel to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariff ad by Canada’s Ontario province.
‘An unusual and extraordinary threat’
IEEPA gives the president power to deal with “an unusual and extraordinary threat” amid a national emergency. It had historically been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. In passing IEEPA, Congress placed additional limits on the president’s authority compared to a predecessor law.
The Supreme Court is reviewing two rulings against Trump. The Washington-based US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with challengers, including five small businesses that import goods and the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont. A Washington-based federal judge sided with a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources.
“It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the Federal Circuit said.
The Federal Circuit also said that the administration’s expansive view of this law violates the Supreme Court’s “major questions” doctrine, which requires executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance to be clearly authorised by Congress. The Supreme Court applied this doctrine to strike down key policies of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.</p><small>2025-11-05 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0517334252caeb4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953309/mqm-p-demands-inclusion-of-local-govts-autonomy-in-27th-amendment-as-promised-earlier' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P demands inclusion of local govts’ autonomy in 27th Amendment as promised earlier</strong></a><br><p>The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Wednesday demanded that local governments (LGs) be given autonomy in the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment.
After the PPP revealed key features of the proposed amendment for which the government sought its support, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said yesterday that the legislation for the tweaks will soon be tabled in Parliament.
MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar presented his party’s demand today while addressing a press conference in Islamabad, alongside party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Sattar asserted that after provincial autonomy had been granted under the 18th Amendment of 2010, the “next step naturally is local autonomy, so it’s turn must come”.
 


“The important thing that we also said at the time of the 26th Amendment, that our constitutional amendment package be included,” he said, referring to its agreement with the PML-N to empower local governments.
“But it did not happen,” Sattar lamented, calling for the matter to be included in the 27th Amendment.
The PML-N and the MQM-P had signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2024 under which LGs would draw powers directly draw powers from the federation instead of provinces.
When talks of the 26th Amendment gained momentum, the MQM-P also tied its support for the legislation to the inclusion of LG-related provisions. However, the final version — passed with MQM-P lawmakers voting in its favour — featured no such provisions.
 
 

Sattar contended that the Constitution’s Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish LGs, needed to be amended so that laws enacted by local bodies would not contradict it.
“The Constitution is a sacred document, but not a divine scripture; it is a living document,” the MNA contended. He added that it should not bring worry or surprise if amendments were needed in it “as per the requirements of the time and situation, and for the country’s stability”.
Sattar also voiced support for constitutional courts, which were initially planned to be formed through the 26th Amendment but only constitutional benches were established in the end.
Meanwhile, about the proposed Constitutional tweaks, Siddiqui said: “We are only telling the key features, and have presented what the government told us and what we understood.
“Even from us, especially Article 243 … this year has created the need for it to be harmonised with national unity, strong defence, and modern requirements of defence,” he said, referring to the provision related to the command of armed forces.
 
 

Siddiqui called for local governments to also be “considered a government”, with the Constitution guaranteeing nazims and mayors’ elections and tenures, without the prime minister needing to issue orders for it.
“The Constitution should decide that. The Supreme Court should monitor it,” the education minister said, proposing a caretaker set-up for the two roles.</p><small>2025-11-05 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05174036e54b11e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953314/fbr-extends-deadline-for-filing-returns-manually-until-nov-30' target='_blank'><strong>FBR extends deadline for filing returns manually until Nov 30</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Wednesday issued a notification announcing that the deadline for taxpayers filing returns using manual forms rather than its web portal has been extended until November 30.
According to the notification, the tax body stated that it is discontinuing the use of manual forms to file returns in favour of digitising all of its data. However, it recognised that until last year, a “small fraction of people” were still filing tax returns manually.
“As a special dispensation, it has been decided that a cell in each tax office of Pakistan dealing with such taxpayers (manual filers) will provide all legal and technical support to such taxpayers,” the notification read.
“Such taxpayer’s return filing date is hereby extended till [November 30], in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 214A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, for smooth completion of the process.”
The notification requested that taxpayers filing manually contact their respective tax offices, where they would receive assistance in registration and return filing free of cost.
“Even if they require legal assistance, the FBR field office will provide them [the] service of a lawyer free of any cost this year,” the notification read.
On October 31, the FBR announced that it received a record 5.9 million tax returns for the tax year 2025 compared to 5m returns filed in the same period last year — an increase of 17.6 per cent.
Out of the filed returns, 3.6m taxpayers filed returns with tax payments, reflecting an 18.6pc rise in taxpayers who contributed revenue along with their returns, compared to the same period in 2024.</p><small>2025-11-05 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051725325b2be5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953312/social-media-post-case-islamabad-court-issues-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-imaan-mazari-husband' target='_blank'><strong>Social media post case: Islamabad court issues non-bailable arrest warrants for Imaan Mazari, husband</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case related to controversial social media posts.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case last week. Both had denied the charges. The court had summoned all prosecution witnesses for today’s hearing.
The judge presided over the hearing today in which Chattha expressed a lack of confidence in the court, to which ADSJ Majoka said the case could have been transferred if the lack of confidence had been expressed before the couple’s indictment.
He added that only the high court could transfer the case now.
“The judge seems to be under pressure,” Chattha said, to which ADSJ Majoka expressed his disagreement.
Mazari said that the two should be indicted first, adding that the charges had not even been read out to them, to which the judge said he had already done so and they should ask their lawyer.
The judge said he would go ahead with the hearing, since the law permitted him to do so, to which Mazari said the couple would boycott the proceedings if Majoka continued hearing the case.
“If you want to boycott the court proceedings, then of course you can,” the judge said, to which Chattha replied that the couple’s lawyers were in the high court and thus some time should be provided.
Reconvening after the break, Mazari informed the judge that her lawyer had withdrawn the power of attorney, to which ADSJ Majoka said the counsel should come to court and confirm it.
“If you are changing the lawyer, you should submit the request yourself on your behalf,” he said, to which Mazari pointed out that she was not changing her lawyer, but he had withdrawn himself.
To this, the judge reiterated that the lawyer should come to court and confirm it himself.
Meanwhile, Chattha replied: “My lawyer is on his way and will appear in court. The prosecution is in a hurry in this case. What is the hurry to record the evidence without the presence of the lawyer?”
The judge said he would wait and told the two to call their lawyers.
He subsequently issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the couple and adjourned the case till tomorrow.
ADSJ Majoka also issued a show cause notice to them, asking why their bail should not be rejected.</p><small>2025-11-05 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05165744874586b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953310/beaver-supermoon-to-be-visible-in-pakistan-this-evening-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>Beaver Supermoon to be visible in Pakistan this evening: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>The Beaver Supermoon, when the moon is at its closest to Earth, will be visible worldwide tonight, including in Pakistan, according to a statement from the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) on Wednesday.
According to Suparco, the moon’s distance from Earth varies between perigee (closest to Earth) and apogee (farthest), and when a full moon is at perigee or close to perigee, it becomes a supermoon.
The statement added that compared to a full moon at apogee, a full moon at perigee can appear up to 14 per cent larger and 30pc brighter, though the change is subtle to the naked eye.
The Beaver Supermoon is, according to the national space agency, the “closest, biggest, and brightest full moon of the year” and will reach peak illumination at 6:19pm, the statement read.
“At its nearest point, the moon will be 356,980 kilometres from Earth, making it 7.9pc larger and 16pc brighter than a typical full moon,” it added. “It is the second in a trio of consecutive supermoons (October, November, December 2025) and will be visible worldwide, including Pakistan, offering a breathtaking view in the night sky.”
According to the United States’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or Nasa, the name emerges from the Maine Farmer’s Almanack, which first published Native American names for the full moons in the 1930s.
“According to this almanack, the Native American tribes of what is now the northern and eastern United States named this the Beaver Moon,” Nasa says on its website.
In October, Suparco announced that a supermoon would be visible from Pakistan at 8:47pm on October 7, rising in the east just after sunset and setting in the west just before dawn.
In September, a rare blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — eluded Karachi stargazers as heavy cloud cover blocked the view.</p><small>2025-11-05 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0513262013270ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953283/brown-bear-ranos-years-of-captivity-at-karachi-zoo-come-to-an-end' target='_blank'><strong>Brown bear Rano’s years of captivity at Karachi Zoo come to an end</strong></a><br><p>After years of captivity at the Karachi Zoo, 24-year-old female brown bear Rano was flown to Islamabad on Wednesday, where she was moved to a sanctuary for a second chance at life.
According to Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar, Rano was transported to the capital on a Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft, which took off at 8:30am and landed at the Nur Khan Airbase a little after 11:30am.
From the Karachi Zoo, the bear was first taken to Faisal Base in a wooden brown crate on a cargo pickup truck, which Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) officials said she entered willingly and without having to be sedated.
“At just three calls, she walked from the sleeping area in her enclosure and into the crate,” said Sana Raja of the IWMB in a video. She added that Rano did not show any signs of distress and was also eating well.
 

The wooden crate in which Rano is being transferred.

Meanwhile, Mahar said that the team continuously monitored the bear on the flight, while Rano, despite the roar of the C-130 engine, caught up on lost sleep. “The technical staff at the Nur Khan Airbase helped with offloading Rano,” he added.
She was then taken to the IWMB bear rehabilitation facility, where she was given food and moved into a quarantine area. “Her stay here could last up to a month for examination and other protocols, after which she will be taken to a larger area,” said Anees, an official of the wildlife board, in a video shared by Mahar.
In the clip, a curious Rano could be seen sniffing her new, green home. Her otherwise heaving and panting body looked calm and at peace. She will be kept at the rehabilitation centre run by the IWMB before finally returning to her natural habitat in Gilgit Baltistan.
 






For years, Rano had languished at the Karachi Zoo, first inside a Victorian-era pit and then in a barren cage, a cell where she paced restlessly day and night on worn-out, hard flooring. Her situation had prompted animal rights activists to approach the Sindh High Court (SHC) seeking her relocation to the sanctuary in Islamabad.
Earlier this month, the SHC had ordered the bear’s relocation to the bear sanctuary. The court had also formed a committee to ensure her safe relocation, which included members of the IWMB, who had previously visited Karachi to train Rano.
Ray of hope
Mahera Omar, co-founder of the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society, said that zoos were unable to meet the complex psychological and behavioural needs of wild animals, nor could they replicate the ecosystems that are their rightful home.
“Zoos must be phased out and the animals rehabilitated in appropriate species-specific sanctuaries,” Omar said.
“Animals are not meant for our entertainment,” said Omar. “They deserve to live freely in their own habitats across protected national parks.”
She added that Rano’s rescue offers a ray of hope for the many other innocent animals silently suffering in captivity across Pakistan.
Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir, who fought Rano’s case in the SHC, called her relocation a win for all animal rights activists and journalists who covered the bear’s suffering and raised their voices over the years. He also thanked the court for bringing Rano’s suffering to an end.
“Rano’s case is not an isolated one. Many animals have perished and continue to suffer at Karachi Zoo due to its inadequate facilities, apathetic and ill-trained staff,” he stressed. “Karachi Zoo was originally a botanical garden, and that is the purpose it should serve as opposed to being a living hell for animals.”
“For the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, the zoo is only a cash cow, and they justify its existence as a cheap source of entertainment for Karachiites. We need to educate our children about animals, not reduce them and their misery and suffering as a source of entertainment,” he added.
Years of neglect
In March 2017, the bear was transferred from a breeding farm and research centre to the Karachi Zoological Gardens under an animal exchange programme. Not having owned bears for 16 years, Rano was confined inside a Victorian-era pit that last housed Emma, a Balochistan black bear said to have gone mad in captivity.
Housed with Rano was an Asiatic black bear that died in 2020, leaving Rano in solitary confinement. That year, Rano’s suffering came to the fore after a video of her panting and leaning against the wall of the cement pit went viral on social media.
Subsequently, a petition was filed in the Sindh High Court seeking Rano’s transfer to a sanctuary. In response, however, the zoo officials shifted her to another cage, not any better than the previous one. Over the years, her condition worsened, reaching the point of psychosis.
Earlier this year, activists rallied for Rano’s freedom once again after the bear underwent treatment for a head injury — an old wound that seemed to have been infested by maggots due to lack of care.
Animal rights activist Jude Allen Pereira petitioned the SHC, through his counsel Nasir, stating that the bear was deprived of species-specific environmental enrichment, suitable climatic conditions and necessary medical care.
When a two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah took up the matter on Oct 14, the court ordered the brown bear be shifted from the Karachi zoo to the IWMB bear sanctuary within 48 hours.</p><small>2025-11-05 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0516321310bfc86.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953265/the-name-is-mamdani-democrat-zohran-elected-new-york-citys-first-muslim-mayor' target='_blank'><strong>‘The name is Mamdani’: Democrat Zohran elected New York City’s first Muslim mayor</strong></a><br><p>Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, capping a meteoric rise from a little-known state lawmaker to one of the United State’s most visible Democratic figures.
According to CBS, Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127 (7.1pc) for Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.
Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party.
Democrats won two key state governor races, sending an early warning signal to Republican President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms.
The clean sweep among several ballots nationwide has boosted morale among Democrats bruised by Trump’s return to the White House and has set alarm bells ringing among Republican circles.
Mamdani, the youngest to serve in more than a century, was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018.
The Democratic socialist’s victory came in the face of fierce attacks on his policies and his Muslim heritage from business elites, conservative media commentators and Trump himself, who had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“.
“Hope is alive,” Mamdani declared in his victory speech. “We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. We won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something we do,” he said.

Mamdani said New York would no longer be a city where one can “traffic in Islamophobia and win an election”, adding that the city will be a light “in this moment of political darkness”.
He pledged a city hall “that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism, where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong”.
He quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”

The Democrat also gave a message to the US president, who is also a New Yorker, saying, “Donald Trump, since I know you are watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!”
Mamdani said he would put an end to the “culture of corruption” that has allowed billionaires like Trump to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks”.
“We will stand alongside unions and expand labour protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have iron-clad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,” he said.

Promising to fight for all New Yorkers, Mamdani said his administration would represent “immigrants, members of the trans community, Black women fired by Trump from federal jobs, single mothers struggling with rising costs — anyone with their back against the wall”.
He concluded his speech by thanking New Yorkers, saying, “This power is yours. This city belongs to you.”
His emphatic speech concluded with Bollywood song ‘Dhoom Machale’ blaring over the speakers.

Turnout was high in this year’s vote with 2.06 million ballots, or 98pc of votes cast, counted by 12:31am on Wednesday — more than the total number of voters in the 2021 race.
“The next and last stop is City Hall,” Mamdani said in a video posted to X after his victory was declared.
 






Congratulations for Mamdani
Ex-president Bill Clinton congratulated Mamdani. “I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York,” he said.
 






The former US First Lady and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that “more people voted in New York City’s election this year than they have in 50 years”.
 






US Senator Bernie Sanders said Mamdani had “pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history”.
“Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1pc,” he said.
 






Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”.
“We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said.
 






In New York, one group exclaimed “Mamdaniiiiii“, substituting the 34-year-old’s name for the customary “cheese” as they posed for a photo at a Brooklyn bar watch party.
Voters gathered there in cautious optimism, sporting Mamdani merch as they anxiously awaited the evening’s results, classic songs such as Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” and edgier tracks from Lou Reed blasting from the speakers.
It was a “local victory” that offered a means of “resisting and pushing back” against the political establishment in Washington, 40-year-old Ben Parisi told AFP, adding that the night stood in stark contrast to Trump’s victory a year ago.
“A lot of us worked hard in one way or another to make this happen,” Parisi said, “and here we are… we get to celebrate“.
Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US
Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States
Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival.
Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary.
 
 

A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign.
Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics.
Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office.
Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races
In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race.
 






Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor.
A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses.
Spanberger, 47, centred her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message.
 






“We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.”
“You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said.
Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.
 






It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms.
Uphill battle
The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.
Since Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness.
Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot.
“‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Prominent business people, including Bill Ackman, had noisily attacked Mamdani and funnelled cash to his rivals, while conservative media, including The New York Post, published blanket negative coverage.
 
 

Mamdani’s improbable rise highlights the Democratic Party’s debate over a centrist or a leftist future, with some leading national figures offering only tepid endorsements of Mamdani ahead of voting.
Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher said ahead of the result that Mamdani would face an uphill battle.
“Everybody’s got their knives out, and it’s a very difficult city to govern,” he told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-05 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051438098262c79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953301/finance-minister-terms-population-climate-change-as-existential-issues-pakistan-faces' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister terms population, climate change as ‘existential issues’ Pakistan faces</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday termed population and climate change as “existential issues” that Pakistan must address to realise its potential.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to the World Bank. The Bank states the annual population growth rate for 2024 at 1.5 per cent, with the government’s 2023 census showing that the population grew by 2.55pc from 207.7m in 2017 to 241.5m in 2023.
“I am very clear: we cannot realise the potential of this country unless we address two existential issues — population and climate change,” Aurangzeb said while addressing a gathering of the business community in Karachi.
“Only saying that we do not make emissions but have to adapt, so demonstrate it,” he said, referring to Pakistan’s oft-repeated argument that the country contributes less than 1pc to global carbon emissions but faces catastrophic climate change-induced events.
“We have funding. First utilise the funding we have,” the finance minister stressed as he responded to a reporter’s query.
He went on to note that population was “not only about the high-level” but also child stunting and learning poverty, which “is girls out of school”.
 


“These are all areas on which the federation and the provinces have to work together,” Aurangzeb said.
He said economic issues were “immediate” and would be solved in a few years, but climate change and population were “existential issues and are now urgent enough to address now. Now.”
Last month, lawmakers from across Pakistan called for declaring the rapid population growth a national emergency and integrating population welfare into all development and policy frameworks.
The Council of Islamic Ideology has endorsed birth spacing and recommended involving religious leaders more actively in disseminating messages on its permissibility.
Need for wheat, sugar to be deregulated
Replying to another question, Aurangzeb asserted that the government was “very clear” on the matter of deregulation of wheat and sugar.
“My view and that of the prime minister and the cabinet is very clear that the government should opt out of whatever matters it can,” he said. The minister noted that wheat had an element of “strategic reserve” as it was a staple food; otherwise, it should also be deregulated.
 
 

“Both these policies are coming,” he said. The government last month introduced the ‘Wheat Policy 2025–26: Transitioning to a Market-Based System’ that set a minimum support price to support flood-hit farmers.
“There was a situation due to the floods this time; otherwise, they (policymakers) did the right thing,” he said.
“Deregulation has to be end-to-end. It cannot happen that we deregulate a certain element in the value chain but maintain control over another. The government has to get out of the entire value chain, so that’s where we are headed,” Aurangzeb said.
During his media talk, the minister also noted, “We have definitely faced losses in rice [exports] this year because its fields in Punjab were damaged. But they are also hovering between $3-4 billion of agricultural exports.”</p><small>2025-11-05 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051213409675ec5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953290/sheikh-rashid-barred-from-travelling-for-umrah-despite-lhc-order' target='_blank'><strong>Sheikh Rashid barred from travelling for Umrah despite LHC order</strong></a><br><p>Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was barred from travelling to Saudi Arabia for Umrah on Wednesday, despite directives from the Lahore High Court (LHC) allowing him to travel abroad.
According to an October 30 court order — a copy of which is available with Dawn — the AML leader’s name had been removed from the Exit Control List (ECL), following involvement in several May 9 cases. The court had directed relevant authorities to allow him to travel.
However, in a video message posted on the social media platform X, Rashid alleged: “Today, I was stopped from going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite having permission from LHC’s Rawalpindi bench under Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan.”
 






The AML leader recalled that the “court had directed relevant authorities — who were present in the hearing — to comply and strictly adhere to the directives, yet I have been told that I can not go.”
Rashid alleged that two airport officers told him he “could not go and refused to obey the court order”.
Rashid vowed to file for contempt of court against airport officials before Justice Khan, adding that “in a country where even a high court order is not valid, you can only really look to God for help.”
In the Oct 30 court order, it was notified that “name of the petitioner (Sheikh Rashid) with the consent of concerned authorities has been removed from the exit control list (ECL).”
The court noted that, “Anti-terrorism court Rawalpindi had issued general order for impounding of passports relating to the persons facing trial under Section 28-A ATA, 1997, but at present respondents have no objection on going of the petitioner to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah.”
In January 2024, the AML chief was arrested after a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court rejected his bail in a case pertaining to violence in the country on May 9.
Previously, Rashid was arrested in 2023 by the Punjab police amid the state’s crackdown on the PTI and its supporters following incidents of vandalism on May 9 — when party chairman Imran Khan was first arrested from the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).</p><small>2025-11-05 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0513104295e1686.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953295/trump-modi-speak-frequently-as-trade-talks-continue-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Modi speak frequently as trade talks continue: White House</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump speaks often with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and trade teams from both countries continue to hold talks, the White House said on Tuesday.
“The president and his trade team continue to be in very serious discussions with India,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
“I know the president has great respect for Prime Minister Modi, and they speak pretty frequently.”
 






Trump said last week in South Korea that he wanted to reach a trade deal with India — signalling a thaw in relations that soured to their lowest point in decades after the US president doubled tariffs on Indian imports to 50 per cent as punishment for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Indian refiners cut Russian oil imports after Washington imposed sanctions last week on Moscow’s top two crude exporters, Rosneft and Lukoil.
Earlier this month, Trump claimed that Modi has agreed to cut Russian oil imports — something New Delhi has not commented on. A White House official said New Delhi had halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
 
 

On October 31, the US and India signed a 10-year defence framework agreement.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth termed the agreement a “cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence”. “We’re enhancing our coordination, information sharing and tech cooperation,” he had said.
Days before that, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Malaysia, where the two discussed bilateral ties as well as “regional and global issues”.</p><small>2025-11-05 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05123632e7b6d55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953292/saudi-arabias-request-to-buy-f-35-jets-clears-key-pentagon-hurdle-sources-say' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia’s request to buy F-35 jets clears key Pentagon hurdle, sources say</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration is considering a Saudi Arabian request to buy as many as 48 F-35 fighter jets, a potential multi-billion-dollar deal that has cleared a key Pentagon hurdle ahead of a visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, two sources familiar with the matter said.
A sale would mark a significant policy shift, potentially altering the military balance in the Middle East and testing Washington’s definition of maintaining Israel’s “qualitative military edge.”
Saudi Arabia made a direct appeal earlier this year to US President Donald Trump and has long been interested in Lockheed Martin’s fighter, one of the people and a US official said. The Pentagon is now weighing a potential sale of 48 of the advanced aircraft, the US official and the person familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The size of the request and its status have not been previously reported.
The US official and a second US official, who acknowledged the weapons deal was moving through the system, said no final decision has been made and several more steps are needed before the ultimate nod, including further approvals at the Cabinet level, sign-off from Trump and notification of Congress.
The Pentagon’s policy department worked on the potential transaction for months, and the case has now progressed to the secretary level within the Defense Department, according to one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Pentagon, White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said military sales are government-to-government transactions and the matter is best addressed by Washington.
Washington weighs weapons sales to the Middle East in a way that ensures Israel maintains a “qualitative military edge”. This guarantees that Israel gets more advanced US weapons than regional Arab states.
The F-35, built with stealth technology that allows it to evade enemy detection, is considered the world’s most advanced fighter jet. Israel has operated the aircraft for nearly a decade, building multiple squadrons, and remains the only Middle Eastern country to possess the weapons system.
Saudi Arabia, the largest customer for US arms, has sought the fighter for years as it looks to modernise its air force and counter regional threats, particularly from Iran. The kingdom’s renewed push for what would constitute two squadrons comes as the Trump administration has signalled openness to deepening defence cooperation with Riyadh.
The Saudi Air Force flies a mix of fighter aircraft, including Boeing F-15s, European Tornados and Typhoons.
The F-35 issue has also been intertwined with broader diplomatic efforts. The Biden administration previously explored providing F-35s to Saudi Arabia as part of a comprehensive deal that would have included Riyadh normalising relations with Israel, though those efforts ultimately stalled.
Trump has made arms sales to Saudi Arabia a priority since returning to office.
In May, the United States agreed to sell the kingdom an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, which the White House called “the largest defence cooperation agreement” Washington has ever done.
Congressional scrutiny could also pose challenges to any F-35 sale. Lawmakers previously questioned arms deals with Riyadh following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some members of Congress remain wary of deepening military cooperation with the kingdom.
The potential sale also comes as Saudi Arabia pursues ambitious economic and military modernisation plans under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 agenda. The kingdom has sought to diversify its defence partnerships in recent years while maintaining its decades-long security relationship with Washington.</p><small>2025-11-05 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051123069c239b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953286/man-arrested-for-allegedly-firing-on-citizens-protesting-dumper-truck-death-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested for allegedly firing on citizens protesting dumper truck death in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police said on Wednesday that a man had been arrested for allegedly firing on citizens who had torched a heavy vehicle that had struck a young man and injured his wife a day earlier.
Angered citizens on Tuesday had set a dumper truck on fire in the city’s Garden area after it crashed into a couple on a motorcycle, killing 23-year-old Shahzeb Shahid and injuring his wife Misbah. A case was also registered against Liaquat Mehsud, the Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, and other suspects for firing on the enraged protesters at the scene.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza on Wednesday said that police had arrested one suspect, identified as one of Mehsud’s gunmen, on charges of firing on the protesters.
The weapon used in the incident was also recovered, he said in a statement.
“Raids are being conducted to arrest the president of the dumpers association, Liaquat Mehsud,” he added.
Ex-MQM-P lawmaker booked under Peca for threatening Mehsud
Separately, Garden police also registered a first information report (FIR) against Kamran Farooqi, a former MPA of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), for allegedly threatening Mehsud.
The case was registered on behalf of the state through a police officer, and invoked the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), as well as Section 506-B (criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, complainant Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Rao Muhammad Shahrukh said he was present at his office on November 4, when he came across a video on social media at 6pm.
 
 

In the video, as per the ASI, a man identified as Kamran Farooqi was seen saying: “This wretched person, was fortunate today that he went away a few moments earlier, otherwise he would have been burned along with his vehicle. This is a public reaction.”
The video was accompanied by similar text stating that Mehsud was “fortunate” to have escaped,  the complainant added.
The complainant recalled that a dumper truck had killed Shahzeb on Nishtar Road in the Ramswami area and injured his wife Misbah yesterday. After that incident, the people had set the dumper ablaze. Subsequently, Mehsud, along with his gunmen and others, had arrived at the spot.
ASI Shahrukh noted that the police had already registered two separate cases about the incident at the Garden police station. He contended that Farooqi spread “mischief” on social media and threatened the dumper association’s head. Therefore, the ex-lawmaker had committed cognisable crimes under Peca and the PPC, the officer asserted.</p><small>2025-11-05 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051130166bd372c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953287/fawad-claims-efforts-for-release-of-political-prisoners-including-imran-to-bear-fruit-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Fawad claims efforts for release of political prisoners, including Imran, to bear fruit soon</strong></a><br><p>Former minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed on Wednesday that the “impacts” of the efforts of a trio — comprising him and other ex-PTI leaders — for political stability in the country and the release of political prisoners, including PTI founder Imran Khan, would start bearing fruit in the next 10 to 15 days.
Fawad, along with fellow former PTI leaders  Mehmood Moulvi and Imran Ismail, has been insisting on talks between the government and the PTI, in what they say is an effort to bring the political temperature down and pave the way for Imran’s release, who has been in jail since 2023.
“I am very pleased that the efforts for political stability and to secure the release of political prisoners, including Imran, have resulted in significant initial successes, and their impact will start becoming evident in the next 10 to 15 days,” Fawad posted on social media platform X.
 






He reiterated that himself, Moulvi and Ismail were making these efforts for “political stability in Pakistan”, expressing the optimism that differences and distances would soon diminish in the political landscape.
“It is important to abate political hostilities for Pakistan’s political stability and […] long-term development,” Fawad said.
The statement came hours after a late-night post on Imran’s X account quoted him as saying that he would “neither hold talks with the government nor with the establishment”.
While it remains unclear that who runs Imran’s social media accounts with him being in jail, posts on his X accounts frequently carry statements that are described as his messages from jail.
In the post, Imran said it was futile to hold talks and any decisions regarding negotiations would be taken by Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Raja Nasir Abbas, who are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, along with the PTI.
The post also quoted Imran as saying that he had complete trust in PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who has been criticised by Fawad in recent days.
Political outreach campaign
Fawad, Ismail and Moulvi’s recent activities came into the spotlight when they visited PTI’s Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore last week. The trio, however, was reported to have returned empty-handed, with Qureshi’s lawyer saying that had no political discussion with his client.
Qureshi is among several PTI leaders who were sent to prison in cases pertaining to May 9, 2023 protest that erupted over Imran’s arrest the same day. A crackdown on the party was launched after the violent protests, during which several public properties and military installations were vandalised.
The former foreign minister was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute from jail for medical treatment, where the three former PTI leaders   visited him.
 
 

“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar later said, adding that by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi.
However, the former PTI leaders, particularly Fawad and Ismail, have been insisting that Qureshi had agreed with them that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end. The also maintain that they met another jailed PYI leader Ejaz Chaudhry in this regard.
After their visit to the hospital, Raja also reportedly called on Qureshi, with party leaders Shaukat Basra and Zaheer Babar in tow.
On Sunday, Fawad had doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue.
He also claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders.
“If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to PTI leaders such as Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid.
He also shared the trio’s plans to approach the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman, as well as some senior ministers, and ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions.
The ex-PTI leaders have also dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’.</p><small>2025-11-05 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051119207f4a0f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953285/19-year-old-ac-technician-injured-in-gas-leak-blast-at-supreme-court-canteen-succumbs-to-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>19-year-old AC technician injured in gas leak blast at Supreme Court canteen succumbs to injuries</strong></a><br><p>One of the 13 people injured in a gas blast at the Supreme Court’s canteen a day earlier succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday, according to hospital officials.
Dr Abdul Khaliq, the head of the Burn Care Centre at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, said that 19-year-old Asad Muneeb, who was a air conditioner technician (AC), did not survive.
He said that the victim had sustained burn injuries on 80 per cent of his body.
The doctor also said that another person injured in the incident had been discharged.
“Out of the 11 remaining patients, four are critical. Five of them will have plastic and skin surgeries within the next two weeks,” he said.
Talking about the gas blast, he said that in such cases hot air enters the lungs, severely damaging them in the process. He said that chemicals were also released in such a situation, which could further exacerbate one’s injuries.
“Our plastic surgery team for burn injuries is doing their best,“ he said.
As many as 13 people were burnt, two of them seriously, in a gas explosion in the apex court’s canteen on Tuesday. The incident took place in the canteen located in the basement of the court building at around 10:55am.
Islamabad Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said there was a massive gas leakage and smell in the basement while air conditioners installed in the canteen were also not working properly. He said the blast happened when technicians were busy with repair work, adding that majority of the injured were technicians.</p><small>2025-11-05 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05111524898da38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953284/china-suspends-some-us-tariffs-yet-soybean-buyers-still-face-high-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>China suspends some US tariffs, yet soybean buyers still face high tariffs</strong></a><br><p>China will suspend for one year the 24 per cent additional tariffs it imposed on US goods in April, while maintaining the 10pc levies also introduced in response to US President Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ duties, its cabinet confirmed on Wednesday.
The State Council’s tariff commission also announced it would remove the duties of up to 15pc it imposed on certain US agricultural goods from November 10, referring to a release from March detailing the products the world’s top agricultural buyer would begin taxing on import.
But the cut still leaves Chinese buyers of soybeans facing tariffs of 13pc, including a preexisting 3pc base tariff. Traders say that makes US shipments still too expensive for commercial buyers compared to Brazilian alternatives.
Before Trump took office in 2017 and the first US-China trade war began, soybeans were by far the top US export to China, with the world’s biggest agricultural buyer purchasing $13.8 billion worth of the staple in 2016.
But China has largely held off on buying US crops this year, costing American farmers billions of dollars in lost exports. In 2024, China bought roughly 20pc of its soybeans from the United States, down from 41pc in 2016, customs data shows.
 
 

Investors on both sides of the Pacific breathed a sigh of relief last week when Trump met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, easing fears that the world’s two largest economies might abandon talks aimed at resolving a tariff war that has disrupted global supply chains.
While Trump and the White House were quick to publish their take on the meeting, the Chinese side did not immediately move to provide a detailed summary of what it had agreed.
China’s state-owned COFCO bought three US soybean cargoes the day before the summit, an act analysts attributed to a goodwill gesture signalling Beijing’s desire to avoid a destabilising escalation in trade tensions.
Some market participants expressed doubt that the soybean trade would return to normal anytime soon.
“We don’t expect any demand from China to return to the US market with this change,” said one trader at an international trading company. “Brazil is cheaper than US and even non-Chinese buyers are taking Brazilian cargoes.</p><small>2025-11-05 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05093335c544ac1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953230/germany-offers-cash-to-afghans-in-pakistan-to-forgo-resettlement' target='_blank'><strong>Germany offers cash to Afghans in Pakistan to forgo resettlement</strong></a><br><p>BERLIN: Berlin is offering cash to Afghan refugees in Pakistan if they agree to give up their places on a programme for resettlement in Germany, activists said on Tuesday.
The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government but around 2,000 have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
According to the initiative Airbridge Kabul, refugees have been sent a letter offering them money and other support in return for exiting the resettlement programme.
In the case of a single woman, the payments would be an initial 1,500 euros (about $1,700) in Pakistan and a further 5,000 euro payment if she travels to Afghanistan or a third country.
A spokeswoman for the interior ministry said that  “there are offers within the framework of a voluntary return programme to Afghanistan or departure to another third country”.

Single woman may get 1,500 euros in Pakistan and a further 5,000 euros if she travels to  Afghanistan or a third country

The German scheme was aimed at Afghans who had worked with German forces in Afghanistan or who were deemed at particular risk from the Taliban, for example journalists, lawyers and human rights activists.
Eva Beyer from Airbridge Kabul said she was not aware of any refugees in the scheme who planned to accept the German government’s latest offer and that many had reacted with shock and outrage.
“I’ve been trembling all over and can’t stop crying,” read one message from a refugee which Beyer shared with this news agency.  “I don’t want money or bread, I just want to live in safety.”
Pakistani authorities have in recent months intensified a crackdown on Afghans living in the country without residency.
Over the summer, more than 200 Afghans who were enrolled in the German programme were deported to Afghanistan.
In September, a German foreign ministry spokeswoman said that  “an understanding” had been reached with Pakistan that no further arrests or deportations of those in the programme would take place until the end of the year.
However, according to Airbridge Kabul, there were 17 arrests in late October and the situation for Afghans in Pakistan was aggravated by the military clashes between the two countries last month.
The initiative says that the latest letter to the refugees admits that “the procedures in Pakistan must be fully completed by the end of 2025” but adds that  “unfortunately, it cannot be guaranteed that all procedures will be completed in time”.
Several groups of Afghans in the resettlement programme have been able to come to Germany after taking the government to court, with a group of 14 arriving last Thursday.

• Discrepancy arises from reliance on administrative boundaries over population density, settlement patterns
ISLAMABAD: An analysis of a World Bank policy research working paper reveals that Pakistan’s true level of urbanisation is close to 88 per cent, based on satellite imagery and the Degree of Urbanisation methodology.
According to the working paper titled “When Does a Village Become a Town?: Revisiting Pakistan’s Urbanisation Using Satellite Data”, the substantial discrepancy arises from Pakistan’s reliance on administrative boundaries that fail to reflect actual population density or settlement patterns.
The analysis finds that Pakistan’s urban population is nearly twice the size reported in official statistics, as the administrative definition accounts only for the largest cities. Based on the DoU classification, 88pc of the population lives in an area with urban characteristics – 46pc in high-density cities and about 42pc in moderately dense urban centres.
These figures contrast sharply with the 39pc urban population reported in official data, revealing a major gap between politically defined and technically measured classifications.
The findings indicate that secondary cities and peri-urban areas — rather than megacities — are the primary drivers of recent urban expansion and are systematically overlooked in official classifications. This discrepancy between functional and administrative classifications has significant fiscal and planning implications.
 
 

Misclassified areas reduce property tax revenues and undermine the planning and delivery of essential public services. Moreover, misclassification distorts spatial socioeconomic indicators, masking the true extent of urban-rural disparities and complicating the design of effective, evidence-based public policy, according to the research paper produced by the World Bank’s Office of the Poverty and Equity Global Department.
The last time Pakistan’s official classification of urban areas reflected on-the-ground realities was in 1972. Before then, urban classification was based on objective indicators such as population count, infrastructure, and public service provision. However, after 1972, the responsibility shifted to provincial and municipal committees, which have no formal obligation to consider population concentration or objective metrics when defining urban areas – nor are they required to periodically revise urban boundaries.
The study shows that while official statistics suggest 39pc of Pakistan’s population is urban, this figure rises to 88pc when population density and concentration are considered. The official definition captures only the largest urban centres and fails to recognise the urban character of growing peri-urban areas that now host nearly half the population.
Additionally, the paper discussed how mirroring the urban expansion of Pakistan with the development of “megacities” overlooks the significant urbanisation occurring in growing peri-urban areas. While the expansion of cities like Lahore and Karachi is a notable indicator of the country’s increasing urbanisation, a large part of the urban population growth occurs in many intermediate and small urban centres.
The study uses the Degree of Urbanisation method, which relies on satellite data to assess population density, providing a more accurate and globally comparable view of urbanisation beyond administrative boundaries.
Across all provinces, the divergence between the official urban classification and the DoU persists, with official statistics consistently
Official data underrepresents urbanisation, with Islamabad showing only 47pc urban population compared to 90pc under the DoU, while figures in Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh are more closely aligned.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the DoU estimates the urban population at nearly three times the official 15pc, while Islamabad is mostly dense urban, and other provinces show mixed suburban and peri-urban growth.  The report concludes that Pakistan’s urban landscape has transformed dramatically over the past two decades. Since the early 2000s, a growing share of the rural population has shifted away from agriculture, transforming previously rural settlements into new and vibrant urban centres.

Under the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), publication of the IMF-prepared GCD report and a subsequent action plan to address governance weaknesses across federal and provincial tiers is a key structural benchmark.
The deadline, initially end-July and then reset to end-August and end-October 2025, remains unmet owing mainly to technical and factual disagreements between Pakistani authorities and the IMF team.
“We have reaffirmed the structural benchmark and, with mutual understan­ding with the IMF, have committed to publish the report before the [IMF exe­­­c­utive] board meeting” later this mo­nth or early next month, an official said.

Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment is a structural benchmark under $7bn bailout package

He said it was a very comprehensive exercise conducted by the technical and legal teams of the IMF in consultation with other global organisations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Drafts were exchanged repeatedly with Pakistani counterparts — including anti-corruption bodies, the superior judiciary, investigation agencies and the finance and law ministries — to secure “the best outcome” from international expertise covering more than 100 rules, the official added.
He said there had been serious disagreements on the interpretation of rules in the local and internal context, “for the best advice and implementation plan”. The official claimed the disagreement phase was now over and a final draft had been shared with IMF headquarters in Washington for a final review before publication.
The two sides are believed to have discussed reducing the time gap betw­een the publication of the GCD Asses­sment Report and a resultant governance action plan based on its recommendations for reform measures to address critical governance vulnerabilities.
Earlier, the GCD report was set for publication in July and the action plan rollout was scheduled for a gap of three months by the end of October. The latter may now be rolled out before December to become subject for the next biannual review.
There are compliance gaps around asset declarations by public servants. While the overarching civil servants’ law has been amended to mandate electronic filing by Grade-17 and above officials, including beneficially owned assets and those of family members, for access by relevant institutions, tax authorities and banks, implementation remains uneven.
An IMF scoping mission had visited Pakistan early this year and held meetings at the Supreme Court, the Law and Justice Division, the Auditor General for Pakistan, parliamentarians, the National Accountability Bureau, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the State Bank of Pakistan.
It produced a comprehensive report identifying gaps and weaknesses in public finance management, FBR’s tax system, and the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues’ efforts to identify loopholes.
Under the existing governance mechanism, the majority of government officers have not been disclosing assets of their own and those of other family members to the tax authorities or the Establishment Division, and there was an insufficient institutional mechanism for accountability.
On top of that, many institutions, including regulatory bodies, have exemptions from such requirements of scrutiny and disclosures. No wonder there have been widespread reports of corruption and corrupt practices across the bureaucratic and political landscape, and Pakistan has been ranking high on the various international corruption perception indexes.
 
 

The IMF has been pressing for data-based red flags, due diligence, safeguard mechanisms and guidelines against corruption and misuse of public offices, resulting in sub-optimal decision-making and compromising the country’s business and growth potential. The Paris-based FATF had also identified a series of weaknesses and made recommendations for course correction.
Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the second review of $7bn bailout package and the first review of $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Fund (RSF) on Oct 14.
Under the agreement, Pakistan will get $1bn disbursement under the EFF and $200m under RSF upon approval of the IMF executive board. The board meeting has not been announced yet, but authorities suggest this would be convened any time after Nov 15.

• Says bill may originate in Senate instead of NA
• Stresses govt will consult allies as opposition warns of ‘constitutional crisis’
• PTI’s Ali Zafar brands move a ‘conspiracy’, claims devolution at risk
• Upper house passes Asaan Karobar Bill, extends Virtual Assets Ordinance by 120 days
ISLAMABAD: As the opposition in the Senate raised alarm over the proposed 27th constitutional amendment, Deputy Pri­me Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday confirmed the bill would be brought bef­o­re parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment.
“We will try to present it in accordance with the Constitution. I assure this will not be put to a vote in a flash,” he told the upper house while responding to PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar.
Mr Dar’s remarks came amid a sustained protest by opposition senators over the delay in appointing the leader of the opposition. He said that after the PPP, the government would take all allies on board, including the MQM, ANP, IPP and BAP. “A standard process is being followed,” he said.
The deputy prime minister noted that such amen­dments typically originate in the National Assembly, but added that if senators wis­hed to see the draft fir­st, he could request that the bill be moved in the Senate.
Brushing aside suggestions that the amendment was coming from “somewhere else”, he said it was being brought by the government. He also suppor­ted the opposition’s dem­a­­nd for the immediate app­o­­i­­n­tment of the opposition leader, but said the Se­n­ate chairman was supposed to satisfy himself on who commanded a majority.
‘Conspiracy against Constitution’
Earlier, PTI’s Ali Zafar termed the forthcoming 27th Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution”.
He said key ministers in television appearances he had taken part in had claimed there was no such amendment in the works.
“This only means either they were telling a lie or were unaware of it. In both cases, it means that someone else is drafting the 27th Amendment for them,” he said, warning that an imminent constitutional crisis had effectively been announced and must be taken up by the Senate.
“Constitutions are not murdered by bullets, but by mala fide amendments made under the guise of reform,” Mr Zafar said.
Calling the Constitution a sacred document, he recalled that on April 10, 1973, when the Consti­tut­ion was adopted, the then prime minister Zulfi­kar Ali Bhutto declared that it was “the Constitu­tion of the people of Pakis­tan, not of one man or one party”.
He said dictators had distorted the 1973 document over the next 37 years, until parliament passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010, restoring the democratic spirit of the Constitution, reviving the parliamentary form of government, strengthening provincial autonomy and safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission.
However, he warned that the proposed 27th Amendment threatened to undo those gains.
The senator alleged it would undermine judicial independence through the creation of constitutional courts, tamper with presidential powers and appointments relating to the armed forces under Article 243, alter the provincial share in the NFC Award by removing the constitutional minimum, and give devolved functions such as education, health and population planning back under federal control.
“All these proposals, as suggested in PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s own tweet, strike at the very foundations of our constitutional order, reversing the principles of provincial autonomy, parliamentary supremacy and judicial independence.”
He expressed surprise that, instead of rejecting such proposals, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had outlined them, arguing they contradicted the spirit and legacy of the PPP, whose founders had given Pakistan the 1973 Constitution.
“The question before us is not merely legal, it is moral,” he said. “Will the Peoples Party honour the word it gave to the people in 1973, or once again erase it in the name of expedience?”
He reminded the Senate that JUI-F had previously opposed the creation of any constitutional court and said he hoped both JUI-F and Jamaat-i-Islami would stand with the PTI in opposing the 27th Amendment.
The row over the opposition leader’s appointment surfaced at the outset of proceedings when PTI-backed Senator Azam Swati raised the matter.
The protest over the issue later escalated as PTI senators gathered before the chair’s podium and tore up copies of the agenda. The house echoed with chants of “Go PM go.”
Presiding officer Manzoor Kakar of BAP said the issue did not fall within his jurisdiction. He asked members to return to their seats and assured them of time to speak.
Asaan Karobar Bill
Separately, the House passed the Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline the regulatory framework for business, trade and investment by removing cumbersome procedures and outdated requirements.
Already cleared by the National Assembly, the legislation provides for the establishment of a Pakistan Regulatory Registry and a Pakistan Business Portal to serve as a national one-window for government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.
The bill was moved by MNA Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, chairman of the Board of Investment.
According to the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, “The modernised regulatory requirements will be integrated through a Pakistan Business Portal, which will serve as a National One-Window facility for the identification and issuance of all government registrations, licences, certifications, and permits.”
The implementation of this initiative “will have several benefits for the economy, including increased investment, job creation and economic growth,” the statement said. “It will also help improve Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market and attract foreign investors seeking a stable and predictable regulatory environment.”
The Senate also extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, for another 120 days. The ordinance, in force since July 8, 2025, establishes a legal framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including the creation of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
The authority’s mandate includes licensing crypto-related entities, issuing and implementing regulations, investigating suspicious transactions, ensuring consumer protection and imposing penalties, suspensions or legal action against non-compliant companies.
