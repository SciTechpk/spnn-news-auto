Trump had offered to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a ceasefire between the two nuclear powers following their most intense military confrontation in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
Responding to a question on the steps the US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce noted, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.
Fielding questions after a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, the US president said that he “stopped a war” between Pakistan and India.
“Eventually they were gonna go nuclear … and I stopped it, I called each leader … and I spoke to them and talked about trade,” Trump said. “I said, ‘You’re not trading with us if you go to war … if you’re going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.
“They were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly, they stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade,” Trump added.
He further said that India is negotiating a trade deal in Washington, and a Pakistani delegation would arrive “I think next week”.
In response to another question, Trump said, “We’re going to get them together. I told them, India and Pakistan … they have a longtime rivalry over Kashmir. I told them ‘I can solve anything.’
“I will be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.”
 
 

Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team visited London and will also visit Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.

The plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel outside the airport during lunch hour. It was headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital.
City police chief GS Malik told Reuters that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. There were no reports of survivors being found, and the Indian Express newspaper said all 242 on board had perished, citing police.
The majority of the people on board are feared dead, a top official in the Directorate General of Civil Aviation told The Print. Malik similarly said the same to the Associated Press, saying: “It appears there are no survivors.”
He later told Indian news agency ANI that there was one survivor who was under treatment.

Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
Relatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi said.
“The building on which it has crashed is a doctors’ hostel … we have cleared almost 70 per cent to 80pc of the area and will clear the rest soon,” a senior police officer told reporters.
Air India said the Boeing 787-8 aircraft was carrying 242 passengers and crew members, adding that the injured were being taken to the nearest hospitals.
 






“This is a difficult day for all of us at Air India,” CEO Campbell Wilson said in a video message.
“Investigations will take time.”

Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 said signal from the plane was lost less than a minute after take-off from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 1:38pm (1:18pm PKT).
According to air traffic control at the Ahmedabad airport, the aircraft gave a “Mayday” call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter, there was no response from the aircraft.
 






According to The Guardian: “The Air India tragedy in Ahmedabad is the first time a Boeing 787 Dreamliner has crashed.
“While airlines using the Boeing plane have had widespread problems with engines on the 787 plane, leaving many having to ground planes and reduce flights, the 787’s safety record in service has been so far good,” the report by Guardian’s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham added.
Al Jazeera also reported that it was the “first crash ever of a Boeing 787 aircraft”, citing the Aviation Safety Network database.
 






Rescue operations
Visuals from right after the crash showed debris on fire, with thick black smoke rising up into the sky near the airport. TV channels also showed visuals of people being moved in stretchers and being taken away in ambulances.
In its statement, Air India detailed that 169 Indians, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian national were among the people on board, with the nationalities of the 12 others not specified. Times of India quoted the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) as saying that the 242 people comprised 230 passengers, two pilots and 10 crew members.

Boeing shares fall 8pc after Air India Dreamliner jet crashes
The fatal crash tarnishes the Dreamliner jet’s safety record and could muddy Boeing’s efforts to rebuild trust related to safety and ramp up production under new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Orthberg.
Shares of Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier, and GE Aerospace, which makes engines for the jet, also fell about 4pc each.
Boeing’s shares were down about 8pc at $196.75 in premarket trading.
“It’s a knee-jerk reaction [to the incident] and there’s revised fears of the problems that plagued Boeing aircraft and Boeing itself in recent years,” said Chris Beauchamp, analyst at IG Group.
India’s aviation accident history
In August 2020, an Air India Express plane crash-landed at Kerala’ state’s Kozhikode airport, claiming the lives of 21 people, including 19 passengers and the flight’s two pilots, and injuring 76.
In 2010, an Air India Express jet crashed and burst into flames at Mangalore airport in southwest India, killing 158 of the 166 passengers and crew on board.

In one of the worst aviation disasters in India, two passenger planes collided mid-air near New Delhi in 1996, with the loss of all 349 on board both flights.
Decades earlier, an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Montreal to London in June 1985 crashed into the sea off Ireland with 329 people on board and leaving no survivors.
India’s airline industry has boomed in recent years, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh last month calling growth “nothing short of phenomenal”.
The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world’s fourth-largest air market — domestic and international — with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.
Air India ordered 100 more Airbus planes last year after a giant contract in 2023 for 470 aircraft — 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing.
India’s domestic air passenger traffic reached a milestone last year by “surpassing 500,000 passengers in a single day”, according to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation.

The move was made in a notification today from the Sindh Excise, Taxation and Νarcotics Control Department.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that on September 16, 2024, the Sindh Excise Department had taken a significant step by making biometric verification mandatory for vehicle registrations and transfers.
Sindh Senior Minister for Information, Transport, Excise, Taxation, and Narcotics Control Sharjeel Memon had said that all new and old vehicles would be subject to biometric verification during the registration or transfer process.
He elaborated that the change would be implemented in three phases under the new policy. In the first phase, starting from July 1, biometric verification will be mandatory for the registration of new vehicles.
In the second phase, beginning on November 1, biometric verification would be required for vehicle buyers.  In the third phase, biometric verification of both the vehicle seller and buyer would be enforced.
Memon had said that the government was working to make all processes more transparent in the Excise Department and was committed to ensuring that Sindh led the way in digitising public services.
He had emphasised that biometric authentication in vehicle registration and transfers was a significant milestone in promoting transparency that would enable the accurate identification of buyers and sellers, thereby helping to protect citizens from illegal vehicle transfers and fraud.
Memon had said that vehicle owners could visit any Nadra e-Facilitation Centre or district excise office to complete the biometric verification process.</p><small>2025-06-12 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12212700e2411db.jpg?r=215106' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916754/pm-shehbaz-discusses-regional-peace-bilateral-ties-with-uae-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz discusses regional peace, bilateral ties with UAE leadership</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday met with the United Arab Emirates leadership to discuss regional peace and stability and explore ways to deepen bilateral ties during his official day-long visit to the emirates.
Over the last few months, UAE has expressed commitment to strengthening its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and announced a $2 billion debt rollover soon after.  In April, the two nations signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen the bonds between the people of both nations.
The premier arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier today, where he was welcomed by the UAE’s National Security Adviser, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
During a high-level meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, PM Shehbaz discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and reaffirmed commitment to further enhance cooperation in key areas, state media PTV reported.
“Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the positive trend of bilateral relations and the ongoing progress at all levels,” it added.
They agreed to maintain close communication and continue working together to advance the shared goals of regional peace and prosperity, the report said.
It added, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated the invitation to the President of the UAE to visit Pakistan soon.”
The premier’s delegation included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Fatemi.
In a statement posted on X, PM Shehbaz said that he was “delighted” to meet with Al-Nahyan, thanking him for the UAE’s “vital role in easing recent tensions” with India.
“We reaffirmed our shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” he said. “Our deep-rooted ties built on trust and brotherhood, continue to grow stronger, especially in trade and investment. “I look forward to welcoming His Highness to Pakistan soon.”
 






In February, PM Shehbaz was invited by the UAE to participate in the World Governments Summit (WGS) in Dubai, where he delivered a keynote address highlighting Pakistan’s vision for inclusive economic growth, digital transformation and governance reforms.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-06-12 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121959296c9b9ca.jpg?r=211931' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916747/mahrang-approaches-sc-against-bhcs-dismissal-of-constitutional-pleas-for-release' target='_blank'><strong>Mahrang approaches SC against BHC’s dismissal of constitutional pleas for release</strong></a><br><p>Rights activist Mahrang Baloch on Thursday moved the Supreme Court against the Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) May 22 order that dismissed constitutional petitions challenging her detention and that of two other Baloch leaders, more than two months after they were held under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO).
Mahrang, the chief of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), along with other activists of the group was arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang’s sister had challenged the detention in the BHC but the court had asked the petitioner to approach the home department for her release. The sister had subsequently filed constitutional petitions in the high court challenging the detentions but those were dismissed.
Mahrang’s petition, filed in the Supreme Court (SC) through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and lawyer Jibran Nasir, pleaded for the right to appeal against the May 22 order and requested the apex court to set aside the BHC judgment and allow the constitutional petitions.
Mahrang argued the BHC judgment was “without jurisdiction, illegal, and liable to be set aside”.
She said that the continued detention was “unjustified and disproportionate” as her name was already placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, subjecting her to stringent restrictions on movement, liberty, and livelihood and enabling the government to maintain oversight through measures including good behaviour bonds, movement restrictions, reporting requirements and asset inquiries.
“It is submitted that further preventive detention under the MPO, in addition to these restrictions, amounts to excessive and punitive control which fails the legal tests of legality, necessity, and proportionality,” the petition said, adding that she was entitled to be released from preventive custody so she may lawfully defend herself in pending cases and seek appropriate legal remedies.
The petitioner also argued that the impugned decision by the Balochistan government was “vitiated by a manifest misapplication of law and a complete failure to adhere to statutory procedure”.
She requested to be allowed to urge further grounds in addition to the above at the hearing of this appeal.
A day earlier, her sister urged the apex court to set aside the BHC’s April 15 order that rej­ected the plea against Mahrang’s detention under the MPO.
The petition alleged that her “repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons. It apprised the court that her father and brother were “subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.”
The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state have been named as res­pon­dents in the petition.
Along with the main appeal, a separate application was also filed before the Supreme Court, seeking suspension of the BHC order during the pendency of the present case.</p><small>2025-06-12 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1219581430744a4.jpg?r=200453' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916751/motorway-cop-allegedly-killed-by-wife-in-mardan-police' target='_blank'><strong>Motorway cop allegedly killed by wife in Mardan: police</strong></a><br><p>A woman on Thursday allegedly gunned down her husband, a motorway cop, in the Mian Khan area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district, according to police.
Mardan police spokesperson Faheem Khan told Dawn.com, “The suspect has been arrested and a first information report (FIR) has been registered at the Baizai police station.”
The FIR, registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and seen by Dawn.com, states that the complainant, the slain police official’s elder brother, alleged that he was asleep in his room when gunshots were heard in the house.
“When my wife and I went inside, we found my brother’s wife with a pistol in her hand, while he was lying in a pool of blood,” the complainant alleged, adding that the victim succumbed to his injuries while being transported to a hospital in Katlang.
“There have been domestic disputes between them since they got married and they used to fight regularly,” the complainant added in the FIR.
Incidents of homicides are frequently reported in various parts of the country. According to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), Punjab, KP, and Sindh are among the regions with a higher number of murder FIRs.
A day ago, Punjab police said they arrested a suspect in Okara for the alleged murder of his wife last month.
The FIR of the incident was registered at Okara’s Renala Khurd Saddar Police Station at the complaint of the woman’s father under Section 302 of the PPC on May 19. According to the FIR, the complainant found his daughter murdered with her throat slit when he reached his son-in-law’s home with the latter lying unconscious on the ground in an injured state as well.
Last month, a man and his two sons were shot dead in Mardan district, police and rescue officials said, adding that the five suspects had fled the scene.</p><small>2025-06-12 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12203111fe54059.jpg?r=203115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916752/harvey-weinstein-jury-resumes-deliberations-after-partial-conviction-infighting' target='_blank'><strong>Harvey Weinstein jury resumes deliberations after partial conviction, infighting</strong></a><br><p>Jurors will reconvene on Thursday in Harvey Weinsteins sex crimes retrial, a day after they handed down a partial conviction against the former movie mogul but hit an impasse on a rape count as deliberations spiralled into angry infighting.
Weinstein, once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, faced a retrial that began on April 23 after a state appeals court last year overturned his 2020 conviction.
He was accused by prosecutors in the case of raping an aspiring actress and assaulting two other women.
Weinstein, 73, pleaded not guilty and has denied assaulting anyone or having non-consensual sex.
The jury found Weinstein guilty on one of the three counts he faced, which stemmed from his alleged assault of former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The jury found Weinstein not guilty of a charge stemming from his alleged assault of Kaja Sokola in 2002 when she was a 16-year-old aspiring actress.
The jury has not yet reached a verdict on a third count, which charges him with raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.
In a startling development on Wednesday, the jury foreperson told presiding Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber that other members of the panel were shouting at him and threatening him for refusing to change his vote on the rape count.
Farber sent jurors home for the day to give them time to cool down and instructed the foreperson to arrive in court separately on Thursday.
Weinstein’s lawyers unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial, arguing that the breakdown in the jury room would taint any verdict.
Regardless of the eventual verdict on the rape charge, Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced. He has separately been sentenced to 16 years in prison following a rape conviction in California.
In closing arguments on June 3, the prosecution told the 12 jurors that the evidence showed how Weinstein used his power and influence to trap and abuse women.
The defence countered that the accusers lied on the witness stand out of spite after their consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer failed to result in Hollywood stardom.
A jury found Weinstein guilty in February 2020 of raping Mann and sexually assaulting Haley. Sokola’s allegation was not part of that case.
The conviction was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men.
But the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, threw out that conviction in April 2024. It said the trial judge erred by letting women testify that Weinstein had assaulted them, though their accusations were not the basis of the criminal charges.
Though the conviction was thrown out, Weinstein, who has had a litany of health problems in recent years and attended the retrial in a wheelchair, has remained behind bars because of his California conviction. He is appealing that verdict.
More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of misconduct.
He co-founded the Miramax studio, whose hit movies included such Academy Award winners as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Pulp Fiction.” Weinsteins own eponymous film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018, five months after sexual misconduct accusations against him became widely publicised.</p><small>2025-06-12 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12100527a3886fd.jpg?r=102308' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916697/us-to-pull-some-personnel-from-the-middle-east-amid-rising-tensions-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>US to pull some personnel from the Middle East amid rising tensions with Iran</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that US personnel were being moved out of the Middle East because “it could be a dangerous place”, adding that the United States would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.
Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that the US is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy and will allow military dependents to leave locations around the Middle East due to heightened security risks in the region, according to US and Iraqi sources.
The four US and two Iraqi sources did not say what security risks had prompted the decision, and reports of the potential evacuation pushed up oil prices by more than four per cent.
A US official said the State Department had authorised voluntary departures from Bahrain and Kuwait.
The State Department updated its worldwide travel advisory on Wednesday evening to reflect the latest US posture. “On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions,” the advisory said.
The decision by the US to evacuate some personnel comes at a volatile moment in the region. Trump’s efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran appear to be deadlocked, and US intelligence indicates that Israel has been making preparations for a strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
 
 

“They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters. “We’ve given notice to move out.”
Asked whether anything can be done to lower the temperature in the region, Trump said: “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple, they can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
Trump has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if stuttering talks over its nuclear programme fail. In an interview released earlier on Wednesday, Trump said that he was growing less confident that Tehran would agree to stop enriching uranium, a key American demand.
Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh also said yesterday that if Iran was subjected to strikes, it would retaliate by hitting US bases in the region.
The US embassy in Kuwait said in a statement that it had “not changed its staffing posture and remains fully operational.”
Military presence
The US has a military presence across the major oil-producing region, with bases in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
 
 

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorised the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a US official said. Another US official said that it was mostly relevant to family members located in Bahrain — where the bulk of them are based.
“The State Department is set to have an ordered departure for [the] US embassy in Baghdad. The intent is to do it through commercial means, but the US military is standing by if help is requested,” a third US official said.
Iraq’s state news agency cited a government source as saying Baghdad had not recorded any security indication that called for an evacuation.
Another US official said that there was no change in operations at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military base in the Middle East and that no evacuation order had been issued for employees or families linked to the US embassy in Qatar, which was operating as usual.
Tensions
Oil futures climbed $3 on reports of the Baghdad evacuation, with Brent crude futures at $69.18 a barrel.
Earlier on Wednesday, Britain’s maritime agency warned that increased tensions in the Middle East may lead to an escalation in military activity that could impact shipping in critical waterways. It advised vessels to use caution while travelling through the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz, which all border Iran.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation and would keep its embassy in Iraq under constant review following the US moves.
 
 

Iraq, a rare regional partner of both the US and its arch-regional foe Iran, hosts 2,500 US troops, although allegedly Tehran-backed armed factions are linked to its security forces.
Tensions inside Iraq have heightened since the start of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in October 2023, with armed groups in the country repeatedly attacking US troops, though attacks have subsided since last year.
Israel and Iran also twice exchanged fire last year — the first ever such direct attacks between the region’s most entrenched enemies — with missiles and war drones hurtling across Iraqi airspace.
Top US regional ally Israel has also struck targets across the region, including Iraqi armed groups operating both inside Iraq and in neighbouring Syria.
In recent months, the US has deployed more military assets in the Middle East, including B-2 bombers, which have since been replaced, and extended the deployment of a second aircraft carrier, which has since departed.
The next round of nuclear talks between Iran and the US is due in the coming days, with Iran expected to hand over a counterproposal after rejecting an offer by Washington.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters that a military threat had always been part of the US’s negotiation tactics with Iran.
“Any military action against Iran, whether by the US or Israel, will have serious consequences,” the official warned.
Iran’s UN mission yesterday posted on X: “Threats of ‘overwhelming force’ won’t change facts: Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon and US militarism only fuels instability.”
 






The statement appeared to be a response to an earlier comment by US Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, the head of US Central Command, that he had provided the president with “a wide range of options” to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.
Kurilla postponed testimony he was due to deliver before US lawmakers today because of tensions in the Middle East, two other US officials said.</p><small>2025-06-12 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12181458d761bde.jpg?r=185008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916743/pakistan-hits-rock-bottom-in-wefs-global-gender-gap-report-out-of-148-countries' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan hits rock bottom in WEF’s global gender gap report out of 148 countries</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan was bottom-ranked among 148 countries in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report 2025 — with 56.7 per cent gender parity — the highest since 2006, it emerged on Thursday.
The annual report benchmarked the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.
In the latest report, Pakistan has been ranked below Sudan, (57pc, 147th), Chad (57.1pc, 146th), Iran (58.3pc,145th), Guinea (59.5pc, 144th), Democratic Republic of the Congo (60.1pc, 143rd), Niger (61.3pc,142nd), Algeria (61.4pc, 141st), and Mali (61.7pc, 140th).
Occupying the bottom rank of the index, Pakistan saw its overall parity score decline from last year’s edition, from 57pc to 56.7pc, the report said. Overall Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006.
However, this year’s results were a second consecutive drop from the economy’s best score of 57.7pc, achieved in 2023. Pakistan’s parity in economic participation and opportunity has declined by 1.3 percentage points, the report said.
While economic representation indicators have remained unchanged, income disparity in Pakistan has slightly increased since the last edition (0.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (4 percentage points).
The sole sub-index advance registered by Pakistan in this year’s edition was “Educational Attainment”, bumping educational parity upwards by 1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1pc.
The shift was partly driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5pc to 48.5pc). However, parity has also risen because male enrolment shares have dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering educational reach overall.
The report said Pakistan’s economy had seen political parity drop from 12.2pc in 2024 to 11pc in 2025.
While parity in parliament increased by 1.2 percentage points, women’s ministerial representation dropped from 5.9pc in 2024 to zero in 2025 and with it the overall sub-index score, the report added.
Pakistan was listed among countries including Azerbaijan, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and Vanuatu that have all-male ministerial cabinets.
Commenting on the 2025 edition of the report, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, Saadia Zahidi, said the report “arrives at a decisive moment, with the world in flux as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflict and economic uncertainty are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities.
“Amid such change, gender parity is both a principle and a strategy,’’ she said, adding that “economies that tap into the full spectrum of their talent and human capital are best positioned to navigate an era of transformation and accelerate productivity and prosperity.”
Zahidi said most economies were not fully leveraging this pathway for growth.
 






The report found that there was still a combined global average gender gap of over 30pc across four areas: economic participation and opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment and health and survival, she added.
The global gender gap score in 2025 for all 148 economies included in this edition of the index stands at 68.8pc. The global gender gap closed by 0.3 percentage points in 2025, from 68.4pc in 2024 to 68.8pct in 2025.
Based on the collective speed of progress of those 100 economies, it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally, the report said.
The 2025 Global Gender Gap Index shows that no economy has yet achieved full gender parity. Iceland (92.6pc) continues to lead the Global Gender Gap Index, holding the top position for 16 consecutive years, and remains the only economy to have closed more than 90pc of its gender gap since 2022.
Each of the top 10 ranked economies have closed at least 80pc of their gender gaps, the only economies to do so. Globally, gender parity has increased by 4.8 percentage points since 2006.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121838200486122.jpg?r=184116' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916746/trump-says-los-angeles-safe-and-sound-for-two-nights-after-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Los Angeles ‘safe and sound’ for two nights after protests</strong></a><br><p>Los Angeles was “safe and sound for the last two nights”, United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday morning, as he hailed troops for helping to restore order in the city after days of anti-deportation protests.
“Our great National Guard, with a little help from the Marines, put the LA Police in a position to effectively do their job,” Trump said on Truth Social, adding that without the military, the city “would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years”.
The mostly peaceful protests ignited last week over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants in the country illegally. But there were also pockets of violence, including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police.
Trump deployed several thousand National Guard troops and some 700 active-duty Marines over the objections of Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom, the first such action by a US president in decades.
In his post, Trump said Newsom “had totally lost control of the situation”.
“He should be saying thank you … instead of trying to justify his mistakes and incompetence!!!” the president added.
Similar protests also ignited in other cities across the United States, as California prepared on Thursday for a legal showdown over Trump’s deployment of the military.
A second night of curfew was in place as city leaders tried to get a handle on the after-dark vandalism and looting that scarred a few city blocks in the 1,300 square kilometres metropolis.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12181446fdc6e93.jpg?r=181544' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916741/egypt-detains-over-200-pro-palestinian-activists-ahead-of-gaza-march-organisers' target='_blank'><strong>Egypt detains over 200 pro-Palestinian activists ahead of Gaza march: organisers</strong></a><br><p>Egyptian authorities have detained more than 200 pro-Palestinian activists in Cairo ahead of an international march with the stated aim of breaking Israel’s blockade on Gaza, organisers said Thursday.
As part of the Global March to Gaza, thousands of activists planned to travel to Egypt’s Rafah border crossing with the Palestinian territory on Friday to demand the entry of humanitarian aid.
On Thursday, the march’s spokesperson Saif Abukeshek told AFP: “Over 200 participants were detained at Cairo airport or questioned at hotels across Cairo.” He added that those detained included nationals from the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Morocco, and Algeria.
Abukeshek said that plainclothes police entered hotels in Cairo on Wednesday with lists of names, questioned activists and in some cases confiscated mobile phones and searched personal belongings.
“After interrogations, some were arrested and others were released,” he added.
 
 

At Cairo airport, some detainees were held for long hours without explanation, Abukeshek said, adding that others were deported, without specifying exact numbers.
Twenty French activists who had planned to join the march were held at Cairo airport “for 18 hours”, he said. “What happened was completely unexpected,” Abukeshek said.
Footage shared with AFP showed dozens of people with their luggage crammed inside a holding room at the airport.
“We’re locked up here in this room with so many people — some 30-40 people,” a German national said in one video. “I called the embassy and they told me their people are trying to figure things out,” she said.
The Greek contingent said in a statement that dozens of Greek nationals were among those held at Cairo airport “despite having all legal travel documents, having broken no law and followed every legal procedure in entering the country”.
Cairo’s security chief did not respond to an AFP request for comment.
Pressure
After 21 months of conflict, Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, which the United Nations has dubbed “the hungriest place on Earth”.
 
 

Another convoy dubbed Soumoud, or steadfastness in Arabic, left the Tunisian capital on Monday, hoping to pass through divided Libya and Egypt — which organisers say has yet to provide passage permits — to reach Gaza.
The Global March to Gaza, which is coordinating with Soumoud, said around 4,000 participants from more than 40 countries would take part in the event, with many having already arrived ahead of the Friday march.
According to the plan, participants are set to travel by bus to the city of El-Arish in the heavily securitised Sinai Peninsula before walking 50 kilometres (30 miles) towards the border with Gaza.
They would then camp there before returning to Cairo on June 19.
Israel has called on Egyptian authorities “to prevent the arrival of jihadist protesters at the Egypt-Israel border”.
Such actions “would endanger the safety of (Israeli) soldiers and will not be allowed”, Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
In response, Egypt’s foreign ministry said that while it backs efforts to put “pressure on Israel”, any foreign delegations visiting the border area must receive approval through official channels.
“We will continue despite what happened because the current numbers in Egypt and those expected to arrive are enough to organise this march,” Abukeshek said.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12163502b3e71aa.jpg?r=170022' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916738/islamabad-high-court-restrains-fia-from-harassing-ex-senator-farhatullah-babar' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad High Court restrains FIA from ‘harassing’ ex-senator Farhatullah Babar</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court on Thursday restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from “harassing” former senator and prominent human rights defender Farhatullah Babar.
FIA Anti-Corruption Circle (ACC) opened an inquiry against Babar in March over alleged “corruption, tax evasion and illicit asset accumulation”. Babar appeared before the FIA in Islamabad on March 28 to respond to the notice over a complaint filed by a citizen named Touseef Abbas in Rawalpindi.
The senator, who is the head of PPP’s Human Rights Cell, filed a writ petition through lawyers Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha with the Ministry of Interior and FIA as respondents, urging the court to quash an anti-corruption inquiry filed against him and restrain the agency from harassing or arresting him.
Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the case today on a petition filed by Babar under Article 199 of the Constitution, one that grants high courts the power to issue writs to enforce fundament rights.
The petitioner’s counsel told the court that Babar was being repeatedly issued “vague, illegal notices and summons.” The lawyer told the court that the FIA’s inquiry was initiated on March 25 on the complaint of a citizen whom the petitioner does not know, accusing him of suspected corruption, tax evasion, and acquiring illegal assets.
The former playmaker appeared before the FIA on March 28, but was not provided with a copy of the complaint, the lawyer said. “On April 11, 2025, he was sent a detailed questionnaire consisting of 12 questions via WhatsApp, and asked to submit the answers by April 7, 2025 (after the deadline),” the lawyer added.
The court adjourned the hearing until the last week of June and “restrained the FIA from harassing Babar.” The court also issued notice to the FIA and other respondents and asked them to submit their replies.
Writ petition
Babar had filed a writ petition in the IHC alleging that the FIA’s conduct was “unlawful, illegal, arbitrary, and mala fide”. The petition called the anti-corruption inquiry against him a baseless “fishing expedition” designed to harass a critic of state institutions.
Babar claimed he received no details of allegations, complaint copies, or legal basis for the probe despite repeated requests. He said the first notice of March 27, 2025, demanded his appearance within 24 hours without specifying charges, and a 12-point questionnaire dated March 28 was sent via WhatsApp on April 11 with the deadline four days earlier.
Babar asserts the FIA’s actions target his human rights advocacy, highlighting his decades-long advocacy, including efforts to regulate intelligence agencies. The petition requested the court to quash the inquiry and all related notices and sought direction from FIA to disclose allegations, documents, and legal basis for the probe.
Babar — a three-term senator, Hilal-i-Imtiaz recipient, and council member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) — last held office in 2013 and served as spokesperson to President Asif Ali Zardari.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121744423e11a8e.jpg?r=174510' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916729/president-pm-call-for-joint-efforts-from-employers-parents-to-end-child-labour-exploitation' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM call for joint efforts from employers, parents to end child labour, exploitation</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday urged parents and employers to make joint efforts to eliminate child labour, as the country observed World Day Against Child Labour.
Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are involved in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement (CRM) National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employed a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation (ILO). According to a provincial survey, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population.
According to a statement from the President’s House, President Zardari, in his message, called for efforts to protect children from exploitation, expressing hope for a future where children could “learn, play, and grow in a safe and dignified environment”.
Stressing the need for collective action by governments, the president urged employers to “strictly follow child labour laws and ensure that their workplaces are free from exploitation.”
He also called on parents and guardians to prioritise their children’s education over “short-term gains”.
“I urge schools and teachers to identify children at risk of dropping out and keep them in classrooms,” he was quoted as saying in his message.
Detailing Pakistan’s efforts towards ending child labour, he added: “Pakistan has enacted the National Commission on Rights of Child Act (2017), the ICT Child Protection Act (2018), the Juvenile Justice System Act (2018), the Employment of Children’s Act (1991), and the Domestic Workers Act (2002).”
“Pakistan has also established effective mechanisms and service units for the prevention of child exploitation, child labour, and providing care and rehabilitation to the affected children.
“Pakistan, as a signatory to various international conventions aimed at eliminating child labour, is fully committed to ending the exploitation of children.”
He called on the media to raise awareness on the matter of child labour and appealed to philanthropists to “support vulnerable families so that no child is forced into Labour due to poverty.”
He further urged the international community to “pay urgent attention to the children in Gaza”.
“Thousands of innocent children in these areas have been displaced, injured, or orphaned due to violence and aggression by the occupation forces,” he stated.
Noting that children in such vulnerable states were at a heightened risk of being pushed into child labour, he emphasised the need for “immediate global support, protection, and justice.”
“Together, we can dismantle the systems that exploit children and create a Pakistan and a world where every child is free to dream, learn, and build a brighter future.”
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz, while reaffirming the government’s commitment to ending child labour, highlighted the role of “the federal and provincial governments, the private sector, educational institutions, media, and civil society” in preventing child labour, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
“Children subjected to child labour not only face sexual and psychological abuse but they are also deprived of their fundamental right to education. They are robbed of their childhood,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also noted that children from “developing countries are the most affected by the scourge of child labour.”
“Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community in its fight against child labour,” he added.
He said that this year’s theme, “Progress is clear, but there’s more to do: let’s speed up efforts!” highlights that while progress has been made, much more remains to be done.
“On this occasion, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF are launching the 2025 Global Estimates and Trends Report on Child Labour, which will help assess the effectiveness of the steps taken so far,” the PM’s statement read.
Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to ILO conventions on child labour, he noted that Article 11 of the Constitution of Pakistan prohibits all forms of forced labour and child labour.
Appealing to all stakeholders to help the government in its effort to promote education, he pointed out the Danish School system as an initiative by the government to provide access to quality education to underprivileged children.
Pakistan’s last Child Labour Survey, conducted in 1996, determined that agriculture involved the greatest proportion of children engaged in child labour (66pc), followed by manufacturing (11pc), hotels and restaurants (9pc), domestic work, social and personal services (8pc), transport (4pc) and construction (2pc), as per an ILO report.
Every year on June 12, the ILO, along with its constituents and partners around the world, commemorates the World Day Against Child Labour. This year’s theme reflects both the progress achieved and the urgency to intensify action to meet global targets.
The 2025 World Day focuses on a key milestone: the release of the 2025 global estimates and trends of child labour. This ILO and UNICEF joint report will provide a comprehensive overview of where we stand in our global commitments to eliminate child labour.
Although the detailed data are not yet available, the estimates and trends identified will guide policy debates and calls for renewed commitment and investment.</p><small>2025-06-12 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121352074606083.jpg?r=135411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916710/dacoit-with-extensive-criminal-record-arrested-in-punjabs-lodhran-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dacoit with extensive criminal record arrested in Punjab’s Lodhran: police</strong></a><br><p>Police arrested a suspect with an extensive criminal record in Punjab’s Lodhran district, while two other suspected dacoits escaped during an exchange of fire, police officials said on Thursday.
A first information report (FIR) was filed against the suspect at the City Kahror Pakka Police Station on the behalf of the state under sections 324 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for “deliberately attacking police officers with the intention to kill and assisting his accomplices escape”.
The suspect was arrested in an injured condition by the Crime Control Department (CCD), the FIR said. It added that the police team was present at Allah Warai chowk when they received a tip-off that three armed persons were present at Khudai Phatak area.
“Police immediately formed teams and conducted a raid, when the suspects suddenly opened direct fire on the CCD team,” the complaint said.
“The suspects ran towards the railway track as police resorted to aerial firing and chased the suspects,” the FIR added. “Suddenly, two suspects managed to escape on a motorcycle while taking advantage of the darkness of the night.”
Police searched the area and found one of the suspects in an “injured condition”, the FIR further said. The suspect was wounded during an exchange of fire with his accomplices, it stated.
The suspect identified himself as Gul Sher, a resident of Bahawalpur’s Karpal district, while one pistol and 30-bore ammunition were recovered from his possession.
According to a police statement, efforts were being made to arrest the escaped suspects.
It added the suspect had an “extensive criminal record comprising 15 cases related to murder, attempt to murder, resisting a public servant, and robbery”. The cases had been registered against him in different police stations.
The police record showed the suspect was also a “proclaimed offender”, according to a case registered at the Musafir Khana Police Station Bahawalpur on charges of murder, attempt to murder and resisting a government servant.
In another similar incident, a criminal was arrested in an injured condition following an exchange of fire between police and his accomplices, police said.
They added the suspect, Imran alias Imran Khoja, also had an extensive criminal record and had been previously nominated in 30 cases, including armed robbery.
A case was registered against him at the CCD Lodhran police station under Section 324, 353 186 and 34 of the penal code on the complaint of the state, stating that a police team was present at the Jind Pir bridge when they received a tip-off that two suspects, including Imran, were spotted at Aibak Mor.
Police conducted a raid to arrest them when “three suspects opened direct fire upon seeing the police vehicle,” the FIR said.
The police responded by firing shots as the suspects managed run towards the crop fields, it said.
“The exchange of gunfire continued as police searched the fields using a torch and found one of the suspect in an injured condition,” it added.
The complaint said the suspect was “injured after being shot by his accomplices during the exchange of fire.” He identified himself as Imran, while one pistol and 30-bore ammunition were recovered from his possession.
Police said two suspects escaped taking advantage of the darkness of the night and are being perused while police have blocked the exit routes.</p><small>2025-06-12 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12124951d7179e2.jpg?r=130415' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916725/trump-unveils-website-for-5m-us-residency-visa' target='_blank'><strong>Trump unveils website for $5m US residency visa</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump touted a new website for his planned $5 million US residency permit on Wednesday, saying the waiting list for the golden visa has opened on TrumpCard.gov.

Trump unveiled the first such visa aboard Air Force One in April, holding a golden prototype that bore his face and promising the special permit would probably be available “in less than two weeks.”
The visas are not available yet, but the website announced on Wednesday allows interested parties to submit their name, desired visa and email address under a header that says “The Trump Card is Coming.”
Trump previously said the new visa, a high-priced version of the traditional green card, would bring in job creators and could be used to reduce the US national deficit.
The announcement comes as deportation raids are being ramped up across the country, prompting protests, and as Trump’s administration faces ongoing lawsuits and accusations of rights violations over its anti-immigration blitz.
Trump has said the new card would be a route to highly prized US citizenship. He said in February that his administration hoped to sell “maybe a million” of the cards and did not rule out that Russian oligarchs may be eligible.</p><small>2025-06-12 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12102354fb044c2.jpg?r=102609' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916618/karachis-k-iv-water-project-pushed-back-10-years-or-more-by-paltry-budget-allocation' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s K-IV water project pushed back 10 years or more by ‘paltry’ budget allocation</strong></a><br><p>• Centre sets aside Rs3.2bn in budget for FY26 against requirement of Rs40bn for completion of water supply scheme
• JI says federal govt has ‘literally shelved’ the project
• Sharjeel expresses concerns over earmarking of ‘inadequate’ funds
KARACHI: Lingering for over two decades, the much-delayed K-IV water project now faces another major setback as the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion in the budget against the required amount of Rs40bn for the scheme, sparking fears that the city may have to wait for “another 10 years” or more for the completion of the plan.
Officials associated with the project, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have expressed deep frustration over the paltry allocation, warning that the funding shortfall has derailed any realistic timeline set for the project’s completion.
“Over 63 per cent of the work is already done, and with proper funding, we were confident of wrapping it up within a year,” said one senior official. “But with just Rs3.2bn, we are now staring at a scenario where it could take another 10 years to complete. This delay is devastating for a city already facing an acute water shortage.”
Now, with that timeline missed and funds inadequate for the current fiscal year, experts and stakeholders fear that the K-IV would be held in limbo for years to come.
For a city of over 20 million, already grappling with severe water shortages and infrastructure failures, the delay has real and immediate consequences.
 
 

“Karachi can’t wait another decade,” warned one project insider. “This isn’t just a budget line — this is about water, survival, and dignity for millions.”
The K-IV project, originally launched in the early 2000s to address Karachi’s chronic water supply problems, has witnessed multiple revisions, cost escalations, and bureaucratic hurdles. Despite renewed federal attention in recent years, the latest budget allocation has cast dark shadow on its future.
Adding weight to the criticism, former federal minister for planning, development, reforms and special initiatives Asad Umar — who oversaw the K-IV project during the PTI government from 2018 to 2022 — said the current allocation shows the government lacks commitment.
“The Rs3.2bn allocation suggests the government isn’t serious about building the project,” he said. “It’s merely a political statement, not a development commitment. There was a real momentum. We had a vision and a timeline. This setback is unfortunate.”
It was Mr Umar who had pushed the K-IV forward during his tenure, recommending to the then prime minister Imran Khan that the federal government take over the full funding of the project, eliminating the previous cost-sharing arrangement with the Sindh government.
Under his supervision, the planning ministry had tasked Wapda with completing the project and assigned August 14, 2023, as the proposed inauguration date.
PPP, JI express concerns
Islamabad’s latest move has also triggered a kind of rift between two key federal allies — the PML-N and the PPP.
The Sindh government of PPP has expressed strong reservations over the “inadequate allocation” in the federal budget, saying it is taking the matter very seriously and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.
“We have serious concerns not only about this project but also the K-4 initiative,” said Sindh Information and Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon. “The funds allocated are highly inadequate. The Pakistan Peoples Party is taking these issues seriously and will thoroughly review the budget.”
He stressed the need for fiscal discipline and smarter resource management at the federal level.
“We’ve submitted formal proposals to the prime minister and urged the federal government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures,” he said. “If revenue is not increasing, it becomes essential to control expenditures. All spending must be managed wisely; otherwise, we’re putting our entire fiscal policy at risk.”
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Monem Zafar echoed similar frustrations during a press conference.
“Against the backdrop of the severe water crisis in Karachi, the K-IV project became the most important plan for the city’s future,” he said. “But it seems the federal government has literally shelved it.”
He referred to the “disparity” in funding priorities.
“Some Rs133 billion was allocated to the Water Resources Division, yet only Rs3.2 billion was earmarked for the K-IV. That’s just 2.5 per cent of the division’s total budget. This clearly shows that those in the corridors of power don’t want to grant Karachi and Karachiites more than a symbolic fraction — no more than Zakat or alms,” said the JI leader.

This assurance was given by Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education Uzma Yousuf to the subcommittee of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Education, which met at the education ministry with MNA Sabheen Ghoury in the chair. She said everything will be clearer during the inquiry.
On the other hand, during the meeting, MNA Mohammad Ali Sarfraz, who attended the meeting as special invitee, pointed out that several papers were leaked. He also presented paper codes and video evidence to the subcommittee. The committee also stated that in case papers are leaked, the committee will ensure no loss to students, and if paper/s are retaken, they should be retaken immediately so that students can get their results in August this year.
The committee also decided to hear school heads, who, besides British Council, also conduct O/A level exams, in the next meeting.

Subcommittee to probe cost, frequency of CAIE exams held in Pakistan

Recently, the subcommittee was formed to look into the issues relating to A level papers leaked in examinations conducted by Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) in Pakistan during 2025.
The subcommittee is also supposed to look into the authority and legal cover under which CAIE is conducting examinations in Pakistan, the number of examinations per year, the number of students per year, and cost of each examination. Whereas, it will also look at any remedies and measures taken by CAIE in the past on such incidents of leakage of question papers.
The terms of reference of the subcommittee stated that after hearing all sides, actions will be finalised to safeguard students and get assurance from the CAIE that befitting measures will be taken to compensate students and avert such incidents in future.
“Since today was the first meeting, we got an important briefing, in the next meeting, the CAIE will provide findings of its inquiry report,” said a participant of the meeting.
It is relevant to note here that the main committee, which formed the said sub-committee, in its last meeting had raised alarm over the alleged leaking of Cambridge University’s Advanced Level (A-Level) examination papers in Pakistan, stating that the issue of leaked paper has put the academic future of bright students in jeopardy.
 
 

Headed by MNA Dr Azimuddin Zahid Lakhvi, the main committee had shown its grave concerns over report of leaked papers. The committee had pointed out an alleged incident of leaked paper had raised questions on the integrity of the examination process of Cambridge University in Pakistan. The committee had urged relevant authorities to address these critical concerns promptly.
Whereas, recently, a press release shared by the Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education with Dawn stated: “We are aware of alleged leaks of specific exam questions and we fully understand the concerns and frustration these claims cause students and their families. We would like to reassure you that our legal compliance teams will urgently investigate all evidence thoroughly so that results are fair.”
It also claimed, “We have seen a significant amount of fake information, including scam circulation on social media, and we don’t comment on specific allegations during exam series, we don’t want to distract students at an important time.”

• Political leadership and intel agencies’ help enlisted to ensure compliance, root out corruption
KARACHI: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial on Wednesday detailed a sweeping overhaul of the country’s tax compliance system, vowing to crack down on non-compliant sectors, expand digital monitoring, and address longstanding loopholes in the tobacco, retail and passive income tax regimes.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Lan­g­rial said that the government’s re­­cent enforcement drive in the sugar sector had resulted in a 39 per cent increase in tax collection without any change in tax rates, and that si­­milar measures are now being rol­led out across other key industries.
“The story of non-compliance in the tobacco sector will fundamentally change, just as it did in sugar,” he said.
 


He acknowledged that raising tax rates on the formal sector often led to market erosion by the informal sector, but said the government’s solution is to target non-compliant businesses directly.
“Sugar mills that were non-compliant have gone out of business due to our monitoring. We are now achieving almost 100 per cent compliance in most parts of the country,” Mr Langrial said.
He also revealed that the Intelligence Bureau was tasked with monitoring FBR teams to prevent collusion and corruption. “Thanks to the IB, we took several actions against black sheep within our own ranks,” he said.
Mr Langrial said similar monitoring has begun in the poultry sector, where initial checks revealed significant under-reporting of production and tax evasion. “One month of monitoring revealed millions of rupees in income tax evasion,” he said.
 
 

On the issue of passive income, Mr Langrial said a new 15pc tax rate on passive income, compared to 29pc on active income, in an effort to address the bias against business investment and encourage investment.
Mr Langrial also addressed comparisons between the salaried and construction sectors, noting that such comparisons are misleading.
“There exists a salaried sector inside construction, and sectors can’t be compared with types of income,” he said, emphasising the complexity of tax policy across different industries.
“We are saying that a person who has Rs50 million in the bank will be taxed at 15pc. This is an attempt to address the discrimination between active and passive income,” he said.

The PAC meeting, headed by its Chairman Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, directed the provincial labour department and Sindh Employees’ Social Security Institution (SESSI) to ensure the strict implementation of the officially notified minimum wage of Rs37,000 to workers in all industrial units across the province.
While reviewing the audit reports of the SESSI for the years 2018 and 2019, the PAC chair­man said that non-implementation of mon­thly minimum wages in 80 per cent of private industrial units was a violation of labour laws.
He directed the SESSI and the labour department to strictly implement the policy of providing the minimum monthly wage to all workers across the province.

Committee asks labour secretary to investigate payment of Rs50m on alleged fake bills; orders audit of annual procurement of Rs9bn medicines for SESSI hospitals, dispensaries

SESSI Commissioner Miandad Rahujo told the PAC that out of 67,000 industrial units, 24,000 units were registered with the organisation. He said that 6,000 units were closed, while 18,000 industrial units were functional and over 800,000 workers of the registered units had been registered with the SESSI.
He shared that many industrial units had implemented the official minimum monthly salary to their workers, but the private security guards of private security agencies were not being paid the officially notified salary.
When asked by the PAC chairman, the SESSI commissioner said that several SESSI employees with fake degrees had been dismissed from their jobs. There were around 4,200 employees in the SESSI and their attendance was checked digitally, he added.
It was also revealed in the meeting that bogus payments of Rs50 million were made through fake bills for the repair work of SESSI institutions.
Taking notice of financial irregularities in the SESSI, the PAC directed the labour secretary to investigate the issue of the bogus payments and submit a report.
The PAC also ordered an audit of the annual procurement of medicines worth Rs9 billion for seven hospitals and 42 dispensaries of the provincial labour department.
The order was given following complaints of irregularities worth billions of rupees in the procurement of substandard medicines and machinery for the hospitals and dispensaries of the labour department.
To a question, the SESSI commissioner informed the PAC that seven hospitals and 42 dispensaries were functioning under the SESSI across the province where industrial workers were provided with health facilities.
He said that out of a fund of Rs13bn, 70pc or Rs9bn was being spent annually on purchasing medicines and healthcare services for the SESSI hospitals and dispensaries.
The SESSI commissioner added that 70pc of medicines for SESSI hospital and dispensaries were being purchased through tenders and 30pc are purchased by SESSI directors at the local level where there were problems in purchase.
He said that hospital management committees had been formed to run SESSI hospitals, while the SESSI governing body had approved a Rs1.4bn project for the infrastructure and building of Valika Hospital, the work on which would start within a year.

• Income tax rate of first slab reduced to 2.5pc, not 1pc as initially printed in Finance Bill
• Change offsets additional fiscal impact from increased govt salaries
• Aurangzeb defends steep pay hikes for lawmakers, ministers
• Says govt held back on raising minimum wage as industry unwilling to implement previous rate
• Contributory pension scheme for forces personnel may face delays
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday repeatedly warned that the government would be compelled to impose a further Rs400 to 500 billion in taxes if parliamentarians failed to approve the sweeping enforcement measures proposed in the 2025-26 budget — as they were already cleared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“I now request my colleagues in both houses of parliament to get the enabling clauses for enforcement measures passed, otherwise we would have to take Rs400-500bn additional tax measures,” the usually soft-spoken minister said at his post-budget press conference, hinting at potential resistance within the ruling party, coalition partners and other pressure groups.
While Mr Aurangzeb did not name specific provisions, he was apparently referring to expanded enforcement powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). These include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector.
At a recent special meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue raised objections to some of those measures introduced through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 last month and hinted at tight scrutiny in due course. “Legal backing will be critical to institutionalise compliance and sustaining revenue growth,” the finance minister asserted.
Mr Aurangzeb explained that of the Rs700bn additional revenues envisaged for the next fiscal year — on top of an estimated 12 per cent organic growth in taxes driven by inflation and economic activity — about Rs389bn is tied to enforcement measures, while Rs312bn stems from additional tax measures.
“These numbers are locked with the IMF,” Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said, adding that the federal cabinet’s decision to increase government workers’ salaries by 10pc — up from the originally proposed 6pc — will have an additional fiscal impact of roughly Rs28bn.
He was responding to a question abo­ut whether talks with the Fund were com­plete or changes would ensue bet­ween the budget presented before and to be subsequently passed by parliament.
Both the finance minister and the finance secretary indicated that this additional fiscal impact was filled with a change in income tax rates for the salaried class. The first income tax slab — people earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million per year — was reduced from 5pc to 2.5pc, as announced by the finance minister in his budget speech, instead of the 1pc earlier envisaged (and printed in the Finance Bill).
Responding to a question, Mr Auran­gzeb said that, given Pakistan’s history, int­ernational stakeholders had also dou­bted the country’s ability to enforce tax laws effectively and insisted on results.
During the current year, “we have demonstrated practically that we can deliver”, with Rs400bn recoveries through enforcement. “We now have the trust and credibility,” the minister said, reiterating the need for legal provisions to continue enforc­e­ment or risk Rs400bn of more taxes.
Journalist walkout
The presser was marred by a walkout from journalists over the cancellation of a traditional technical briefing on the Finance Bill.

The protest turned into a full-blown boycott following a decision by officials to continue the live event in the presence of their own people alone. Information Minister Atta­u­llah Tarar, who was not in attendance, had to rush to the scene to acknowledge journalists’ grievances and convince them to return to the presser.
Mr Aurangzeb also defended sharp increases, some of them as large as 550pc, in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament and ministers.
He insisted the hikes sh­­ould be seen in the context that the salaries of the mi­­nisters had last been adju­s­ted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wa­­­ges of employees in pu­­blic and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors. “Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump.”
At the same time, the finance secretary indicated delays in the implementation of a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel with effect from July 1, 2025, as announced by the finance minister last year.
Mr Bosal said the contributory scheme for military employees was not an easy job and consultations had been taking place with the Ministry of Defence.
Both the minister and the secretary parried questions about the size of salary increases and special allowance for armed forces personnel annou­nced in the budget speech.
They also did not respond to repeated questions regarding the justification and increase in allocation of funds for parliamentarians’ schemes to Rs70bn, instead of the Rs50bn approved by the Annual Plan Coordination Committee.
 
 

The minister conceded the relief in tax rates for the salaried class, corporates and other sectors was minor but insisted it should be seen in the “direction of travel” that the government would keep on following as more fiscal space became available.
He insisted that the government showed acknowledgement that certain sections of society are overburdened. “This is a signal from the government to start moving in the right direction,” he said.
Responding to a question, Mr Aurangzeb said the federal government had called provincial nominations for the new National Finance Comm­ission, as the prime minister had already announced to call its meeting in August. He rejected the impression that the Centre could unilaterally delink population from resource distribution.
When questioned about the proposed debt servicing surcharge (DSS) on electricity, the finance minister did not recall he had announced any such thing in his budget speech.
However, in his budget speech, he had said the DSS would be used not only for servicing interest but also for repaying principal debt. He also proposed amendments to the Nepra Act to allow the federal government to raise the DSS beyond the current 10pc ceiling on a case-by-case basis.
Minimum wage
Asked why the government did not announce a minimum wage, the minister said the industry, in particular, and the private sector, in general, were not willing to pay even the previous minimum wage announced by the government.
He said Pakistan’s two international bonds are due for repayment in September and in April 2026, and the government was in a good position for their repayment.
Additionally, he ann­oun­ced plans to issue Panda bonds later this year to access China’s capital markets for diversification. The government also hopes to return to the US and European markets in 2026, contingent on improved credit ratings.
The minister stated that the government had eliminated additional customs duties on 4,000 tariff lines out of a total of 7,000 and reduced duties on an additional 2,700 lines as part of structural reforms aim­ed at aligning Pakis­tan’s trade and industrial policy with global standards.
These steps are part of a phased reform plan to simplify Pakistan’s tariff reg­i­me, aiming for an average rate of just over 4pc.
“Of these, around 2,000 tariff lines are directly linked to raw materials and intermediary goods used by the exporters,” he said. “This is the structural reform not taken in the past 30 years. This is a huge step, and we are committed to taking it forward gradually.”
Breathe Pakistan
The finance minister also expressed his gratitude to DawnMedia for its climate change initiative, Breathe Pakistan.
“I am very thankful to Dawn Group for the initiative it has taken on climate cha­n­­ge,” he said. “I have repeatedly said this (climate cha­nge) is an existential threat to Pakistan. Through Breathe Paki­st­an, you have taken it forward, and I commend you, your institution and your sponsors for highlighting this issue and its importance.”
He added, “It’s no longer just about the floods of 2022 — those of us living in Islamabad now experience windstorms and hailstorm every week. This never happened before. We are living climate change day in and day out. I want to sincerely thank your institution for leading the charge under Breathe Pakistan.”

• US president warns protests at army parade will be met with force
LOS ANGELES: Protests against Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policies spread on Wednesday across the United States despite a military-backed crackdown in Los Angeles and a threat by the Republican president to use “heavy force.”
In Los Angeles, where the unrest began last Friday, the downtown area was calm but tense after an overnight curfew saw police make 25 arrests.
Heavily armed officers patrolled near government buildings, and storekeepers boarded up windows to protect against vandalism.
US Marines — ordered by Trump to deploy in addition to more than 4,000 National Guard soldiers — were expected to make their first appearance on the streets on Wednesday.
“US military troops deployed to Los Angeles are allowed to temporarily detain individuals until law enforcement agents arrive to arrest them,” a senior US military official said.  The mostly peaceful protests ignited over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants who were in the country illegally.
 
 

Pockets of violence — including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police — triggered a massive response from authorities using tear gas and other non-lethal weapons.
Trump won the election last year partly on promises to combat what he claims is an “invasion” by undocumented migrants.
He is now seizing the opportunity to make political capital, ordering the California National Guard to deploy despite Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections, the first time a US president has taken such action in decades.
Trump then tested the constitutional limits of his power even further by ordering about 700 Marines — a force designed primarily for combat in foreign wars — to the scene.
“If our troops didn’t go into Los Angeles, it would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump insisted on social media Wednesday.
But in a televised address late on Tuesday, Newsom said “democracy is under assault right before our eyes.” “California may be first, but it clearly won’t end here,” the Democrat said.
Trump has expressed support for a call by one of his top officials to arrest Newsom, who is seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, when Trump will be required by the constitution to step down.
 
 

Despite Trump’s threats to deploy the National Guard to other Democratic-run states over the objections of governors, protesters appear undeterred.
Thousands marched in New York and Chicago late on Tuesday.
Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he was deploying the state’s National Guard to counter a protest announced for San Antonio on Wednesday.
Demonstrations were also planned on Wednesday in New York, Seattle and Las Vegas ahead of what organisers say will be a nationwide “No Kings” movement on Saturday, when Trump will attend a highly unusual military parade in the US capital.
In a speech at an army base on Tuesday, Trump warned that any protests during the Washington parade would face “very heavy force.”
The parade, featuring warplanes and tanks, has been organised to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army but also happens to be the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.

• Hospitals across Punjab receive scores of heatstroke patients
• Authorities ask people to remain indoors, stay hydrated
• Met Office expects hot spell to continue for 48-72 hours
LAHORE: Amid no let-up in extreme heat that has engulfed Pakistan since last week, almost all cities in Punjab reported temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius, with Bhakkar and Sindh’s Jacobabad topping the charts with 49°C.
The intense weather is expected to continue today as well, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. “Mainly hot and dry weather is expected in most parts of the country, while very hot in plain areas,” it said in a statement posted on its website.
“However, dust-raising/gusty winds are likely in plain areas during the afternoon. Partly cloudy weather with isolated rain-wind/thunderstorm is likely in upper Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Potohar region, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan during the evening/night,” it added.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported extreme conditions across Punjab, including Sargodha City at 47.8°C, Gujranwala and Hafizabad at 47.5°C, and Lahore at 46.2°C. Only the hill station of Murree offered some respite with a relatively cooler temperature of 32°C.
Like Punjab, the rest of the country sizzled as well, bringing life to a standstill. In Sindh, Jacobabad reported 49 and Mohenjo-Daro simmered at 48°C. Larkana and Sukkur recorded 47°C. Karachi experienced sweltering 40°C with 70% humidity, making conditions unbearable for citizens in the port city.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) plains, including Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan, baked at 45-46°C. The northern mountainous areas remained relatively cooler, however. Balochistan’s Sibi and Turbat reported 47°C, while Quetta witnessed a comparatively mild temperature of 38°C.
Across Punjab, people avoided stepping outside to hide from the sun while markets and streets wore a deserted look during the afternoon. The relentless heat left streets deserted during the afternoon, with vendors and labourers struggling to cope. “The heat is unbearable. Even standing in the shade feels like being in an oven,” said Muhammad Asif, a rickshaw driver in Lahore.
Due to extreme heat, hospitals in Punjab received scores of heatstroke cases, which were treated by the authorities that had set up dedicated counters in the state-run hospitals. Most cases were reported particularly among labourers, the elderly and children. To add to the misery were the intermittent power outages in various cities, leaving many without fans or air-conditioning.
In light of the heatwave, the National Disaster Management Authority alerted all provincial departments to remain vigilant as the heatwave persists.
In response to the crisis, the Punjab government issued directives to mitigate the situation.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed ordered all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remain on high alert. He said the authorities were providing cool drinking water at public spaces, transport hubs, and markets, and hospitals had set up heatstroke emergency counters, and medical supplies were stocked to treat heat-related illnesses.
He said that the water supply in Cholistan was being closely monitored to prevent shortages.
The authorities issued health advisories urging citizens to stay hydrated, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities between 11am-4pm and watch for heatstroke symptoms.
Residents were encouraged to wear light-coloured, loose cotton clothing and stay hydrated. Special attention was called for children, the elderly, and sick individuals who are at highest risk, with authorities recommending they remain in cool environments.
People were advised to avoid strenuous work or exercise in direct sunlight and to call PDMA’s emergency helpline 1129 in case of experiencing heatstroke symptoms.
The Met department predicts no immediate relief, with the heatwave expected to continue for the next 48-72 hours.
“This is a life-threatening situation,” warned PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia, stressing that vulnerable groups must be protected at all costs.

• Banks, couriers to deduct withholding tax under new plan
• Fine for failing to submit withholding tax statements raised by 10 times
• Govt to take over property valuation powers from FBR
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has proposed sweeping reforms to tighten tax compliance, including significantly higher penalties for non-compliance and stronger enforcement measures to target under-taxed and digitally active sectors.
The changes, proposed in the Finance Bill 2025, aim to deter non-compliance, discourage cash-based transactions and enh­ance documentation of the economy. Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said enforcement was the only viable option to boost revenue collection, rather than relying on new taxes.
 
 

One of the key amendments is a tenfold increase in the penalty for failure to submit withholding tax statements — from Rs5,000 to Rs50,000. Authorities believe this will compel withholding agents to comply with deadlines and file statements within the due date.
A substantial penalty has been proposed for online marketplaces that allow unregistered, non-resident vendors engaged in e-commerce to sell digitally ord­ered goods without proper registration under the Sales Tax Act and the Income Tax Ordinance.
 
 

Under the proposed framework, the first violation would incur a fine of Rs500,000, with subsequent defaults carrying a penalty of Rs1 million. These fines would apply to both online platforms and courier services facilitating such transactions.
According to the Finance Bill, if a banking company, payment gateway or courier service provider fails to deduct tax when making payments to sellers or neglects to remit the deducted tax, the government proposes strict penalties.
In cases involving digitally ordered goods or the provision of digitally delivered services via e-commerce platforms, the government proposed a penalty equal to 100 per cent of the tax amount for violations.
The government has made banks and courier services withholding agents for deducting withholding tax and sales tax from buyers of online goods and services. The collected tax will be submitted to the FBR, while the remaining amount will be transferred to the seller.
The Finance Bill 2025 introduces several revisions across various sections, tightening restrictions on economic transactions by certain individuals. These limitations were initially outlined in the Tax Laws Amendment Bill 2024.
Under the proposed amendments, the federal government — rather than the FBR — will be responsible for notifying the value of immovable property. Until this valuation is officially declared, restrictions on registering, recording or attesting property transfers will not take effect, and no individual will be deemed ineligible for such transactions.
The Finance Bill 2025 also expands exemptions to restrictions on bank account operations. Pensioner accounts, along with previously exempted Aasan accounts, are now explicitly excluded from limitations on opening or maintaining current or savings accounts.
The bill seeks to broaden the definition of an “eligible person” by including individuals who have submitted a statement of investment sources and expenditures, demonstrating sufficient resources and providing an explanation for a specific purchase or investment transaction.
The bill removes “special child” from the definition of immediate family members and eliminates the age limit of 25 years for a child’s classification as an immediate family member. As a result, individuals aged 26 or older who remain financially dependent on their parents will now qualify under this definition.
The definition of “sufficient resources” has also been broadened to encompass cash in local or foreign currency, the fair market value of gold, and the net realisable value of stocks, bonds, receivables or other prescribed cash-equivalent assets.
Individuals may declare these assets in their sources of investment and expenditure statements or their wealth statements filed for the latest tax year.
For companies and associations of persons (AOPs), sufficient resources include cash and equivalent assets reported in financial statements accompanying the income tax return for the latest tax year.
The Finance Bill proposes a proviso in the definition of sufficient resources, specifying that when an asset is acquired through the exchange of capital assets already declared in a wealth statement, financial statement or sources of investment and expenditure statement, the disposed capital assets shall be considered part of cash-equivalent assets, up to the value stated in the agreement.

Dr Mahrang Baloch, a leader of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), is held at the Hudda District Prison, Quetta, pursuant to a March 22 detention order by the deputy commissioner under the Mainte­nance of Public Order.
 
 

Moved through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, the appeal pleaded that Mah­rang Baloch had challen­ged her detention before the BHC, but the high court rejected her plea.
Now the appeal before the apex court contended that the high court order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts.
The federal governm­ent through interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state have been named as res­pon­dents in the petition.
The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising voice for missing persons. It apprised the court that her father and brother too were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.
Along with the main appeal, a separate application was also filed before the Supreme Court, seeking suspension of the BHC order during the pendency of the present case.
Another petition challenging the extension of detention order is also expected to be filed before the SC in a day or two.
The main appeal pleaded that in December 2023, the “Baloch Long March”, organised and led by the detenue and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force.
The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge.
The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO.
It reminded that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority.
The court was apprised that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case.
The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner by issuing MPO order acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister.

The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, which are marked by mutual trust, shared values, and close cooperation across multiple sectors, said an official press rel­ease issued here on Wednesday.
The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Min­ister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar, federal ministers, and other senior officers.
PM Shehbaz will hold high-level meetings with the UAE leadership, including a bilateral meeting with the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
A wide range of bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest and concern will be discussed during the high-level interactions.
The PM’s visit will serve to further stre­n­g­then the longstanding bro­­therly rel­a­tions between Pakistan and the UAE, deepen economic ties, and foster multifaceted collaboration.
