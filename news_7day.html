Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
“Eye experts examined him in Adiala jail, after which they recommended that it was necessary to take him to Pims for a small medical process. Last Saturday night, he was taken to Pims on the recommendation of these eye doctors and experts,” Tarar said.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. The ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
“During the medical procedure, his vitals and everything were stable. He’s absolutely healthy,” Tarar stated.

 


The minister asserted that “all prisoners” have access to doctors and medical treatments when such an issue arises. “This is in accordance with the [jail] rules, and he is absolutely healthy,” he added.
Asked about the concerns raised regarding Imran’s health, Tarar reiterated that the PTI founder was “absolutely fine”.
The minister stressed that it was the medical experts’ opinion to take Imran to Pims for a medical procedure. “He is absolutely fine, and he was also perfectly fine when this medical procedure was being performed.”
On Tuesday, the PTI said it had learned through credible reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”.
Citing medical experts, the party had said that if not treated promptly and properly, CRVO could cause permanent damage to his eyesight.
Also on Tuesday, PTI MNAs filed a fresh petition before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet Imran.
According to a senior doctor at Pims, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time.
“Whatever procedure was going on, it was completed when the time reached in the A.M. So we can say that he was taken back on Sunday,” he claimed.
The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims.
Imran’s sister demands his medical reports be made public
Prior to Tarar’s confirmation, Imran’s sister Noreen Niazi had raised concerns about why the PTI founder’s family and lawyers were not being kept informed if the reports of his medical treatment were true. She also asked for his medical reports to be made public.
“I am a sister, and today my question is directed towards the corridors of power,” Niazi said on X this morning.
“According to multiple journalists and media sources, our brother, Imran Khan, was taken under the cover of the night to the Pims hospital on the pretext of eye treatment. He was kept there for three hours, and then transferred back to Adiala jail in an atmosphere of extreme mystery and terrifying silence,” she stated.
Contending that it was a “blatant crime” if the reports were true, Niazi asked: “Why does no one have the courage to tell the truth to Imran Khan’s family and lawyers? Who is this being hidden from, and on whose orders?
“What treatment is our brother being subjected to inside the jail, and why are our family and lawyers being kept in the dark?”







Niazi again demanded that Imran’s family, personal doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet him, adding that “make his complete medical reports public”.
“This is no longer a request, it is a final warning!” she stated.
Asserting that Imran was “not just another prisoner”, his sister alleged, “To endanger his health is nothing less than an attempt to blind the entire country.”
“Remember, if even the slightest harm comes to Imran Khan’s eye, this injustice will not be buried in silence. After that, no one else’s eyes will remain safe,” Niazi added.
Separately, Imran’s son Kasim Khan claimed that “authorities continue to block his treatment and deny him the doctors he trusts”.
“I am even denied the right to speak to him. This is not governance. This is authoritarian cruelty,” he said on X.
Claiming that his father had now spent over 900 days in a “death cell with no family visits and no access to his personal doctors, Kasim stressed that CRVO could “lead to permanent vision loss if not treated through urgent medical intervention in a proper hospital”.
The son called on human rights defenders to “act before it is too late”.
“The world must see that in Pakistan today, democracy is hollow and basic human rights are being crushed,” he added.

In a statement, Rescue 1122 said that its “diving team had recovered the girl’s body from Saggian”, around five kilometres from Bhatti Chowk, where the incident took place a day earlier.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, in an earlier statement, said that the “rescue services received a call at 7:32pm on Wednesday about a mother and daughter falling into an open sewer line”.
In the statement, he detailed that the rescue operation had continued “without any breaks”.
In the early hours of Thursday, speaking to the media, Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran said that the body of the mother had been found at the disposal station on Outfall Road.
When asked about the various reports about the water flow not being fast enough to carry away a person, he said, “You should also look at the time difference. When it happened, the water flow was fast; those are peak hours.”
He said that the water flow receded as the night progressed.
Asked whether the family would register a case, Kamran said, “Whatever the family says and whatever their opinion is, we will act according to that.”
Yesterday, Lahore Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Mohammad Tauqir told Dawn that police had taken the woman’s husband into custody, adding that he was the one who had alleged that his wife had fallen into the sewerage line along with their minor daughter at around 7:30pm.
According to the official, the husband was taken into custody on the statement of the woman’s father, who alleged that the couple had not been on good terms for the past few months.
The SSP had further stated that the deceased woman’s father had expressed his doubts over the role of her husband, who had called Rescue 1122 and alerted it about his wife falling down the sewerage pipeline along with their minor daughter.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.</p><small>2026-01-29 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29132355bb31d02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969724/fm-dar-stresses-importance-of-dialogue-diplomacy-in-call-with-irans-araghchi' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar stresses importance of dialogue, diplomacy in call with Iran’s Araghchi</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday.
The Foreign Office (FO) posted on X today that the two foreign ministers had spoken on the phone, during which Dar expressed concern over the evolving regional situation.
The foreign minister “underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the FO said.
It added that both leaders agreed to remain in close contact.







The two leaders had already spoken on Saturday, when Dar received a call from Araghchi while on a visit to Dubai.
According to the FO, the Iranian minister thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”.







Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. Pakistan was one of the seven countries that voted against the resolution, along with India and China.
The ministry added that the two dignitaries exchanged views on regional and international developments, while Araghchi conveyed “deep appreciation” for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistani government and the people.</p><small>2026-01-29 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/291254049229cad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969721/uks-pm-starmer-tells-xi-he-wants-sophisticated-ties-with-china' target='_blank'><strong>UK’s PM Starmer tells Xi he wants ‘sophisticated’ ties with China</strong></a><br><p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday that he wanted to build a “sophisticated relationship” with Beijing to boost growth and security, signaling a reset after years of strained ties.
On the most important day of his four-day visit to China, the first by a British prime minister in eight years, Starmer held an 80-minute summit with Xi at the Great Hall of the People before they lunched together. He will later meet Premier Li Qiang.
“China is a vital player on the global stage, and it’s vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but of course, also allow a meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree,” Starmer told Xi at the start of their meeting.



Xi said ties with Britain had gone through “twists and turns” that did not serve the interests of either country and that China stood ready to develop a long-term strategic partnership.
“We can deliver a result that can withstand the test of history,” the Chinese leader said, flanked by his top ministers.
Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world’s second-largest economy a priority, despite lingering misgivings about espionage and human rights.

PM Starmer said “really good progress” had been made on issues including whisky tariffs and visa-free travel during his meeting with Xi.
“We made some really good progress on tariffs for whisky, on visa-free travel to China and on information exchange and cooperation on irregular migration, focusing particularly on small boats and engine parts,” Starmer told reporters, calling it “a very good constructive meeting with real outcomes”.
Starmer is the latest Western leader to engage in a flurry of diplomacy with China, as nations hedge against unpredictability from the United States under President Donald Trump.
Trump’s on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, have rankled long-standing allies like Britain.







Starmer’s visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, drawing Trump’s ire.
Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London, said he expected a number of deals between Britain and China would be announced to show how their relationship has improved.
Starmer is being accompanied by more than 50 business leaders, another signal that he is seeking economic wins.
The British premier said he raised issues such as the trial of Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai and China’s human rights record during his meeting with Xi.
“We did have a respectful discussion about that, raised those issues as you would expect … It gives us great opportunities, but it also gives us the opportunity to have those discussions about areas where we disagree,” Starmer told reporters in Beijing when asked if the subjects had been raised.
Tackling migrant smuggling gangs
Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after ties deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments, when London curbed some Chinese investment over national security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.
“I made the promise 18 months ago, when we were elected into government, that I would make Britain face outwards again,” Starmer told Xi.
“Because, as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in our home countries, to prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel.”
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party, said on Wednesday she would not have gone to China because of the security risks the country poses.

British security services have said China routinely spies on the government. China has denied the claims.
In a sign of how the countries can work together, Downing Street said Starmer and Xi would announce that Britain and China would jointly tackle gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants.
The deal will focus on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats that transport people across Europe to claim asylum.
British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime, Downing Street said.
After arriving late on Wednesday, Starmer dined at a restaurant in the capital known for its mushroom-laden dishes that also hosted former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen during her 2023 visit.
He practised pronouncing the Chinese word for thank you – “xie xie” – with restaurant staff as he posed for photographs, a video posted on Weibo showed.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2910085234518ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969709/security-forces-launch-large-scale-operation-in-bannus-domel' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces launch large-scale operation in Bannu’s Domel</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Security forces on Thursday launched a large-scale operation in the Domel tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
The operation was launched in the tehsil’s Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan area.
During the operation, security forces have targeted militant hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continues in the area.
Continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters is being carried out in the region, indicating the sensitive nature and importance of the operation.
Security forces have completely cordoned off the area and are conducting combat operations against the militants.
The objective, security forces said, is to completely clear the area and restore law and order.
Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with police in Domel area. The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the killed militants.
On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district.
The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district. According to a senior official of the district police, the victims were all travelling in the same vehicle when armed men opened “indiscriminate fire” on them.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/291204583011766.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969717/in-letter-to-shc-cj-sindh-governor-seeks-constitution-of-judicial-commission-for-gul-plaza-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to SHC CJ, Sindh governor seeks constitution of judicial commission for Gul Plaza inferno</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, in a letter to the Chief Justice of Sindh High Court Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput, has sought the constitution of a judicial inquiry commission in relation to the devastating Gul Plaza blaze in Karachi, it emerged on Thursday.
The development comes amid growing calls from the opposition parties to form an inquiry commission in response to preliminary findings on the incident, which suggested that the fire was caused accidentally by a minor son of the owner of a flower shop.
Jamaat-i-Islami also questioned the probe’s credibility and asked for an independent judicial commission.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
In his letter — dated January 27 and available with Dawn — the Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader requested the SHC CJ to constitute a judicial inquiry commission to “investigate the Gul Plaza fire incident and to dig out the root cause, negligence facts or violations of law that may have led to this unfortunate occurrence”.
He noted that the incident had “resulted in irreparable loss of precious human lives and caused grave concern among the public at large”.
“Given the gravity of the incident and the widespread public concern, there is a compelling need for a transparent, independent, and credible inquiry to ascertain the causes, regulatory lapses, and any responsibility on the part of individuals or institutions,” Governor Tessori said.
He maintained that inquiry would “contribute towards preventing similar tragedies in future in the larger public interest”.
In his letter, the governor expressed confidence that “an inquiry conducted under the esteemed guidance of the judiciary will help restore public confidence and ensure that justice is served in accordance with law.”
On Wednesday, JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar called for an independent and credible judicial or statutory commission to conduct a thorough investigation, warning that failure to hold those responsible accountable would only pave the way for more disasters in the city.
Earlier in the day, a two-member committee comprising Karachi Commissioner Hasan Naqvi and city police chief Azad Khan, tasked with investigating the Gul Plaza inferno, called on Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and reportedly submitted their report.
Media reports said the report stated that the minor son of a shop owner lit a match while playing inside the shop and threw it without putting it out, due to which the shop caught fire, which then spread to the entire Gul Plaza.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29105602e713bca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969710/pakistan-armed-forces-undergoing-major-transformation-in-multiple-domains-cdf-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan armed forces undergoing major transformation in multiple domains: CDF Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the armed forces were “undergoing major transformation in multiple domains”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
According to an ISPR press release, the army chief made the remarks while addressing troops of the Bahawalpur Garrison at Khairpur Tamewali (KPT) in Punjab, where he witnessed a high-intensity field exercise ‘Steadfast Resolve’.
The corps, based at Bahawalpur Garrison, is a key strike formation of the Pakistan Army. Its area of responsibility includes the southern Punjab desert zone and its order of battle includes multiple divisions. It focuses on modern, technology-enabled, multi-domain operations, often conducting exercises in areas like Khairpur Tamewali.
“COAS & CDF highlighted that Pakistan Armed Forces are undergoing major transformation in multiple domains,” the military’s media affairs wing said.
“Character of war has evolved massively, with technological advancements driving the evolution, dictating huge mental transformation at all tiers,” the army chief observed.
He added: “In the future, technological manoeuvres will replace physical manoeuvres and will fundamentally alter the way offensive and defensive operations are undertaken.”
“Therefore, Pakistan armed forces are embracing and absorbing technology at a rapid pace. In this process, innovation, indigenisation and adaptation shall remain fundamental.”



CDF Munir also lauded the troops’ high morale, professional competence and operational preparedness.
He reaffirmed that the armed forces remain fully prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity “against all threats, emphasising the need to maintain optimum readiness to meet the requirements of future battlefield and security challenges”, the ISPR added.
The ‘Steadfast Resolve’ exercise encompassed the “integration of niche technologies like unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced surveillance assets, electronic warfare assets and modern command-and-control mechanisms, reflecting the armed forces’ focus on technology-enabled multi-domain operations”, the statement said.

During his visit to Bahawalpur Garrison, Field Marshal Munir was also briefed on “various operational, training and administrative aspects of the Corps, with special focus on preparations for multi-domain warfare”.
Upon his arrival at the garrison, the CDF was received by the Bahawalpur Corps commander. He also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered prayers for the martyrs, paying tribute to their sacrifices.
Earlier, COAS Munir inaugurated the “ROHI eSkills Learning Hub (STP) aimed at promoting digital skills and learning opportunities for students, particularly from southern Punjab and across the country”.
He also inaugurated the APS Abbasia Campus, reaffirming the army’s commitment to “quality education and character building”, the ISPR said.
Field Marshal Munir also visited the EME Regional Workshop, where he was briefed on the maintenance regime to sustain modern platforms through advanced technologies, indigenisation, and other combat support measures.
In August 2025, the Army Rocket Force Command was established to bolster the country’s conventional strike capability. As part of it, the army successfully conducted a training launch of the Fatah-4 cruise missile in September.

 

The army chief has emphasised the importance of technological advancements in modern warfare on multiple occasions.
In December, he highlighted that the multi-domain operations conducted during the conflict with India in May 2025 had now become a textbook example and case study for future warfare.
He also noted that the country needed to keep up with emerging spheres in warfare, such as cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, outer space, information operations, and quantum computing.
Earlier this month, CDF Munir addressed officers at the Lahore Garrison, where he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies”.
Last week, the army chief visited the National Police Academy in Islamabad, where he stressed that a strong and people-centric police force was indispensable for ensuring internal security and the rule of law.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29110522f096e96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969711/trump-weighs-iran-strikes-to-inspire-renewed-protests-sources-say' target='_blank'><strong>Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the government.
Two US sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for “regime change” after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month.
To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions that Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said.
One of the US sources said the options being discussed by Trump’s aides also included a much larger strike intended to have a lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes.
The other US source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path.
The arrival of a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran’s crackdown.
Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats, and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the crackdown.
Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections, Iran’s protests remained “heroic but outgunned.”
The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran’s foreign office, the US Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office declined to comment.
Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future US attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an “armada” sailing to Iran.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels.” However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said.
Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday.







Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East.
Limits of air power
A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal.
“If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.”
Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said.
The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests.
Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said.
The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government.
Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.”
Khamenei retains control but less visible
At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said.
Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy.
However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei.
In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said.
But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions.
Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said.
Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders.
A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint.
The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources.
Regional blowback
Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran.
“The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.”
Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium.
The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said.
EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn
Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move.
EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests.
“France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X.







With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members.
Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States.
“The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said.
The French presidency had earlier announced the decision.
Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran
While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious.
They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons.
Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.
Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity.
“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.</p><small>2026-01-29 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/291143288db4deb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969712/sri-lanka-boosts-t20-world-cup-security-with-eye-on-india-pakistan-matches' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka boosts T20 World Cup security with eye on India-Pakistan matches</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka will deploy elite armed units to protect teams at next month’s T20 World Cup, part of enhanced security measures with a special emphasis on matches between perennial rivals India and Pakistan, officials have told AFP.
The island is co-hosting the biennial cricket tournament with India and will hold 20 games between February 7 and March 8.
The Indian and Pakistani teams will play each other at least once, in their Group A clash in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on February 15.
Cricket matches have long been a stage for expressing political tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which fought a four-day conflict last year.

 

Sri Lanka has given the “highest priority” to ensuring the tournament runs smoothly and is “paying special attention to the India-Pakistan matches”, sports minister Sunil Kumara Gamage told AFP late on Wednesday.
Elite commando units, usually assigned to guard visiting heads of state, will be deployed to protect all participating teams, police and security officials said.
“From the time they step out of the airport till they return to their aircraft, they will be protected by armed guards,” an official said, asking not to be named.
India and Pakistan have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, opting to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead. Hence, for the T20 World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shifted their matches to Sri Lanka.
Bangladesh also tried to have their matches moved out of India due to security fears, but the ICC rejected the request.
An angry Bangladesh then withdrew from the tournament, and Scotland were drafted in as their replacement.
Pakistan has indicated that it may yet boycott the event in solidarity with Bangladesh.

 

Sri Lanka maintained a studious silence throughout the India-Bangladesh row.
Cricket Secretary Bandula Dissanayake told AFP Colombo wanted to avoid being drawn into regional disputes.
“In these disputes among India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are remaining neutral, all of these are friendly nations,” he said.
But he added that Sri Lanka would be willing to host future tournaments for any of the countries if asked.
Sri Lanka has also used the T20 World Cup as an opportunity to upgrade its international venues.
It has commissioned new floodlights at the Singhalese Sports Club, one of two stadiums in Colombo.
The Pallekele Stadium in Kandy was unaffected by a deadly cyclone that damaged buildings in the region in November, and will host a T20 international between Sri Lanka and England from Friday.</p><small>2026-01-29 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/290219029f93baa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969552/tirah-buried-under-snow-and-circumstance' target='_blank'><strong>Tirah: buried under snow and circumstance</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been ‘under the weather’ lately; not just because of the low temperatures and heavy snowfall in the mountains, but also rising political temperatures.
Months of political confrontation between Peshawar and Islamabad have now reached fever pitch.
In KP, the ruling PTI has been in agitation-mode ever since the incarceration and jailing of its founding chairman — assigning everything else, even governance, to a secondary care list.
But the latest row over a military operation in the lofty mountains of picturesque Tirah has squeezed space for any meaningful conversation, consultation and even coordination, especially on the all-important issue of security in the troubled province.
That is, unless, all stakeholders take a strategic pause, pull back and allow temperatures to cool down.
How did we get here?
Tirah Bagh Maidan — spread over approximately 542 sq km, comprises thick forests, narrow gorges, passes and high-altitude peaks more than seven thousand feet tall — adjoins Afghanistan’s famous Tora Bora mountains to the northwest.
Home to the Afridis, Tirah overlooks the plains of Bara, and shares a long boundary with Peshawar. The terrain is tough and winters here can be challenging due to heavy snow in the upper reaches, prompting its inhabitants to move down to the plains of Bara and Peshawar in the winters, and return when the snow melts.
For months, the military and state intelligence apparatus — the civil administration included — watched as the security situation in Tirah took a serious turn as a motley crew of terrorist outfits started pouring into its many villages, attacking security outposts, and exacting taxes on one of its main agricultural products: hemp.
Lashkar-i-Islam (LI), the original native militant outfit, which had weakened after the killing of its chief Mangal Bagh in the neighbouring Afghan province of Nangrahar, were the first to return to the Valley. Then followed the Jamaatul Ahrar and the IS-Khorasan.
But it was the Hafiz Gul Bahadur’s group’s unusual alliance with LI in Khyber that triggered alarm bells amongst security minders in Peshawar and beyond the Indus.

 

Gul Bahadur, whose group hitherto operated in its native North Waziristan, appeared to expand its operation by creating a strategic arc from the north to the west, inching ever closer to Peshawar.
Intelligence was pouring in as terrorists mounted attacks, not just within the limits of Khyber but also on police posts dotted along Peshawar’s boundary with the tribal districts.
More troubling were attempts by IS-Khorasan to set up a stronghold in Tirah. Things became more self-evident after intelligence agencies and the counterterrorism department traced a failed suicide bomber — an Azeri national who had wanted to target a JUI-F rally in Peshawar — to Tirah.
Discussions to mount a military operation — the second for Tirah — to bring this strategic area under control assumed more seriousness. This was long before incumbent Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, himself a native of the area, took oath of office in October 2025.
The Tirah ‘operation’
Call it a military operation, limited military action or an intelligence-based operation — the plan for intervention in Tirah was fully mapped out in the summer of 2025. Everyone was on board, including Afridi’s predecessor. This is when local jirgas from the valley were pressed for action.
Fresh off the heels of a successful operation in the Bajaur tribal district, authorities presented the same three-choice model to Tirahwals: press the outlaws to leave; raise a tribal lashkar (militia) to flush them out if they refuse; or, evacuate and allow security forces to clean up while avoiding collateral damage.
After all, the authorities had successfully evacuated nearly twice as many families and twice the number of Bajauris, and resettled them back into their 54 villages in October, with the provincial exchequer providing nearly Rs4bn for that exercise too.
Tirah, at least in its scale, was not much different. Authorities were optimistic; the model had worked in Bajaur and there was no way it wouldn’t work here as well.

 

The outcome was as expected: the terrorists refused to leave, and the natives declined to take up arms. So it was a foregone conclusion, they must pack up and leave.
Next was getting the tribespeople to vacate their areas. A broadened 24-member jirga was constituted to work out the details of the evacuation, the exit and return dates, settle the question of expenses during the interim period and compensation for possible damage to properties during the operation.
Understandably sceptical, the Afridis took their time, played hardball and negotiated the agreement down to the minutest details.
Taking it personally
But while security forces took their time to free up men and resources from Bajaur and redeploy them in Tirah, while waiting for the wise Afridi elders to reach an agreement, winter descended.
As the Tirawals moved lock, stock and barrel down to the plains, the snow — late by around two months — caught up with them. Despite their best laid plans, it seemed the weather was something no one had calculated for.
Enter Sohail Afridi. If the dramatic exit of the more predictable Ali Amin Gandapur was a shock for policymakers in Islamabad, the entry of this little-known dark horse was equally surprising.
But more surprising, probably, was the reaction to his nomination and ultimate vote of confidence. The grapes had turned sour for the student activist even before he could devour them, and he didn’t take this lying down.
In the days leading up to his inauguration, Afridi went around telling anyone who would listen — especially those trying to cool down tempers and set up a working environment to cope with the twin challenge of governance and security in KP — that the powers that be were out to humiliate him.

 

They were engaging in mud slinging, he would say, trying to link him with the narco-lobby. Predictably, in his maiden speech before the Provincial Assembly last October, Afridi threw down the gauntlet. “I am a champion of agitation politics,” he roared, to applause and desk-thumping.
Ever since becoming the chief executive, Afridi has been fuming as well as musing. To his aides and well-wishers, he says the federal government and the powers that be have been relentless in their bid to sling mud at him and embarrass him; the handling of the situation in Tirah being their latest salvo.
“You ask me to cool down, but look at what they are doing to me,” he told one aide. But in typical cricketing parlance, he says, the feds have been treating him with one full-toss after another, “I am relishing hitting them over the boundary”.
Balancing act?
But stuck, perhaps, between the growing challenges of governance and security, is his own party’s dilemma.
The PTI has been struggling to balance its political narrative of agitation with the strategic and security imperative. For all his misgivings, Ali Amin Gandapur knew this art well, and walked the tightrope all nineteen months of his rule. But he ended up paying the ultimate price, in the shape of his unceremonious ouster from office.
Sohail Afridi knows this, understands it, and has been well-briefed by all stakeholders — including his own provincial security apparatus. Yet, he is still struggling to find ways to balance his party’s own political narrative with the military operation, drone strikes and other security imperatives.
He is angry, but also enjoying the limelight. In him, the PTI has found a new poster boy, a veritable cheerleader to lead an otherwise demoralised party cadre, which felt increasingly betrayed by its frontline leaders.
Would he have behaved any differently had those in power courted him well in time, it is hard to say.
But spare a thought for the beleaguered bureaucrats caught in the middle of this power struggle, as space for officialdom to work through the complex challenges that face the province has been squeezed to almost zero.

 

Nothing illustrates the ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ predicament of civil servants better than the Khyber deputy commissioner’s Dec 26, 2025 notification regarding the “voluntary movement of population”.
Seizing upon the document, the federal government relishes every opportunity to brandish it, apparently in a bid to embarrass CM Afridi, who continues to insist and call the evacuation a ‘forced displacement.”
This has undoubtedly pushed the bureaucracy into a tight corner, hampering its ability to cope with security demands on the one hand and a belligerent chief minister on the other.
The resulting schism, and deepening mistrust between federal institutions and the province will only complicate the political and security situation further than it needs to be.

In the narrative it built to support its decision, the State Bank effectively argued that that battle against inflation has been won, but the battle to rebuild the external sector remains a work in progress despite significant strides.
These are the two large battles in the war the country waged against economic volatility since July 2023. I use that date because that is when Pakistan had veered perilously close to the edge of a sovereign default and was rescued by an extraordinary bailout arranged by the IMF, China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Had that bailout not come, the country was going to shut down, perhaps within weeks. We move on too fast and forget too much in this country.
Two tasks were of the utmost urgency starting then. First was to douse the flames of the inflation that had engulfed the country since early 2021, rising to an unprecedented inferno by May 2023. Never had we seen inflation reach 38 per cent year on year like we did that month. And never had we seen devaluations of the sort that began to hit in 2021. By the time that wave of devaluations peaked a few years later, the dollar had nearly tripled in value against the rupee. Never have we seen a devaluation of this magnitude in such a short period of time.
Two successive IMF programmes have been required to pull back from the brink of this near catastrophic volatility that ran between 2022 and 2023. The first was the Stand-by Arrangement in July 2023, and the second was the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in September 2024. The latter programme is still running, and going by the numbers it contains, Pakistan is still far from being out of danger.

Against the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the battle is still on.

When the EFF began Pakistan’s Net International Reserves (NIR) were negative $11 billion. If you took all the money Pakistan owed in the short term out of the reported foreign exchange reserves, you were left $11bn in the hole. That’s how dire the situation was. This number had gone negative in 2017 for the first time after a few decades, and had barely managed to reach the zero line a few years later, when it plunged once again when the external sector drains of the PTI’s much-vaunted growth rates began.
The Fund programme set a stringent timeline for raising this figure, slowly but surely, back up to the zero line. At the time of signing, the Fund targeted that Pakistan’s NIR should break into positive territory by 2028, four years into the future. Based on that timeline, Pakistan is slightly ahead of the curve. By now the NIR were supposed to be aiming for a target of negative $7.5bn. The data shows that they were at negative $6.6bn by September of 2025 and could realistically touch negative $4.8bn by June of this year, if things keep moving as they are.
This is good news certainly. But notice the figure is still negative, meaning all the dollars and gold and other reserve assets that the country has are still overshadowed by the claims that non-residents have on the country. To put it simply, we owe more than what we have when it comes to foreign exchange, and while that is the case, the country cannot be said to be ready to grow.
A war began in July 2023. A war against catastrophic economic volatility. That volatility was showing up in two areas: inflation and foreign exchange depletion. Each front required a full-fledged battle to put the fire out. Against inflation they won the battle many months ago. But against the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the battle is still on.
This is probably one of the reasons why the State Bank is so aggressive in ‘buying’ dollars from the banks. I put the word buying in quotation marks because banks don’t always get to decide the price at which they will sell these dollars, and in some cases they don’t even get to decide whether they will sell or not. What is puzzling, however, is the sheer zeal with which this goal is being pursued, to the point where they are over-performing on the targets set by the IMF. In September and October of 2025, for example, they bought up more than a billion dollars each month. This is unusual.

 

The long hard slog to bring the foreign exchange reserves back into positive territory is going to continue for at least another year to 18 months — despite the over-performance so far. To do this, it is necessary not only to accumulate reserves, but also to retire the liabilities that were built up during the period of the great volatility of 2022 and 2023. The improvement is happening but it is far from over. And the last thing the economy can afford at this time is a resurgence of the trade deficit to act as a drain on the reserves.
This is what the State Bank pointed to in its monetary policy announcement. It pointed out that “economic activity continues to gain momentum faster than anticipated” and that “the trade deficit has widened in the wake of a substantial increase in imports”. These trends are expected to gather more momentum, it says, upgrading its growth forecast slightly to the 3.75- 4.75 range, with the possibility that “[t]his economic momentum is likely to strengthen further in FY27”.
The economy has started showing signs of an incipient revival with the result that the current account immediately registered a deficit of $1.2bn in from July to December. This is manageable. But the wheels can come off very fast if this trend picks up. So the State Bank has done the right thing to not juice the trajectory further. The battle to rebuild reserves is still on.

Speaking at a Security Council open debate on the Palestinian question on Wednesday, Pakistan emphasised that the establishment of “an independent, sovereign, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital” is the ultimate goal supported by the international community and essential for regional stability.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the unresolved Palestinian question lies at the heart of Middle East instability. He highlighted decades of Israeli occupation marked by dispossession, repression, and the denial of Palestinians’ inalienable rights, including self-determination.







Referring to continued Israeli aggression in Gaza, Ahmad noted that over the past two years, the crisis has escalated to an unprecedented scale, causing widespread civilian casualties, mass displacement, near-total destruction of infrastructure, and severe humanitarian deprivation. He stressed that humanitarian needs are growing rapidly.
The ambassador welcomed renewed diplomatic engagement, including the High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan, endorsed by Security Council resolution 2803. 
He said the second phase of the plan should help consolidate the ceasefire, secure a permanent cessation of hostilities, facilitate transitional arrangements, and enable recovery and reconstruction, while providing humanitarian assistance at scale and preparing the ground for a credible political process toward Palestinian self-determination.
Pakistan, along with other Arab and Islamic countries in the Group of Eight, supports the Board of Peace under resolution 2803, which is intended as a transitional mechanism to consolidate a permanent ceasefire, aid reconstruction in Gaza, and advance a just and lasting peace.







Pakistan has also expressed willingness to participate in the proposed Gaza Stabilisation Force, a US-led multinational initiative to stabilize the territory following the ceasefire.
At the same time, Islamabad has voiced deep concern over continuing tensions. Ambassador Ahmad warned that ceasefire violations persist, civilian lives remain at risk, and pressure on humanitarian organizations impedes aid and protection. 
He strongly condemned Israeli actions against UN facilities, including the recent demolition of a UN compound in Sheikh Jarrah, stressing that such acts undermine stabilization efforts and threaten limited progress. He underlined that UNRWA’s operations remain essential and must be safeguarded.
Outlining Pakistan’s priorities, Ahmad called for full respect for the ceasefire, recovery and reconstruction in Gaza without delay, and the prevention of annexation, forced displacement, or any alteration of the territorial unity of Palestinian territories. 
He urged an immediate end to illegal settlement activity, settler violence, and attempts to alter the demographic, legal, or historical character of the occupied territory, including holy sites, emphasizing that accountability is indispensable for durable peace.
Pakistan has long supported Palestinian self-determination and statehood, consistently advocating a two-state solution in line with UN resolutions and international law.
Concluding his statement, Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed that Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people “remains firm and unwavering” and called on the Security Council to ensure diplomatic efforts deliver concrete, measurable results for the betterment of Palestinians.</p><small>2026-01-29 04:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2700483243a412a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969190/luxury-on-display-taxes-under-scrutiny-how-fbrs-lifestyle-monitoring-cell-tracks-the-rich' target='_blank'><strong>Luxury on display, taxes under scrutiny: How FBR’s Lifestyle Monitoring Cell tracks the rich</strong></a><br><p>On the roads of Pakistan, a country where the gap between the haves and have-nots is in danger of becoming a chasm, a quiet contradiction is becoming harder and harder to ignore. From Lamborghinis to Porsches to Ferraris, scores of ultra-luxury cars can be seen gliding through major cities, leaving awe-inspired spectators in their wake. Sometimes, the ‘owners’ of these status symbols use them to amplify their presence on social media, drawing a plethora of envious comments.
Yet, on paper, many of these luxury vehicle owners report incomes that barely register against the value of the vehicles they drive. Officials are at pains to point out, however, that owning expensive items is not a crime in and of itself. However, the gap between visible wealth and declared earnings in many cases is so wide that it warrants scrutiny to ascertain whether these assets are properly documented as per the law.
In Pakistan, tax compliance remains among the lowest in Asia. According to reports, less than two per cent of the population pays income tax, and the state’s chronic revenue shortfalls have pushed it repeatedly into International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes.
Against this backdrop, the open display of extreme wealth, coupled with modest or negligible tax filings, has begun to test not just enforcement capacity but the credibility of the tax system itself.
This disconnect is what triggered a shift in how the state monitors its taxpayers; in September 2025, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) quietly operationalised its special unit called the Lifestyle Monitoring Cell (LMC). This was a digital subdivision within FBR, designed to do what traditional audits often failed to achieve, i.e. match publicly-available displays of wealth with people’s declared incomes.
The revelations
Relying on open-source intelligence, the cell represents a departure from paper-based scrutiny towards real-time observation of wealth, behaviour and spending. To improve enforcement, five regional offices were established in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Faisalabad, and Multan. These, along with the main unit, operate under the jurisdiction of the Director General of Intelligence and the Inland Revenue Department’s investigation division, to ensure legal cover for their activities..

In less than three months, the LMC detected an estimated Rs12.3 billion in concealed assets across 38 cases – largely linked to luxury vehicles, high-end events, frequent international travel, and other premium assets.

Within weeks, LMC’s focus moved squarely into the public domain. A team of 40 FBR investigators began systematically scanning different social media platforms, cross-checking individuals whose online lifestyles appeared disproportionate to their tax filings.
Authorities stress that the objective is not to target fame or status, but to identify mismatches between lifestyle and tax compliance, with social media serving as an evidentiary starting point, rather than a conclusion.
In less than three months, the LMC detected an estimated Rs12.3 billion in ‘concealed’ assets across 38 cases – largely linked to luxury vehicles, high-end events, frequent international travel, and other premium assets.
A breakdown of the data analysis shows that 19 cases are purely linked to luxury vehicles, followed by seven cases involving expensive weddings, while five are related to foreign travel.
Another four cases involve foreign travel combined with high-value personal acquisitions, including luxury cars, horses, and wedding-related spending, while one case is linked to the purchase of an exotic motorbike.
In the cases involving foreign travel, the individuals in question had not declared the related expenditures in their tax returns.
How it works
The LMC scans social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, to identify influencers, celebrities, real estate magnates, businesspeople, and individuals with a high net worth, whose public displays of wealth appear inconsistent with their declared tax profiles.
Tax officials say the exercise has moved beyond paper disclosures, with concealed income identified through open-source intelligence, gathered via social media, which feeds directly into their enforcement work.
The LMC has matched visible consumption with income tax returns for the tax year 2025 and issued tax concealment notices to the relevant Regional Tax Offices (RTOs) for further action in major cities of the country.
“In more than 70pc of the cases, the identified individuals have been selected for audit,” an FBR official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, adding that the investigations are based on “firm grounds”.
“Those under scrutiny will be required to justify the sources of income used to acquire fleets of luxury vehicles and other high-value assets.”

No longer ‘luxuries’
There is also another side to this story: self-expression or show-casing one’s lifestyle can now attract the attention of the taxman. As the scope of enforcement expands into online spaces, questions are emerging that go beyond tax recovery.
“This new enforcement drive blurs the boundary between personal display and professional accountability,” a taxpayer, who chose not to be named, told Dawn.
Observers note that the heightened scrutiny of social media may push individuals to stop public displays of luxury altogether, not necessarily to improve compliance, but to stay out of the digital taxman’s line of sight.
There is also a wide variation in spending patterns and lifestyle visibility across provinces and cities. Faisalabad and Sialkot, for instance, are widely associated with some of the most expensive cars seen on social media, yet only one such vehicle is on the FBR’s radar so far.
That case surfaced after the vehicle’s driver was penalised for speeding, with the incident going viral on social media and drawing official attention.
A breakdown of the afore-mentioned 38 cases shows that Lahore accounts for 10, followed by Karachi with seven. Bahawalpur accounts for four cases, Islamabad three, Multan two, while one case each has been recorded from Sargodha, Rawalpindi, Abbottabad, and Gujranwala.
Officials say eight additional cases are in the final stages of scrutiny and are expected to be concluded soon.
These include one high-value case from an industrial town in Punjab involving what is described as the “city’s most expensive Lamborghini”, while the remaining cases are linked to different cities across Punjab.

Collectors’ hamartia
Most cases flagged by the LMC centre on luxury vehicles, where ownership patterns sharply diverge from declared incomes in tax returns. Official data shows that 21 individuals were found displaying high-end cars on their social media accounts, often registered in multiple cities, while reporting income levels that could not justify such assets.
These luxury vehicles were not declared in the individuals’ wealth statements, and will now be examined through individual audits, officials said. The LMC is using income tax returns for the tax year 2025 to determine the extent of concealed income linked to the possession of these vehicles.
According to tax officials, the aggregate value of vehicles under investigation exceeds Rs10.6bn. However, in several cases, the declared taxable income remained minimal or inconsistent with the assets reflected in wealth statements.
Three individuals, two based in Lahore and one in Karachi, were identified as owning fleets of vehicles valued at more than Rs1bn. None of these assets was declared in their wealth statements, indicating a possible concealment of income.
One Lahore-based individual stands out for the sheer scale of high-end vehicle ownership.
Officials say the taxpayer was found to possess 30 luxury vehicles, including two Lamborghini Aventadors valued at Rs300m each, a Rolls-Royce Phantom worth Rs280m, a Bentley Continental GT priced at Rs200m, a Mercedes S600 Maybach valued at Rs180m, two BMW 7 Series cars worth Rs110m each, two Lexus LX-570 vehicles at Rs110m each, and two Porsches valued at Rs50m each.
The remaining 17 vehicles were assessed at values ranging between Rs25m and Rs100m per car, excluding two lower-priced units.
The total market value of the fleet has been estimated at Rs2.7bn. According to the FBR, none of these high-value vehicles were declared by the taxpayer in income tax returns filed over the years.
An initial assessment by tax officials indicates that the cost of the vehicles is 937 times higher than the net assets declared by the taxpayer for the tax year 2019, pointing to what officials describe as a gross misdeclaration and non-disclosure of income and expenditures.
Another Lahore-based individual was found to be in possession of 11 luxury vehicles, with a combined market value of Rs1.05bn.
Here too, the FBR said the cost of the vehicles alone exceeds more than double the net assets declared by the taxpayer in their income tax returns.
A Karachi-based taxpayer was also found to be in possession of 26 luxury vehicles, but had not correctly reported his actual wealth or income in tax declarations. According to tax officials, none of the luxury vehicles owned by the individual were declared in income tax returns, whose total market value was estimated to be around Rs1.163bn.
The most expensive vehicle in their collection is a Honda NSX, valued at Rs140m, followed by a 1958 Mercedes 190SL estimated at Rs130m, a 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith valued at Rs110m, a 1954 Mercedes Adenauer 300 at Rs95m, and a 1931 Blue Kaufen estimated at Rs90m. The remaining vehicles in the collection were assessed at values ranging between Rs2m and Rs65m.
In a country where a 1,001-horsepower supercar has become the ultimate status symbol, a purple Lamborghini Revuelto, estimated to cost Rs508m, was recently flagged by the City Traffic Police in the industrial heartland.
Several other individuals own fleets of vehicles worth hundreds of millions of rupees, but have not declared these assets in their wealth statements. Analysis of the data shows that one individual from a city in south Punjab was found to possess vehicles valued at an estimated Rs624m, while another from the same city owned vehicles worth Rs180.50m.
In other cities, undeclared vehicle fleets were identified with estimated values of Rs479.36m in Rawalpindi, Rs167m in Sargodha, Rs574m in Multan, Rs415m in Lahore, Rs686m in Islamabad, Rs224m in Lahore, Rs569m in Karachi, and Rs138m in Islamabad.
Eight additional cases involving fleets of expensive vehicles are currently in the pipeline, officials say.
These cases, they say, further underline how investment in luxury vehicles has become a common practice, often used by affluent individuals as a means of parking wealth while keeping it outside the tax net.

Lavish weddings
After luxury vehicles, the next major lifestyle category under scrutiny is lavish weddings. Officials estimate that the cost of just seven such ceremonies that are under the scanner stands at Rs725.6m: three cases were detected in Lahore, followed by two in Karachi, and one each in Islamabad and Multan.
These weddings involved multi-day celebrations where designer wardrobes, jewellery, premium venues, and high-end entertainment collectively pointed to undeclared liquidity.

In several cases, the families hosting these events had declared modest income in their returns, including salaried employment or small business earnings, while financing celebrations that featured imported décor and celebrity performers.
Tax officials estimate concealed income ranging between Rs55.5m and Rs238m per case, based on assessments of the scale, vendor pricing, and duration of the events in question.
According to officials, these expenses were again not reflected in the taxpayer’s wealth statement.
Taxmen have relied heavily on tagged service providers, event planners, jewellers, and fashion designers to reconstruct spending estimates.
Unlike asset-based cases, the investigation focuses on cash flow rather than ownership, with officials stressing that such expenditures are treated as indicators of undeclared earnings, rather than taxable events in themselves.
Foreign travel
Four cases involve frequent foreign travel, often to premium destinations, and are documented extensively through personal social media accounts. Unlike vehicles or property, the LMC has not assigned precise monetary values to these trips.
Instead, travel frequency itself has been treated as a risk indicator.
In these cases, individuals reported limited domestic income and no foreign earnings, yet travelled multiple times each year, often staying in luxury accommodation and engaging in high-end leisure activities.
Two cases involving celebrities were detected by the LMC, one in Lahore and the other in Karachi.
Tax officials say several other celebrities are not yet on the radar of digital tax enforcement despite indications of concealed assets, but may be netted once the scope of scrutiny widens.
In the Lahore case, a playback singer was identified as having concealed assets estimated at Rs224m.
According to officials, the taxpayer owns expensive vehicles, including Range Rovers and Mercedes models, while digital footprints point to consistently high-value spending patterns that are not supported by declared earnings or expenses in tax filings.
Officials noted that the cost of the vehicles alone is almost double the taxpayers’ declared net assets, even before accounting for declared income.

Meanwhile, a Karachi-based actor’s concealed assets have been estimated at Rs403.534m, according to tax officials.
Officials said the actor has travelled extensively within the country and abroad, frequently using private jets and chartered flights, and has stayed in high-end hotels during overseas trips since 2020.
The actor is also reported to own luxury watches valued at Rs50.680m, while the estimated cost of vehicles in his possession stands at around Rs350m.
Tax officials said the actor did not declare any vehicles, high-value watches, or travel-related expenses in their income tax returns or wealth statements.
The wide gap between declared earnings, which officials say may understate income from endorsements and influencer sponsorships, and the scale of personal spending has raised concerns over undeclared income streams, possible tax evasion, or reliance on undisclosed sources of funds.
Champion horses
The LMC has also begun monitoring the equestrian community, which is known for owning high-quality champion horses used in traditional sports.
Tax officials identified one such individual, who is estimated to have concealed assets worth Rs14m linked to imported horses. The taxpayer owns a farm housing pedigreed horses, with officials estimating that imported breeds typically cost between $10,000 and $30,000 per horse.
Officials further noted that the ongoing expenditure required to maintain such a large farm, including feed, veterinary care, and staff salaries, cannot be justified by the modest income declared in the taxpayer’s returns.
In addition, the individual was found to have travelled to 13 destinations, a pattern of travel that tax officials say is not compatible with the income and assets reported in tax filings.

Real estate
In Pakistan, real estate has long been one of the primary sectors where untaxed money is parked. However, it has not fully come under the focus of the LMC so far.
Tax officials said that several high-value properties and their owners have already been identified, and the related cases are expected to be finalised in the coming days.
So far, only one case directly linked to real estate has been formally documented. It involves properties owned by an individual valued at Rs395m, along with ownership of 10 vehicles worth Rs174.5m. The total value of concealed assets in the case has been estimated at Rs569.5m.
According to tax officials, the combined cost of the vehicles and immovable properties is almost 80 times the net assets declared by the taxpayer, aside from declared income.
Officials said the presence of such high-value assets against low declared income and minimal declared expenses clearly points to non-disclosure of personal expenditures and income.

In a judgement pronounced on Jan 27 and uploaded on Wednesday, the FCC ruled that Section 4B does not create any unreasonable or hostile classification among persons forming the same class. The court held that parliament was fully competent to impose, abolish, remit, alter or regulate such taxes through a Finance Act as part of a Money Bill under Article 73(2)(a) of the Constitution.
The court observed that the classification introduced under Section 4B is income-based, rests on an intelligible differentia and bears a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The provision, it said, suffers from no lack of legislative competence and does not, on its face, transgress any fundamental right warranting judicial invalidation.
The verdict was delivered by a three-judge bench comprising FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah. The judgement noted that any perceived inequities or hardships arising from the operation of Section 4B fall within the legislative domain and do not, by themselves, justify judicial interference in fiscal matters.

Verdict says parliament can enact laws with retrospective or prospective effect, as long as ‘past and closed transactions’ are not disturbed

The FCC held that Section 4B squarely falls within Entry 47 of Part I of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, namely “taxes on income”, and was therefore intra vires. It ruled that Section 4B applies as enacted for tax year 2015 and onwards at the rates prescribed in Division IIA, Part I of the First Schedule to the ITO. Consequently, the decisions of various high courts upholding Section 4B as a validly enacted “tax” were declared to represent the correct position of law.

 

Section 4B was inserted through the Finance Act of 2015 to impose a super tax for the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons on individuals earning more than Rs500 million. Similarly, Section 4C was introduced through the Finance Act, 2022, imposing a super tax on persons earning more than Rs150m from tax year 2022 onwards.
The FCC also declared Section 4C to be intra vires the Constitution and applicable as enacted for tax year 2022 onwards at the rates prescribed in Division IIB, Part I of the First Schedule. The court reaffirmed that the legislature enjoys plenary power to enact laws with retrospective or prospective effect, subject to the caveat that such laws do not disturb past and closed transactions.
The judgement clarified that the closing of accounts for a tax year does not preclude the imposition of a fresh charge where none existed earlier, particularly when returns for tax year 2022 were yet to be filed. Accordingly, the FCC set aside the judgements of the Sindh, Islamabad and Lahore High Courts to the extent they held that Section 4C could not apply retrospectively to tax year 2022.
Rejecting preliminary objections regarding maintainability, the FCC held that it possessed inherent powers to transpose parties for just adjudication. Since the federation was already a respondent, it could be transposed as an appellant. The court also noted that in several pending matters, appeals had been filed by the Federation in addition to the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR) and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), rendering the appeals maintainable.
The FCC set aside the Islamabad High Court’s Pakistan Oilfields judgement of March 15, 2024, insofar as it held that amended rates under Division IIB could not apply retrospectively to tax year 2023. It held that the definition of “income” under Section 4C, including income from all sources, was validly enacted. Consequently, the IHC’s direction to the FBR to issue a nationwide circular to implement its order was declared to be without jurisdiction.
The court ruled that super tax under Section 4C is a standalone tax on income, independent of the tax levied under Section 4 of the ITO, and therefore applies to capital gains under Section 37A as well. However, in the case of exploration and production (E&P) companies, Sections 4B and 4C will apply only to the extent that they do not exceed the aggregate tax rates stipulated under the Fifth Schedule and relevant petroleum concession agreements.
The FCC held that Section 4C would not apply to E&P companies where it would result in taxation exceeding the threshold prescribed in Rule 4 of the Fifth Schedule, nor would it override exemptions granted to benevolent and provident funds. In the case of banking companies, Section 4C will apply from tax year 2023 onwards at rates amended by the Finance Act, 2023.

Taking umbrage at the assertion about ‘seasonal migration’ by Tirah residents, Bara Tehsil Chairman Mufti Kafeel argued that no such event had taken place since 2015, when residents were allowed to return to their homes after completion of a military operation.
Some questioned why registration centres were established for these families when they were supposedly going to Bara on a ‘joy ride’, as the ministers seemed to claim.

 

Former MNA Hameedullah Jan Afridi said the defence minister’s statement was tantamount to rubbing salt in the wounds of the people of Tirah and Bara.

Talal Chaudhry accuses PTI of concocting narrative to ‘hide their corruption’; says any military action will only be launched ‘after informing everyone’

Talking to Dawn, he said that these statements were “unbearable, shameful and completely opposite” to the facts about the displacement of residents.
“We reject this baseless and misleading statement and want to clarify that the residents of Tirah have not left their homes voluntarily nor is this a seasonal migration,” he insisted.
He claimed these people were forced to leave their houses in inhospitable conditions in the name of eradicating terrorism.
He reminded the federal ministers that displacement from Tirah started only after an agreement was reached between government officials and a representative jirga of local elders, in which all modalities about transport fare and compensation for damages were sorted out prior to the start of a planned military operation.

 

Another former parliamentarian from Bara, Shafeeq Afridi, said the statement made a mockery of the sufferings of thousands of children, women and elderly residents of Tirah, who were made to wait in lines for long hours in order to get themselves registered.
He said that describing the current displacement in light of a book written by an English author in 1880 was tantamount to twisting historical facts and misleading the people.
“The federal government cannot absolve itself of its constitutional responsibilities towards its law-abiding citizens by simply referring to history books written by foreigners, as we live in a different Pakistan now,” he stated.
He also questioned the rationale behind the ban on taking edibles to the restive valley, as well as the strict monitoring of the movement of residents in the entire valley. He said women and children were not even allowed to venture out of their homes prior to their displacement.
Bara Siyasi Ittehad President Hashim Khan Afridi, meanwhile, held both the federal and provincial governments responsible for the miseries of the displaced families and insisted that the plan to conducting a military operation and prior evacuation of families was finalised with the mutual consent of both governments.
‘Concocted narrative’
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, however, continued to point the finger squarely at the government in Peshawar, claiming that it was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation.
“As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they [KP govt] were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it,” he said in televised remarks on Wednesday.
“Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.”
However, the minister added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP).”
“Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted.
The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is that [the provincial government] wants to do it, but they are scared”.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a global race for critical minerals and rare earths, Pakistan on Wednesday reaffirmed China’s central role in transforming its mineral sector beyond extraction to unleash the potential of around $8 trillion of estimated resources, as the two sides signed a series of memoranda of understanding (MoUs) at the Pak-China Mineral Cooperation Forum.
At the daylong session, the two sides launched the ‘Pak-China E-Mining Platform’, a digital initiative aimed at improving information sharing, project connectivity and cooperation between Pakistani authorities and Chinese enterprises and to enhance transparency, efficiency and collaboration in the development of the mineral sector.
The forum also led to the signing of MoUs, among which was an accord for ‘A Framework for Cooperation to Explore Opportunities in Digital Cross-Border Industrial Trade’, signed between Wah Nobel (Pvt) Limited and MCCT International, as well as between JW Corporation and MCCT International.

 

In addition, an MoU for cooperation in Pakistan’s mineral sector was also signed among the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC), POWERCHINA International and Pak China Investment Company Limited, focusing on investment facilitation, technical cooperation and joint development initiatives.
Organised by the China Chamber of Commerce in Pakistan (CCCPK), the event brought together Pakistani ministers, diplomatic representatives, Chinese enterprises and industry stakeholders.
The petroleum division said more than 800 people attended, including representatives from over 70 Chinese companies and over 100 Pakistani firms.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who is also Pakistan’s focal person for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), said Pakistan wanted strategic partners such as China to develop the mineral sector, just like CPEC’s cooperation has delivered tangible results across the economy, including the power sector, infrastructure development and industrial connectivity.
“Chinese enterprises bring advanced expertise to the entire mining value chain, including geological surveying, modern extraction techniques, mineral processing, smelting, refining and manufacturing,” he said.
The minister added that Pakistan wanted to move beyond extraction to develop mineral processing plants, smelters, refining facilities & mineral-based industrial units linked with special economic zones and transport corridors.
In his keynote speech, Ambassador Jiang Zaidong reaffirmed China’s strong interest in investing in Pakistan’s mining sector and in supporting capacity building and technological advancement.
He emphasised China’s role as an active contributor to global economic development and highlighted the importance of sustainability and benchmark construction standards in mining projects.
Speaking on the occasion, CCCPK Chairman Wang Huihua said mining and minerals were emerging as a new pillar of Pak-China economic cooperation and that the chamber would facilitate dialogue, promote responsible investment and strengthen linkages between Chinese and Pakistani enterprises.
Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said Pakistan’s policy direction was now to move towards responsible and value-added mineral development.
He promised Pakistan’s commitment to policy stability, streamlined approvals and federal-provincial coordination to position Pakistan as a reliable long-term partner in the global mineral supply chain, and formally invited Chinese companies to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum this year.
Published in Dawn, January 29th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-29 03:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29074622d61ba0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969656/punjab-wants-sc-to-review-fornication-other-lessened-sentences' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab wants SC to review ‘fornication’, other lessened sentences</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court faces fresh challenges from the Punjab government to its criminal jurisprudence, which has resulted in several commuted sentences, with the latest filing by the prosecutor general questioning the judgement that turned a rape conviction into a fornication charge.
The substituting of the sentence of rape with less punishment sparked considerable controversy, with rights organisations including the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) criticising the verdict.
One of the judges on the bench, however, had dissented from the majority ruling passed on Dec 2, 2025.
Filed by Additional Prosecutor General, Pun­jab, Ahmad Raza Gilani, the petition under Article 188 of the Constitution has pleaded before the SC to revisit its decision and restore the conviction and sentence of the respondent under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
“The impugned judgment is profoundly stigmatic, casting a permanent shadow over the victim and her entire family for generations to come,” the review petition regretted, adding such an approach runs contrary to the principles of justice, dignity and victim protection and with respect calls for clear judicial disapproval.
Headed by Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aqeel Ahm­ed Abbasi and Justice Salahuddin Panwhar, the SC on an appeal of Hassan Khan against Dec 18, 2018 rejection of his plea by the Lahore High Court (LHC) had commuted the sentence of the convict from 20 years of imprisonment to five years after reclassifying the offence from rape to consensual extramarital affair.
Whereas Justice Panhwar had rejected the appeal by holding that sexual harassment often went unreported in society where victims were fearful of the consequences.
“This is unusual that Punjab government has come in review by filing a set of petitions, since the State usually restrains itself from moving review petitions against the SC decisions in criminal cases,” said a senior counsel on condition of anonymity, also recalling that the last such review petition was filed by the Punjab government in 2015 against the SC judgement in Mujahid versus the State where a three-judge bench had held that DNA was not permissible evidence.
Against the fornication judgement, the Punjab prosecution department argued in its review petition that in the cases of sexual violence, delay in reporting the crime and absence of marks of violence did not carry significant importance.
Citing the 2011 Mukhtaran Mai case, the review petition recalled how the SC had held that delay in reporting rape was natural due to trauma, fear and social stigma. Thus, it claimed, the delay of reporting crime after seven months of occurrence in the present case must not have material bearing on the prosecution case when even a child’s birth from rape was established. The review petition pleaded that if the judges in the present case differed with earlier SC judgements, then it would be appropriate to send the matter to the chief justice for the constitution of a larger bench so that one authoritative verdict should come.
The petition regretted that one of the distressing aspects of the case was that a child was born as the result of the nefarious act, but the SC failed to address or clarify the legal and social status of the child. While imputing criminality to the victim, it added, the SC also failed to appreciate the extraordinary hardship faced by the victim’s family in coming forward with a visibly pregnant victim to seek justice. While the SC was not empowered to record conviction in deviation from the prescribed mandatory mode of taking cognizance it departed from the mandatory provisions and converted the conviction and sentence under Section 376 to Section 496-B of the PPC.
Therefore, the judgement is void ab initio, constitutes an error apparent on face of the record and therefore required to be rectified within contemplation of Article 188 (review jurisdiction).
In another petition, the Punjab prosecution department has requested the SC to revisit the Nov 25, 2025 decision in which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim had converted the death sentence of Shahzad Liaquat to 20 years of life imprisonment on the grounds that the convict had no prior planning or intention to commit the murder.
Case of 16 murders
Likewise, the prosecution department in yet another review petition contended before the SC to review its Nov 10, 2025 ruling in which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan had ordered that the sentences of convict Muhammad Ishaq for murdering 16 persons in Bahawalpur would run concurrently.
The review petition pleaded that the courts were required to examine gravity of actions and while directing the sentences to run concurrently, it awarded the sentence of life imprisonment to the murderer of 16 persons as if he had killed one person. It urged the apex court to restore the death sentence earlier awarded by the trial court.

GILGIT / ISLAMABAD: The difficulties of Gilgit-Baltistan residents intensified on Wednesday as snowfall disconnected road access to remote areas, with temperatures dropping below minus 15 degrees Celsius in the region. As freezing temperatures persisted, people took to the streets to protest prolonged power outages.
A patient in Astore allegedly died due to the unavailability of transportation facilities for treatment.
A fresh spell of snowfall on Monday and Tuesday brought life to a standstill across parts of GB amid freezing temperatures, power outages and road closures. The suffering of residents due to snow, harsh weather, lack of electricity and other basic facilities continued in remote areas on Wednesday.
Police said up to six inches of snow was recorded in parts of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang, Hunza, Nagar and Ghizer, disrupting routine life and making travel hazardous.
Locals said a patient from the Mirmalik area of Astore was being shifted on foot to Rattu hospital after roads were blocked by snowfall, but he died before reaching the hospital.
According to a statement issued by the Astore assistant commissioner, locals attempted to shift a patient from Chamriot to a nearby hospital.
Following the information, a rescue team comprising the Astore Disaster Management District assistant director, two doctors and a snow-cutter machine was dispatched. The team reached Dadujil after clearing the road, but doctors confirmed that the patient had died four to five hours earlier.
Officials of the GB Communications and Works Department said the Karakoram Highway, Ghizer-Shandur road, Astore Valley road and Baltistan road were opened for traffic in the evening.
Travellers were advised to exercise caution as snowfall had made roads slippery and hazardous.

Confined to homes
Residents in remote areas remained confined to their homes due to blocked roads, freezing temperatures and unavailability of electricity and firewood.
Shafqat Hussain, a resident of Astore, said there was fear of food shortages in snow-hit areas if roads were not opened urgently.
Upper areas of Skardu, Ghanche, Ghizer, Hunza, Nagar and Shigar were also facing communication disruptions, road closures and electricity shortages.
Residents were facing water shortage as pipelines and streams froze, forcing people, particularly women, to fetch water from distant places.
In the border area of Dansar Thang in Kharmang district, heavy snowfall created a severe drinking water crisis. Locals said women were forced to fetch water from dangerous mountain routes four kilometres away. They demanded emergency provision of clean drinking water and basic health facilities.
Residents in the Nilt area of Nagar district staged a protest by blocking the Karakoram Highway for several hours.
Protesters said the area had been without electricity for several days. They added that residents already faced daily power outages of up to 20 hours, but electricity had been completely unavailable for the last few days.
Similar demonstrations were held in Gilgit’s Basin area, as well as in Ghanche, Ghizer and Diamer.
The Provincial Emergency Operation Centre, GB, issued an alert warning of widespread rain, thunderstorms and snowfall from Jan 30 to Feb 2. It cautioned about extremely cold temperatures, avalanche risks, landslides, road closures and hazardous travel conditions, advising residents to remain alert and travellers to avoid non-essential travel during heavy snowfall.
Meanwhile, temperatures in major urban centres of the country varied on Wednesday morning. Islamabad and Pesha­war recorded five degrees Cels­ius, while Lahore was at 10 degrees.
In the south, Karachi’s temperature was 12 degrees Celsius. Colder conditions prevailed in northern areas, with Quetta recording minus five degrees Celsius, Murree minus one and Muzaffarabad zero degrees Celsius.

ISLAMABAD: After a suspension of nearly two years amid a “mistaken identity” controversy, Sadaf Ihsan was reinstated on Wednesday as a member of the National Assembly on a reserved seat for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, drawing condemnation from Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which termed the decision “unjust” and “biased”.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued a notification restoring its March 4, 2024, declaration of Ms Ihsan as the returned candidate, shortly after a full bench rejected petitions filed by JUI-F and Hina Bibi for being “devoid of merits and facts”.
The controversy surfaced after the ECP’s March 4, 2024, notification, when the JUI-F disowned Ms Ihsan and claimed it had not fielded her as a candidate, alleging impersonation and insisting its priority list carried the name “Sadaf Yasmeen” rather than “Sadaf Ihsan”.
The ECP suspended Ms Ihsan’s victory notification on March 11, 2024. The matter was later remanded to the commission by the Federal Constitutional Court on Dec 24, 2025, with directions to decide it afresh within a month.
In its order, the ECP noted that counsel for the JUI-F had argued that a political party could not object to an alleged wrong entry in nomination papers, or to the acceptance or rejection of a candidate’s nomination papers, as no remedy was provided under the law.
The commission rejected the contention, saying the law allowed a voter of the constituency, an objector or an appellate tribunal, upon receiving information from any source, to raise objections or file an appeal regarding acceptance or rejection of nomination papers.
The ECP observed that the party could have approached the commission earlier but did so after a “considerable delay”, and said it was the duty of political parties to prepare reserved-seat priority lists with due diligence on the prescribed Form-66 under the Election Rules, 2017.
It said the returning officer had given the JUI-F an opportunity to submit a properly drafted list, but the party, in its second submission, corrected only three names at serial numbers 1 to 3 and again left the name of “Sadaf Yasmeen” incomplete.
The order also noted that Hina Bibi, who was on the priority list and had pursued her case regarding acceptance of nomination papers up to the Supreme Court, did not raise an objection to the acceptance of Ms Ihsan’s nomination papers.
The commission also questioned the existence of “Sadaf Yasmeen”, observing that she did not appear before any forum, including an inquiry committee and the Supreme Court, despite notices. It said her counsel appeared before the commission on the last date of hearing without notice and submitted a power of attorney.
The ECP also noted that two different copies of Ms Yasmeen’s identity card had been submitted, showing different temporary and permanent addresses and different issuance dates.
It observed that Ms Yasmeen was not a voter of the constituency at the time the party submitted its list as she was a resident of Karachi’s East district and that her identity card details were changed on Feb 18, 2025, about a year after the 2024 general elections.
Rejecting the JUI-F’s claim that Ms Ihsan was an “alien” to the party, ECP said Ms Ihsan had been a JUI-F member since 2018 and that original documents regarding her membership were provided by an authorised representative of the party.
According to the order, Ms Ihsan appeared in the party’s 2018-19 membership list at serial number 4 with membership number 506,885 and held a membership card. The commission said membership cards of 29 other members of her family were also produced, including her mother, father, brother, sister-in-law and brother-in-law.
‘Unjust, biased’ decision
Meanwhile, JUI-F has criticised the ECP decision to reinstate Sadaf Ihsan as an MPA on a reserved seat allocated to the party. In a statement, JUI-F spokesperson Aslam Ghauri said the decision was regrettable. “We are being forced to accept a stranger in our parliamentary party,” he said, calling the decision unjust, biased and “contrary to the electoral system in the country”.
The spokesperson alleged that the ECP had ignored an order of the Peshawar High Court and referred the matter to a tribunal, which he said was tantamount to making “a mockery of the Constitution and law”. He claimed the party’s reserved seat had been awarded to “a stranger” instead of a party candidate, describing it as a “daylight robbery” of the party’s mandate.
The party also faces an internal disciplinary matter in the Senate after it terminated the basic membership of Senator Ahmed Khan for supporting a government-sponsored bill against party lines.

In a three-page statement, Somiya Arshad requested the FCC to order the formation of a comprehensive, independent judicial commission with international observers to probe all aspects of the case, including pre-murder threats, coordinated FIRs, nominated accused, institutional links and any transnational involvement.
On Jan 14, the FCC had dropped hints about closing the suo motu proceedings, observing that the court’s facilitation had already borne fruit with the signing of a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) agreement between the governments of Pakistan and Kenya in September last year.
Arshad Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple sedition cases were registered against him in different cities.
In the fresh application, Somiya Arshad also requested the FCC to order the immediate sharing of the report of the Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT), constituted by the government, along with all related investigation documents, with the family.

 

The statement further urged the FCC to issue directions for the summoning and questioning of nine individuals nominated by the late mother of the slain journalist, as well as relevant officials identified in the fact-finding report prepared by a two-member team.
It also asked the FCC to ensure the sealing and confiscation of properties linked to the prime accused and to expedite action under the MLA agreement.
The statement read that the indications given by the FCC on Jan 14 suggested that the proceedings might be nearing closure. However, it added that any premature closure would deny justice and undermine public confidence in the rule of law, especially given the slow progress of the investigation, lack of family access to key reports and unaddressed nominations of accused persons.

In a statement, the power division said the minister had taken notice of the “non-crediting of units of net-metering consumers under PPMC instructions”, which had been reviewed “with immediate effect”.
Informed sources said power distribution companies (Discos) had complained that some net-metered solar consumers — commonly referred to as “prosumers” — had installed solar systems significantly larger than permitted under the rules, which allow generation capacity up to 150 per cent of sanctioned load. The Discos argued that such installations created challenges for grid stability and financials.
They said the PPMC had directed Discos and the Power Information Technology Company (PITC), which handles billing for all Discos, to stop counting export units for consumers found to have exceeded the allowed capacity, instead of denying the benefit of only extra units exported beyond the authorised capacity.

Leghari intervenes as govt comes under criticism for violating its own policy

Sources said implementation of the directive led to the blocking of credit for all exported units for affected consumers, including a number of influential politicians and businessmen, among them leading parliamentarians.

 

Most of them belonged to Lahore, where the Lahore Electric Supply Company’s first billing cycle immediately coincided with the application of PPMC’s notification, followed by other Discos as well.
A large number of bills on the first three days after the Jan 23 notification caused a lot of hue and cry in Lahore, although there were fewer complaints in other Discos, including Islamabad Electric.
The power minister had to intervene for damage control as the government came under criticism for violating its own policy for renewable energy through a unilateral notification without stakeholder consultation or approval from any competent forum.
Mr Leghari directed that consumers who had already received their bills should be corrected in next month’s billing and stop issuing fresh bills to remaining consumers at the outset. In addition, only extra units beyond authorised capacity should not be credited in favour of prosumers.
The power division said some net metering consumers had installed systems with capacities exceeding the approved limit under their licences for distributed generation capacity.
“Last month, a number of such consumers were not given any credit for the electricity sold to the national grid,” it confirmed and conceded that “this practice was not correct”.
Mr Leghari reiterated commitment to securing consumers’ rightful entitlements without any compromise, the statement said. Under the revised directives, only those units exceeding the approved capacity will not be credited.
Units exported to the national grid within the approved capacity would now be credited accordingly as before, it said, adding that instructions had been issued to all Discos for implementation.
“For consumers whose net metering units were not credited in their bills, the relevant adjustments will be made in the next billing cycle,” it said.

The department updated its travel advisory for Pakistan on Jan 26, advising travellers to think twice before visiting due to crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and the risk of kidnapping. 
Pakistan has been placed under a Level 3 advisory, a category that indicates a high risk where terrorist attacks may occur without warning. According to the State Department, typical targets include “transportation hubs, hotels, markets, shopping malls, military and security sites, airports, trains, schools, hospitals, places of worship, tourist locations, and government buildings”.
Some regions, including parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have been designated Level 4: Do Not Travel areas. 
The advisory urges US citizens not to travel to Level 4 areas “for any reason”, warning that assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, particularly against government officials and private citizens. The warning also applies to US citizens of Pakistani origin.
The State Department noted that local laws prohibit demonstrations without a permit and warned that “US citizens have been detained for participating” in such activities.
A Level 3 advisory indicates “serious risks to safety”, and travelers are advised to reconsider their travel plans. Level 4 is the highest advisory level and discourages all travel.

Speaking to the media, Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran said that the body was found from the disposal station on Outfall Road.
Asked about the various reports about the water flow not being fast enough to carry away a person, he said, “You should also look at the time difference. When it happened, the water flow was fast; those are peak hours.”
He said that the water flow receded as the night progressed.
Asked whether the family would register a case, Kamran said, “Whatever the family says and whatever their opinion is, we will act according to that.”
Meanwhile, Lahore Operations SSP Mohammad Tauqir told Dawn that police had taken the woman’s husband into custody, adding that he was the one who had alleged that his wife had fallen into the sewerage line along with their minor daughter at around 7:30pm.
He said the police were questioning the husband. “It would be premature to say she was murdered or died in an accident,” he said.
According to the official, the husband was taken into custody on the statement of the woman’s father who alleged that the couple was not on good terms for the past few months.
The SSP said that the deceased woman’s father had expressed his doubts over the role of her husband, who had called Rescue 1122 and alerted it about his wife falling down the sewerage pipeline along with their minor daughter.
“We are investigating the case and will share more details once it is completed,” he said, adding that the minor girl was still missing.
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and constituted a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter and submit a report within 24 hours.
It should also be mentioned that two officials of Tepa, a subsidiary of the Lahore Development Authority, were placed under suspension with immediate effect “on account of an incident [regarding] uncovered manholes”.
Earlier in the day, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson had said that teams were dispatched immediately after receiving a report of the incident and launched a vigorous search operation after receiving reports of the incident.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.
The same month, a three-year-old boy’s body was recovered from an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.

Nipah, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.
It is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organisation (WHO) because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40 per cent to 75pc, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.
The measures taken by authorities in Pakistan coincide with those taken multiple other countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia — after India confirmed the detection of two cases in December last year.
In this connection, the Border Health Services-Pakistan (BHS-P) — an ancillary department of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination — issued an advisory which referred to a regional alert reported by international and regional public health surveillance mechanisms, including the WHO South East Asia Region Epidemiological Bulletin.
Citing the alert, the advisory said in view of the “suspected cases of Nipah virus infection in West Bengal, India, and considering the high case fatality rate, zoonotic nature, and potential for human-to-human transmission, it has become imperative to further strengthen preventive and surveillance measures at Pakistan’s borders”.
“In order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus in Pakistan and to ensure early detection and prompt response, the competent authority has decided to enforce strict and enhanced health surveillance at all points of entry with immediate effect.
“These instructions shall be applicable to all points of entry, including international airports, seaports, and ground/ land border crossings, without any exception,” the advisory said.
Outlining the instructions, the advisory said all in-charges at entry points should ensure 100pc screening of all arriving passengers, transit passengers, crew members, drivers, helpers, and support staff.
“No individual shall be allowed entry into Pakistan without health clearance by BHS-P,” it said.
Under the new measures, mandatory verification of the country of origin and complete travel and transit history for the preceding 21 days shall be carried out for each and every traveller, irrespective of their nationality or travel status.
“All in-charges at points of entry shall exercise special vigilance for travellers originating from, or transiting through, Nipah-affected or high-risk regions. Any false declaration, concealment, or misreporting of travel history shall be immediately documented and reported to the competent authorities for further necessary action,” the advisory stated.
Moreover, travellers are also required to undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at entry points.
“Screening staff shall remain alert for early signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection, including fever, headache, respiratory symptoms and neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness or altered consciousness.
“Any individual consistent with suspected Nipah virus case definition shall be immediately isolated at the point of entry, restricted from onward movement, and managed strictly in accordance with infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols,” it was instructed in the advisory.
Such suspected cases should be promptly referred to the designated isolation facility or a tertiary care hospital in coordination with provincial and district health authorities, the advisory said, adding that the “conveyance concerned (aircraft, vessel, vehicle) and surrounding area shall be immediately disinfected as per approved standard operating procedures”.
In-charges at entry points have been further directed to ensure strict compliance with IPC measures, including the mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, and environmental sanitation.
Any lapse in surveillance or IPC practices should be treated as serious negligence, the advisory said.
Moreover, “daily case/ nil reports from all points of entry shall be recorded in the BHS-P system already in vogue and shared with National Command and Operation Centre and the National International Health Regulation Focal Point”.
Any delay, weak surveillance, under-reporting, or non-compliance with these instructions should not be tolerated, the advisory stated.
“All in-charges at points of entry are directed to ensure strict compliance with the above instructions in letter and spirit. These measures shall remain in force until further orders are issued by the competent authority,” it added.
Separately, the National Institute of Health (NIH) also issued an alert to health departments, healthcare providers, and BHS-P regarding the potential threat of Nipah virus spillover into Pakistan.
The alert said that while Pakistan had not yet reported a human case, a significant situation was emerging in South Asia.
“As of January 2026, an outbreak has been confirmed in West Bengal, India. […] Due to its high case fatality rate ranging from 40pc to 75pc and the potential for human-to-human transmission, health authorities are placing the region on high alert,” it added.
According to the advisory, there was currently no specific anti-viral treatment or licensed vaccine available for the virus.
Management remains primarily supportive and focuses on symptomatic treatment, including management of fever, respiratory distress, and neurological complications,” it said.
“Severely ill patients often require hospitalisation and may need intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation. The clinical effectiveness of ribavirin (broad-spectrum antiviral medication) remains inconclusive and it is not routinely recommended,” it said.
It urged travellers to avoid contact with symptomatic individuals or contaminated materials.
“Travellers returning from affected areas within 21 days who develop symptoms should self-isolate, seek medical attention, and inform the provider of their travel history and exposure,” it said.
It further directed the provincial health department to designate at least one tertiary-care hospital or infectious disease unit for the isolation and clinical management of cases.
It also urged provincial public laboratories to review and strengthen their capability for safe sample handling and transportation. Further, it directed that rapid response teams be placed on standby for case investigation, contact tracing, and coordinated field response for any cluster of acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).
It further said that provinces with international airports or land border points needed to main realtime communication with BHS-P for any alerts or travellers requiring follow-up.
‘Risk in Pakistan minimal’
Talking to Dawn, Microbiologist Prof Dr Javaid Usman said that the virus was named after a place in Malaysia.
“The virus is spread through the droppings of fruit bats and pigs,” he said. He further said that if cases were reported in Pakistan, it would be through carriers.
“Currently, a few cases have been reported in the Indian state of Bengal due to which neighbouring countries have announced to screen their masses,” he said.
Replying to a question, he said that the major symptoms of the virus included fever and neurological disorders.
“People can have fits. The virus can spread through respiratory droplets, saliva and the blood of a patient who has tested positive. So positive samples are kept in isolation,” Dr Usman said.
Chief of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan, told Dawn that this was the 51st outbreak since 2001.
“Although we have issued advisories to alert airport authorities, there are very few chances of identifying patients as the incubation period of the virus is 9 to 14 days,” he said.
Infectious disease expert Dr Rana Safdar told Dawn that Nipah virus was listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen due to a high fatality rate (up to 80pc).
“Its progression is therefore being closely monitored. While efforts are underway, to date no effective vaccine or treatment is available so the management of infected cases is largely supportive,” he added.
Dr Safdar said, since its identification in 1998, the outbreaks of Nipah virus had been sporadically occurring in South and Southeast Asia, largely in rural settings. Countries which have previously reported outbreaks include Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Bangladesh and India, he said.
“While the principle ‘infectious diseases respect no boundaries’, holds, due to the peculiar transmission dynamics, the risk of spread to surrounding countries thus far remains moderate to low. Given the current outbreak in India’s West Bengal and the associated media hype, there is no reason to panic as the risk of the virus in Pakistan stays minimal,” he said.
“While executing preventive measures, it’s important to consider that the usually deployed passenger screening at airports does not help much in preventing virus importation. We otherwise need to remain prepared, anticipating and mapping risk and enhancing vigilance in identified vulnerable zones,” Dr Safdar said.

A week after Trump formally introduced the initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the body launched an official account on the social media platform X.
A post on Wednesday said that the Board “welcomes Pakistan as a founding member of our growing international organisation”.







The list of founding members also includes Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Albania, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, El Salvador, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, spanning the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caucasus.
Notably absent from the list are major European countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, amid sharp disagreements with Trump on issues including Greenland and tariff policies, which have strained relations between Washington and several European capitals.
Ukraine questioned how it could participate alongside Russia and Belarus.
Belarus accepted the invitation to join, while Russia was not included in the board, despite President Vladimir Putin saying Moscow was ready to allocate $1 billion from Russian assets frozen by the previous US administration to the body’s budget.
Trump rescinded Canada’s invitation, citing Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which he warned against economic coercion by major powers.
Trump announced the establishment of the Board of Peace on January 15 as part of his broader plan for Gaza, under which the ceasefire agreement was reached. The board was authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2803 in November 2025.
The board was originally conceived to oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, but its charter expands its mandate to peace-building in all areas affected by or at risk of conflict.
Further details on the board’s mandate, leadership structure, and timeline for implementation have yet to be formally announced.</p><small>2026-01-28 15:58</small></div><hr>
