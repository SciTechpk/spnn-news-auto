<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/692f8f5b7c1d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958893/undermining-the-federal-compact' target='_blank'><strong>Undermining the federal compact</strong></a><br><p>BARELY had the ink dried on the 27th Ame­ndment that talk of the 28th began. Were it to be passed, the much-discussed 28th amendment would purportedly strip away constitutional protection for provincial shares under the seventh NFC award. This fits a long-standing agenda: the PML-N, the PTI, the establishment and international lenders have all argued that Islamabad needs a larger slice of the divisible pool. But to revisit the vertical distribution of resources through opaque bargaining, arm-twisting and political engineering is not a technical tweak. It strikes at the core of Pakistan’s federal compact and carries grave implications for provincial aut­o­nomy, federal cohesion and human development.
Supporters of the proposed amendment adv­ance three main arguments. First, they say the seventh NFC award shifted an unduly large share of the divisible pool to the provinces without a matching transfer of expenditure responsibilities. Second, they argue that easy access to federal transfers has created a ‘moral hazard’, thus dulling incentives for provinces to broaden their tax base. Third, they accuse provincial governments of wasteful and politically motivated spending on salaries and discretionary development schemes, with little improvement in public services.
Some of these concerns are not entirely without merit. In Balochistan, for instance, the development budget is formulated and implemented almost entirely on the basis of political considerations. Over time, development spending has become deeply inefficient, with members of the provincial assembly exercising sweeping control over the public financial management cycle and allegedly using development funds for corruption, patronage and narrowly targeted goods rather than for strengthening public services. Similar practices can, in varying degrees, be observed in the other provinces as well.
However, Pakistan’s fiscal woes predate the seventh NFC Award. Cutting provincial allocations will not, by itself, resolve them. The deeper problem lies in stagnant productivity, a narrow and weakly documented tax base and the failure to build institutional capacity for capturing emerging sources of revenue. Admittedly, both the federation and the provinces have underperformed in expanding the tax net. Tax-to-GDP ratios for both tiers of government have fallen in recent years, reflecting deeply ingrained structural weaknesses.

 

Nor can Pakistan afford to squeeze social spending further. The country already trails regional peers on key human development indicators. Cutting the provincial share would directly undermine their capacity to invest in education, health and social protection. Experience suggests that when more resources are channelled to the centre, they tend to fund defence and elite-centric subsidies rather than classrooms and clinics. Smaller provinces such as Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa already devote a large share of their budgets to security, including allowances to federal law enforcement agencies called in aid of civilian forces. In Balochistan, for instance, spending on law and order is now believed to exceed that on both school education and health, and has grown far faster than either in the years since the 18th Amendment. Further cuts to the provincial share of the divisible pool would push human development even further down the list of national priorities.

Rather than curtailing transfers, a more promising approach is to redesign the fiscal framework to reward performance.

Rather than curtailing transfers, a more promising approach is to redesign the fiscal framework to reward performance. The introduction of outcomes-based indicators in horizontal distribution criteria could better incentivise improvements in both provincial revenue mobilisation and socioeconomic indicators. By linking a portion of fiscal transfers to improvements in key social indicators and to credible fiscal effort, the proposed amendment would directly address the moral hazard built into unconditional transfers while keeping decision-making closer to citizens. Provinces that broaden their tax base and deliver better results in social sectors can be incentivised to receive a larger share of incremental resources.
Inefficiency in provincial spending, meanwhile, does not automatically justify a return to centralised control. There is no assurance that federal spending on social sectors is more efficient, equitable or insulated from patronage. Islamabad’s own development portfolio has often been criticised for weak fiscal discipline and politically motivated projects. The limited impact of development spending reflects a patronage-driven political economy that operates at both the federal and provincial levels. The recent IMF report underscores these systemic governance weaknesses and persistent corrupt practices. Recentralisation would simply reproduce these distortions at the centre while weakening provincial ownership of service delivery.
Additionally, there is a dire need for the federal government to withdraw from areas the Cons­titution has already devolved. The fiscal squeeze is aggravated by Islamabad’s insistence on retaining large ministries and programmes in sectors such as health and education whose mandate, after the 18th Amendment, should largely be limited to coordination. Similarly, the federal government also spends significant resources from the federal PSDP on projects of a ‘provincial nature’. A 2023-24 review by the Planning Commission revealed that provincially oriented projects accounted for one-third of the total federal PSDP. The centre also finances devolved subjects outside the PSDP through vertical programmes such as polio, adding to its burden. Islamabad is thus attempting to perform tasks beyond its constitutional remit and then citing fiscal stress as justification for clawing back provincial shares.
As talk of a 28th amendment gathers pace, parliament must weigh the long-term consequences of diluting or removing constitutional protections for provincial finances. The seventh NFC award and the 18th Amendment were crucial steps towards a workable federal compact. Fiscal engineering, from levies (petroleum) kept outside the divisible pool to tweaks in sales tax, has already eroded provincial trust. Unpicking that settlement through contentious constitutional fixes would be a serious mistake. A sounder course is to reform tax policy, enforce discipline on federal and provincial spending, and embed performance-based criteria in the NFC formula as well as inter-organisational resource allocation.

Published in Dawn, December 3rd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-03 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958896/in-words-only' target='_blank'><strong>In words only</strong></a><br><p>NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq seems to have taken serious affront to combative remarks made by Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, which the former criticised on Monday as “irresponsible and provocative”. To recap, Mr Achakzai is said to have made a statement challenging the proceedings of the House and suggesting they could be disrupted by public pressure.
As custodian of the House, Mr Sadiq responded sharply, asserting that “It is my responsibility to protect parliament”, and stating that “such thinking and statements must be collectively discouraged to ensure parliament’s supremacy, preservation of the constitutional system and protection of democratic traditions”, according to remarks paraphrased in a recent news report. Thankfully, the matter did not go beyond verbal sparring, and Mr Sadiq prudently blocked voting on a proposed resolution condemning Mr Achakzai’s statement and seeking his disqualification, though he allowed it to be read out.
Yet a broader question arises: is the sanctity of parliament something to be invoked only rhetorically, or is it ever to be upheld in practice as well? Consider, for example, the way the National Assembly is being run. After losing their erstwhile leader in August to a May 9 case, the opposition had collectively nominated Mr Achakzai as its representative leader in the House. Instead of honouring the nomination, however, Mr Sadiq has refused to notify Mr Achakzai as opposition leader, and on Monday quickly interrupted when Mr Achakzai was described as such, saying he, as Speaker of the House, did not recognise him in that capacity.
It does not behove the Speaker or his office to thwart the opposition in this manner. It has been widely speculated that certain quarters view Mr Achakzai as ‘undesirable’ for his political stance. The Speaker’s apparent acquiescence in this view does little to enhance the credibility of his office or the standing of parliament.

 

Consider also the manner in which parliament has legislated sweeping and far-reaching changes to Pakistan’s laws in recent years. Many would agree that there was very little that was dignified about the manner in which the 26th Amendment was passed. The same can be said for the 27th. When an institution repeatedly described as ‘supreme’ is perceived as playing more of a validating role, it can hardly expect the genuine respect its office-bearers demand for it.
The opposition, too, must reflect on its conduct. The main opposition party seems preoccupied with its jailed leader: its representatives show very little care for their responsibilities as public representatives and remain fixated on a single-point agenda. A parliament distracted by personal battles and narrow agendas cannot hope to command public respect. The people deserve a legislature that takes itself seriously. If our elected representatives expect dignity for parliament, they must first demonstrate it through their own actions.

The mounting tension between the provincial and federal governments appears to have reached a critical point. Recent statements by some government ministers indicate that the option is being seriously considered.
Any such move would plunge the country deeper into crises, with far-reaching political and security consequences. The shrinking democratic space in the country has already created a volatile situation and the ongoing politics of confrontation could derail the entire system. Can the country, which is facing multiple internal and external security challenges, afford such a reckless action?
Among the reasons cited by the federal government for this potential move are security and governance problems in KP. It may be true that the strategically located province is facing perhaps its worst security challenge in a decade, with terrorism claiming hundreds of lives, but the main responsibility of this worsening security situation lies with the federal government and security establishment. The pretext of bad governance is equally spurious with conditions in the other provinces hardly enviable.
It is all about power politics and pushing the PTI government in KP to the wall. For over a year now, the establishment-backed federal government has done everything it can to destabilise the PTI government that still enjoys a dominant presence in the KP Assembly, despite being denied its share of reserved seats for women and the minorities.

Any move to impose governor’s rule in KP could plunge the country further into crises.

With a new and more hard-line chief minister now at the helm, the confrontation between the provincial and federal governments has come to a head. The potential imposition of governor’s rule in the province reflects the desperation of the hybrid set-up that has failed to subdue the provincial government. But any drastic action against an administration that still enjoys popular support will unravel the situation in a region experiencing rising militancy and war-like conditions on the western border.

 

Most alarming is the growing alienation of the local population with the state, particularly in the districts most affected by militancy. There is a complete breakdown of administrative control in these areas because of the prevailing tension between the provincial government and the establishment — a situation which ends up providing greater space to the terrorist groups now operating with impunity. The recent attack on the FC headquarters in Peshawar shows the growing capacity of these groups to carry out such audacious strikes even in a high-security zone.
Who is to be blamed for this security failure? Certainly not the ill-equipped and highly demoralised civilian law enforcers. The growing trust gap between the state and public has been a major factor in the virtual collapse of security in the province.
Moreover, comments by the ISPR head on a ‘political-criminal nexus’ have been widely interpreted as linking the provincial political leadership with militant and criminal groups, contributing to perceptions of the establishment being involved in the Islamabad-Peshawar face-off. This can end up widening the trust deficit instead of uniting the people against an existentialist threat and give the impression of a state estranged from its own people.
The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and terrorist sanctuaries based in the latter country have directly affected KP. The province has a long border and ethnic-based connections with Afgha­nistan. Thus, the mounting Pak-Afghan tensions have a direct bearing on KP politics and society. The closing of the borders has massively affected business and trade in the province. But have the state institutions and federal government recognised these concerns of the local population?
While one can dispute the PTI’s position on dealing with Afghanistan’s backing of the TTP, the stance of the provincial government over the forced expulsion of those Afghan refugees who were born and/or lived in this country for almost three generations is not unreasonable as is being portrayed by the federal government. In fact, the government’ arbitrary decision to expel them and the closure of trade has turned Afghan public sentiments against this country, which, in turn, has been exploited by the Afghan Taliban administration.
There is an urgent need for the establishment and the federal government to review their Afg­han policy. Certain public statements made by the defence minister and some other Pakistani officials using strong language for the Afghans has not only infuriated the people across the western border but also many Pakhtuns in this country.
But the root of the confrontation lies in the diminishing democratic space and rising authoritarianism in the country. With the curbing of judicial autonomy through constitutional amendments, the government has closed the doors for any judicial recourse against extra-constitutional actions by the hybrid set-up. Denying incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan his constitutional right to a fair trial and not allowing him to meet his relatives and lawyers despite court orders has further fuelled the politics of confrontation between the centre and the KP government. The party in the province has now been taken over by the younger generation and more assertive elements who are not willing to accept the regime’s undemocratic actions.
With the establishment of a separate and evidently pliant constitutional court, the federal government now feels confident that its unconstitutional and undemocratic actions will not be struck down, thus making it easier to impose governor’s rule in KP. There seems to be no idea in powerful circles about the public reaction that such a move could trigger in the province.
The federal law minister appeared to defend governor’s rule, referring to it as a constitutional choice and not martial law. But the denial of democratic rights and the high-handedness of some powerful quarters is being regarded as no less than that. Suspending the provincial government would exacerbate public discontent, further destabilising the country.

KARACHI: The widespread outrage that the tragic death of a child, who drowned in an open manhole in Gulshan-i-Iqbal near Nipa, ignited has intensified, with political parties, civil society, and celebrities demanding answers, asking: “Who is responsible for this?”
Three-year-old Ibrahim fell in an uncovered manhole in front of a departmental store near Nipa on Sunday evening. The body was recovered after a 15-hour-long rescue operation on Monday.
By Tuesday evening, the manhole and the connected drain that had been dug up by rescuers to retrieve the body remained open, posing a threat to people.
Many parties held protests against the provincial administration on Tuesday and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign.

Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts

A lawyer moved a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan Town chairman, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) and Red Line contractor over their alleged negligence.

 

Another lawyer filed a petition before the Sindh High Court for a judicial inquiry.
Protests continue
The Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday staged a protest near Nipa against Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the Sindh government of Pakistan People Party (PPP) over the incident that claimed the life of the three-year-old a day earlier.
The protesters carrying placards and banners chanted slogans against the PPP government and demanded the mayor’s resignation.
Senior party leader and opposition leader in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin said Karachi had been “bleeding for long” and another innocent life had now been lost.
Those responsible, directly or indirectly, should be nominated in the FIR, he said, urging the Sindh chief minister to take serious action.
Also on Tuesday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders visited the area near Nipa and pointed out that the manhole was yet to be covered. They strongly condemned the inaction of the PPP-led provincial set-up and municipal authorities and demanded that lids be placed on all uncovered gutters across the metropolis.
Meanwhile, the Karachi Restoration Movement (KRM) demanded that an FIR for the alleged killing of Ibrahim be registered against the mayor.
Speaking at a press conference outside the KMC head office, KRM leaders said that as mayor — the “custodian and father of the city” — he must be held responsible.
They announced that their protest camps would continue across the city in mourning for Ibrahim and other children who had died in similar incidents, and that their campaign would continue until a case is registered and the mayor resigns.
Lawyers move courts
A lawyer on Tuesday filed an application before a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan town chairman, KWSC and the contractor of Red Line project over their alleged negligence.
Applicant Advocate Sheikh Saqib Ahmed filed the application under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code and submitted that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people have lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes.

 

He stated that after incident, he approached the Aziz Bhatti SHO for lodging an FIR under Section 322 (qatl-e-bis-sabab) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the proposed accused persons but the police refused to register the case.
Meanwhile, another lawyer filed a petition in the Sindh High Court seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the same incident by a district and sessions judge.
Petitioner Gulzar Nigar also sought directives for the mayor and all 25 town chairmen to file detailed reports about uncovered manhole trenches and pits in the city.
The petitioner also asked the SHC to further direct the respondents to formulate and implement a city-wide municipal safety and hazard prevention framework.
Social media outrage
Many X users framed Ibrahim’s death not as an unfortunate mishap, but as the latest example of systemic failure in the city.
One post captured the sentiment bluntly: “Imagine taking your child shopping and walking out with empty arms because the street itself swallowed him… This isn’t an ‘accident’; it is state-engineered negligence. Every open manhole in Karachi is a death trap waiting for another Ibrahim.”
Actor Mahira Khan called out “unimaginable apathy” after watching a “video of a mother helplessly screaming, crying for her baby”. All she could ask was, “Who the hell is responsible for Karachi?”
Sajal Ali criticised the city’s crumbling infrastructure and “collapsing, failed system”, saying she couldn’t imagine the parents’ pain as they waited for a miracle that never came because “there was no one to save him”.
She added that Karachi “carries the weight of millions yet receives no care in return”.
Adnan Siddiqui blamed the authorities who “couldn’t be bothered to cover a manhole”, calling the tragedy a “simple, preventable act of responsibility” and the indifference “as if human life means nothing here”.
Rapper Talha Yunus said, “My heart weeps and my blood is boiling; this is all the result of our government’s incompetence. 2026 is almost here and this is the state of our city. Curse you,” he said, offering condolences to the family.
Naumaan Ijaz also questioned the government’s priorities, saying, “Cameras worth millions have been installed [to give out] e-challans, but manhole covers were not installed to save someone’s life.”

At least 465 people were killed, according to disaster officials, with another 366 missing.
Sri Lanka’s Air Force has been combing the landslide-struck landscape, surveying the damage and ferrying food and other essential supplies to marooned residents. Tho­ugh the rain has stop­ped, recovery has just begun.

 

As the first journalist for foreign media to join a relief mission over the tea-growing region, photographer Ishara Kodikara saw a swathe of the country destroyed after slips of soil flattened everything in their paths, including roads and the vehicles that were on them.
The roof of some houses peaked through the mud, while the rest of the buildings were swallowed by the torrents of soil unleashed by Cyclone Ditwah.
Jagged tears in the mountainsides revealed churned-up expanses of earth, with a few patches of the lush vegetation still clinging nearby in stark contrast. There was no sign of human life in the wrecked landscape.
In the central Welimada area, now inaccessible to heavy vehicles, rescue workers pulled 11 bodies from the mud on Monday and appealed for help to search for dozens more.
In some places, entire slopes have been sheared away, leaving ochre wounds slicing through the dense plantation greenery.
The full extent of the damage to tea plantations, factories and tea pickers is not yet clear, but local media reported the industry has been hard hit. What were once thick, unbroken canopies of tea are now wide channels of mud and debris.

KARACHI: The city commissioner has informed the Sindh High Court that all milk samples collected from Karachi were found unfit for human consumption by the Pakistan Standards & Quality Control Authority.
The report, which was submitted on behalf of the commissioner, also said that presence of formalin in 22 samples and phosphate in eight samples indicated extensive adulteration.
It also maintained that there was no justification for any increase in the price of fresh milk particularly due to decline in consumption of milk related products in winter.

 

Citing the department of agriculture, supply and price, the commissioner and others as respondents, a petition was filed in 2023 by a dairy farmer impugning a notification about the official price of fresh milk fixed in October 2023.
A report on behalf of the commissioner of Karachi was placed before a two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry in compliance with the last court order.
The report said that the impugned notification as well as subsequent notifications were issued for revision of milk prices after due deliberations with all relevant stakeholders and in pursuant to court directives, various meetings were convened with all stakeholders to finalise milk prices.
However, it maintained that the hygiene practices and safety standards followed by wholesalers/farmers/retailers were hazardous to human health.
The report also said that an exercise of the quality checking of milk samples were conducted across the city on the request of a milk retailer association and the same were sent to the PSQCA for sampling.
“After testing, the PSQCA declared all the samples unfit for human consumption. In the meeting held on 20.11.2025, a representative of the PSQCA stated that due to unhygienic practices adopted by farmers, wholesalers and retailers, the milk was found unfit for human consumption. He further noted that the presence of formalin in 22 samples and phosphate in eight samples, indicates extensive adulteration”, it added.

 

The commissioner in his report further stated that in order to address the issue of adulteration, the milk sellers’ associations were instructed to formulate joint Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure proper hygiene and safety practices and the same were prepared and submitted to the commissioner office on Nov 25.
It maintained that in a meeting held on Nov 20, a representative of the bureau of supply & prices observed that there was no justification for any increase in milk prices at this stage particularly in view of the seasonal decline in the consumption of milk-related products in winter and anticipated that the prices were likely to decrease in the coming month.
Subsequently, the report also said that a fresh notification was issued on Nov 27, fixing the maximum retail price of fresh milk at Rs220 per litre and all the associations were instructed to adhere to the notified rates, maintain proper measurement practices and ensure quality strictly in accordance with the SOPs.
The bench in its order noted that since no one was present for the petitioner to dispute such reports, same were taken on record.
Earlier, the petitioner had stated that he was aggrieved by a notification issued on Oct 3, 2023 whereby milk price in a certain way per litre had been fixed by the provincial authorities which was less than the actual price as per formula devised by the government itself.
In May, the bench had directed the commissioner to consider representations/applications of all the stakeholders, including the petitioner, and provide them a fair and proper hearing and fix the milk price in Karachi in accordance with law and the formula already in existence within a period of one month.
Disposing of the petition, the bench had also directed the commissioner to file compliance report after one month through member inspection Team-I of SHC for perusal in the chamber.

The prime minister said this while presiding over a meeting of the working group on tax reforms. The huddle was part of a series of meetings held with the private sector experts’ working groups for national economic reforms, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.

 

During the meeting, PM Shehbaz said the government held the tax-paying businesses and companies in high regard, adding that only strong businesses and a robust economy could generate tax revenues.
“We desire to make business environment in the country better and more competitive through long-term measures. Since day one, the government has been taking practical steps for export-driven economic growth,” he added.
Ministers Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­ammad Aurangzeb, Ali Pervez Malik, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar and senior officials attended the meeting.
Chairman of the Working Group, Sheh­zad Saleem, also attended the meeting.
The meeting was given a comprehensive briefing on tax rates in various sectors, including the corporate sector.
Proposals regarding necessary tax ref­orms to support private sector developm­ent, increase exports and promote investment in the country were presented.
Recommendations were also shared on enhancing the competitiveness of the country’s business sector in the region.
The prime minister also expressed his gratitude to private sector experts for presenting comprehensive proposals, hinting that after due consideration, he would be forming a committee headed by the finance minister to make these proposals actionable.

ISLAMABAD: A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday sought relevant record from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) regarding the law degree of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan resumed the hearing of a petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood. Representatives of the legal fraternity, along with amicus curiae Barrister Zaffarullah Khan, also appeared before the bench.
During the proceedings, the petitioner urged the court to summon the academic record directly from Karachi University (KU), contending that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri had been cancelled by the university. The Sindh High Court (SHC), on a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri, had suspended KU’s order regarding the degree’s cancellation.
Chief Justice Dogar observed that since the HEC was the regulatory authority for universities, the bench would first examine the record provided by the commission before issuing any notice to KU.
The court also passed the direction to the HEC to appoint a senior officer for court’s assistance.
At this stage, a representative of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) drew the court’s attention to the council’s pending application seeking to become a party to the case. The bench assured the representative that the application would be considered and taken up in due course. The matter was subsequently adjourned.
The case has undergone a complex procedural trajectory since it first came before the court on September 16, when the same division bench initially took up the matter. At that hearing, the bench issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be examined.
The decision — issued without prior notice to the respondent — prompted considerable debate within the legal community.
The Supreme Court later intervened, and on September 29 set aside the IHC’s restraining order. A five-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan held that no high court could bar a sitting judge from performing judicial duties by granting interim relief.
The apex court emphasised that its ruling was confined to the legality of the interim order and did not touch upon the underlying merits of the petition.
During proceedings before the Sup­reme Court, Attorney General for Paki­stan Mansoor Usman Awan acknowledged that the petition raised an unprecedented legal question, as quo warranto proceedings against sitting judges were exceedingly rare.
He referred to the 1988 Malik Asad Ali judgement, in which the SC held that judges could not be rest­ra­ined from judicial functions through int­e­rim orders. The SC then asked the IHC to decide the objections raised to the petit­ion and proceed in this matter accordingly.

Criticising the rulers, he said a parliament formed through stolen mandates, money or influence had no authority to alter the basic structure of the Cons­t­i­tution.







Mr Achakzai was speaking at a public meeting held at Ayub Football Stadium on Tuesday to mark the 52nd death anniversary of Shaheed Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai. Leaders of various political parties attended the gathering and paid tributes to Khan Shaheed for his struggle against colonial rule, his efforts to strengthen democracy and work for people’s rights.

 

The PkMAP chief, who also heads the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), alleged that in order to secure a majority, state repression was unleashed against the PTI.
He claimed thousands of homes were raided, workers were tortured in police stations and detention centres, and even their dignity was violated. “Despite this, the public gave PTI the mandate, but instead of counting votes, candidates who came third or fou­rth were declared winners through tick-marking, while others were given victory in exchange for millions,” he alleged.
He added that when a majority still could not be achieved, opposition members were disqualified en masse through court rulings and their seats handed to the “fake government.”

“All six militants who attacked the FC fort have been killed by the security forces in the clearance operation,” officials said.
The militants barged into the compound on Sunday night after a suicide bomber detonated herself at the main gate of the fort. Security officials said they had killed three armed men instantly, while three managed to enter the building and take hostages.
The local residents said that the firing stopped on Tuesday morning, after which the authorities stated that the remaining assailants were killed in the late-night operation.
By the time this report went to press, there was no statement from the military’s media wing about the number of casualties in the attack.

These documents were signed during the ongoing visit of a Turkish delegation led by Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alparslan Bayraktar that had engagements with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik and Power Minister Awais Leghari on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Sharif witnessed the ceremony for the exchange of MoUs and agreements between Turkiye and Pakistan in the field of petroleum exploration, including the deed of assignment for Eastern Offshore Indus-C, the Petroleum Concession agreement Ziarat North Block, the Petroleum Concession agreement Sukhpur-II Block, the Petroleum Concession agreement Deep C block and the Offshore Deep F Block.







The premier underscored the historic and fraternal ties between the two nations and expressed satisfaction at the positive trajectory of bilateral relations and a strong desire and commitment to further expanding cooperation, particularly in the energy sector.

Companies reach exploration pacts for three offshore and two onshore fields

Mr Sharif and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed in June 2022 to expand bilateral trade to $5bn in three years from $1.1bn in 2021. The bilateral trade stood at $1.4bn in 2024.
He also emphasised the importance of expanding collaboration between Pakistan and Turkiye in the energy, petroleum, and mineral sectors, according to an official statement, noting with satisfaction that Turkish Petroleum had joined offshore and onshore exploration activities in Pakistan, marking a major milestone in bilateral energy cooperation.
The prime minister also extended an invitation to Turkish companies to increase their investment footprint in Pakistan’s energy market and called for the need to ensure close coordination between the two nations in view of the fast-evolving regional and global environment. The two sides agreed that a ministerial delegation from Pakistan will visit Turkiye soon to explore further cooperation in these fields.
The Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar informed the hosts that Turkiye was planning to develop additional ventures in partnership with Pakistan, particularly in oil & gas exploration, energy infrastructure, and the mining sector. “To achieve our shared goal of $5 billion in bilateral trade, significant contributions will come from deeper collaboration in energy and mining,” the visiting minister said.
He recalled his participation in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Conference early this year and noted Pakistan’s vast mineral potential. “That is why I have brought a Turkish mining company with me,” he said. “It is a milestone for Türkiye to enter the mining sector with Pakistan, and we look forward to building long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships”, he was quoted as saying.
Managing directors of Mari Energies, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) gave detailed presentations on their ongoing and planned projects and highlighted promising opportunities for Turkish counterparts for collaboration in oil and gas exploration, including those in shale gas and tight gas and mining and minerals, through joint venture and technology partners.
The visiting delegation also informed Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik that the office of Turkish Petroleum will be opened in Islamabad this month, where ten Turkish nationals will be working along with local staff. The two sides agreed to explore the concept of adopting a unified approach by incorporating a joint trading company for the procurement of petroleum to meet their respective energy requirements.
Both sides agreed to enhance investment facilitation and expand collaboration to unlock the full potential of Pakistan-Turkiye energy cooperation, according to the statement.
During these interactions, Power Minister Awais Leghari also invited Turkish experienced and reputable international private-sector investors in the bidding as Pakistan prepares for the privatisation of the first three Discos, an Expression of Interest for which will be invited shortly.

ISLAMABAD: Amid stiff opposition from both sides of the aisle, parliament on Tuesday passed by majority vote a bill to establish a statutory body to protect and promote the rights of minority communities in the country.
The opposition was based on fears that a provision giving the law an overriding effect would affect the anti-Ahmadiyya ordinance promulgated in 1984.
A motion seeking leave of the House to take up the bill for immediate consideration was opposed by around one-third of the members present in the joint sitting. A total of 160 members voted in favour of the bill while 79 opposed it.







The bill was, however, passed with certain amendments, including the omission of the clause giving it overriding effect and a change to withdraw the suo motu powers earlier proposed for the National Commission for Minorities’ Rights.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar tabled the bill amid outcry from some members, particularly those belonging to the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).
However, Mr Tarar made it clear that the bill would neither dilute the anti-Ahmadiyya provisions nor affect any court judgement. “Neither the law nor the Constitution, nor our conscience, allows us to make a proposal that contradicts the Holy Quran and Sunnah,” he remarked.
He said the Constitution and the state had declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, but they did not accept this and therefore did not fall within the ambit of the bill. He said that when the decision declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims was challenged, the Supreme Court had held that the protection under Article 20 of the Constit­ution was not available to those who did not recognise their non-Muslim status.
The minister said four amendments had been suggested to the original draft and these had been incorporated into the proposed legislation. Saying that minorities were defined as “non-Muslims” in the Constitution, he added: “This is a commission for non-Muslims. Our Hindu, Christian and Parsi brothers are as good Pakistanis as we are.”
Mr Tarar recalled that a 2014 Supreme Court judgement had called for the constitution of a commission for minorities. The matter had landed in the joint sitting after around 10 years, he added, before the debate on the bill began. He underlined that the proposed commission would not have punitive powers and would instead send its recommendations to the government.
“Our Christian, Hindu, Parsi, Sikh and other non-Muslim brothers and sisters deserve a forum to address issues — whether forced conversions, job quotas, sanitation workers’ rights or other matters of dignity,” he said.
Presidential assent
During the debate, PTI Chairman MNA Gohar Ali Khan pointed out that the bill had come to the joint session after the president returned it without giving his assent and with certain objections. “It should be seen why the president did not give his assent to the bill,” Mr Gohar said.
He pointed out that the president had objected to the proposed procedure for the removal of the chairperson and members of the commission on the pattern of superior court judges, as well as to the proposed powers of the commission to create and upgrade posts and maintain independent accounts.
The PTI chairperson also objected to Section 35 of the bill, a point further elaborated on by JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza. He said the section stated that the legislation would have an overriding effect. This meant that, being the more recent law, the bill under consideration, once approved, would have precedence over all previous legislation.
He said the provision should be omitted from the bill in its entirety. Moreover, he also objected to Section 12 of the bill, which he said gave suo motu powers to the commission to be established under the proposed legislation.
“On the one hand, you are taking away suo motu powers from courts. And on the other hand, you are giving this power to commissions,” he said, apparently referring to the recent 27th Amendment that curtailed the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers. If these two provisions were omitted, he said, “we could say that this is acceptable”.
Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also participated in the debate, saying: “We are here today to give some people their rights, to legislate so that they get more rights.”
He said that at present the biggest issue in Pakistan was the violation of fundamental and civil rights. “There is democracy, (and) you are presiding over a session where there is no opposition … It is not a good sign.”
As he went on to express his grievances on this matter, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq interrupted him and asked him to confine his remarks to the bill.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also stated that the Pandora’s box of Ahmadis, who were declared non-Muslim in 1974, should not be opened again. He pointed out that the law minister himself had stated that Ahmadis were non-Muslims and did not follow the Constitution. “But at the same time, I will ask the minister that he should also be aware of the past tricks of Qadianis,” he said.
He also expressed concerns regarding the recently passed 27th Amendment and other legislation passed by the ruling coalition.
Lamenting that no one was taken into confidence regarding the amendment, he stressed that the legislation “will remain controversial”.
Noorul Haq Qadri of the PTI endorsed the position taken by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He also suggested that the bill be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP also opposed the bill.
Proposed commission
According to the bill, the proposed commission will include representatives from all provinces and minority communities, promoting inclusivity and effective oversight. There shall be a council of the commission to be established under this act. The council shall exercise all powers, perform all functions and do all acts and things assigned to it by the commission.
It shall consist of 18 members, including three Hindu members (of whom two shall be from the scheduled castes); three Christian members; one Sikh member; one member from the Bahai community; one member from the Parsi community; two Muslim members with a human rights background; one representative from each provincial human rights or minorities affairs department; and one minority member from Islamabad Capital Territory.
Upon the commencement of this act, or whenever required thereafter, the National Assembly Secretariat shall, within 60 days, initiate and complete the process for appointing the chairperson.
A four-member parliamentary committee is to be constituted by the National Assembly speaker after consultation with the Senate chairman, consisting of two members from the Senate, preferably non-Muslims, and two members from the National Assembly, also preferably non-Muslims. If the parliamentary committee fails to take a majority decision, the prime minister will appoint the chairperson of the commission.
The joint sitting also passed the National Assembly Secretariat Employees (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (Implem­entation) Bill 2024, the Pakistan Institute of Management, Sciences and Technology Bill 2023, the National University for Security Sciences, Islamabad Bill 2023, and the Ghurki Institute of Science and Technology Bill 2025.

The 70-year-old pope spoke to reporters on the plane at the end of his visit to Turkey and Lebanon — his first trip outside of Italy since becoming head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics in May.
Leo said anti-Muslim sentiment was “oftentimes generated by people who are against immigration and trying to keep out people who may be from another country, another religion, another race.” He said his visit to Lebanon was intended to show “that dialogue and friendship between Muslims and Christians is possible”.
Leo said stories he heard during the trip of Christians and Muslims helping each other were “lessons … that we should perhaps be a little less fearful”.

The pontiff urges halt to attacks in Lebanon as first trip abroad ends

The US-born pope spent two decades in Peru as a missionary within the Augustinian order.
He has been critical of growing nationalist sentiment in Europe and the United States, and has called for an end to the “inhuman treatment” of migrants under US President Donald Trump.
He has also exhorted followers to reject an “exclusionary mindset” that he said had led to nationalism around the world.
Leo has said the Catholic Church “must open the borders between peoples and break down the barriers between class and race”.
A 150,000-strong mass at Beirut’s waterfront was the highlight of the trip by the head of the world’s Catholics, who arrived in Lebanon on Sunday after visiting Turkey, the start of his six-day trip.
Before landing in Rome on Tuesday afternoon, the 70-year-old pontiff told journalists aboard the papal plane that he looked forward to his next international trip, which has yet to be officially confirmed.
“I hope to make a trip to Africa, which would possibly be my next trip to confirm,” he said, adding that he hoped to visit Algeria “to visit the places where St Augustine lived”.
He also mentioned “Latin Amer­ica, Argentina, Uruguay” as possible visits.
In Lebanon, the US pontiff received a jubilant welcome in a nation beset by a years-long economic collapse and which is still reeling from last year’s war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, with many fearing renewed hostilities.
Noting that he was unable to visit all of the country, Pope Leo expressed his “aspiration for peace, along with a heartfelt appeal: may the attacks and hostilities cease”.
Israel has continued to launch stri­­kes on Lebanon despite a Nove­mber 2024 ceasefire with Hezbollah and has escalated attacks in recent weeks — but has not announced any raids during the pope’s visit.
Under heavy pressure, Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming the Iran-backed group, which, however, has rejected the idea.
The pope appealed in his mass “to those who hold political and social authority here and in all countries marked by war and violence. Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace”.
He said that “the Middle East needs new approaches to reject the mindset of revenge and violence, to overcome political, social and religious divisions, and to open new chapters in the name of reconciliation and peace”.
Later, as he prepared to depart from Beirut airport, he declared, “While weapons are lethal, negotiation, mediation, and dialogue are constructive. Let us all choose peace as a way, not just as a goal!”
Before the service, the pope prayed at the site of a catastrophic port explosion on August 4, 2020, which killed more than 220 people, injured over 6,500, and devastated swathes of the capital.
Near a monument to those killed, with the facility’s devastated grain silos visible nearby, the pope spoke with survivors and relatives of victims, many of whom were holding photos of their loved ones.
“I was deeply moved by my brief visit to the Port of Beirut,” the pope said from the airport.
“I carry with me the pain, and the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country,” he added.
Nobody has been held to account for the Beirut port blast, one of the world’s largest ever non-nuclear explosions.
Cecile Roukoz, a lawyer whose brother died in the explosion, expressed gratitude for the pope speaking up for the victims.
“We need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,” she said.

The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Faisal Rat­h­­ore late on Monday, also decided to provide Rs2.9 billion in equity to Bank of AJK to help it obtain the scheduled-bank status from the State Bank of Pakistan, establish women police stations at divisional headquarters, and fix the number of administrative departments at 20.
Among other key decisions, the cabinet approved uniform domestic and commercial power tariffs for 5kV and 60kV consumers, waived Rs139 million in outstanding electricity dues, and sanctioned the establishment of education boards in Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot.
The cabinet decisions were shared with the media by Senior Minister Mian Abdul Waheed and Minister for Forests Sardar Javed Ayoub on Tuesday.
Mr Ayoub said the government would initiate the health card scheme immediately after finalising an agreement with State Life Insurance. A committee led by the health minister would identify hospitals and submit its report within five days, he added.
On education reforms, he said staff shortages would be addressed under a rationalisation formula of one teacher per 25 students. New posts would be created where required, while surplus teachers would be shif­ted within the same union council. Institutions would also be upgraded or newly established on a need basis.
A separate committee headed by the higher education minister wou­ld present its recommendations on the revival of student unions within five days. He said a finance minister-led committee would also submit proposals within five days to reduce taxes on property transfers. 
A committee has also been for­m­­ed for the rehabilitation of Mangla Dam-affected families, which would submit its report within five days, after which land allotment for the affectees would begin.
The cabinet further approved a revised scheme for the Revenue Complex in Muzaffarabad, the launch of solid waste management projects in nine district headquarters, and procurement of machinery for the Communications and Works Department in Poonch.
Projects earlier cleared by the Cabinet Development Committee (CDC) also received approval. These included the 500kW Pathyali and 500kW Haryala hydropower projects in Muzaffarabad, costing Rs495.305 million and Rs499.250m, respectively, and the 220-metre Gulpur bridge in Kotli at a cost of Rs824.369m.

Five Chinese citizens have been killed and five wounded near the border in the past week as a result of attacks launched from Afghanistan.
Tajik President Emomali Rahmon held talks with the heads of his security agencies on Monday about the situation and China has advised its citizens, who are engaged in various mining and business activities, to urgently leave the border area.
One of the three sources, in the Tajik Security Council, told Reuters that the authorities have held talks with Russia about the possibility of deploying forces from Moscow’s military base in the Central Asian country to jointly patrol the Tajik-Afghan border.
The base is Russia’s largest overseas military facility and is located close to the Tajik capital, Dushanbe.
“We are currently in talks. I think a decision will be made … this week,” the source told Reuters.
Two of the other sources, in Tajikistan’s State Committee for National Security, confirmed the talks with Russia, which, if successful, would see Russia use helicopters to help patrol the 1,344-kilometre border with Afghanistan, which runs through mountainous terrain.
The Tajik and Russian ministries of defence declined to comment when asked about the talks.
The Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation alliance, which the sources said was also involved in the talks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 

The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have said they will cooperate with Tajikistan on security issues around the border.
In a call with his Tajik counterpart, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi expressed regret and said Kabul was prepared to boost coordination between border forces, adding that “joint measures against malicious elements are a pressing necessity.”
“The Islamic Emirate is fully prepared to strengthen border security, conduct joint investigations, and engage in any form of coordination,” Muttaqi said, according to a statement from the Afghan foreign ministry.
He added that “an atmosphere of trust” had recently developed between the two countries and should not be undermined.
Until the early 2000s, the Russian base, along with Russian border troops in Tajikistan, was tasked with guarding the Tajik border with Afghanistan. Tajikistan has been independently guarding the frontier since 2005.</p><small>2025-12-02 20:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02134737702e43f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958724/pakistan-population-summit-experts-seek-swift-govt-action-to-restore-demographic-balance-reduce-pressure-on-resources' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Population Summit: Experts seek swift govt action to restore demographic balance, reduce pressure on resources</strong></a><br><p>The second and final day of the ‘Pakistan Population Summit’ concluded in Islamabad on Tuesday, with experts urging swift government action to restore demographic balance as fast-growing population strains the country’s health, education and other vital resources.
Organised by DawnMedia, the summit brought toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as rapid population growth continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.

 

On Monday, policy­makers, experts, diplomats and lawmakers had expressed the unanimous view that prosperity was not possible if the number of mouths to feed kept rising.
They argued that without managing the population in terms of resources, all of the government’s efforts — aimed at development, progress and social uplift — would amount to nought.

2:11pm — KP CM Sohail Afridi stresses need for investment in ‘human capital’
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a video message to the summit, stressed the need for investing in “human capital”.
“In my opinion, population is a blessing. If your purpose is to invest in people, give them basic facilities, fulfil their basic rights, and improve human capital, then the population becomes a blessing for you,” the chief minister said.

However, CM Afridi noted that in Pakistan, “we only think of the next election and not the next generation.”
“Our investment is made only for political benefit,” he added.
Detailing efforts made by his government towards developing the human capital, he said: “In KP, as per the vision of Imran Khan, we have started investing in people. We introduced the Sehat Card for the people of KP, in which around 40m people are receiving free of cost treatment.”
“I have also announced that healthcare for pregnant women in KP would be free, and if she gives birth to a daughter, the government will take the responsibility of the child,” he continued.
“With this kind of investment, the population will no longer feel like a burden, but you will actually receive the output of the investment,” CM Afridi added.

2:08pm — CM Murad details Sindh’s population strategy with education, health ‘at its heart’
Describing his government’s population management strategy as “comprehensive and forward-looking”, CM Murad Ali Shah said, “First, we are focused on expanding economic opportunity; a growing population requires a growing economy.
“Sindh is working to create a job-rich environment by supporting the industry, agriculture, services and new technology sectors through skill development and investment facilitation.”
CM Murad asserted that education and health were “at the heart” of the Sindh government’s population policy, vowing to prioritise quality schooling and strengthening maternal health.
On water scarcity, the chief minister said his government was investing in modern irrigation and protection of the Indus river to “secure our natural resources for future generations”.
“Population balance is not merely a policy ambition. It is essential for a prosperous, healthy, and sustainable Sindh. Together, we can transform demographic pressures into systems of opportunity.”

In a video message played at the summit, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah said his government recognises that “achieving population balance is central to our social and economic progress”.
“Sindh, as one of Pakistan’s most dynamic provinces, feels this pressure keenly. Our growing population is a national strength, but it brings profound challenges.”
Highlighting that 40pc of children under five faced stunting, 26m children aged 5-16 were out of school, and water scarcity threatened agriculture, the Sindh CM said, “These realities demand urgent and coordinated action.”

2:00pm — Tackling population growth requires ‘coordinated and swift’ response: federal health secretary
The federal secretary of the Ministry of National Health Services, Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, called for the need to adopt a “coordinated and swift response” in tackling population growth.
“Pakistan’s population, which was around 34m at the time of independence, has now increased to around 257m,” he said, adding that “this rapid expansion placed immense strain on our resources.”
“This imbalance is impacting every aspect of national development, our education system, our food security, water security, employment opportunities, urban planning and most critically, our health sector,” he added.
“This is not a sustainable situation and requires a coordinated response and and swift and effective response,” he said.

1:50pm — ‘Living standards could have been higher with lower population growth rate’
Dr Ishrat Husain estimated that if Pakistan’s population growth rate had been 1.8pc instead of 2.5pc, the per capita income would have been $2,100 instead of 1400-1500, leading to higher living standards.
The SDPI advisor termed “institutional fragmentation” as one of the causes of the current population predicament.
“Population requires a multisectoral, multidisciplinary, all hands on the desk approach,” he said, pointing out a lack of coordination between the population and health departments.

1:44pm — Dr Ishrat Husain links lack of implementation to leaders being occupied with political incentives
Wondering why the issues of population crisis and climate change had not been tackled and some solutions implemented, Dr Ishrat Husain said a reason was leaders’ focus on political incentives.
He noted that elected leaders felt the need to show “visible projects” where they are inaugurating various development projects.
“That is very much where they are occupied because they want to appeal to their electorate.”
Dr Husain further said that had the momentum of population planning from the 1960s been sustained, Pakistan’s population growth rate would have been much lower.

1:40pm — Summit’s last session begins
The summit’s final session, titled ‘Balancing Population and Economic Growth - Reports from the Provinces’, has begun.
Dr Ishrat Husain, a senior advisor at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), is delivering his keynote address.




1:33pm — Population growth Pakistan’s ‘biggest challenge’: Azma Bokhari
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, in a video message for the summit, termed population growth the country’s “biggest problem”.
“Growing population is not just a problem for one province or an individual; it is a challenge for the entire country,” Bokhari said.
She continued: “As the population increases, you have to adjust your resources as well, make changes to infrastructure and make efforts to create basic facilities for the growing population.”
“I would like to say that population growth is Pakistan’s biggest challenge at the moment,” Bokhari stressed.
The minister underscored the need to follow the paths outlined by fellow Muslim nations in tackling population growth.

1:25pm — Shafiullah Jan highlights financial challenges faced by KP
Shafiullah Jan, KP chief minister’s aide on public relations, highlighted the financial challenges faced by his provincial government.
Speaking on the NFC award, Jan said the ex-Fata tribal areas had been merged administratively, not financially.
“The allocation we are getting is half of what it should be,” he added, terming the case of KP “very strong”.
“If you had given us these Rs560bn on time, they could have been used for health and education.”
Pointing out that KP still has the subject of population accounting for 1pc of its NFC award allocation, the CM’s merging the tribal areas financially would be a “great positive sign”.

1:15pm — PM’s spokesperson Mosharraf Zaidi calls for ‘national movement’
The prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, stressed the need for a “national movement” in tackling the population growth.
“On population, you need a national movement, and for that to happen, the conversation around the 26th,27th,28th,29th and 30th amendments has to be treated with a view to the outcomes that we want for people.”
On the matter of NFC and population, Zaidi said: “We need to revisit how we allocate resources in the country, and if it’s only on the basis of population, then I think we are in big trouble, but it cannot be at all on the basis of population either.”
“Figuring that balance out will require give and take,” he added.

Senior journalist and DawnNews anchor Arifa Noor noted that there was “no space for important issues” amid the polarised political environment.
“What have the information ministries been reduced to? […] They’ve become personal of the political parties […] that’s still some virtue, but now they’re personal spokesperson for individuals more or less.”
She also raised her concern over “feel-good legislation” that was passed by the parliament without considering how it would be implemented.

1:05pm — Ex-senator Mushahid calls attention to ‘cousin marriage’ as reason for child stunting
Former information and culture minister Mushahid Hussain Sayed, in his keynote address, drew attention to the issue of “cousin marriages” as a cause for child stunting.
“There is one important reason that has been missed out of our narrative on stunding, and it is cultural — first-cousin marriages,” he said.
“They are a major cause of stunting according to medical sciences, and I think that needs to be incorporated,” the former senator added.

12:55pm — Empowering women’s choices ‘constitutional obligation’: NCSW head
National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) head Umme Laila Azhar termed the act of enabling women to make their own choices “a constitutional obligation”.
“Pakistan stands at a socio-economic crossroads, and empowering women’s choices is not just a soft issue; it’s a constitutional obligation,” she said.
She continued: “When girls and women can choose their education, work, mobility, marriage, and health decisions, entire communities become more resilient, productive, and peaceful, and this is not about individual empowerment; it is nation building.”

12:50pm — Healthcare providers discouraging many fertility management techniques: Madiha Latif
Stressing the need for women to make their decisions, Madiha Latif said women were often “infantilised” when they go into hospital emergency rooms or healthcare providers.
“Providers are the ones discouraging a lot of these fertility management techniques, where they are telling her ‘you are too young to make that decision’ or that ‘you have only one child’,” she said.
“Who are those providers to make those decisions for us?” she asked. “We talk about nutrition and breastfeeding, but we don’t give space to women to breastfeed safely at work.”

12:44pm — Madiha Latif stresses need to make women aware of their reproductive rights
Madiha Latif, vice president of Pathfinder’s Strategic Engagement and Innovation department, stressed raising awareness and knowledge among young women so they would have control over their bodies.
“Reproductive right is also fundamental for gender equality,” she said, adding that the rights begin the moment a child is born.
“Since she hits puberty, what are we giving her in terms of her ability to negotiate sexually? Why are we still turning our faces around to gender-based violence that occurs?” she asked.
“Censorship is not the way to give anymore,” Latif asserted, noting the need to create awareness among women about their control and choices in sexual activities.

12:42pm — ‘We must educate men’: Shamama Tul Amber Arbab
Former president of Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry Shamamatul Amber Arbab highlighted the “friction” that results between men and women when women are made aware of their rights.
She said that the friction resulted because “we are not educating their counterparts, we are not educating the men in their families.”
[While] empowering women, we must at the same time educate men also, and that is how the tug of war will not take place. They will be empowered, they will know what their power is and exactly what their choices can be,” Arbab added.

12:38pm — Dr Yasmeen Qazi notes need to ensure ‘continuity’ in providing healthcare to women
QZ Catalyst CEO Dr Yasmeen Sabih Qazi emphasised the need to ensure “continuity” in providing healthcare to women.
“From adolescence to pregnancy to post-partum, at every point of her life, she would need that kind of information which we fail to provide in a classical facility setting,” she said.
Dr Qazi cited the example of Sweden, which reached nearly 0pc mortality rate “merely through advice”, and Ethiopia, where lady health workers were doing wonders.
“We need a community-led accountability system,” she added, noting that women’s groups would be the best agents to do that, as they would understand women’s rights.

12:35pm — We need inclusion in ‘true sense’: QZ Catalyst CEO
Dr Yasmeen Sabih Qazi, who heads family planning consulting firm QZ Catalyst, underscored the need for inclusion in a “true sense” in response to a question regarding the delivery of interventions to undocumented communities.
“We need inclusion in a true sense…not for the data but for the very right that they deserve,” Qazi said.
“We should make a position that a woman’s autonomy and a woman’s right to make a decision should be central to all the policies we are leading,” she added.

12:22pm — Our rural communities are not as rural: Ayesha Leghari
Detailing a WhatsApp chatbot aimed at population growth in rural areas, Leghari remarked that Pakistan’s “rural communities are not as rural anymore”.
“We are more of a peri-urban shifted country as opposed to having deep rural communities and cities,” she said.

12:18pm — Ayesha Leghari stresses importance of ‘economic agency’ for women
Ayesha Leghari, Population Services International’s country director for Pakistan, echoed Tahira Abdullah’s comments and stressed the importance of providing women with “economic agency”.
“Giving women agency from an economic perspective is one of the most important aspects which we have seen,” Leghari said.
Detailing the outcomes of a PSI project aimed at uplifting women in rural areas, Leghari said: “These women did not have a say in their households before, but once they started becoming economic contributors in their households, their decision-making improved substantially, not just in their households.”
She noted women also became more autonomous in making decisions with regards to their bodies.
“They started choosing contraceptive methods of their choice, they started investing the money they were earning into their daughters, and we saw a dynamic change.”

12:10pm — Tahira Abdullah calls for ending ‘feminisation of poverty’
Activist Tahira Abdullah also called for an end to “feminisation of poverty”, which she described as the share of women in the country’s total poverty figures.
She cited World Bank and past figures, according to which 45pc of the country’s population lived below the poverty line, and women and transgender people made up 75pc of that.

 

The rights defender also demanded an end to unpaid labour by women.
She insisted that women’s labour force participation rate “might be 22pc in the official figures, but 100pc of Pakistan’s women, girls and transgenders do work”.

12:02pm — Conditional permission for birth spacing ‘unacceptable’: activist Tahira Abdullah
Tahira Abdullah, a rights defender, noted that the subject of population balance had become an “existential challenge”.
Donning a keffiyeh, she said that permission for anything should not be “conditional”.
She asserted: “When we give permission, it should be from a moral, ethical and rights-based background, not on a transactional basis.
“‘If a woman’s health is not good, then she can employ birth spacing’. I’m sorry; that is not acceptable,” the activist said, apparently referring to some religious scholars opining that birth spacing was allowed in Islam if there was a danger to the mother’s life.

11:46am — Need to focus on giving free of cost land to our people: Wahab
Replying to a query whether migration should be reduced, Murtaza Wahab termed Karachi an “extremely stretchable city”.
He noted that the city had a “humongous” land mass, which has tremendous potential.
The Karachi mayor underscored the need for development planning, noting that any restrictions on land allotment to the poor would lead to “unplanned growth in the city”.
“We should as a state be focusing on giving free of cost land to our people, incentivising them to develop proper settlements,” he said.

11:44am — Wahab calls for developing more cities as ‘alternate to Karachi’
Mayor Karachi was of the opinion that the state should invest in developing more cities to serve as alternatives to Karachi.
“I think as a matter of policy, Pakistan should be focusing on developing more cities, alternates to Karachi, so that the population can be moved to other cities as well,” said Wahab.

11:40am — Karachi faces brunt of Pakistan’s ballooning population: Murtaza Wahab
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in response to a question about long-term planning for Karachi’s population management, highlighted that his city was “facing the brunt of ballooning population”.
Wahab noted that “one common denominator amongst Pakistan’s problems is the ballooning population”. “Karachi, arguably, being the only cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, faces the brunt of it.”
He cited figures from the first census in 1951 when the population of Karachi was 1m, then it increased to 8.5m in 1995, and later, as per the census of 2023, “we are a city of 20.3m, which again is debated”.

 

Comparing it to the population growth in cities such as New York and London, Mayor Wahab said, “There is no example of a city anywhere in the world where the city’s population has increased over 20 times.”
“That shows that perhaps the state has not prioritised the issue of ballooning population, and the second aspect is that the state has not developed alternate places for people to reside,” he said.
“People from all over Pakistan come to Karachi,” Wahab added.

11:33am — ‘No govt has produced any amount of houses’
Arif Hasan recalled that although many governments promised to construct many houses, “nobody has produced any amount of houses”.
On the PPP building “one-room houses” for flood-affected people, Hasan said, “Let’s see how it works out.”
Asked about pressing issues faced by the society, he said flooding was the biggest. He also stressed the need to control population density, adding that dealing with these issues required a major land reform.

11:28am — Arif Hasan terms ‘affordability’ biggest problem in housing
Asked about the national housing policy, urban planner Arif Hasan said he believed there was “no housing policy for the poor”. “It’s almost always the private sector that deals with this,” he added.
He termed affordability as the biggest problem, adding that another issue was that the only space available to the poor was at the city’s fringe.
“They are pushed out ot teh periphery or environmentally degraded areas,” Hasan said, pointing out that old katchi abadis were turned into high rises as the informal sector invested in that.

11:21am — Arif Hasan notes changing urbanisation trends
At the summit’s ninth session, titled ‘Population Challenges for a Highly Urbanised Pakistan in 2050’, architect and urban planner Arif Hasan detailed the rising trends in urbanisation.
“The major trend is social, which, of course, is a result of economic change.
“The extended family has reduced considerably, the nuclear family has evolved and consolidated, especially in the urban areas, and that gives a lot of freedom to individuals within nuclear families,” Hasan said.
He continued: “So women can acquire education, without pressure from their aunts and uncles, not to have an education. Also, the freedom to marry whoever they want, although this is not consolidated, but the trend is certainly there even within low-income groups.”

 

He noted that the shift to nuclear families “has changed settlement patterns as well”.
Speaking about changing trends in rural areas, Hasan observed that the “change in production patterns, mechanisation, fertiliser, middle man economy … all this has given rise to an economy where cash is desperately needed and that cash is not available in the rural areas”.
“So that has become a push factor,” he added.




11:15am — Not having women’s consent for pregnancy is inconceivable: Humaira Masihuddin
Humaira Masihuddin said that women bore the “main burden of pregnancy — physical, psychological and emotional“.
She said: “In every pregnancy, the risk and threat of death is very real. Not asking the person who has to take such a huge risk or their consent not being included is inconceivable.
“I cannot believe that the Sharia would ever allow something like this,” she added, prompting a huge applause from the audience.
Stressing the importance of justice in Islam, Masihuddin asked, “Where would the justice be in this if a pregnancy is forced upon a woman?”
“ […] Consultation is a cardinal principle in all relationships in Islam.”

11:08am — Women’s representation extremely important in family planning discussions: Humaira Masihuddin
Legal expert Humaira Masihuddin recalled that in July, the CII held a consultation with the Population Council to discuss “pregnancy issues” where 47 men and only three women were present.
“So I think this needs to be rectified; women’s representation is extremely important,” she asserted.
Masihuddin also stressed the importance of women in Islam, citing a Quranic verse that declares men and women each other’s “allies”.

11:06am — Dr Qibla Ayaz calls for ‘de-linking’ population with ‘rizq’
Dr Qibla Ayaz called for the need to “delink” the concept of rizq (sustenance) with population, and associate population with health instead.
“Scholars believe that rather than linking population growth with sustenance, link with health, because if you do not take gaps in childbirth, both the mother and child will suffer,” he stressed.
“The child will be born stunted, and the mother will be weak, and she will face difficulty in raising her children and guiding them towards a better future.”

11:00am — CII ‘coined’ concept of population balance, says Dr Ayaz
Dr Qibla Ayaz, a member of the Supreme Court’s Shariat appellate bench, appreciated the CII for “taking the lead” in the matter and “coining” the concept of population balance.
He recalled that “back in the 60s, it came to be known as family planning”.

10:50am — Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani says Pakistan has not utilised resources
While noting that the growing populace was an issue, Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani asked whether the country had utilised the resources given by God “in the right way”.
Citing the example of China, he said population was much larger there but it managed its resources.
“Allah has blessed our country with treasures worth billions, but we are selling those to others for pennies and not utilising our resources,” he said.
The Jamia Darul Uloom vice president noted that even the Sunnah underscored “moderation” in everything.

10:45am — Islam allows birth control in select situations: Jamia Darul Uloom vice president
Jamia Darul Uloom Vice President Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani also shed light on what the Sharia says about the issue of rapid population growth.
“Growing population is not an issue, it is a waseela,” he said, adding that a balance could be struck as birth control could be used in certain situations, such as when there was danger to a woman’s health.
However, Mufti Usmani said Islamic laws did not favour “birth control due to fear of poverty and starvation”, or if parents wanted to avoid a girl’s birth.

10:35am — Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad terms tackling population growth ‘a collective responsibility’
Chairman Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Abdul Khabeer Azad stressed that tackling population growth was “our collective responsibility”, recalling his 15 years of association with the Population Council.
Detailing their efforts, he said: “When we created this awareness that saving one human life was equivalent to saving the entirety of humanity, and then when we talked about the health of mother and child, people understood that this was indeed a noble cause.”
“We often see that when such topics come under discussion, they are labelled as foreign agenda, but we believe that the life of a person is very precious,” he added.

10:28am — ‘Religious scholars ready to play role in raising public awareness’
The CII chief affirmed that religious scholars were determined to play their role in raising awareness among the public.
“Neither are the scholars behind in this, nor do they think that birth spacing should not be adopted,” he said.
Dr Raghib Naeemi called for public sessions, discussions at the graduate level in colleges and universities, and formation of think tanks to work on the issue.

10:22am — Birth spacing parents’ duty: Council of Islamic Ideology chairman
CII chief Raghib Hussain Naeemi said that keeping in mind Islamic rules, appropriate birth spacing to consider the children’s health was the parents’ responsibility.
He further said that scholars of all sects were of the view that Sharia allowed for birth planning and spacing if there was danger to the mother’s health during pregnancy, or risk of “untolerable pain”, or issues related to lactation, or the mother would have to face multiple complications.
The CII chairman also advocated for a social media campaign to raise awareness. He said that Islam’s “fundamental principle” of balance also favoured a balance between resources and population.

10:20am — CII chairman terms family planning ‘Islamic responsibility’
CII chairman Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi recalled that in July, CII organised a conference aimed at discussing the Islamic perspective on population growth, where they adopted a resolution.
“The basis of our resolution was that the protection of the family system, the health of the mother and child, in the context of an increasing population…has become increasingly important”, he said.
He continued: “Quran and Sunnat have declared the protection of one’s life and their offspring as the fundamental purpose of Shariat, which is why the protection of one’s life, the betterment of mother and child, and family planning is an Islamic responsibility.”
“Keeping in view the Sharia, taking a gap between children is the responsibility of the parents in the context of their child’s health,” he added.

10:16am — Info minister calls for joint working group, parliamentary debate
Suggesting some steps that could be taken, Attaullah Tarar called for a charter on the population crisis and recommended that a debate be held in parliament.
“One size fits all strategy might not work,” he noted, adding that religion was not an impediment in population planning.
The minister called for a joint working group that could work on a charter on the issue.

10:11am — Postpartum depression is a reality: info minister
The information minister also highlighted that postpartum depression was a “reality which should be realised and accepted”.
He stressed that mental health was a major aspect of “health linked to the population problem”.
Tarar further wondered what role legislators and the parliament could play in this regard. The minister also pointed out that lack of resources was an issue.
“There needs to be a realisation of rights and responsibilities — who has rights and who has responsibilities.”

10:08am — ‘Right to life’ impeded by population growth: Tarar
Attaullah Tarar believed that the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the Constitution was directly linked to population growth.
“If one’s right to life gets impeded because of the population issue […] It is tragic,” he said.
The minister noted that “we were losing a lot of lives” due to issues amplified by the population explosion, particularly in relation to infant mortality rates, neonatal healthcare, mother-child healthcare, and reproductive health.

10:05am — Must acknowledge scale of issue: Attaullah Tarar
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar began by commending the DawnMedia group for speaking about the issue. He then stressed that, to him, “acknowledging the issue itself was quite important”.
“Until and less we accept it as a huge challenge, we will continue to face problems,” he said.
“First of all, it’s acceptance and the realisation that it is a huge issue,” the minister cautioned.

9:58am — Population Council official speaks
Ali Mazhar, the director of communications at the Population Council, opened the second day.
He said that the first day of the summit focused on the gap between an expanding population and the available resources.
Experts highlighted that ensuring a safe and educated Pakistan is not possible until we take better steps for population management, he said.
Mazhar also noted that the role of Islamic scholars in tackling population growth came under much discussion.
“Scholars have the most influence on our family planning and societal behaviour,” he noted.

The comments came as United States envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner were in Moscow for high-stakes talks on ending the nearly four-year war, which were preceded by days of intense diplomacy.
“We are not planning to go to war with Europe, but if Europe wants to and starts, we are ready right now,” Putin told reporters in Moscow.
“They have no peaceful agenda, they are on the side of war,” he added, repeating his claim that European leaders were hindering US attempts to broker peace in Ukraine.
He added that European changes to Trump’s latest plan to end the war “aimed solely at one thing — to completely block the entire peace process and put forward demands that are absolutely unacceptable for Russia”.
Washington has presented a 28-point draft to end the conflict, later amended after criticism from Kyiv and Europe, which viewed it as heeding to many of Russia’s maximalist demands.
The plan to end the war is championed by Trump, but European countries fear it risks forcing Kyiv to cave in to Russian demands, notably on territory.
Fearing further Russian aggression, Europe has repeatedly said an unfair peace should not be imposed on Ukraine.
The Trump envoys are now seeking to finalise the plan with the approval of Moscow and Kyiv.</p><small>2025-12-02 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/022235035c0c684.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958806/afghan-man-arrested-in-texas-threatened-suicide-attack-justice-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan man arrested in Texas threatened suicide attack: Justice Dept</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan man has been charged in Texas with threatening to build a bomb and carry out a suicide attack, United States officials said on Tuesday, as the Trump administration vows a crackdown on Afghan migrants after a deadly shooting.
Mohammad Dawood Alokozay, 30, of Fort Worth, allegedly made the threats in a November 23 video that he shared on TikTok, X and Facebook, the Justice Department said in a statement.
In the video, Alokozay allegedly praises the Taliban and threatens to carry out a suicide attack on Americans.
“Thanks to public reports of a threatening online video, the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force apprehended this individual before he could commit an act of violence,” FBI Dallas special agent in charge Joseph Rothrock said.
Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Alokozay “came into America during the Biden administration and, as alleged, explicitly stated that he came here in order to kill American citizens”.
He faces up to five years in prison if convicted of making a threatening interstate communication.
Alokozay’s arrest comes a week after the shooting near the White House in Washington of two National Guard members.
A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the attack, which left one of the soldiers dead.
Lakanwal had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and entered the United States as part of a resettlement program following the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
US President Donald Trump said Sunday his administration intends to pause asylum decisions for “a long time” after the shooting.

Prison authorities had allowed her to meet the former prime minister today. She was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as Uzma went inside the prison to meet her brother.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
The meeting took place under strict supervision and without mobile devices, she added, declining to provide further details.
In a separate talk with the media, flanked by Aleema Khanum and PTI leaders, Uzma said: “When I met him, he was very disturbed and very angry. He said that they are keeping him and Bushra Bibi in such mental torture in a small room, he said he was not allowed to meet anyone for four weeks … he said this mental torture is worse than physical torture.”
She added the PTI founder was even more disturbed when informed about the treatment meted out to his sister, Noreen Niazi, a few weeks ago.
Uzma said Imran also gave a message to the party to support the candidates nominated by PTI’s Salman Akram Raja and Hamid Khan for the Pakistan Bar elections, along with ensuring that Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were notified as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
She further said Imran had also tasked the PTI with supporting and following any call by the two nominees for the opposition leaders. Uzma added that Imran further directed that Shahid Khattak be made the parliamentary leader of the opposition.
“About Sohail Afridi, he said that he is very happy and supports him completely.”
In a strict warning for PTI members seen fraternising with those from the government, she said Imran gave one direction: “My party members who play on both sides of the wicket have no place here and are the Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq of my party.”
Meanwhile, Aleema announced the party’s future course of action, saying the sisters would now sit outside Adiala every Tuesday and would not move until six family members and just as many lawyers were allowed to meet Imran. Party members would continue their own sit-in every Thursday, she added.







The development comes following the PTI’s protests outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Adiala jail today against restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights. The party had claimed that the ex-premier’s family and party leaders had been denied access to him for the last several weeks.

According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code was imposed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi ahead of PTI’s protests. It is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
Tallal’s warning
Earlier today, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that compliance with Section 144 would be ensured in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“Whether they come to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) or the Adiala jail, action under Section 144 would be carried out without any discrimination,” Chaudhry warned while speaking to the media in Islamabad. He particularly urged PTI-backed parliamentarians to “abide by the law”.
Chaudhry said Section 144 had been imposed in the twin cities “in light of intelligence reports”.
He further linked the matter to terrorism, saying: “Terrorists look for instances [which they can use] to spread fear and make headlines; be it [a] political gathering, courts or important places or offices.”
The state minister further said that terrorists used social media applications, particularly for communication. “They use these apps with virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their identities and locations.”
So, Chaudhry continued, the interior ministry had decided that it, along with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), would find a solution to this problem.
“The PTA has issued a detailed press release regarding the registration of VPNs,” he said, adding that the government did not want IT-related businesses to be affected by this measure. “But, it has to be done at any cost to ensure that mobile and social media apps are not used for terrorist activities.”
The state minister also recalled that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had ruled that state resources were not to be used for political activities.
So, “we hope that the KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) chief minister, who repeatedly comes to Islamabad and Pindi, will not use state resources for his political activities”, he added.
The state minister asserted that “KP police will [only] be used in KP for security”.
“If they come to Islamabad or any other province, prior intimation will be required in a proper manner. If any state resources are used without any intimation, action will be taken and criminal cases will be registered against government employees [concerned], in line with the PHC’s directive,” he warned.
He further stated that Section 144 had been imposed for the protection of lives. “An incident has occurred in Islamabad, and threats still exist,” he said.
The minister pointed out that the PTI had staged protests in Rawalpindi, demanding meetings with Imran, several times.
The administration, he said, was closely monitoring the situation to ensure that citizens’ lives and peace in the city were not affected. “To ensure that such gatherings of protests do not cause any loss.”
Here, he also recalled the violent protests of May 9, 2023, which were held after Imran’s arrest. “They will do it themselves just like on May 9, and entire Pakistan will face the consequences. They will do it themselves, and will then deny [any responsibility].”
He maintained that KP Chief Minister had no authority to demand a meeting with Imran.
Reiterating that Section 144 had been imposed in light of terror incidents. “And I hope that terrorists will not be facilitated — that such gatherings are held where they could carry out [terror] activities with ease and spread fear in Pakistan. We have made foolproof security arrangements, and God willing, no such incident will take place. But, we need the cooperation of other political parties and civil society to ensure this.”
He again warned Section 144 would be “strictly imposed” and action would be taken in light of the PHC order if any provincial public office holder used state resources for political activities.
To a question about whether Imran would be shifted from the Adiala jail to a prison in Islamabad, Chaudhry said: “It is too early to say anything.”
The minister said that the prison’s construction was in its last stages, after which its staff would have to be trained. “That jail is not being constructed for just one prison. It was needed in Islamabad as prisoners from the federal capital had to be sent to jails elsewhere,” he added.
He also said if the authorities were provided all the necessary documents and “tracking number, Imran’s sons would be issued visas in the next 24 hours”.
Security beefed up in Pindi
Rawalpindi police said effective arrangements had been made to ensure law and order in the city. In a statement, police said at least 3,000 security officers were performing traffic and other security duties.
“Section 144 has been imposed across Rawalpindi for three days which restricts unlawful assembly, rally and protest,” it said.
It added that Rawalpindi police would deal strictly with those who breached the law and it would ensure the implementation of Section 144 to maintain law and order in the city.
Reports from the twin cities said pickets were set up on routes leading to the Adiala jail. Meanwhile, roads leading to the Red Zone, which houses key government buildings, from Serena Hotel and the National Database and Registration Authority office were also reported to have been blocked.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said on Monday the opposition lawmakers from both houses of parliament will protest outside the IHC before taking their demonstration to Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” he said.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and other leaders will stage protests in the twin cities, Qaiser said.
Last week, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time.
Imran’s sisters had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI also alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters after they, along with other party members and supporters, held a protest outside the jail on November 19.
There were also speculations about his health, but the government and the PTI leaders had said that he was in good health.</p><small>2025-12-02 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02215204b2257a7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958804/minor-girl-killed-5-others-injured-as-gas-cylinder-explodes-in-car-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Minor girl killed, 5 others injured as gas cylinder explodes in car in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>A minor girl died of burns while five of her family members were injured in an explosion in a car in Karachi’s Quaidabad area early on Tuesday morning, according to police, hospital and rescue services officials.
They added that six people suffered burn injuries when a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder exploded inside the car at Quaidabad’s main roundabout.
Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the family was filling LPG cylinders from a roadside shop when the explosion took place.
Regarding possible reasons, Khan said that generally, “Such explosions take place because of a lack of mandatory hydrostatic tests after a certain period.
“Another possible reason was that when the cylinder is filled with LPG with pressure, it triggers an explosion,” he added.
Khan noted a similar incident in Shah Faisal Colony recently with human casualties. He added that these roadside shops took no precautionary measures, as they were illegal.
“The injured were transported to the burns centre at Karachi’s Civil Hospital, where the nine-year-old girl died during treatment,” said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
Dr Syed added that the girl sustained 80 per cent burn wounds and that the condition of the other five victims was also serious.
“The deceased girl’s two sisters … have suffered 81pc and 71pc burns respectively,” she added. “Their parents and another relative also suffered serious burns.”
In February this year, five members of the same family, including three women, suffered critical burn wounds in an explosion caused by a leakage in a gas geyser in Azizabad, police and rescue officials said.
Area Station House Officer Amir Azam said that the incident took place in the ground floor portion of a four-storey house in Federal B Area’s Block 2 near Al-Falah Masjid.</p><small>2025-12-02 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021403361f7071d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958751/pakistan-says-india-blocking-aid-for-cyclone-hit-sri-lanka-dispatches-200-tonnes-by-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says India blocking aid for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka; dispatches 200 tonnes by sea</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday that India was preventing humanitarian assistance from being sent to Sri Lanka by air, prompting Islamabad to send aid by sea to the south Asian island, where severe flooding and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah have claimed more than 400 lives.
In a post on X, the FO said: “India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face a delay of over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India.
“The partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”







A statement issued later by the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka said aircraft were awaiting clearance to fly and accused India of blocking the humanitarian relief operation through “shenanigans”.
The statement said that a “robust relief operation” was initiated on the special directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who had instructed the “immediate mobilisation of national resources” to support Sri Lanka during its hour of need.
It said that since Saturday, the Pakistan Army and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) have been ready for relief operations in Sri Lanka.
“However, for more than two days, Pakistan’s emergency relief mission comprising C-130 aircraft carrying a fully equipped urban search and rescue team, field hospitals, highly trained sniffing dogs and nearly 200 tonnes of life-saving supplies have remained stranded at Noor Khan Air Base in Islamabad due to delaying tactics deployed by India in granting flight clearance to C-130 aircraft.
“India in a cunning move has granted one day diplomatic clearance at 1800 hours, on Nov 1 through its embassy in Islamabad. The clearance was valid for around six hours for Pakistan’s assisted emergency and relief aircraft to depart, which was not sufficient for an aircraft to move back and forth to Colombo.
“Earlier, Indian authorities were reportedly engaged in deliberate delaying tactics, repeatedly asking Pakistan to resubmit and re-route flight plans despite already receiving complete documentation. These procedural hurdles appear to cause further delays, undermining timely relief delivery to a disaster-struck neighbour.”
The high commission said that by delaying emergency humanitarian aid, India had disregarded universally accepted norms of humanitarian conduct.
“The behaviour is callous, politically motivated and in violation of established international humanitarian norms, UN guiding principles as well as SAARC humanitarian charter principles.”
The high commission said that India’s “continued use of procedural manoeuvres and airspace restrictions” raised serious concerns about its adherence to humanitarian obligations and its commitment to regional solidarity in times of tragedy.
“Pakistan hopes that India will take a responsible and humanitarian approach by granting immediate airspace access with doable flight operational time and will refrain from politicising a purely humanitarian mission meant for the people of Sri Lanka in times of distress.
“Having, everlasting bilateral friendship, the humanitarian operation of relief supplies carries heartfelt solidarity of the Pakistani nation with its Sri Lankan brothers and sisters. and underscores powerful message that Sri Lanka is not alone and Pakistan will stand by it always,” the statement said.
Later in the day, the FO said that 200 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been dispatched by sea due to the delay in authorising overflights.
“Pakistan has dispatched 200 tons of humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka via sea cargo to support relief efforts following the devastating Cyclone Ditwah,” the FO wrote on X, adding that a send-off ceremony was held for the cargo, attended by Sri Lanka High Commissioner to Pakistan Admiral Ravindra C Wijegunaratne, among other officials.
“Pakistan stands in full solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka,” the post read.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrote on X that he had spoken with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and extended his condolences for those killed in the cyclone. He also praised Sri Lankan emergency responders for their relief work.
“As a neighbour and brotherly country, Pakistan has always stood in full solidarity with Sri Lanka, especially in moments of grief,” he wrote.
“We are immediately dispatching urgently needed humanitarian assistance to support our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters and will continue to offer whatever help we can, as Sri Lanka recovers from this calamity.”







The development comes a day after diplomatic sources told Dawn that Pakistan had received India’s permission to use its airspace for humanitarian aid flights to Sri Lanka to provide flood relief.
Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency to deal with what he called the “most challenging natural disaster in our history”.
It should be mentioned that India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s aircraft since tensions between them escalated in April in the wake of an attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people and the subsequent four-day conflict. In October, Islamabad extended the airspace ban until November 24.
Sri Lanka flooding death toll hits 410
The death toll from flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka was now 410, the Disaster Management Centre said Tuesday, with another 336 people missing following a week of heavy rains.
It said over 1.5 million people were affected by the worst natural disaster to hit the country since the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.
An official in the central town of Welimada told local reporters he expected the toll to rise, as his staff dug through the mud looking for victims buried by landslides.
In the capital Colombo, meanwhile, floodwaters were slowly subsiding on Tuesday.
The speed with which waters rose around the city surprised local residents used to seasonal flooding.
“Every year we experience minor floods, but this is something else,” delivery driver Dinusha Sanjaya told AFP.
Rains have eased across the country, but landslide alerts remain in force across most of the hardest-hit central region, officials said.</p><small>2025-12-02 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/022044575054c30.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958801/pakistan-crypto-council-ceo-bilal-bin-saqib-steps-down-as-pms-aide-on-virtual-assets' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal bin Saqib steps down as PM’s aide on virtual assets</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib has stepped down as special assistant to the prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency, it emerged on Tuesday.
He continues to serve as the chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
A notification from the Cabinet Division, signed October 13, said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accepted Saqib’s resignation from the position with effect from August 21.
He was appointed to the role on May 26, with the status of a minister of state.
Saqib was appointed the PVARA chairman with the status of a minister of state on a pro bono basis for three years on August 1.
PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes.­
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.

The traffic police’s crackdown on traffic violations across the province left motorists in turmoil when they lodged over 4,600 cases and arrested around 3,100 citizens, including a large number of schoolchildren, during the last 72 hours, creating a criminal record for a majority of them.
Parents lambasted the Punjab government for making criminal profiles of these children, saying it would have long-term consequences on their careers and declaring it an overreaction by the traffic police.
According to a statement from the office, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed her displeasure over minors being handcuffed for violating traffic rules.
“A decision has been made in principle to issue smart cards and motorcycle licences to 16-year-olds,” the statement read. “Traffic police across the province will also host an awareness week for the public, especially for students.”
The statement added that a warning would be issued for motorcyclists not wearing helmets for their first offence, while drones and police body cameras would be employed for the first time by the traffic police officials.
“Parents should be playing a greater role in abiding by traffic rules, more so than children and students,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying. “Traffic rules have been created to protect people. The public needs to change their habits for their own safety.”
She added that she did not want to arrest children, but emphasised that they needed to obey the law.
“It’s not the children’s fault, we did not teach them to wear helmets,” the CM was quoted as saying. “Parents need to teach their children about the importance of helmets for road safety.”
Last week, the Punjab government introduced 20 major reforms in the 60-year-old Traffic Act, aiming to bring about better traffic management in the province, including a decisive crackdown to end underage driving, which may be punishable by six months’ imprisonment.</p><small>2025-12-02 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/022046477bc80a7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958802/security-forces-kill-7-terrorists-in-north-waziristan-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 7 terrorists in North Waziristan IBOs: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the two operations were carried out on the reported presence of khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in [the] general area [of] Mir Ali,” the statement read. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, six khawarij were sent to hell.”
Another terrorist was killed in an IBO in Spinwam, the ISPR said, adding that weapons and ammunition were seized from the terrorists who “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as [a] relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by [the] security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Earlier today, Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in KP’s Bannu district.
Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan confirmed the number of casualties.
“The attack was sudden, and after opening fire on the vehicle, the assailants also set it on fire,” he said. The DIG said the area was cordoned off after the incident and a search was underway to locate the attackers.
“Security forces and police are conducting a joint operation. Security in the area has been put on high alert and investigations are being carried out from every angle,” he said.
Meanwhile, Bilal Saqib, the assistant commissioner’s secretary, told the media that the incident took place at around 10am and that Wali was on his way to appear before a court when he was “ambushed” near Mamash Khel’s Masoomabad.
Giving details about the deaths, he said that two constables and a civilian, who was working in the fields, were martyred, while two police officials were injured.

Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Ali Nasir Rizvi, speaking to the media, said the explosion occurred around 4pm and was caused by a gas leak ignited by a short circuit.
“When summer ends, the university turns off its gas connection. They turned it on at 3:30pm, but there was an accumulation of gas and a short circuit somewhere,“ the IG said. “A gas leakage caused the explosion.”
The IG outlined that the explosion occurred in a prayer room, which was near a clerk’s office. He stated that seven people were caught in the explosion.
“Five students were there with a clerk and a junior assistant,” IG Rizvi explained.
“The clerk sustained 60-65 per cent burn injuries, the clerical assistant was burned and the students suffered minor burn injuries. Seven people are under treatment; of those, six are out of danger as per the hospital.”

IG Rizvi added that multiple teams were present at the scene, including Operations, Investigations, Special Branch and the Counter-Terrorism Department.
“We have examined the scene thoroughly and have ruled out the use of explosives,” the IG said. “No traces have been found. We are telling the media that this explosion was caused by a gas leakage and a short circuit.”
He added that standard operating procedures were invoked to close all gas connections, and Numl’s administration was instructed to check the gas lines as a precaution.
“We have also instructed them to check the structural stability of the building where the explosion took place,” IG Rizvi added.
Rescue 1122 control-in-charge Subhan told Dawn earlier that the emergency service first received a call at 4:06pm.
“The caller did not know the nature of the explosion, but the administration called us and said that it was caused by a gas cylinder or a gas leak in a room,” he said over the phone.
He added that the fire was controlled by emergency services.
The official added that damage from the explosion was contained to a single room and the rest of the building was not affected.
Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi, speaking to Dawn soon after the incident, had also said that a gas leakage caused the explosion.
Visuals from the varsity showed panicked students evacuating the campus as emergency and rescue personnel tried to extinguish the blaze in one of the rooms on the premises.
Bystanders could also be seen rushing to the help of an injured person lying on the ground.

His remarks came ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s two-day visit to New Delhi from Thursday, looking to restore defence and energy ties as India is set to trim its Russian oil purchases this month to at least a three-year low.
Russia’s top buyer of seaborne oil, India has cut crude imports from Moscow under pressure from Western sanctions, particularly by Washington, on Moscow’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.
“There can be, for a very brief period of time, insignificant decreases in the volume of oil trade,” Peskov told Indian journalists, in response to a question about the impact of sanctions.
Working to build the necessary environment for buyers
Russia is the top oil supplier to India, the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer.
Moscow is working to build the “necessary environment” for buyers who seek its oil, Peskov said, speaking by video link organised by Russia’s Sputnik news agency.
“We have deep experience in performing under regime of these illegal sanctions,” Peskov added.
“We have our own technologies in doing that. We will continue to make those technologies more sophisticated should this practice of sanctions continue.”
Trade between Russia and India should be secured from pressure from third countries, he said, adding that payment methods would feature in the leaders’ talks.
Activities of Indian refiners
Indian refiners, such as Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, have stopped buying Russian oil.
State-run Indian Oil Corp has placed orders to buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned entities, while Bharat Petroleum Corp is in an advanced stage of negotiations for Russian oil imports.
Russia-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy, partly owned by Rosneft, is exclusively processing Russian oil after other suppliers pulled back, following British and EU sanctions.
Russia wants India to continue to provide support to Nayara to boost its local sale and capacity use.
Reliance Industries Ltd, formerly Russia’s top Indian client, has said it loaded Russian oil cargoes “precommitted” by October 22, and will process any arriving after November 20 at its refinery geared to domestic supply.</p><small>2025-12-02 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021247054bce99b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958742/miranshah-assistant-commissioner-among-4-martyred-in-bannu-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Miranshah assistant commissioner among 4 martyred in Bannu attack</strong></a><br><p>Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu on Tuesday.

Miranshah is the administrative headquarters of North Waziristan district and is adjacent to Bannu.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed sorrow over the lives lost in the incident. A statement shared by the PPP on X said he condemned the terrorist attack.
He further said that the elimination of terrorists operating with external support against the country was being carried out with national consensus.
He also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel and directed the relevant agencies to ensure the immediate arrest of the attackers.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow on the terrorist attack in Bannu that martyred four people, including the assistant commissioner, according to a statement on X issued by the PM Office.







He prayed for the departed souls and extended prayers of patience for the bereaved.
“The government is committed to eliminating terrorism from the country.”
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow at the lives lost in the incident. According to an official statement, he also sought a detailed report from the KP police chief.
“The sacrifices of the martyrs will not go in vain. The elements involved will be brought to justice,” he said. Afridi also directed to provide the injured with the best possible medical treatment.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TTP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
The development comes a day after two policemen embraced martyrdom and five others were injured in a suicide bombing and a gun attack in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
In July, an assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among five people martyred, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area.</p><small>2025-12-02 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021714050926a52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958756/pakistan-successfully-emerged-as-regional-stabiliser-following-marka-i-haq-says-paf-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan successfully emerged as ‘regional stabiliser’ following ‘Marka-i-Haq’, says PAF chief</strong></a><br><p>Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday noted that Pakistan had emerged as a regional stabiliser after the May conflict with India.
The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief made the remarks during the passing out parade at PAF Academy Asghar Khan in Risalpur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district.
“In the wake of Marka-i-Haq, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net stabiliser in this part of the world,” ACM Sidhu said.
“As a responsible nuclear power, our relations with key global and regional powers have further strengthened, which is a testimony to the untiring effort of our diplomatic strategy and credible military prowess.”
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India, from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, as Marka-i-Haq in May.



“The rising global relevance of Pakistan remains a growing concern for our adversary, and it exploits every opportunity to malign and destabilise Pakistan on the international front,” said the air chief in a veiled reference to India.
Speaking further on the May conflict, ACM Sidhu said, “The people of Pakistan and its armed forces defeated the enemy with far greater numerical might.
“This resounding success during Marka-i-Haq and Bunyanum Marsoos was the outcome of a unified approach by all elements of national power, and above all, Allah’s special blessing.”
The PAF chief highlighted: “Undoubtedly, the victory also reflects great credit on the firm resolve of our national leadership alongside well-executed tri-service synergy, aggressive decision-making, and full support of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.”

 

He reiterated that the “strength of military organisation solely hangs upon a value system based on character and credibility”, asserting that the PAF’s each and every claim was based on “evidence and undeniable hard facts”.
During his speech, the air chief noted that “we live in challenging times in the wake of a complex global and regional environment”.
While affirming that Pakistan “wishes to maintain friendly relations with all, especially with our neighbours”, ACM Sidhu warned: “However, let me make it clear; if our nation’s sovereignty is challenged, our adversary will find Pakistan’s armed forces even harder and better prepared.”
He asserted, “While celebrating this success with humility, we singularly remain focused on preparing for the future challenges, as the enemy’s rhetoric continued to suggest.”
‘PAF’s first full-spectrum multi-domain operation’
ACM Sidhu highlighted that the PAF conducted “full-spectrum multi-domain operation” for the first time in its history, employing elements of “space, cyber and electronic warfare, along with long-range vectors, unmanned aerial systems, killer drones and loitering munitions”.
Recalling the downing of multiple Indian jets on May 7, the PAF chief noted that it was being “regarded as one of the most intense and longest BVR vs BVR (beyond-visual-range) battles of modern aerial history”.

 

On the subsequent missile exchange on May 10, he said, “We also responded to their pre-amption on May 10 with the Pak Army with a paralysing punch, and struck their bases and ground assets deep into the enemy territory from north to south.”
He added that the armed forces also “neutralised state-of-the-art defence system S-400 and command and control centres” of India. He said the operations were “calibrated and balanced with a single aim to ensure peace with honour”.
The air chief added that the PAF’s “mastery and employment of multi-domain capabilities is being acknowledged and studied by warfare professionals around the globe”.
‘PAF vigorously pursued very innovative strategy of modernisation’
The air chief noted that the PAF’s performance during Marka-i-Haq was not an isolated event but the “outcome of a comprehensive strategy of restructuring, modernisation and indigenisation campaigns undertaken” by the air force in the past few years.
The PAF, he said, recognised the “rapidly changing character of war” and realigned its “operational doctrine, concept and strategy, keeping in view the limitations of fiscal space and availability of technologies”.
ACM Sidhu noted that the PAF “vigorously pursued a very innovative and practical strategy of modernisation and adapted, as well as operationalised, numerous advanced combat and combat-support capabilities, along with niche technologies in record time”.
“The smartly executed homeground kill chain comprising indigenously developed unmanned system, EW and space assets, along with cyber capabilities developed in record time under the ambit of newly established National Aerospace Science and Technology Park (NASTP) form the very core of PAF’s multi-domain operational strategy.”

 

The PAF chief said the range and capabilities of the NASTP were “expanding at an unprecedented pace”, adding that “a host of indigenous projects are still in the pipeline that are being vigorously pursued”.
“Indeed, through rigorous retrospection, concept development, validation cycle, war gaming, the Pakistan Air Force now stands as a vault into the operational ecosystem whose manifestation was seen during the recent conflict.”
‘Recent paradigm shift in training’
Congratulating the graduating cadets, the air chief said, “Today marks the beginning of your journey in one of the most distinguished, respected and professional air forces of the world.”
“Indeed, you are entrusted with the noble mission of defending the aerial frontiers of the motherland, and carry on the hopes of the entire nation on your young shoulders.
“You are being trained well at this leading air force academy on the strength of the recent paradigm shift in training based on future-focused technological interface, with equal emphasis on character, leadership, intellectual progress, mental resilience and physical robustness.”
Noting the presence of Saudi cadets at the ceremony, he said it was a “symbol of strong friendship and cooperation between our two great nations and our armed forces”.</p><small>2025-12-02 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021447524e16c66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958754/first-jcp-meeting-post-27th-amendment-elevates-justice-miangul-hassan-aurangzeb-to-permanent-sc-judge' target='_blank'><strong>First JCP meeting post-27th Amendment elevates Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb to permanent SC judge</strong></a><br><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), which is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary, elevated Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb to a permanent judge of the Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP held its first meeting following the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
The JCP had appointed Justice Aurangzeb as an acting judge of the Supreme Court in February after elevating him from the Islamabad High Court (IHC),
The forum also approved the elevation of Justice Zafara Ahmed Rajput as the chief justice of the Sindh High Court (SHC), and Justice Kamran Mullahkhail as the chief justice of the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
During the meeting, held at the conference room of the SC building, the JCP had considered the appointment of the SHC chief justice from among the three senior-most judges of the high court.
Those considered for the office included Justice Rajput, Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalohoro and Justice Mahmood A. Khan.
Similarly, the JCP had also considered the appointment of the BHC chief justice from among the three senior-most judges of the high court. Those considered for the office included Justice Mullahkhail, Justice Iqbal Ahmed Kasi and Justice Shaukat Ali Rakhshani.
With the establishment of the FCC, where four judges from the SC — Justices Aminuddin Khan, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi — have been appointed, as well as the resignation of Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, the total strength of the SC has reduced to 18 judges from 24.
The JCP meeting was also attended by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council representative Ahsan Bhoon, Senator Farooq Hamid Naek, Senator Syed Ali Zafar, and MNAs Sheikh Aftab Ahmad and Gohar Ali Khan.
A press release issued later said the JCP constituted a committee comprising Justice Farooq, AGP Awan, Naek, Zafar and Bhoon to make draft rules under clause 20 of Article 175A of the Constitution.
The clause calls for the drafting of rules related to the annual performance evaluation of high court judges and to the period granted to a high court judge to improve their performance if it is found to be inefficient.
After the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, changes were made to key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies.
Following these changes, SC’s Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail was included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee, while the FCC’s Justice Farooq was made a member of the JCP.
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.
The SJC also held a meeting today and constituted a committee comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Rizvi and Justice Aalia Neelum to draft rules for regulating its procedures and conduct of business under clause 10 of Article 209 of the Constitution.
“In the meanwhile, the council unanimously adopted the Supreme Judicial Council Procedure of Inquiry, 2025, provisionally,” a press release issued by the body said.</p><small>2025-12-02 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021646119082d30.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958782/son-of-ihc-judge-sent-on-physical-remand-over-fatal-car-accident-that-claimed-two-lives' target='_blank'><strong>Son of IHC judge sent on physical remand over fatal car accident that claimed two lives</strong></a><br><p>The teenage son of Justice Mohammed Asif of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) was remanded into police custody on Tuesday in a case where two young women lost their lives after being hit by a speeding sports utility vehicle (SUV).
Judicial magistrate Shaista Khan Kundi issued the remand order on the police’s request.
According to a First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Secretariat Police Station, the accident occurred late on Monday night near the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad, when a black SUV allegedly driven by the judge’s son struck two girls who worked at the PNCA.
The victims were riding a scooter when they were hit by the SUV and reportedly died on the spot. Police reported that the vehicle fled the area immediately after the collision.
The FIR, lodged on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Muhammad Asghar, states that police traced the vehicle through its registration number and later reached a private hospital where the suspect had reportedly been taken for medical treatment.
He was subsequently taken into custody, and medical and forensic samples were collected, and the vehicle was impounded for examination.
Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 322 (manslaughter) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code have been invoked in the case.
The investigating officer informed the court that further custody was required to complete the investigation, including verification of the suspect’s medical report, vehicle inspection and eyewitness statements.
After reviewing the case record and police request, the court approved physical remand of the suspect for further investigation. The bodies of the deceased were shifted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences for an autopsy.
Police said efforts were underway to obtain CCTV footage and determine whether speeding or negligence was involved, while authorities assured the families of the victims that the case would be investigated strictly on merit.
In Islamabad in 2022, an SUV allegedly driven by the daughter of a Lahore High Court judge ran over two persons near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.
As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague, Hasnain Ali, were going home at midnight when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
In July, 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the IHC that the vehicle involved in the hit and run case was driven by a woman and was in the use of Supreme Court Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed.
In February this year, a local court in Islamabad acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge. The verdict was announced by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.</p><small>2025-12-02 12:07</small></div><hr>
