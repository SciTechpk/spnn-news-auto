On Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. Subsequently, the TTAP announced the sit-in outside the Parliament House on Friday.
The sit-in started after Friday prayers and continued overnight. Participants in the sit-in are demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be moved to Shifa International Hospital.







In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”.
Demanding that they ‘be set free,’ the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets.







PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House.
“We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”.
“The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed.







TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar also attempted to deliver breakfast to the protesting opposition members from the rear side of Parliament House but was stopped by police.
Khokhar wrote on X at around 11am: “Outside the parliament to deliver food and water to friends inside. Wouldn’t mind not being let in but the refusal to let food and water go in is highly insensitive.”
“There’s no other name for this heartless behaviour but ‘yazidiat’,” he added.







TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises.
“On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said.
According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night.
Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in.
The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others.







PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors.
She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.”
She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye.
Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition.
It is worth mentioning that Achakzai had urged the prime minister to get Imran checked by doctors of his choice; however, the government has not given any response.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament.
“Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”.
“Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”.
The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released.
He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked.
Awaam Pakistan leaders to join sit-in
The Awam Pakistan party directed all leaders to immediately participate in the sit-in, while the party’s leadership departed for the venue to join the protest, according to a party statement.
Dr Zafar Mirza, the party’s central spokesperson, will represent the Awaam Pakistan at the sit-in, while party leaders from Rawalpindi and Islamabad are also accompanying him.
“The supremacy of the Constitution and the protection of democratic values are our top priorities,” Mirza said, adding that the Islamabad police and administration had “turned the Red Zone into a prison”.
“The government has placed barriers on all routes leading to KP House [in Islamabad].”
KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful
Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful.
“Imran Khan sahib’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X.







He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well.
“Those opposing Imran Khan sahib, who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.”
The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib’s family and party,” Afridi added.
“A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised.







SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema
Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government.
In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC.
“The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted.
Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”.
“The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said.







She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists.
Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!”
“Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”.
“PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded.
“Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.







Imran should be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa Hospital: personal physician
In a video statement issued on Friday night, Imran’s personal physician, Dr Faisal Sultan, suggested that the PTI founder be moved to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad so that the required expert care could be provided to him.
Dr Sultan, who is also the chief executive officer (CEO) of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH), referred to media reports about Imran losing 85 per cent of vision in his right eye.
“This is obviously a matter of grave concern, but also lends great importance to the timeliness of treatment. In addition to timely and urgent treatment, it is crucially important that such treatment may be delivered by specialists in the field of retinal surgery,” the physician stressed.
He explained that retina was a subspecialty of ophthalmology, and such specialists are especially trained and qualified to manage this kind of illness in the eye.
“The other important aspect to consider is that many times retinal problems are a reflection of underlying illnesses, which also require management, diagnosis, and review. This is not only to make sure that the existing afflicted eye can be improved and, you know, vision restored if possible, but also that the good eye is maintained in its present health and is safeguarded,” Dr Sultan said.



He further emphasised that such specialists need to be able to “work in an environment, a hospital, or a centre that maintains high standards of care, and also has the right equipment and infrastructure to provide the sophisticated and coordinated care required by Mr Imran Khan at this time”.
“One such institution is the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, which is a joint internationally certified hospital, and I believe that they do have the right infrastructure and the specialists to be able to provide this care at high quality and at excellence, which is to ensure that Mr Khan receives the care that he requires at this time.”
Dr Sultan expressed an additional request to the authorities, which was that he, Dr Asim Yousuf, or both of them be included whenever a medical team is formed for Imran’s care, to help provide all the necessary insight into the ex-premier’s medical history.
“This information and insight into his health care will provide additional value and put together the holistic team that is required at this time to deal with this very challenging problem,” he highlighted.
Imran will be taken wherever he prefers for medical treatment: minister
A day earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry spoke to the media ahead of the sit-in outside Parliament. He was asked about the blockade during the media talk, at which he maintained that the opposition had a right to protest. He went on to claim that the “blockade was not from the government’s side.”
He held that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health”.
“There is no need to deal with it politically; it is a medical issue,” he added.
Chaudhry, during his media talk, gave assurance that the PTI founder would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment amid claims regarding the incarcerated leader’s vision, stating that there would be “no negligence in the matter”.
“Wherever he (Imran) wants to go for a check-up, he will be taken. If he wants to go to Al-Shifa Eye Trust, then he will be taken there. There will be no negligence in the matter.”
“If the CJP recommends a doctor, he will be taken there,” Chaudhry added.
He called on the opposition to refrain from politicising the issue. “This is a sensitive issue; politicising it and misrepresenting facts is completely unfair.”
He added that the incarcerated leader would “now be examined by eye doctors or super-specialists, and we will try to ensure he receives every possible treatment available”.
Addressing claims of Imran’s deteriorating vision, the minister dismissed the reports and stated, “The issue did not surface when Imran’s sister met him on Dec 2 or on Dec 9 when he was examined by a medical board or on Dec 20 when the Toshakhana verdict was announced.”
“The complaint was not brought up anywhere before,” the minister said.
He further recalled that, “On January 16, it was recommended by a doctor that Imran be shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for an eye checkup. It is also on record that he was not shifted at the request of PTI, but the jail authorities and the government”.
He said that following Imran’s procedure on Jan 24, a medical report was issued by the doctors, “and then there is a ‘report’ by the lawyer” — referring to PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar’s report submitted to the SC.
He added that a new medical report will be issued soon.
The minister said that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, was “himself looking after the case”.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14153609d2efee8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973182/pakistan-always-ready-for-india-despite-late-green-light-agha' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ‘always ready’ for India despite late green light: Agha</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan skipper Salman Agha said Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.
The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.
The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government made a U-turn on its order to boycott the blockbuster Group A game.
“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Agha said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.
“We were always ready for the game, whatever the decision.”
Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the United States by 32 runs. India have also won both their matches so far.
“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Agha.
But he warned: “We have to play good cricket to win the match.” The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.
Agha believed spin would dominate, calling Tariq Usman his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.
“Tariq has been bowling well, and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Agha said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Tariq’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.
“He has been cleared twice, so there are no worries.” Agha hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during their three Asia Cup matches in Dubai last year.

 

“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” said Agha.
“It has been the norm in cricket for years, but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”
The winner will be guaranteed their berth in the next Super Eights round.
India have a doubt over explosive opener Abhishek Sharma, who has been suffering from a stomach bug.
“I hope he plays tomorrow. I hope he’s recovering well,” said Agha. “We want to play against the best, good luck to him.”</p><small>2026-02-14 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141457163317941.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973180/imran-bushra-move-ihc-to-suspend-toshakhana-2-sentences-on-medical-legal-grounds' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra move IHC to suspend Toshakhana-2 sentences on medical, legal grounds</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking suspension of their sentences in the Toshakhana-2 (Bulgari jewellery) case, citing grave medical concerns and what their counsel termed legal infirmities in the trial court verdict.
Advocate Salman Akram Raja, along with Barristers Salman Safdar, Gohar Ali Khan, and Qausain Faisal Mufti, filed the petition under Section 426 read with Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code 1898, praying for the release of the petitioners till the final adjudication of their criminal appeal.
The Special Court Central-I judge, on December 20, 2025, convicted the couple, handing down a 10-year simple imprisonment term under Section 409 PPC (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), along with a fine of Rs16.425 million. Additionally, Imran and Bushra were sentenced to seven years’ simple imprisonment under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947.
The petition contended that the conviction under two separate enactments for the same alleged act violated the principle of double jeopardy enshrined in Section 26 of the General Clauses Act 1897.
“Such dual conviction for the same alleged act is wholly beyond the mandate of law, as the petitioner could, at best, have been convicted under either of the two provisions, but not under both,” the petition argued.
Medical grounds formed a significant part of the suspension plea. Citing proceedings before the Supreme Court on February 10, 2025, wherein the lead counsel for Imran was appointed as amicus curiae, the petition noted that a medical report submitted by Dr Muhammad Arif of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) revealed severe damage to the Imran’s right eye.
According to the report, a blood clot had left the former prime minister with only 15 per cent vision in the affected eye, with treatment not possible within jail premises.
The petition further argued that the trial court erred in holding Imran to be a “public servant” within the meaning of Section 21 PPC, relying upon PLD 2024 SC 102 and Indian Supreme Court precedent. It was contended that elected holders of public office do not qualify as public servants for the purpose of Section 409 PPC.
Challenging the prosecution’s narrative, the petitioners maintained that gifts received from the Toshakhana were duly deposited and retained after payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000, strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy 2018.
The petition also raised objections to the treatment of prosecution witness Sohaib Abbasi as an approver, contending that the mandatory procedure under Section 337 CrPC was not followed.
It was argued that witness Syed Inamullah Shah, being a material participant in the alleged transaction, ought to have been arrayed as an accused rather than examined as a routine prosecution witness, reflecting a “selective approach manifestly demonstrative of mala fide intent”.
The petitioners highlighted that they remained on bail throughout the trial and faithfully complied with all terms and conditions imposed by the trial court.
The accompanying criminal appeal assails the conviction on substantial questions of law and fact, with no likelihood of immediate hearing, necessitating the suspension of sentence to prevent “manifest miscarriage of justice”.
The former PM and his spouse also filed separate petitions for early hearing of £190m corruption case. The registrar office is likely to place this matter before the bench next week.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1414410565f3c55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973179/pm-shehbaz-meets-naqvi-directs-him-to-address-security-situation-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Naqvi, directs him to address security situation in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi to address the security situation in Islamabad in a meeting on Saturday.
A press release by the prime minister’s media wing said that during the meeting, the interior minister briefed the premier on the overall security situation of the country.
“The prime minister was also given a detailed briefing on the current overall situation and security in Islamabad,” it added.
According to the press release, PM Shehbaz directed Naqvi to address the security situation in Islamabad and other matters “in an effective and efficient manner”.
The statement by the premier’s media wing further said that Naqvi would soon visit Sri Lanka, where he would “convey the prime minister’s special message” to the Sri Lankan president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Islamabad has experienced two major suicide attacks in recent weeks. One occurred on 6 February, when 36 people were killed and over 150 injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers.
The other attack took place in November, when a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area killed 12 people and injured more than 30.
PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari had held a meeting at the Presidency on Thursday to take stock of the political and security situation.
The meeting was also attended by Naqvi, as well as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and other officials.</p><small>2026-02-14 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14123932a3cb24a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973171/death-toll-in-m9-motorway-crash-rises-to-13-after-child-succumbs-to-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll in M9 motorway crash rises to 13 after child succumbs to injuries</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The death toll from the tragic traffic accident on the M9 Motorway has risen to 13 after another injured child succumbed to his injuries during treatment at Civil Hospital, Karachi.
Following medico-legal formalities, the child’s body was transported to the Edhi Home cold storage facility in Sohrab Goth by an Edhi ambulance.
The Edhi Foundation also transported the bodies of the 12 family members who lost their lives in the road mishap to their hometown of Kotri in Sindh.
The accident occurred near Ansari Bridge, close to DHA City on the M9 Motorway, when an oil tanker collided with a passenger bus.
Initial reports from police and Rescue 1122 had suggested a higher casualty figure, but later confirmation by Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed stated that 12 people had been killed and six injured at the time.
Rescue officials faced significant challenges during the operation as a large quantity of oil spilled onto the motorway, creating a risk of fire. To avoid sparks, rescue workers refrained from using electrical equipment and manually cut apart the damaged vehicles to retrieve the victims.
Authorities have cited differing causes for the accident. Malir police stated that the passenger bus was travelling in the wrong direction when it collided with the oil tanker, which was en route to Karachi.
The impact caused the tanker to overturn onto a van. Meanwhile, motorway police maintained that the accident occurred after a tyre of the oil tanker burst.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan confirmed that four vehicles were involved in the crash: an oil tanker, a passenger bus, a passenger van and a goods trailer.
Federal Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan has taken notice of the incident and directed the motorway inspector general to conduct an immediate inquiry and submit a detailed report.</p><small>2026-02-14 09:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141242006b23881.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973173/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-poised-to-be-pm-as-jamaat-i-islami-concedes' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman poised to be PM as Jamaat-i-Islami concedes</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.
The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.

Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.
His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.
Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.

The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.
‘Verdict of the people’
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”.
But a day later, he conceded defeat.
“In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement.
“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.”

Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”.
The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”.
‘Successful’
Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”.
Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success.
“It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.
“People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.”

The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.
“With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.”
Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”.
‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh.
In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“.







The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”.
Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”.
It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”</p><small>2026-02-14 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14130434ef2c121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973174/riverine-areas-of-rahim-yar-khan-rajanpur-cleared-of-dacoits-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Riverine areas of Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur cleared of dacoits: Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Saturday said the riverine (katcha) areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts had been “100 per cent cleared” of dacoits during security operations carried out over the past few weeks.
“It was a no-go area for the state, police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and other agencies. The writ of the state and its authority have been restored in the area,” she said while addressing a high-level meeting following the successful operation in the riverine areas.
Briefing on the operation, she said it was launched in three phases. “The first phase was launched at the end of December, in which ground operations were integrated with aerial surveillance. It targeted multi-pronged criminal activity.”
“In the second phase, we cordoned off major criminal strongholds, including Mach, Katcha Rajwani, and Katcha Karachi, and brought them under control,” she said.
She further said: “The third phase was the surrender phase, which continued from January 7 to February 13, during which more than 500 dacoits and criminals surrendered, including high-profile gang leaders.”
Maryam shared further details of the criminal gangs, mentioning the names of “Umrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Bingyani, Lathani, and Inder,” who surrendered in the third phase of the operation.
She noted that 34 criminals who surrendered had Rs10 million in bounties on their heads.
CM Maryam also shared details of arms recovered during the operation, including grenade launchers, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistols.
The Punjab chief minister also thanked Sindh Police and the government of Sindh for the successful operation, noting that law enforcement personnel “faced challenges in the tri-border areas” connecting Punjab with Balochistan and Sindh.
She added that the successful operation would not have been possible without the active participation of the Sindh Police and the Sindh government.
Further elaborating on the operation, she said, “Latest technology, including drones, night-vision cameras, and quad-dopters, were used in the operation. Every movement of criminals was not only digitally monitored but also tracked through aerial intelligence assets.”
She added that this left the criminals with “no chance to hide or run away.”
“The Punjab government deployed 1,700 personnel for the operation, with armoured personnel carriers and bullet-proof vehicles to ensure their safety.”
The chief minister noted that the operation was successful because “LEAs, intelligence agencies, the police department, and the provincial government acted as one unit.”
“It was a coordinated and synchronised effort,” added Maryam.
The chief minister further said, “No casualty was reported in the multi-pronged operation.”
“From a zone of fear, it has now become a zone where there is rule of law, the writ of the state, and the authority of the state,” she added.
She thanked and congratulated former Punjab inspector general of police, Dr Usman Anwer, who “played a great role” in the operation.
Speaking about the police force in border areas, she said, “For the first time in 78 years, 53 women from the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan were recruited and joined the border police.”
Maryam further described it as an “unprecedented achievement that we have to maintain”, adding that the government was planning a development package for the area and had established a committee for the purpose.
Last month, Sindh police launched an operation against riverine bandits. Since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters have taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested, Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said.</p><small>2026-02-14 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141249309cc4cdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973172/burden-of-electricity-tariff-revisions-should-not-fall-on-middle-lower-income-households-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Burden of electricity tariff revisions ‘should not fall’ on middle, lower income households: IMF</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is discussing proposed electricity tariff revisions with Pakistan authorities, the fund said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday, adding that the burden of the revisions should not fall on middle- or lower-income households.
“The ongoing discussions with the authorities will assess whether the proposed tariff revisions are consistent with these commitments and evaluate their potential impact on macroeconomic stability, including inflation,” it said in its statement.
Pakistan announced a proposed tariff overhaul, which analysts said would lift inflation while easing pressure on industry, as it seeks to meet conditions under its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) as another review of the program approaches.
The EFF is a longer-term IMF loan programme designed to help countries address deep-seated economic weaknesses and medium-term balance-of-payments problems.
Electricity carries significant weight in Pakistan’s consumer price index, making tariff adjustments highly sensitive at a time when inflation, though sharply lower than its near-40% peak in 2023, remains a key political and economic pressure point.
Pakistan’s power sector has long been weighed down by circular debt, a chain of unpaid bills and subsidies that builds up across generation companies, distributors and the government, prompting repeated tariff increases under IMF-backed reforms since 2023.
The accumulation of power sector circular debt has been contained within programme targets, supported by improved performance on recoveries and loss prevention, the Fund added.</p><small>2026-02-14 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/14115359f3e41f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973169/punjab-ctd-claims-arrest-of-26-suspected-terrorists-over-past-month' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CTD claims arrest of 26 suspected terrorists over past month</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) claimed on Saturday to have arrested 26 suspected terrorists belonging to various proscribed organisations during intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted across the province over the past month.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the department carried out 286 IBOs in different districts in view of potential terrorism threats. These operations were conducted in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sahiwal, Khushab, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Faisalabad, Jhang, Chakwal, Rajanpur, Narowal, Pakpattan and Sargodha.
During the operations, 286 suspects were interrogated, and 26 terrorists were taken into custody along with arms, explosives and other prohibited material.
One alleged militant affiliated with Al-Qaeda was arrested in Lahore, while four members of Fitna al-Khawarij were apprehended in Sargodha. Officials said the arrested suspects had links with the tribal areas.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

 

The spokesperson said 4.9 kilograms of explosives, three improvised explosive devices (IEDs), 19 detonators, 34 feet of safety fuse wire, pamphlets and magazines of banned organisations, Prima cards, mobile phones and cash were recovered from their possession.
Authorities said the suspects were planning to target important buildings in different cities to spread fear among the public.
The CTD registered 25 cases against the arrested suspects under terrorism charges and started the investigation.
In addition to the IBOs, the department, in coordination with local police and security agencies, conducted 4,662 combing operations across the province. During these operations, 160,009 individuals were checked, 538 suspects were arrested, 516 first information reports (FIRs) were registered and 389 recoveries were made.
Last month, the CTD claimed to have arrested 49 suspected terrorists and foiled a major terror plan during a province-wide crackdown in Punjab, including a “dangerous operative” allegedly linked to India’s intelligence agency (RAW).
The same month, it killed six ‘highly dangerous’ terrorists during an intelligence-based operation near Chapri Dam.</p><small>2026-02-14 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1410472375d1bbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973165/trump-says-iran-regime-change-could-be-best-thing-as-second-carrier-heads-to-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Iran regime change could be ‘best thing’ as second carrier heads to Middle East</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Friday embraced potential regime change in Iran and declared that “tremendous power” will soon be in the Middle East, as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Trump’s military moves and tough talk come even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”
He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, “there are people.”
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
“In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.”







Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in strikes last year.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the “dust.” He added: “If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left.”
Long deployments
US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.”
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.</p><small>2026-02-14 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/141111513268876.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973060/policeman-run-over-by-racer-at-cholistan-jeep-rally' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman run over by racer at Cholistan jeep rally</strong></a><br><p>BAHAWALPUR: A jeep in 21st Cholistan Desert Jeep Rally ran over and killed a police officer performing security, dampening the festivities of the event on Friday.
According to police, the accident took place on the track near Jamgarh mid-point. ASI Muhammad Bashir Ahmed Joyia, who was performing security duty, was killed when he was hit by the jeep of racer Faisal Shadikhel. 
The reports alleged that Shadikhel lost control of his vehicle that skidded off the track and ran over ASI Joiya while other officials saved their lives by reacting promptly and getting away from the path of the coming vehicle. ASI Bashir, who died on the spot, was posted at Shahr Farid Police Station. 
After the accident, the police booked Shadikhel for the killing of ASI Joiya.
Shadikhel was the unofficial winner of the first round of prepared category participants’ race on Friday. His win is considered a major upset as he was third in Thursday’s qualifying round of the prepared category.
Marrot Police Station near Jamgarh Fort in whose limits the accident took place registered a case on FIR No 46/26 under Section 322 (manslaughter) and Section 379 (theft) of the PPC on the complaint of SI Riaz Shahid.
The complainant alleged that Shadikhel committed alleged negligence on a turn that led to the accident. 
Meanwhile, according to unofficial reports, Shadikhel covered 236km in 1:43 hours and became a winner. He was followed by Mir Jaffar Magsi and Hussain Asif, in second and third positions, respectively.
Magsi was in second position in Thursday’s qualifying round. The prepared category participants’ second and final round would be held on Sunday (tomorrow), the last day of the rally.

Prosecutors said Nikhil Gupta, 54, admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the failed plot.
He entered the plea on February 13 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29.
According to the Justice Department, Gupta acted at the direction of an Indian government employee identified as Vikash Yadav, who was employed by India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which oversees the country’s foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Yadav remains at large.

The department said that in May 2023, Yadav recruited Gupta to arrange the killing of Pannun, a US citizen and lawyer who advocates for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan.
Gupta contacted a person he believed to be a criminal associate, who was in fact working with US law enforcement. That individual introduced him to an undercover officer posing as a hitman.
Prosecutors said the conspirators agreed on a $100,000 payment for the killing, and about $15,000 was paid in advance. The plot was disrupted before any attack took place.
In a statement, US Attorney Jay Clayton said Gupta believed he could target someone in the United States “simply for exercising their American right to free speech,” but would now face justice.
An FBI official described the case as an example of “transnational repression”.
The case comes amid wider tensions between India and Western governments over alleged threats against Sikh separatists abroad.
Canada has separately accused India of involvement in the 2023 killing of another Sikh leader outside a temple in British Columbia — allegations New Delhi has denied.
Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and later extradited to the United States.</p><small>2026-02-14 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/131935116133b88.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972919/asymmetric-warming-trend-islamabad-winter' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad’s nights are losing their chill as city’s winter warms up</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Winter in Islamabad, which runs from December through February, transforms the city into a serene landscape of quiet, scenic streets and chilly winds.
While the capital enjoys plenty of sunny afternoons, night temperatures frequently drop to between 1°C and 4°C. On rare occasions, a strong cold wave will even leave a delicate dusting of snow atop the Margalla Hills, drawing crowds to catch a glimpse of white-capped peaks.
Over the years, however, winter in the capital has become progressively shorter and warmer due to a combination of global warming and human-induced factors. Weather data from the Pakistan Meteorological Department between 1981 and 2025 shows a noteworthy shift in Islamabad’s climate profile.

According to an analysis of mean maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures during December and January, the warming trend is specifically asymmetric. While the overall climate is warming, minimum (nighttime) temperatures are increasing at a much faster rate than maximum (daytime) temperatures.


This chart tracks 45 years of December weather in Islamabad, showing a steady climb in daytime maximums (TX) contrasted against the high volatility of nighttime minimums (TN).

As the coldest month of the year, January’s data reveals a steady upward trend in daytime temperatures. While nights remain cold, the frequency of extreme “deep freeze” events has shifted, contributing to the overall sensation of a shorter, milder winter core. — Graph created using data from Pakistan Meteorological Department

The widening gap between the rising red line (daytime highs) and the fluctuating blue line (nighttime lows) visualises how the fundamental character of Islamabad’s winter is changing over time. — Graph created using data from Pakistan Meteorological Department

Danish Baig, the head of Meteorology at WeatherWalay — an Islamabad-based private weather company — described this pattern as widely recognised in climate science as “a strong indicator of anthropogenic climate change”. “[Such a weather pattern] suggests a transition towards a more thermally moderated winter climate regime,” he said. Dawn obtained the dataset from the Met department and shared it with Baig for analysis.

Baig’s assessment has been supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 6th report (AR6), in which the leading scientific body noted that the “frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including heatwaves) have increased, and those of cold extremes have decreased on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain). This also applies at the regional scale, with more than 80 per cent of AR6 reference regions showing similar changes.”
Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes, the IPCC confirmed.
It may be noted that the global temperature in the post-industrial age has risen more than the 1°C to 1.5°C threshold agreed under the Paris Agreement has been breached twice – in 2024 and 2025.
According to Baig, the changes in winter temperature reflect the impact of climate change in Pakistan. “The pronounced rise in winter minimum temperatures relative to daytime maxima reflects enhanced longwave radiation trapping during nighttime hours and is consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations, elevated aerosol loading, and changes in winter cloud cover,” he said after analysing the dataset.
“This asymmetric warming is a well-documented characteristic of climate change across South Asia and is particularly evident in urban and peri-urban environments,” he said. The expert added that warmer night-time temperatures “reduce the occurrence of radiative cooling, leading to fewer frost events and persistently warmer winter nights”.
He said a similar warming pattern was visible in Lahore and Peshawar as well. Meanwhile, a report prepared by the Karachi Urban Lab, which reviewed a 60-year dataset, reached a similar conclusion for Karachi.
Pakistan Met Department Chief Meteorologist Dr Muhammad Afzaal told Dawn that local factors, particularly deforestation, were also responsible for this “observed rise” in temperatures.
“Climate change drives broader warming trends, with Pakistan’s mean annual temperature rising over a recent decade, prolonging heatwaves and elevating both daily highs and lows,” he said.
Another factor making the city hotter is the urban heat island effect, he said, adding that rapid expansion since the 1990s has “significantly enhanced Islamabad’s urban heat island effect”.
“Increased built-up surfaces, reduced vegetation cover, and continuous anthropogenic heat emissions have particularly amplified night-time warming during winter,” Dr Afzaal said.
“Locally, rapid urbanisation replaces green spaces with concrete, intensifying the urban heat island effect; tree cover has dropped as housing expands, trapping heat and preventing nighttime cooling. Deforestation exacerbates this, reducing shade and carbon sequestration,” he added.
Islamabad’s residents are experiencing firsthand how the winter season is changing around them.
Nasir Jamil, a schoolteacher from Gokina village in the Margalla Hills, told Dawn that the capital city used be colder in the 1980s. He said that some peaks in the Margalla would regularly receive snow in the winter, but he has not seen these snowcapped peaks for a long time.
“There were hardly any vehicles or roads, and the city’s air was pristine, but now, deforestation and infrastructure expansion, particularly in the Margalla Hills area, have taken their toll,” said Jamil.
Climate policy expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh agreed that winters were getting warmer, saying this was evident even through “observational science”.
“The changes in weather patterns did not occur abruptly, but rather took decades, and the solutions would also need to be tailored, keeping long-term planning and sustainability in mind,” he said.
Sheikh suggested that Islamabad’s urban planning should include more indigenous solutions, such as ‘doongi grounds’ for groundwater recharge. Urban landscaping, he noted, must prioritise plants that are resilient to rising temperatures, have broad leaves to absorb carbon and support local fauna, ensuring that urban plantations can withstand increasing heat.

He added that expanding tree canopies across the city as green ringtones can help reduce the urban heat impact, while minimising asphalt surfaces can decrease water runoff and heat absorption.
Some solutions that can be deployed to adapt to a changing climate include reducing built-up areas where possible, increasing porous surfaces to support groundwater recharge, implementing rainwater harvesting, and designing better storm drains to manage urban flooding, he said.
“One thing is certain: the current developmental model cannot keep pace with changing weather patterns, and policymaking must adapt to reflect the realities of climate change and its effects on urban environments,” Sheikh said.
For adaptation, planting trees is not the answer. It requires local solutions, such as shelters for the poor and vulnerable, Dr Nausheen H Anwar, who heads the Karachi Urban Lab, said.
According to Dr Anwar, the fundamental problem is that extreme climate impacts, including cold and hot, will not cease without risk mitigation, while risk mitigation requires a global-scale intervention to reduce fossil fuel consumption.
Scientists and policy experts have suggested that to protect the public from heat, the government should have a proactive approach in the form of early warning systems, introduce more green spaces, and use innovative techniques, such as cool coatings, to reduce heat absorption. “Adaptation and risk mitigation go hand in hand,” Dr Anwar, however, noted.
Besides making cities hotter, the rising temperatures have broader “environmental and socioeconomic” ramifications.
“It changes winter energy demand patterns, increases winter smog potential, reduces the frequency of frost events, and alters agriculture chilling requirements” across northern Pakistan, according to Baig. “Winter temperature trends in Islamabad, when examined alongside Lahore and Peshawar, reveal a structurally consistent warming pattern across northern Pakistan.”
The impact on agriculture is also confirmed by the IPCC scientists, who warned that fluctuating rainfall patterns and rising temperatures, an effect of global warming, were expected to reduce yields of staple crops in the region.
In an email to Dawn, Dr Mukesh Gupta, science officer of IPCC Working Group II, said that the increased frequency of extreme weather events, like floods, directly threatens crop production and disrupts food supply chains. He proposed crop diversification and climate-resilient seeds, among other measures, to address this looming food crisis.
“Adaptation strategies, including the development and use of climate-resilient seeds, can mitigate some impacts, but financial and technological barriers limit their adoption in low-income countries like Pakistan,” he said, adding that equitable resource use and enhanced access to technology are essential to deal with this problem.

Washington Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded at approximately 3:33am on Wednesday to a report of smoke in a hallway in the 1400 block of Rhode Island Avenue NW. Firefighters entered an apartment, extinguished a small fire, and found an adult male unconscious and not breathing.
The victim was later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as 40-year-old Syed Hammad Hussain. Officials said he showed signs of blunt-force trauma as well as thermal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene after responders found no signs consistent with life.
The apartment is located near Logan Circle, a busy residential area about 1.1 miles northwest of the White House.
In an official statement issued on Friday, police said that following an initial assessment, the matter was referred to police and taken over by homicide detectives. As of Friday, no suspects had been identified.
Investigators are reviewing security camera footage from a neighbouring building. Sources familiar with the investigation told local media the footage shows Hussain entering the building with three other individuals, including a possible woman, shortly before the fire. The same individuals were later seen running from the building.
Authorities have appealed to the public for information and urged anyone with knowledge of the incident to contact police. The Metropolitan Police Department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
The Hussain family is from Lahore and is settled in Washington.

ISLAMABAD: Sitting on mammoth liabilities of Rs9.2 trillion — equivalent to half of Pakistan’s annual budget — and facing ever-rising losses and negative equity, the power sector leadership remains clueless about its business operations as a going concern and the consequential challenge to the state.
This damning charge sheet has been issued by the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance in its FY25 aggregate report on the performance of State-Owned Entities, as required by the IMF, posing a serious question mark on the credibility of power sector planning.
This is despite the fact that the power sector remains the top recipient of equity injections, while continuously bleeding the economy and consumers at large. National Highway Authority (NHA) comes as the second biggest financial black hole after the power sector.
Worst still, the business plans submitted by power sector distribution companies (Discos) tend to be descriptive rather than analytical. These plans often list intended activities, such as improving recoveries or reducing losses, but fail to model the financial impact of these interventions.
“The absence of clear financial causality undermines the credibility and effectiveness of these plans,” the CMU observed in its report released on Friday with the approval of the federal government as required under the IMF programme.
The report noted over Rs2tr of unfunded liabilities of all federal SOEs, including more than Rs1.5tr of unfunded pension liabilities in the power sector alone, in addition to around Rs1.9tr circular debt, despite around Rs800bn capital injection during FY2025.
Not only the Discos but generation companies (Gencos) typically present outdated and defensive business plans, focused on preserving existing capacity rather than optimising the asset portfolio. There is a notable lack of cost-benefit analysis of refurbishment versus decommissioning, as well as little evaluation of asset-disposal or privatisation options. Consequently, capital remains tied up in low-yield assets.
A recurring theme in Gencos plans is the sunk cost fallacy — the notion that prior investments justify continued capital expenditure. However, in a reform-oriented context, sunk costs should be viewed as historical facts, not as valid grounds for further investment. “Without rationalisation modelling, capital continues to be misallocated”, the report observed.
The report said the Discos’ plans frequently omit essential financial planning elements, such as capital prioritisation, sequencing investments aimed at loss reduction, and modelling of returns on investment. There is little consideration of indicators such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), or leverage.
“As a result, these plans lack the rigor needed to serve as tangible restructuring roadmaps and instead remain mere wish lists”, the report said pointing out “a broader challenge of Discos following an activity-based planning approach — plan, spend, and hope for positive outcomes — rather than a value-based approach that emphasises modelling, prioritisation, and strategic allocation based on return on investment”.
Overall, the CMU reported that fiscal support to SOEs increased by 37pc to Rs2.079tr in FY25, compared with the previous year’s Rs1.513tr. The expansion of fiscal support was driven by significant changes across various components, including equity injections totalling Rs729bn, led by a one-off circular debt payment.
Government loans to SOEs also grew, climbing by 34pc from Rs263.3bn to Rs354.1bn, underscoring the government’s ongoing commitment to providing direct financial resources to support SOE operations and restructuring.
In contrast to increases in guarantees, loans, and equity, both grants and subsidies declined. Grants fell by 27pc to Rs269.2bn, while subsidies dropped by 7pc, reaching Rs726.3bn. These reductions “reflect shifting government priorities or improved operational efficiencies in certain areas”.

 

Sovereign guarantees increased markedly, from Rs1.412tr in FY24 to Rs2.164tr in FY25, reflecting a 52pc rise. This change is not due to the addition of new guarantees, but rather accounting for self-liquidating guarantees on stock.
During FY25, SOEs experienced a decline in their overall profitability. Aggregate profits decreased by 13pc, falling from Rs820.7bn in FY24 to Rs709.9bn in FY25. This downward adjustment was primarily attributed to reduced financial contributions from profit-making SOEs in the oil sector, a consequence of declining international oil prices.
On the loss side, there was a slight improvement, with cumulative losses across SOEs declining by 2pc to Rs833bn in FY25 against Rs851.4bn in the previous fiscal year. “The net result of these changes in profits and losses was a total net adjusted loss of Rs122.9bn for FY25 from Rs30.6bn in FY24”, it said, putting the NHA at the top with Rs295bn loss and over Rs315bn power sector loss.
Total SOEs equity increased by 7pc, rising from Rs5.865tr in FY24 to Rs6.246tr in FY25, but this growth was primarily driven by recapitalisation efforts and significant equity injections, particularly in the power sector, to clear the circular debt stock.
On the liabilities side, there was a moderate improvement, as total liabilities decreased by 3pc to Rs31.742tr in FY25 from Rs32.57tr. Total assets value remained largely unchanged, exhibiting only a marginal decrease of 1pc to Rs37.988tr from Rs38,44tr a year earlier.
During the year, the federal government collected Rs12.97tr in tax revenue, of which approximately Rs2.1tr (about 16pc) was channelled back to SOEs through subsidies, equity injections, grants, and loans. In practical terms, every Rs6 collected in taxes results in Re1 being absorbed by SOEs.
The SOEs’ debt stock, circular debt, pensions and quasi-fiscal flows showed that total debt portfolio rose by 4pc, increasing from Rs9.196tr to Rs9.571tr, reflecting a clear re-profiling of the funding architecture among SOEs. Cash Development Loans saw a significant expansion, up 21pc to Rs2146tr. Similarly, Foreign Re-Lent exposure increased by 24pc to Rs2.16tr.
“These changes confirm a shift toward sovereign-intermediate financing, in which the federal government assumes the credit risk and SOEs act as pass-through borrowers”, the report deplored. Bank borrowing remained nearly unchanged at Rs2.8tr, suggesting a credit-saturated environment and sector-wide tightening of exposure limits.
Contributing factors include elevated leverage, a deterioration in debt service coverage, and higher expected losses. Unfunded pensions stand at Rs2.03tr, including Rs1.5tr in the power sector, and excluding the pensions of Pakistan Railways, which reports pensions on a cash basis annually rather than on aggregate pension unfunded obligations.
Statutory compliance standards were found to be weak and uneven across SOEs, with approximately 36pc of SOEs having finalised audited financial statements as of the reporting cutoff. This constrains the timeliness of performance analysis, valuation assessments, and comprehensive fiscal-risk evaluation.
The CMU called for continued strengthening in these areas — including board composition, audit timeliness, disclosure quality, and performance-linked accountability — which would support greater strategic discipline and help SOEs progress toward sustained value creation for the state.

• DP World CEO Bin Sulayem ousted as investors stop funding over ties to disgraced financier• Goldman Sachs lawyer Ruemmler resigns due to her extensive ties to Epstein in documents• PM urges probe into top Norwegians’ links to dead felon
DUBAI: The chairman and chief executive of DP World Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem’s resigned on Friday following pressure over his alleged ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, making him one of the highest-profile figures to step down after the recent release of documents.
The fallout also prompted the resignation of a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and has sparked official inquiries into political and royal figures in Norway.
Bin Sulayem’s departure from the Dubai-based logistics giant was announced the same day the emirate’s ruler appointed a new chairman for the Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, another role Bin Sulayem held.
Pressure mounted on the state-owned firm after two major investors, the UK development finance agency British International Investment and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, said this week they would suspend new investments with DP World over the matter.
Both organisations welcomed the resignation. The UK agency said it looked forward to continuing “our partnership to advance the development of key African trading ports”. In a statement, La Caisse said “the company took the appropriate measures” and it would “move quickly to work with DP World’s new leadership”.
DP World appointed Essa Kazim as the new chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, the Dubai Media Office reported. Kazim is the governor of the Dubai International Financial Centre, while Narayan was the company’s deputy CEO.
The documents, released by the US Department of Justice, revealed frequent correspondence between Bin Sulayem and Epstein for more than a decade after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
The correspondence allegedly includes business discussions, plans for Bin Sulayem to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island, and exchanges of an intimate nature. While being named is not evidence of wrongdoing, the contents prompted immediate scrutiny.

US Rep. Thomas Massie, who reviewed unredacted files, referenced the resignation in a post on X on Friday.
“DOJ red­acted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the ‘torture video email.’ @RepRoKhanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns.”







Bin Sulayem was a key architect of Dubai’s transformation, having established the developer behind the emirate’s palm-shaped islands and helping build DP World into one of the world’s largest port operators.
Top lawyer resigns
The repercussions also rea­ched Wall Street, where Gold­man Sachs’ general counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, anno­unced she will resign at the end of June.
The decision followed the release of emails showing her extensive relationship with Epstein long after his conviction.
The interactions reportedly included career advice, questioning of his sex crimes, and personal messages where Ruemmler called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey.”
Before joining Goldman Sachs in 2020, Ruemmler held senior roles at the Department of Justice and served as a legal advisor in the White House under then-President Barack Obama.
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he accepted her decision.
‘Shocking connection’
Meanwhile, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Friday it was crucial to fully investigate the relationships between prominent Norwegians and Epstein.
“I think it has been quite shocking for people to get this insight into this world and the connection between people with power. And how it has affected people without power, who have been abused and subjected to assault,” Stoere told public broadcaster NRK. “As prime minister, I have a responsibility to speak clearly about this.”

These returns add to the 5.4 million Afghans who have gone back to Afghanistan from the same two neighbouring countries since October 2023.
UNHCR says it continues to observe significant numbers of Afghans returning or being forced to return from neighbouring countries under extreme difficult circumstances. The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation — particularly for women and girls — along with a fragile economy and recurring natural disasters.
According to a recent report by the World Bank, rapid population growth fuelled by these returns led to a 4 per cent decline in GDP per capita in 2025.
The high number of returns already this year is particularly concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of the country. UNHCR’s recent survey of returnees highlights the scale of challenges they face. Just over half reported being able to find some form of work, even if informal. For women, this figure drops to less than a quarter. More than half of returnee families report having no civil documentation — such as identity cards to prove who they are or where they are from — and more than 90 per cent are living on less than $5 a day.

More than half of returnee families lack civil documentation; over 90pc live on less than $5 per day

“We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns, UNHCR said. While 5 per cent of returnees surveyed say they intend to leave Afghanistan again, more than 10 per cent know a relative or community member who has already left since returning. These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life.
“This year, our focus is on supporting the reintegration of returnees. We have the access, presence and experience of the last four decades in Afghanistan to deliver the assistance that communities say they most need, including protection services, housing and livelihood support, particularly for women.”
Along with other UN agencies and partners, UNHCR is closely monitoring the regional situation, where asylum space continues to shrink and regulated migration pathways are narrowing. Afghans increasingly feel compelled to undertake dangerous onward journeys.
“We remain prepared to respond to population movements into Afghanistan, while also continuing to call on states to uphold access to asylum, protect and assist Afghan refugees, and ensure that no one is returned to a place where their rights and freedoms are at risk,” the UN refugee agency said.
Given the dire humanitarian situation and rapidly increasing population, additional support is urgently needed in 2026 to scale up assistance and invest in reintegration, enabling people to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope and stability.

AMMAN: More than a week after he walked away from Human Rights Watch over its blocking of a report on Palestinians’ right of return, the organisation’s former country director says he is still fuming over the lack of a transparent explanation.
Omar Shakir, ex-HRW Israel and Palestine director, resigned in February after the executive director withdrew a report on Palestinian return rights before its December release.
“The report finds that Israeli authorities’ longstanding policy denying Palestinian refugees the right of return, a fundamental right well-established in law, has caused serious harm and amounts to a crime against humanity,” Shakir told AFP in Amman.
Shakir, who resigned alongside his research colleague Milena Ansari, said the organisation has not provided a written reason for pulling the report. When the story became public, Shakir said, HRW stated the report had been “paused to give them more time to conduct additional factual and legal analysis”.
Meanwhile, HRW told AFP the report’s release was delayed due to its complexity. Their review revealed the need for stronger research to meet standards, leading to a pause for further analysis, which is ongoing.
Shakir believes the decision was due to political backlash, as HRW’s new leadership worried the report might be perceived as a call to eliminate Israel’s Jewish identity.
“So, ultimately, this was not about the law or the facts,” he said. “This was a decision motivated by concerns of how the organisation would be received when issuing this report.
The “right of return” is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, dating back to the 1948 war. Approximately 760,000 Palestinians were displaced in the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, with descendants now numbering six million according to the UN. Israel sees this demand as a threat to its Jewish identity.
Smear campaign
Meanwhile, a UN human rights spokesperson on Friday expressed concern about attacks on independent UN experts after several European governments criticised Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for Palestine, and called for her resignation.
“We are very worried. We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials, are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues,” UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a press briefing.
The Czech Republic’s Foreign Minister Petr Macinka on Friday quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a “common enemy of humanity”, and he also called for her resignation.
Subsequently, Germany, France, and Italy criticised Albanese this week for remarks against Israel, accusations she refutes.
Albanese’s February 7 remarks in Doha did not label Israel as such although she has regularly criticised its actions in the Gaza conflict, Reuters confirmed.
Albanese said on X: “Three European governments accuse me — based on statements I never made — with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days.” She was citing figures from the Palestinian Health Ministry, which puts the total death toll from the Gaza war at more than 72,000.







Though unprecedented, it’s theoretically possible to introduce a motion to dismiss a special rapporteur, however, diplomats said strong support for Palestinian rights within the UN Human Rights Council means such a motion is unlikely to pass.

In a statement, GB Police said the CTD had begun work with 250 officers and personnel, while recruitment for another 600 posts would be completed during the current year to strengthen the unit’s capacity.
The statement said assistance would be sought from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for basic training and professional skills development of CTD personnel in GB.
SSP Tanveerul Hassan has been appointed head of CTD Gilgit-Baltistan. All counterterrorism-rela­ted FIRs registered so far have been transferred to the CTD police station in Gilgit.
Mr Hassan said the CTD had four wings, including investigation, intelligence and operations, and would handle terrorism-related cases across the region.
He said the case relating to Thursday’s attack on a Frontier Works Organi­sation (FWO) vehicle in the Tangir valley of Diamer had been registered with the CTD.
The federal government had approved the establishment of a CTD unit in Gilgit-Baltistan in September last year, authorising the creation of 613 new posts to combat terrorism and violent incidents, particularly along the strategic Karakoram Highway (KKH).
However, federal and regional officials were facing funding challenges, with recurring expenditure for the new posts placed on the resource-strapped Gilgit-Baltistan governm­ent and uplift funds for construction deferred until the next fiscal year.
A Central Development Working Party (CDWP) meeting on July 25, 2025, reviewed the GB government-sponsored project, titled “Raising of CTD police in GB”, estimated to cost over Rs1.5 billion. The initiative followed a directive by the prime minister to establish the CTD in GB within six months.
According to official documents, the project aims to enhance the capacity of GB Police by addressing “critical gaps in human and technical resources” to enable effective responses to terrorist incidents and comprehensive investigations. The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions is to sponsor the project.
The Ministry of Planning had cited “reduced fiscal space in PSDP” and a “substantial” existing financial commitment to GB as reasons for delays.

Talking to a select group of media persons in the federal capital, he said that Iran was countering the “Zionist and Western narrative” alongside military aggression, adding that the US and Israel had a history of “deception and backstabbing”.
“But they have seen the response in the recent 12-day conflict, and Israel was almost on its knees when the US intervened,” the envoy said. He added that wars were not fought merely with weapons but with national determination and the resilience of the whole society.
He said that the West had used all its cards in the June 2025 attack by the Zionist regime and the recent conspiracy when riots were held, and acknowledged that the resistance movements in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria had been weakened.

Moghadam urges Muslim unity, lauds Islamabad’s support for Tehran during 12-day war with Israel

“While there are ups and downs in wars and broader conflicts, the US, Israel and others have seen the advanced military capabilities as well as the strength of the Iranian nation — it is less likely there will be a war soon,” Mr Moghadam said.
‘War may affect region’
“If, God forbid, war breaks out, regional countries will have to make their own decisions, as such a war would affect the entire region,” he added.
He stressed that Iran had always called for greater unity and cooperation among Muslim countries since the Islamic revolution.
He said that all the Muslim nations were targets on their list but the priority was different. “Today it is Iran and tomorrow it will be Saudi Arabia,” he added.
Referring to the “12-day war” with Israel last year, he lauded Pakistan for supporting Iran and said that despite strong propaganda and huge networks, the Western narrative had weakened over the decades and resistance to the policies of Zionism was visible globally.
He also lauded Pakistan’s stance at regional and international forums, claiming Islamabad had supported Iran diplomatically during the recent conflict. “There is a clear understanding in Pakistan that any harm to Iran is harm to Pakistan,” he added.
The ambassador said that US President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan for Gaza was a mockery, as all the funding for the restructuring of the Palestinian territory would be in the hands of the American president, “who has no credibility”.
“Whereas the establishment of the [international stabilisation]force [for Gaza] was a dangerous move as its target was to disarm the resistance group Hamas through Muslim countries,” he added. “Pak­istan’s decision to distance itself from this force is encouraging.”
Balochistan
Speaking on common issues, he expressed concern over terrorism in Balochistan province and said that it was a bilateral matter between the two countries.
He observed that there was a need to look into the root causes of the problems faced by Pakistan’s Balochistan province and Iran’s adjoining Sistan province. He said that militant activities could not be countered through the use of force alone.
“Lack of opportunities and discontent among the people of Pakistan’s Balochistan and Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan provinces has to be addressed through economic development and cooperation to neutralise the hostile designs of the common enemies of both countries,” he added.
Women empowerment
Responding to a question on the status of women in Iran, the envoy said that while Iran had laws regarding the hijab, there was no coercion in public spaces, and women continued to play a prominent role in education and professional sectors.
He said that recent rallies on the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the revolution held across Iran witnessed participation by both veiled and unveiled women.
“There is a law regarding the hijab in our country, and that is enforced in government offices, but there is no strictness in public gatherings,” he said, adding that similar social variations were visible in other Muslim societies, including Pakistan.
He clarified that certain dress codes applied within government institutions, as was the case in many countries, but only Iran was targeted by the Western media.
“Western media never showed the progress made in this regard, as women’s participation in Iran’s higher education is huge. There are more female students in Iranian universities than male students, and women are scientists and hold senior posts even in highly technical projects,” he said.
“But nobody compares the representation of women across professions in Iran with other Islamic countries, or with what it was before the Islamic revolution,” Mr Moghadam added.
“Nobody among us would like to see the status of women as commercial products or be named in those notorious file[s of late US convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein],” the envoy maintained, and concluded that the status of women should be seen in the context of Iran’s social laws and societal norms.

As per details, the incident occurred near the traffic police office on the Old GT Road where one Tahir Beig (60) of Chak Buzarag was going home on his motorcycle when was stopped at a picket by the traffic police. 
The police officials reportedly imposed a fine of Rs2,000 on the motorcyclist for not wearing a helmet. He requested the duty officials to spare him as he did not have the amount on him to pay the fine. However, the officials declined to accept his request. 
The man then started walking towards the GTS Chowk without his motorbike to arrange the amount and pay the fine, but he fell just a few meters away and died on the spot. 
Some eyewitnesses called Rescue 1122 and they pronounced him dead after a checkup. 
The rescue and police officials later shifted the body to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH). 
A spokesperson for the Gujrat Police confirmed that the elderly man died of a heart attack after the traffic officials imposed a fine on him. 
He said that the doctors at the ABSTH had declared heart attack as the cause of his death. 
The Gujrat DPO ordered the SP (investigation) to conduct an inquiry into the incident.

The Gerald R. Ford carrier, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, US President Donald Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
One of the officials, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The Gerald R. Ford will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere”.
Trump had said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if a deal is not reached with Iran.
On Friday, he told reporters he thought that talks with Iran would be successful but warned that “if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran”.
Long deployment
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jets and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also includes sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.</p><small>2026-02-13 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/132306366857346.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972947/un-security-council-condemns-suicide-attack-on-imambargah-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>UN Security Council condemns suicide attack on imambargah in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: The 15-member United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Friday condemned the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad in the “strongest terms”.
On February 6, a suicide bomber had ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident and more than 150 were injured.
In a press statement issued by UNSC President James Kariuki, the 15-member body described the February 6 attack as a “heinous and cowardly suicide bombing terrorist attack”.
The UNSC expressed “its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan” and wished “a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured”.
Reaffirming its long-standing position, the UNSC said that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”.
The statement further stated that UNSC members stressed the need to ensure accountability, underlining “the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
They urged all states to cooperate actively with Pakistan “in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions”.
Last week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also strongly condemned the attack.
“The secretary general reiterates that attacks against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” his spokesperson said, stressing that those responsible “must be identified and brought to justice”.</p><small>2026-02-13 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1321311459f93ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972943/pm-shehbaz-lauds-uaes-consistent-unwavering-support-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lauds UAE’s ‘consistent, unwavering’ support to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday held a telephone call with United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, lauding the Gulf country’s “consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan”.
According to a press release, during their “warm and cordial conversation”, the two leaders “fondly” recalled their recent meetings in Islamabad and Rahim Yar Khan last month.
“The prime minister lauded the UAE’s consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan that had helped the country navigate through difficult challenges,” the statement said.
“This support was a manifestation of the historic, fraternal bonds between the leadership and the people of both countries,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
The statement added that the two leaders reaffirmed their shared desire to further enhance mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and the UAE.
“The two leaders also exchanged views on other matters of mutual interest and agreed to remain in close contact,” the statement said.
In a post on the social media platform X, PM Shehbaz said, “Had a most warm and cordial telephone conversation with my dear brother His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.”
He said the two reaffirmed the shared resolve to further strengthen the historic, fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE and to expand mutually beneficial cooperation.
“I thanked his highness for the UAE’s consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan that had helped the country navigate through difficult challenges,” he said.

The neighbouring countries and cricket rivals are due to meet during the group stage of the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, after Pakistan reversed a decision to boycott the match earlier in the week.

 

The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices — the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.
After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.
Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 per cent to roughly $666.
Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), said hotels were booked out.
“Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.
Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches, and lush tea plantations.

 

It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.
Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told Reuters that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20pc of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.
The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.
“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.
Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.
“I think it’s going to be a great experience, said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. I’m really excited about this match.”
Sultan added he thought Pakistan absolutely could come out on top on Sunday.</p><small>2026-02-13 16:11</small></div><hr>
