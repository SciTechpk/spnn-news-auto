Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release — posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to “stay strong”.
“There are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.”
 






Imran’s sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a key role in the PTI’s campaign to win over Americans.
Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier’s sons.
“Immense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan’s freedom,” he said.
He also praised Grenell for “standing for justice and principle” and called for unity to free the PTI founder.
 






Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said the two brothers will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p><small>2025-07-23 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23130000d8e8c40.jpg?r=130057' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926051/minister-talal-chaudhry-warns-public-of-ttp-operating-whatsapp-channels-to-spread-hate-harmful-narrative' target='_blank'><strong>Minister Talal Chaudhry warns public of ‘TTP operating WhatsApp channels to spread hate, harmful narrative’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Wednesday warned the public of terrorist groups using WhatsApp channels “to disseminate hateful content and harmful narratives”, urging the platform and the international community to help Pakistan fight the menace of terrorism.
In a post on X, the state minister said the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States — was operating its WhatsApp channels and sending bulk messages to “proliferate its violent/hateful ideology, to spread its harmful narratives, and for glorification of its terror activities.”
The state minister requested the international community and WhatsApp to “cooperate to help us fight this menace.”
“These accounts must be blocked and necessary algorithms created to auto-detect and auto-suspend such handles/numbers,” he added.
 






On 1 September 2010, the US designated the group as a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO), while the UN imposed sanctions on the entity on July 29, 2011, due to its affiliation with al-Qaeda. The sanctions include asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.
Founded in 2007, the TTP has staged a large number of attacks across Pakistan, leading to a ban on the group on August 24, 2008. It remains on the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) list of proscribed organisations.
According to data from the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), during the height of its insurgency in 2009, the group carried out 2,586 terrorist attacks and 3,021 fatalities.  A large-scale military offensive launched in 2014 dealt a massive blow to the command and control structure of the group, dramatically reducing insurgent violence throughout Pakistan. Sporadic attacks targeting security forces, however, continued.
After holding several rounds of talks with the group, former prime minister Imran Khan’s government announced on November 8, 2022, that the group had agreed to a complete ceasefire.  In November that year, however, the TTP called off the ceasefire, vowing to increase attacks on police and security personnel.
With the resurgence of the group, the country has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mainly conducted by the TTP.
In July last year, the government designated the group as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.  In Islamic history, the term refers to the period of conflict and discord caused by the Khawarij, an early Islamic sect known for their extreme interpretations of Islam and their rebellion against established authority.
Pakistan ranks second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
In December last year, the Pakistan Army said it [conducted][12 59,775 operations against terrorists.</p><small>2025-07-23 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231359034a6e734.png?r=140539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926057/india-to-resume-issuing-tourist-visas-to-chinese-citizens' target='_blank'><strong>India to resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens</strong></a><br><p>India will resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens from July 24 this year, its embassy in China said on Wednesday, the first time in five years as both countries move to repair their rocky relationship.
Tensions between the two countries escalated following a 2020 military clash along their disputed Himalayan border. In response, India imposed restrictions on Chinese investments, banned hundreds of popular Chinese apps and cut passenger routes.
China suspended visas to Indian citizens and other foreigners around the same time due to the COVID-19 pandemic but lifted those restrictions in 2022, when it resumed issuing visas for students and business travellers.
Tourist visas for Indian nationals remained restricted until March this year, when both countries agreed to resume direct air service.
 
 

Relations have gradually improved, with several high-level meetings taking place last year, including talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Russia in October.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Wednesday that Beijing had noted the positive move.
“China is ready to maintain communication and consultation with India and constantly improve the level of personal exchanges between the two countries,” he said.
India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that has been disputed since the 1950s. The two countries fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962 and negotiations to settle the dispute have made slow progress.
In July, India’s foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart that both countries must resolve border friction, pull back troops and avoid “restrictive trade measures” to normalise their relationship.</p><small>2025-07-23 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2314183241aa3fc.png?r=141934' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925649/the-honourable-men-of-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>The ‘honourable’ men of Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan — Pakistan’s largest and most resource-rich province — rarely makes headlines, and when it does, it’s often for tragic reasons: bombings, attacks on passenger buses, targeted killings, enforced disappearances, arrest of activists, or political upheavals. In recent years, another deeply troubling issue has pushed its way into the spotlight — a rise in gender-based violence and ‘honour’ killings.
While such violence has long haunted the province, the proliferation of smartphones, internet access, and social media have made it increasingly difficult to keep these crimes hidden. Over the weekend, one such incident sparked nationwide outrage: a harrowing video emerged online, showing a woman and a man being killed by a group of men in the outskirts of Quetta — reportedly in the name of honour.
At a press conference on Monday evening, while sharing details of the so-called honour-based killing, Balochistan’s Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti disputed reports that the victims were a newly married couple. “The woman and man weren’t married. The woman had five children, and the man, aged around 45 to 50, also had four or five children,” he said, suggesting that the two may have been involved in an extramarital affair.
What’s ironic here is that, over a month after the gruesome murders, when the chief minister held a press conference to share details of the case, he did not share any information regarding the perpetrators or the police investigations into the actual crime. He instead chose to focus on the marital status of the victims, insinuating — without providing any evidence — that they were engaged in an extramarital affair. The fact that the issue at hand was the murders, not the victims’ marital fidelity, seemed to be lost on the chief minister.
Although he stressed that these details did not justify the killings, his comments were seen by some as reinforcing the kind of narratives that often accompany honour-based violence. “It is a murder, a crime, no matter what anyone has done. No one has the right to kill a person this ruthlessly and make videos,” Bugti said.
The footage had earlier sparked widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, forcing the Balochistan government to take immediate action. By Sunday evening, CM Bugti had announced on X that 11 suspects had been arrested, with more arrests expected in the coming days.
 


But this wasn’t an isolated incident of violence against a woman.
Just this March, a young woman was abducted in Khuzdar, ostensibly for turning down a marriage proposal — allegedly with the backing of “influential persons”. The incident sparked public outcry, triggering protests and an uproar in Balochistan’s provincial assembly. For four days, the RCD Highway, which connects Quetta to Karachi, was temporarily closed. The woman was eventually recovered, but the public outrage took longer to die down.
Balochistan may have laws on paper, such as the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2014, but implementation remains a serious challenge. The recurring nature of such crimes shows how the state’s writ often runs second to centuries-old tribal justice systems. It also raises questions about the government’s ability, or will, to protect women.
The state seems to only spring into action when a case goes viral, suggesting that justice for women in Balochistan — and the rest of the country — depends less on law, and more on public outrage.
A history of violence against women
While so-called honour killings are tragically common in Pakistan, some cases stand out for their sheer brutality and the impunity that cloaks them. One of the most chilling incidents emerged in 2008, when five women were buried alive in the village of Babakot in Usta Mohammad. The horror of the act sent shockwaves across the country and beyond — not just because of how horrifying it was, but also due to allegations of the complicity of state officials and tribal leaders.
According to The Guardian, government vehicles were reportedly used to abduct the five women, and that the killings were allegedly overseen by a tribal chief — the brother of Sadiq Umrani, a provincial minister at the time from the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). For his part, Umrani denied the allegations, claiming that his family had nothing to do with the incident and accusing his rivals of propaganda. Nevertheless, Umrani remains a sitting member of the Balochistan Assembly and continues to be affiliated with the PPP.
The case stirred even greater controversy when, during a session of the National Assembly, Senator Israrullah Zehri defended the killings, declaring them to be in line with “tribal traditions.”
“These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them,” he said, drawing support from several male lawmakers, some of whom even criticised the woman senator who had dared to raise the issue. Despite widespread condemnation, not a single perpetrator was ever brought to justice.
Activists argue that the prevalence of such heinous crimes largely stems from the state’s failure to act. “The state sees these crimes as tribal or cultural matters and avoids intervention,” says Sadia Baloch, a human rights defender who documents gender-based violence in Nasirabad and Jhal Magsi. “Families, fearing stigma or retaliation, often choose not to report them.”
Another driving factor, Sadia adds, is the deep-rooted influence of tribal chieftains, many of whom are politically connected and shielded from prosecution.
Imrana Imdad, a psychologist offering mental health support to survivors of gender-based violence, has been tracking honour-based crimes across the Makran coast and Lasbela. She says that these crimes are frequently backed by tribal elites who benefit from political power and state protection.
“In most honour killing cases, the culprits are tied to someone in power — a minister, tribal elder, politician or government official. Such figures frequently enjoy state protection, making it nearly impossible to bring them to justice,” says Imdad.
In January 2020, a Quetta sessions court — and later the Supreme Court — rejected then-senator Sarfraz Bugti’s bail in a case involving the alleged abduction of a minor girl and ordered his arrest. For his part, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind rejected allegations linking Sarfaraz Bugti — who is now chief minister — to the case, stating that the latter had been cleared by the court. The CM’s supporters say this was a family matter within the Bugti tribe that was deliberately politicised and turned into propaganda to malign him.
In October 2021, a tribal jirga in Kalat ordered the hanging of a man and woman for allegedly defying “honour.” Once again, the executions sparked outrage and once again, no arrests followed.
Then in February 2023, the discovery of three mutilated bodies — among them an 18-year-old woman — dumped in a well in Barkhan district shook the nation. The victims were believed to be members of Khan Muhammad Marri’s family. Marri accused then-Minister of Communications and Works, Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran, of keeping his relatives in illegal detention and orchestrating their murder. Khetran was arrested but was later released on bail. He, too, currently serves in the provincial cabinet.
 
 

“The involvement of such powerful figures makes the rate of prosecution and punishment in honour killing and gender-based violence cases extremely low,” lamented Imdad. She added that while public outrage and media coverage can sometimes force authorities to act, once the noise fades, so does any hope for justice. “When people forget and move on, the families are pressured into forgiving the perpetrators, and charges are quietly dropped,” she says.
Sadia also pointed to Pakistan’s Qisas and Diyat laws — which allow families to pardon offenders — as a serious obstacle to justice.
One such example came earlier this year. In January, a man who had recently returned from the US murdered his 13-year-old daughter in Quetta over a TikTok video he deemed “objectionable.” The girl held American citizenship. The father was only arrested after public pressure mounted.
“Why must there be a media storm or diplomatic pressure before the state acts?” asks Sadia. “Why can’t the government protect women and girls as a matter of principle, not performance?”
A disturbing reality — in numbers
Each year, approximately 1,000 people — the majority of them women — are killed in honour killings across Pakistan, according to human rights organisations. These murders are typically committed by family members who claim to be defending their family’s honour.
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), at least 392 women were killed in the name of honour between January and November 2024. Punjab reported the highest toll at 168, followed by Sindh (151), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (52), Balochistan (19), and Islamabad (2). But activists believe that these figures are only the tip of the iceberg — the few cases that reached the media or police.
“The real numbers, especially in Balochistan, are far higher,” adds psychologist Imdad. “Many cases go unreported due to the influence of tribal chieftains, government officials, or individuals connected to political power.”
What has alarmed rights defenders most is the recurring pattern of impunity — particularly when those implicated include politically influential tribal or government figures. This influence often ensures that cases go unreported, underreported, or are quietly buried.
The recent killings on the outskirts of Quetta only drew public and official attention after a video of the incident went viral on social media. Yet, according to the FIR, the incident is believed to have occurred over a month ago. For weeks, there was no police investigation, no public statement, and no political response. It was only once the graphic evidence went public that the chief minister announced a series of arrests.
On July 18, Dawn.com reported another alleged honour killing — this time in Jaffarabad. But unlike the Quetta incident, there was no viral video, no public outrage and no official action. The story, like so many others, went unnoticed.
Even in the Quetta case, the delayed response has reignited uncomfortable questions: why does the state only act when violence against women is caught on camera and amplified on social media? What happens to the countless cases that never make it online?
Strong traditions, elite power, and a culture of impunity
Much of the violence faced by women in Balochistan stems from a combination of outdated tribal structures and the influence of powerful elites. At the heart of this violence are customary practices aimed at maintaining female subjugation — practices that former National Assembly member Israrullah Zehri once described as “centuries-old traditions” that he would “continue to defend.”
From honour killings and child marriages to the exchange of women to settle tribal disputes, such norms remain deeply entrenched within Balochistan’s tribal framework and are routinely shielded by the province’s political powerbrokers.
Efforts to dismantle this oppressive structure have historically been met with resistance. During the 1970s, prominent Baloch nationalist Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri introduced a resolution in the provincial assembly to abolish the tribal chieftaincy system altogether. Then-Chief Minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal backed the move, arguing that the tribal hierarchy was incompatible with justice and democratic governance. However, the decision required federal approval and was sent to the government of then-Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The proposal was never acted upon. Marri’s push for reform was one of the factors that led to growing political and administrative tensions between Baloch nationalists and the Bhutto government.
In cases of honour killings, what makes the situation even more disturbing is the alleged complicity of some of the province’s most powerful political stalwarts. Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, incumbent minister for Public Health Engineering Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran, and senior PPP leader Sadiq Umrani have all faced serious allegations ranging from illegal detention and abduction to complicity in honour killings.
“The involvement of such powerful tribal leaders with strong connection to government not only hampers efforts to combat gender-based violence and honour killings in Balochistan, but also encourages others, as there is no accountability,” says Sadia, the local human rights defender.
These are not isolated events; they form part of a long-standing pattern in which perpetrators, especially those with tribal or political clout, act with near-total impunity, while state institutions remain either paralysed or complicit — until a horrific video surfaces on social media.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.
The monsoon death toll since the end of June surged to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.
Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.
Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. “The dead body has been recovered by the locals,” the PDMA said.
Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The victims were brothers, aged 21 and five.
“Their mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,” the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner’s Office as saying.
Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.
“The current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,” the report said.
“The PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,” it said.
The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.
“The public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,” the report added.
On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.
He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.
A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.
All tourists stranded on Babusar Highway rescued
All tourists who were stranded on the Babusar Highway have been rescued and are currently in Chilas city, according to Gilgit-Baltistan spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.
“The Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,” Faraq said.
He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.“
Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.
He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ​​Babusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.
The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.</p><small>2025-07-23 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231133438800472.jpg?r=121312' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926044/noor-mukadam-case-convict-zahir-jaffer-files-review-plea-in-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam case: Convict Zahir Jaffer files review plea in SC</strong></a><br><p>Zahir Zakir Jaffer on Tuesday sought a review of the Supreme Court verdict that upheld his death sentence for the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam in Islamabad.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured by him before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had already been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The 47-page review petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed by Advocate Khawaja Haris on behalf of Zahir under Article 188 of the Constitution (review of judgments or orders by SC). The state and Noor’s father, Shaukat Ali Muqadam, were made the respondents.
 
 

The petition contended that the issue of Zahir’s alleged “unsoundness of
mind or mental capacity” that was raised before the SC in an application had not been addressed and was “given short shrift”.
It further said that “hype created on social media […] constantly created hatred towards the petitioner throughout the investigation and the trial (and even at appeal stage)”, which breached Zahir’s right to fair trial and due process.
“In [the] process of hurry, mistakes were made in the investigation and during trial,” the petition quoted a verdict from another case.
On the rape charges, the review plea argued that it was “apparent from the record that there is no evidence on the record in proof of this allegation”.
The SC had commuted Zahir’s death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, as decided by the trial court, but did not acquit him of it. While he was acquitted of the 10-year sentence for kidnapping, a one-year term was handed down for wrongful confinement under Section 342 of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the SC verdict.
Zahir’s review plea argued that the video recordings based on which the SC upheld the death sentence had not been proved during the trial and were not provided to any of the accused.
It said the apex court ruling was extensively based on video recordings stored in a digital video recorder (DVR) and on clips that the prosecution said were transferred from the DVR to a hard disk, providing the “most essential link in the chain of circumstances” on which the SC gave its verdict.
“Portions of these so-called recordings, on the basis whereof the inference of ‘last seen’ has been drawn against the petitioner, were never played during the trial, rather, only hearsay evidence thereof was led by the prosecution,” the plea stated.
The SC, in its detailed verdict, had stressed the significance of digital evidence by declaring that footage can be admissible as primary evidence under the “silent witness theory” — a rule of evidence that allows for photog­r­a­­phic video or other recorded evidence to be admitted as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness’s testimony.
 
 

Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, who led the three-member bench, observed that the silent witness theory of authentication had developed in almost all jurisdictions over the last 25 years to allow photos to substantively “speak for themselves”.
The SC had also noted that Zahir neglected to provide any explanation for the victim’s presence at his residence and the ensuing recovery of her body from the premises.
Zahir is also contemplating filing a mercy petition before President Asif Ali Zardari, with a letter by jail authorities seeking the formation of a medical board so its opinion could be included in the plea. A presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could provide Zahir pardon or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
SC verdict
A three-member bench, led by Justice Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, heard Zahir’s appeal against his death sentence.
The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the PPC.
However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence. The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.
 
 

While the 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was overturned, Zahir was handed one year of imprisonment for wrongfully confining Noor.
The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.
The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their 10-year sentences were also taken up by the SC.
The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient and allowing them to be released.</p><small>2025-07-23 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23112822329d550.jpg?r=112949' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925948/pakistans-asia-cup-participation-to-be-discussed-at-acc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s Asia Cup participation to be discussed at ACC meeting</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An important meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is being held on Thursday in Dhaka where Pakistan’s participation in this year’s Asia Cup in India will come under discussion.
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi as the head of the ACC was expected to leave for Dhaka on Tuesday night to head the said meeting.
The ACC meeting is considered important, particularly in the backdrop of the the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in India in the month of September.
According to reports, no official of the BCCI will visit Bangladesh to attend the ACC meeting. There are also media reports that Sri Lanka, Oman and Afghanistan may also not attend.
Though the Asia Cup is an impo­rtant continental event, due to strained political relations between India and Pakis­tan, particularly after the military encounter between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May this year, the fate of the said competition is hanging in the balance.
On its part, the BCCI has said that the political relations between India and Bangladesh are not normal. Therefore, the ACC meeting should be shifted from there to any other venue. But the ACC did not change the venue.
Whether Pakistan visit India for the Asia Cup or a hybrid model will be followed — which was adopted for the ICC events — is yet to be decided.
Under the hybrid model, both India and Pakistan agreed to play their respective matches of ICC events — like the World Cups and the Champions Trophy — on neutral venues.

• Sindh Chamber of Agriculture vows to move court or go for some other crops
HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) has announced that it will challenge the 45pc agricultural income tax in court. It described the tax as ‘unconstitutional, illegal and unethical’, and asked its members and farmers across Sindh to boycott wheat cultivation this year.
The decision was taken at meeting of the chamber held here on Tuesday under the chairmanship of its patron-in-chief, Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar.
The meeting rejected the tax and claimed that it was imposed under directives of the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF).
The farmers who attended the meeting argued that they were not receiving fair prices for their produce and, as such, there was no justification for the imposition of such a tax.
The meeting asked farmers across Sindh not to pay the tax, and warned that if government resorted to arrest them for on this disobedience, millions of other farmers would also court arrest. “We are ready to face imprisonment, but will not pay the agricultural income tax,” farmers’ leaders at the meeting declared.
The participants announced a complete boycott of agricultural income tax and asked the government for the exemptions similar to those given to industrialists.
The SCA told farmers to boycott wheat cultivation for the 2025-26 season on the ground that they were not getting adequate support prices.
The farmers vowed to go for growing alternative crops, such as mustard, nigella (kalonji), sunflower and other oilseeds instead. They said that due to very low wheat prices, they could not even recover the cost of production, and this year will be marked as a ‘boycott year’ for wheat cultivation.
Decline in cotton production
The chamber expressed its deep concern over 40pc decline in cotton production, estimating that the yield would not exceed four million bales. It said farmers were receiving only Rs6,500 per maund for cotton although the Sindh agriculture minister had promised Rs11,000 per ma­und which did not materialise.
SCA demanded withdrawal of the 18pc local tax on cotton and imposition of a 25pc tax on imported cotton to discourage imports this promoting local production. It expressed its concern over rising cost of agricultural inputs, citing a Rs22 per liter increase in diesel prices and Rs600 per bag increase in DAP fertiliser over the last 15 days.
It said that skyrocketing prices of essential agricultural inputs were crippling farmers, especially since they were not receiving fair prices for their produce. These developments, it warned, indicated a deliberate destruction of agricultural sector. It demanded immediate rollback of increased prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides and other agricultural inputs.
The chamber urged farmers to contact their respective mukhtiarkars (administrative officers) and related officials to get themselves registered for the Benazir Hari Card. It demanded that the subsidy of Rs10,000 per acre, currently available to sunflower and canola crops, be extended to mustard and rapeseed crops as well.
The meeting was attended by Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority Chairman Kabool Khatian, general secretary Zahid Bhurgari, Nabi Bux Sathio, Shahnawaz Khan Jamali, Asghar Khan Noonari, Murad Ali Khan Nizamani, Sikander Ali Sariwal, Bilal Khan Laghari, Abdul Karim Talpur and others.

JOURNALIST Omar Al-Qattaa poses for a picture in the Gaza Strip.—AFP

GAZA CITY/PARIS: Journalists belonging to this news agency in the Gaza Strip said on Tuesday that chronic food shortages are affecting their ability to cover Israel’s aggression in the besieged territory.
Palestinian text, photo and video journalists working for the international news agency said desperate hunger and lack of clean water is making them ill and exhausted.
Some have even had to cut back on their coverage of the conflict, now in its 22nd month, with one journalist saying  “we have no energy left due to hunger”. The United Nations in June condemned what it claimed was Israel’s  “weaponisation of food” in Gaza and called it a war crime, as aid agencies urge action and warnings about malnutrition multiply.
Israel says humanitarian aid is being allowed into Gaza and accuses Hamas of exploiting civilian suffering, including by stealing food handouts to sell at inflated prices or shooting at those awaiting aid.

France’s top diplomat calls for foreign press access to the besieged territory

Witnesses and Gaza’s civil defence agency, however, have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of firing on aid seekers, with the UN saying the military had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food since late May.
‘We have no energy’
Bashar Taleb, 35, is one of four photographers of this news agency in Gaza who were shortlisted for the prestigious Pulitzer Prize earlier this year. He lives in the bombed-out ruins of his home in Jabalia al-Nazla, in northern Gaza.
“I’ve had to stop working multiple times just to search for food for my family and loved ones,” he said.  “I feel for the first time utterly defeated emotionally. “I’ve tried so much, knocked on many doors to save my family from starvation, constant displacement and persistent fear but so far to no avail.” Another Pulitzer nominee, Omar al-Qattaa, 35, is staying in the remains of his wife’s family’s home after his own apartment was destroyed.
“I’m exhausted from carrying heavy cameras on my shoulders and walking long distances,” he said.  “We can’t even reach coverage sites because we have no energy left due to hunger and lack of food.” Qattaa relies on painkillers for a back complaint, but said basic medicines were not available in pharmacies, and the lack of vitamins and nutritious food have added to his difficulties.
The constant headaches and dizziness he has suffered due to lack of food and water have also afflicted contributor Khadr Al-Zanoun, 45, in Gaza City, who said he has even collapsed because of it.
“Since the war began, I’ve lost about 30 kilos and become skeletal compared to how I looked before the war,” he said. “I used to finish news reports and stories quickly. Now I barely manage to complete one report per day due to extreme physical and mental fatigue and near-delirium.” Worse, though, was the effect on his family, he said. “They’re barely hanging on,” he added.
‘Hunger has shaken my resolve’
Eyad Baba, another photojournalist, was displaced from his home in Rafah, in the south, to a tent in Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, where the Israeli military this week began ground operations for the first time. But he could not bear life in the sprawling camp, so he instead rented an apartment at an inflated price to try to at least provide his family some comfort.
Baba, 47, has worked non-stop for 14 months, away from his family and friends, documenting the bloody aftermath of bullets and bombs, and the grief that comes with it. Hardest to deal with, though, is the lack of food, he said.
“I can no longer bear the hunger. Hunger has reached my children and has shaken my resolve,” he added. “We’ve psychologically endured every kind of death during our press coverage. Fear and the sense of looming death accompany us wherever we work or live.” Working as a journalist in Gaza is to work  “under the barrel of a gun”, he explained, but added:  “The pain of hunger is sharper than the fear of bombing. “Hunger robs you of focus, of the ability to think amid the horrors of war.”
‘Living the catastrophe’
Text journalist Ahlam Afana, 30, said an exhausting  “cash crisis” — from exorbitant bank charges and sky-high prices for what food is available — was adding to the issue.
Cash withdrawals carry fees of up to 45 percent, said Zanoun, with high prices for fuel — where it is available — making getting around by car impossible, even if the streets were not blocked by rubble.
“Prices are outrageous,” said Afana.  “A kilo of flour sells for 100-150 shekels ($30-45), beyond our ability to buy even one kilo a day. “Rice is 100 shekels, sugar is over 300 shekels, pasta is 80 shekels, a litre of oil is 85-100 shekels, tomatoes 70-100 shekels. Even seasonal fruits now — grapes, figs — cost 100 shekels per kilo.
“We can’t afford them. I don’t even remember how they taste.” Afana said she keeps working from a worn-out tent in intense heat that can reach more than 30C, but going days without food and only some water makes it a struggle.
 
 

“I move slowly, unlike before,” she said.  “The danger isn’t just the bombing. Hunger is slowly killing our bodies and threatening our ability to carry on. “Now, I’m not just reporting the news. I’m living the catastrophe and documenting it at the same time.”
‘I prefer death over this life’
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on July 8 that more than 200 journalists had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, 2023. Video journalist Yousef Hassouna, 47, said the loss of colleagues, friends and family had tested him as a human being  “in every possible way”. But despite  “a heavy emptiness”, he said he carries on.  “Every frame I capture might be the last trace of a life buried beneath the earth,” he added.
“In this war, life as we know it has become impossible.” Zuheir Abu Atileh, 60, worked at AFP’s Gaza office, and shared the experience of his journalist colleagues, calling the situation  “catastrophic”. “I prefer death over this life,” he said.  “We have no strength left; we’re exhausted and collapsing. Enough is enough.”
Calls for press access
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday called on Israel to allow foreign press into the besieged Palestinian territory of Gaza, as warnings of famine mount after 21 months of war.
He spoke after this news agency warned that the lives of Palestinian freelance journalists it was working with in Gaza were in danger and urged Israel to allow them and their families to leave the occupied coastal territory.
“I ask that the free and independent press be allowed to access Gaza to show what is happening there and to bear witness,”  Barrot told France Inter radio in an interview from eastern Ukraine.
Asked if France would help stringers of this news agency leave Gaza, Barrot said France was  “addressing the issue” and hoped to be able to evacuate freelancers working with French journalists  “in the coming weeks”.
On Monday,  an association of journalists, the Societe des  Journalistes (Society of Journalists), sounded the alarm, urging   “immediate intervention” to help reporters working with the agency in  Gaza.
The SDJ cited the example of one such freelancer, a  30-year-old living with his family in Gaza City, who reported on Sunday that his older brother “fell because of hunger”. “We have lost journalists in conflicts, we have had injuries and prisoners in our ranks, but none of us can remember seeing a colleague die of starvation,” it said.
The management responded in a statement posted on X and Instagram which said that it shared the anguish about the  “dire situation” of colleagues in Gaza.
“Since Oct 7, Israel has prohibited access to the Gaza Strip for all international journalists. “In this context, the work of our Palestinian freelancers is crucial to inform the world,” it said.
“But  their lives are in danger, which is why we urge the Israeli authorities  to allow their immediate evacuation along with their families.” This news agency evacuated its eight staff members and their families from Gaza between  January and April 2024.
Barrot called for an  “immediate ceasefire” after Israel on Monday expanded military operations to the central city of Deir el-Balah. “There is no longer any justification for the Israeli army’s military operations in Gaza,” he said.
“This is an offensive that will exacerbate an already catastrophic situation  and cause new forced displacements of populations, which we condemn in  the strongest terms.”

A passing-out ceremony was held here on Tuesday in which Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz handed over the flag to the CNF.
She also met the CNF personnel and inspected vehicles and equipment.
CNF DG Brig Mazhar Iqbal gave briefing about the formation and work of the force to the CM.
Some 866 personnel have been recruited in the first phase in the CNF. It has been made functional in all divisions. In the first phase, CNF stations and regional directorates have been established in each division of Punjab. In the second phase, the scope of CNF will be expanded to the district level.
 






The CM was informed that the CNF officers and personnel were given 12 weeks of professional training at the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) Academy, Rawalpindi.
Speaking on the occasion, CM Maryam said the future of Punjab was bright with the formation of the CNF. With the establishment of the CNF, she said the menace of drugs would soon be eradicated from Punjab.
“When I assumed the office, I received requests from the parents to protect their children from the menace of drugs. It is highly regrettable that drugs are being transported to every street, neighbourhood, universities and schools,” she said.
She said the CNF had become functional in all  divisions of Punjab. Some 12,000 applications were received for the recruitment in Punjab CNF, out of which 850 soldiers and officers have been selected.
She said: “Just as every disease cannot be cured with a single pill, similarly crime cannot be eradicated with a single force. There was a dire need for the establishment of a specialised department to solve the problems of a large chunk of population. Whenever any problem arises in Punjab, the commissioners and deputy commissioners are called upon to redress the grievance at the earliest, as a result they leave all their other administrative work and focus their attention towards achieving the assigned task.”

Area SHO Sadaruddin Mirani told Dawn that three-year-old Husain Ali had been kidnapped from Sector A-17 and the family had lodged an FIR (731/25) under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown persons around two and a half months ago.
The officer said, on Monday an uncle of the child had gone to offer prayer at a mosque in Sector A-16 of Shah Latif Town where he found his missing nephew begging outside the mosque along with a man. The uncle and area residents caught the man, who was beaten and handed over to police. He was identified as Shaharyar.
During grilling, the held suspect told the police that his in-laws had given him the child. On the information extracted from the suspect, the police also arrested the couple.
According to media reports, the child had been kidnapped when he was returning home from a local shop in Shah Latif Town. The family had been desperately searching everywhere for the missing child.
Area residents told the media that several children had been abducted from their area, and they strongly suspected that an organised kidnapping gang might be behind the disappearances.
They have urged the authorities to carry out a thorough investigation into the missing children.

Exports registered notable growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, largely attributed to recent shifts in the regional political landscape. However, trade relations with these countries have remained strained in recent years, primarily due to challenges stemming from restrictive government policies.
Despite the uptick in exports, the overall trade gap with regional partners widened, driven predominantly by increased imports from China, India, and Bangladesh during the months under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries was $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-June FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 20.79pc to $16.312bn in FY25 from $13.504bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China totalled $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn in FY25 from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India increased pc to $220.58m in FY25 from $206.89m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 6.62pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.43m in FY25. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan increased 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25 from $558.03m last year. Imports stood at $25.89m against $11.96 in FY24, a growth of 116.47pc. Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan has exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.
No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. However, Pakistan has opted for barter trade amid the thriving smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG via a porous border of Balochistan.
Exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m in FY25 from $661.19m. Imports grew 38.47pc to $78.31m in FY from $56.55m over the last year. The increase resulted after the toppling of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has started exporting rice to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 4.14pc to $376.61m in FY25 from $392.89m over the last year. This decline in exports to Sri Lanka occurred following the recession in economic activity.

“The confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future,” Prime Minister Shehbaz said while chairing a meeting on Tuesday regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan.
The prime minister acknowledged that multiple measures were being taken to enhance the security of Chinese nationals across the country, including in Islamabad.
 






He said that the Safe City projects were an excellent example of this increasing capacity. He added that Safe City projects were being built across the country as per the international standards.

Unveils plan to overhaul police training, align it with military academy standards

“China is our friendly country,” said the prime minister stressing that the protection of Chinese brothers was the top priority of the government. He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a highly important joint project between the two countries which had now entered its second phase, where business-to-business cooperation will be prioritized between the two countries.
In light of the development of CPEC, the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, he said, while issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure.
 
 

During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the progress of special security arrangements for Chinese nationals across the country.
Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi informed the PM about the security arrangements being implemented nationwide. It was said special security arrangements for Chinese nationals had been enforced in light of potential terror threats.
The federal government and all provinces were working in full cooperation on this matter, while safe city projects were under construction across the country, it was highlighted.
Chinese nationals were also being provided with security escort facilities for travel, the PM was told.
The meeting was further informed that all new housing projects would be equipped with cameras that meet Safe City standards.
Training facility inaugurated
Earlier, the PM visited the National Po­­l­ice Academy (NPA) and Islamabad Safe City Capital Command and Control Centre.
Addressing the 52nd Commons Batch of Assistant Superintendents of Police (ASPs), the PM announced plans to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the institution, aligning it with the standards of the Pakistan Military Academy.
He also inaugurated the ‘Raising the Standard: NPA Tactical Firing Range and Elite Police Training Facility’, a state-of-the-art complex designed to provide han­ds-on tactical training to police officers.
Besides, the PM performed the groundbreaking ceremony of the new ASP Hostel, aimed at providing modern residential facilities for trainee officers.
He outlined a bold vision for the academy’s revival, announcing the launch of a Master’s degree programme for trainees and the establishment of a 25-acre state-of-the-art campus where a training school, with a modern firing range, would be built. “Collaboration with international partners, including China and the United Nations, is planned to upgrade training standards,” he added.
In his address, PM Shehbaz praised law enforcement agencies along with security forces for their commitment to eradicate terrorism from the country. He urged police force to uphold justice and ensure safety and protection of the life and properties of the people.
He praised the leadership of police institutions, including trainers and course commanders, and encouraged enhancement of the Gilgit-Baltistan quota. “We aim to equip our officers not only with weapons but also with modern technology and critical thinking. From hostels to classrooms, the entire structure will be refurbished,” he said.

• Brother of slain woman still not in custody, BHC told
QUETTA: The Balochistan As­­sembly unanimously adopted a joint resolution moved by Women Parliamentary Caucus, conde­m­ning the barbaric killing of a couple in the Dagari coal mines area of Quetta district, reportedly in the name of so-called honour.
Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola, who belongs to the PPP, presented the resolution in the house on behalf of the Women Parlia­mentary Caucus and several ministers.
The house, presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Khan Achakzai, condemned the killing and termed the incident a horrifying example of the continued misuse of the concept of honour to justify the killing of innocent people, especially women. “Such acts are not only condemnable and shameful but also an assault on the peace and stability of society as a whole,” the resolution said.
The resolution emphasised that honour killings had no connection to the Baloch cultural values, provincial or national traditions, or any religious and moral principles, calling this practice entirely inhumane.
Speaking on the resolution, the members expressed concern over the recurring nature of such crimes. “No individual or group has the right to act as judge, jury, and executioner,” the resolution declared. “Justice is the sole responsibility of the state,” it said.
The provincial assembly urged the PPP-led Balochistan government to ensure immediate arrest and strict punishment to the perpetrators to discourage such heinous crimes to prevent such incidents in the future.
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also suggested forming a committee, comprising treasury and opposition members, to oversee progress in the case.
JUI-F member Shahida Rauf said that no one had the authority to hold tribal courts or take decisions outside the formal legal system. She stressed that legal disputes must be settled in courts, and even tribal feuds should be resolved through jirgas, not through violence.
Provincial minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani said the killing of the couple was a tragic event and a stark reminder that such incidents were occurring even in the 21st century. “No one has the right to take a life,” she asserted. Adviser to the Chief Minister Meena Majeed Baloch called for the elimination of outdated customs related to women.
 






JI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman also condemned the killings, affirming that while Islam promoted honour and modesty, it did not permit anyone to violate the sanctity of life or household.
Earlier, Balochistan National Party (BNP-Awami) MPA Mir Asad Baloch staged a walkout against a CTD raid at his residence. Speaking on a point of order, he stated that security forces stormed his home on July 9. “If there were any allegations, I should have been summoned,” he said, adding that he was taken to the CTD Centre and released after four hours. “The use of such force only breeds resentment,” he remarked before walking out.
BHC CJ briefed
Meanwhile, police officials informed Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech that no further arrests had been made in the case.
They said the brother of the slain woman had also been on the run. “Efforts are underway to arrest Jalal, who shot his sister after the jirga ordered the killing of the man and woman,” sources said.
Home Additional Chief Secre­tary Hamza Shafqaat, Additional IG Saeed Wazir, and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Abdul Saboor Agha appeared before the chief justice in his chamber and submitted a progress report.

The launch ceremony, held at the CM House, was attended by Federal Minister for Investment Qaiser Shaikh, provincial ministers, secretaries, senior bureaucrats, and members of the business community.
Speaking at the event, Mr Shah termed the initiative a “transformative moment” for Sindh’s economy and governance. “SBOSS is more than a digital solution — it is a foundational reform in the structure of governance,” he said, calling it a major step towards improving the ease of doing business and empowering the private sector.
The platform, developed under the World Bank-supported CLICK Project, currently offers 32 e-licensing services across nine key departments, with plans to expand to over 130 regulatory services from 16 departments. It operates 24/7 and is integrated with national databases including NADRA, SECP, 1LINK, and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), enabling real-time identity verification and secure digital payments.

SBOSS offers 32 e-licensing services across nine key departments

For the first time in Pakistan, blockchain technology has been incorporated into a business facilitation portal to ensure data integrity, transparency, and protection against forgery.
“Whether you are a large investor or a small business own­er operating from home, SBOSS guarantees fair, predictable, and convenient access,” the chief minister said, inviting entrepreneurs to utilise the service.
He acknowledged the perception challenges facing the Sindh government but said the administration remained committed to modernising governance. “We must work at the pace of the world or risk falling behind. Sindh will lead in industrial development,” he said.
Mr Shah noted that Pakistan had improved its position on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index from 147th to 108th over the last three years. “To bring prosperity to the country, we must prioritise industrial growth,” he said.
He added that all licensing processes would now move online, allowing applicants to receive approvals digitally. The next phase of SBOSS will include the digitisation of all regulatory and licensing services, the establishment of Business Facilitation Centres across Sindh, and the launch of a 24/7 Digital Contact Centre.
“This launch is only the beginning. We are building a future defined by innovation, efficiency, and shared economic prosperity,” Mr Shah said, thanking the World Bank for its strategic support and lauding the Sindh Investment Department and partner agencies for delivering the reform.
Speaking at the event, Federal Minister Qaiser Shaikh termed SBOSS a “significant step” in facilitating business operations and said the federal government was committed to simplifying licensing procedures to improve the investment environment.
He appreciated the Sindh government’s efforts to promote business, noting improvements in the national currency and foreign exchange reserves. “Economic indicators are showing positive signs of growth. The first SBOSS license issued today marks a new beginning,” he said.
Special Assistant to CM Qasim Naveed and Secretary Inves­tment Raja Khurram Shahzad also spoke on the occasion.
The SBOSS platform is now live and accessible to users across Sindh.

A delegation of top businessmen, led by Gohar Ijaz and including Atif Ikram Sheikh, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), met with the army chief at the General Headquarters (GHQ) on Monday.
According to a statement issued by the FPCCI, the delegation presented a detailed overview of the challenges facing the industrial sector, particularly concerns over the recently expanded powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Special emphasis was placed on the controversial provisions under Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act 1990, which allow for arrest and detention.
 
 

The FPCCI president said the business community was grateful to the army chief for directing that the enforcement of these provisions be held in abeyance. He also underscored the need for a meaningful dialogue between the FBR and business stakeholders to resolve ongoing disputes and rebuild trust.
The statement noted that GHQ, through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), would continue to support economic activities and foster an environment of collaboration. The delegation praised the government and SIFC for their efforts, which have brought a measure of stability to the economy.

The FPCCI chief also urged for a reduction in interest rates in line with inflation to support business growth. He highlighted delays in notifying amendments to the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), particularly the exclusion of cotton, yarn, and greige fabric from the scheme, and the imposition of an 18pc sales tax on their imports.
He further drew attention to high electricity prices, which continue to weigh heavily on manufacturers and exporters. The FPCCI acknowledged the field marshal’s ongoing efforts to secure more competitive power tariffs, especially for industrial and export sectors.
The delegation assured the army chief of the business community’s unified commitment to reviving the economy. “Under Field Marshal Asim Munir’s guidance, we are confident Pakistan can unlock its full potential, restore investor confidence, and achieve inclusive economic growth,” the statement said.
Khalid Hasnain adds from Lahore: Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President termed the meeting impressive, as the army chief assured the delegation that there would be no issues for the business community.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi managed the meeting, which lasted for almost four hours after starting around 8pm on Monday night, the LCCI president maintained.

• 156 lawmakers remained absent without submitting leave applications
ISLAMABAD: Only 78 members of the National Assembly (MNAs) attended every sitting during the budget session last month, while 10 did not attend a single sitting, according to a new report released on Tuesday.
The budget session, which lasted 13 sittings from June 5 to 27, was frequently marred by poor attendance of MNAs, particularly from the treasury side, forcing lawmakers to point out the absence of government ministers.
The protest prompted the speaker to direct government members holding finance-related portfolios to attend the sessions.
Yet the finance minister, who is a senator, attended nine, or 69 per cent of sittings, according to a report released by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
The minister of state and parliamentary secretary for finance and revenue, both MNAs, were present in 11 or 85pc of sittings.
Notably, the economic affairs minister, also a senator, did not attend any sitting during the session, despite his portfolio being closely related to issues discussed during the budget session.
According to the report, 83pc of members in the 336-seat house were present on June 10 when the Finance Bill, 2025 was introduced.
However, as the discussion progressed into general topics, attendance declined, reaching its lowest point — 57pc — on the third sitting.
The attendance resurged again at 79pc on the final day of the discussion, which also included deliberations on Senate recommendations and charged expenditures.
A marked increase was observed towards the end of the session, with attendance rising above 9pc  during voting on demands for grants and the Finance Bill.
The highest attendance was 93pc, recorded on the day the Finance Bill was passed.
An analysis of the attendance and leave applications read during the proceedings showed 235 members, or 75pc of the current strength, missed at least one sitting during the budget session.
However, only 79 members submitted leave applications for their absence. Of them, 13 applied for leave in advance, while 46 submitted the application while on leave or after returning.
The leave applications of the remaining 20 lawmakers were read on a day falling in the middle of their period of absence.
As many as 46 members sought approval for the entire duration of their absence, while the remaining 36 were absent for longer than the number of days for which they had requested leave.
As many as 156 members remained absent without submitting any application during the session.
A total of 22 female MNAs, including 19 on reserved seats and three on general seats attended all sittings.
Meanwhile, all seven minority members attended more than half of the sittings, including three who attended all sittings.
Among male MNAs elected on general seats, 10 did not attend any sitting, 35 were present in less than half of the sittings and 208 attended more than half of the sittings. Meanwhile, 54 were present in every sitting.
Among the cabinet members, the federal ministers for parliamentary affairs and public affairs unit attended all sittings.
Likewise, the ministers of state for overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, national food security & research, and religious affairs & interfaith harmony were present throughout the session.
The majority of lawmakers from PML-N, PPP, MQM-P and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) attended more than half of the sittings.
The sole member of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan attended every sitting.
Lawmakers from the Balochistan Awami Party, National Party and the PML-Zia attended more than half of the sittings.
The sole representative of the PkMAP attended less than half of the sittings.

• WHO accuses IDF of storming its facilities
• EU foreign policy chief asks Israeli counterpart to stop killings at aid points
GENEVA: The United Nations (UN) on Tuesday said Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started operations.
An officially private effort, the GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel halted supplies into the Gaza Strip for more than two months, sparking famine warnings.
GHF operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.
“Over 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food in Gaza since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operating,” UN human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told AFP.
“As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near UN and other humanitarian organisations’ aid convoys.” Kheetan added: “Our data is based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organisations.”
Malnutrition claims lives
Meanwhile, the head of Gaza’s largest hospital on Tuesday said 21 children have died due to malnutrition and starvation in the Palestinian territory in the past three days, while Israel pressed a devastating assault.
Gaza’s population of more than two million people is facing severe shortages of food and other essentials, with residents frequently killed as they try to collect humanitarian aid at a handful of distribution points.
“Twenty-one children have died due to malnutrition and starvation in various areas across the Gaza Strip,” Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza, told reporters.
Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza’s remaining functioning hospitals “every moment”.
“We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza,” he added.
‘Horror show’
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Gaza a “horror show” in a speech on Tuesday, with “a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times”.
Chaotic scenes have become frequent at aid distribution areas since the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began overseeing aid operations.
Latest attacks
Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 81 Palestinians, including 31 aid seekers, in attacks across Gaza since dawn, a day after tanks pushed into southern and eastern parts of Deir el-Balah for the first time, according to an Al-Jazeera report.
Also, the World Health Orga­nisation said Israel attacked its facilities amid its expanding ground operations. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that Israeli strikes on the Al-Shati camp west of Gaza City had killed at least 13 people and wounded more than 50.
He said two people were killed in Deir el-Balah.
The UN agency’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused troops of entering its staff residence, and forcing women and children to evacuate, as they handcuffed, stripped and interrogated male staff at gunpoint.
‘Morally unacceptable’
Reports of the latest death toll came as the Roman Catholic church’s most senior cleric in the Holy Land said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “morally unacceptable”.
“We have seen men holding out in the sun for hours in the hope of a simple meal,” Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa told a news conference in Jerusalem after visiting Gaza.
Civilian killings ‘must stop’
In the meantime, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told her Israeli counterpart Tuesday that Israel’s military “must stop” killing civilians at aid distribution points in Gaza.
Kallas wrote on X that “the killing of civilians seeking aid in Gaza is indefensible”.
“I spoke again with Gideon Saar to recall our understanding on aid flow and made clear that IDF must stop killing people at distribution points,” she wrote.

• Shah Mehmood Qureshi among six acquitted in Sherpao Bridge case
• PTI leadership vows to move high court against ‘unjust’ decisions
• Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated by acting Punjab Assembly speaker
LAHORE: Several PTI leaders were handed down decade-long sentences by two anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha in connection with cases registered in the aftermath of the May 9, 2023, violence that had engulfed the country following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in a corruption case.
In Lahore, ATC Judge Arshad Javed announced the decision in Kot Lakhpat Jail around 9:30pm in the presence of the incarcerated PTI leaders, who were implicated in the Sherpao Bridge case.
The court awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid. Besides four senior leaders of the PTI, the judge sentenced as many accused to 10-year rigorous imprisonment, including Afzaal Azeem Pahat, Ali Hassan, Khalid Qayum and Riaz Hussain.
The court, however, acquitted PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi. This is the first verdict in any of the cases related to the May 9 riots in Lahore. The judge acquitted six accused, including Mr Qureshi, who, as per his defence, was in Karachi on the day of the alleged occurrence. PTI activists Hamza Azeem, Aitzaz Rafiq, Rana Tanvir, Iftikhar Ahmad, and Zayas Khan were also acquitted.
In this case, as many as 14 accused were indicted during the trial conducted in the jail for security reasons. The prosecution had submitted the challan (charge-sheet) on Sept 28, 2023.
In its final arguments, the prosecution had argued that the ‘May 9 conspiracy’ was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park, the residence of Imran Khan.
 
 

Advocate Burhan Moazzam
Malik, the lead defence counsel, argued that the FIR mentioned 400 accused persons, but only 14 were being put on trial. The lawyer also pointed out that no medical certificate existed to prove that any person was injured on May 9. He said the prosecution failed to establish the presence of the PTI leaders at the place of alleged occurrence.
About Mr Qureshi, he said the former foreign minister was in Karachi on May 9, 2023. The Sarwar Road police registered the FIR, claiming that the accused delivered provocative speeches and incited rioting, attacks and public disorder at Sherpao Bridge during the widespread violent protests of May 9.
Sargodha ATC
Meanwhile, the Sargodha ATC awarded ten-year rigorous imprisonment each to dozens of PTI leaders, including Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.
ATC Judge Naeem Sheikh convicted as many as 32 accused, including sitting MNA Ahmad Chattha and former MNA Rana Bilal Ijaz. In this case, over 70 accused persons, including National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan, had been declared proclaimed offenders.
Over a dozen accused were granted exemption from personal appearance during the trial proceedings. The prosecution presented testimonies of 50 witnesses to prove charges of attacks, vandalism, and incitement to violence against the accused.
The PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
‘Unlawful, unjust’
Commenting on the conviction, Mr Ayub said the decision by the Sargodha court was unlawful. In a statement on his X account, he said the same prosecution witnesses were declared untrustworthy by the previous trial judge. He said the PTI leaders had been convicted unjustly. He said the PTI leaders will challenge the conviction before the higher courts.
 






Mr Bhachar also announced he would challenge the ATC verdict in the Lahore High Court. “Once the written verdict is received, I will approach the Lahore High Court,” he added.
Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated
Separately, Punjab Assembly acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar on Tuesday reinstated 26 opposition PTI members who had been suspended for 15 sittings for disrupting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech on June 27.
During the session, Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman addressed the house and conveyed Chief Minister Maryam’s desire for the return of the suspended members. “These representatives have been elected by the people and have come to the assembly,” the minister said, adding, “I request the speaker to allow them back into the house so they can represent their constituencies.”
He emphasised the importance of the opposition’s presence, remarking, “The assembly lacks vibrancy without the opposition. The reinstatement of the 26 suspended members will enable them to represent their constituencies effectively. Frankly, I don’t enjoy the proceedings as much without the opposition.”
Earlier, Speaker Malik Muhammad Khan had rejected references against the 26 opposition MPAs seeking their disqualification on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Assembly also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the killing of nine bus passengers from Punjab while they were travelling in Balochistan on July 10.

According to the Indian Express, the fleet is scheduled to be retired in Septe­mber after serving the IAF for six decades. Inducted in 1963, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were number-plated or retired from service between 2017 and 2024, the newspaper said, quoting unnamed sources in the military.
Its sources said the IAF is set to retire the remaining Russian-origin MiG-21 fleet in a ceremonial decom­m­issioning at Chan­digarh airbase on Sept 19.
Two squadrons of MiG-21 Bisons are currently active.
India procured more than 700 MiG-21 aircraft of different variants, such as the Type-77, Type-96, BIS and the Bison, since the aircraft’s induction in the IAF in 1963.
The phasing out of the aging MiG-21 fleet was originally scheduled to be concluded by 2022, but was held up due to a delay in the planned induction of other fighter jets, including the indig­enous Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, which are set to replace the MiG-21 squadrons.
Four squadrons phased out
Between 2017 and 2024, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were phased out. India has a sanctioned fighter squadron strength of 42, but has 31 active squadrons.
The phasing out of the MiG-21 fleet will further bring down the IAF’s active fighter squadrons.
The MiG-21 Bison, which comprises the last two squadrons to be retired, is one of India’s six fighter jets.
The single engine, single-seater multi-role fighter/ground attack aircraft has been a key fighter jet with the IAF. The Bison is the latest upgrade of the MiG-21 jets.
 
 

Over 100 MiG-21s of the IAF have been upgraded to Bison over the last three decades.
The MiG-21 Bison upgrades included avionics and communication systems, electronics, multi-function display cockpits, the Kopyo light-weight multi-mode radar, radio sets, electronic warfare suite, inertial navigation system/GPS, a helmet-mounted display and a better windshield, among others. However, the engine performance and load carrying capacity of the jet could not be enhanced as part of the upgrades, with its airframe being the major limitation, the Express said.
With a maximum speed of 2,230 kilometres per hour, the jet carries one 23mm twin-barrel cannon with four R-60 close combat missiles. Initially developed as an interceptor, the supersonic jet was eventually upgraded to perform as a multi-role combat aircraft, including ground attacks.
Despite its significant role in all wars and conflicts fought by India, the MiG-21 jets had earned a mixed reputation due to several crashes, although it could have happened due to a multitude of reasons.
Some estimates say that India lost over 400 MiG-21 jets, including its variants and trainer versions, since its induction, and the crashes killed over 100 pilots and some civilians.
A MiG-21 fighter jet of the IAF crashed near Rajasthan’s Suratgarh in May 2023 while it was on a routine operational training sortie, killing three civilians. In July 2022, a MiG-21 trainer Type 69 aircraft crashed, killing Wing Commander M. Rana and Flight Lieutenant Adivitiya Bal.

• Orders special audit of IPP payments, sectoral inefficiencies
ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday conducted a detailed review of audit objections related to the Ministry of Energy, with a focus on independent power producers (IPPs), rising electricity costs, incomplete development schemes and excessive load-shedding.
Officials from the Central Power Purch­asing Agency (CPPA-G) briefed the committee on a sharp rise in the installed capacity of IPPs from 9,765MW in 2015 to 25,642MW in 2024.
They revealed that the annual capacity purchase price had surged from Rs141 billion in 2015 to a staggering Rs1.4 trillion by 2024. In contrast, power generation dropped from 90bn kilowatt-hours in 2014 to 58bn in 2015.
Chaired by MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, the committee questioned the rationale behind these increases. PPP’s Naveed Qamar challenged the power division’s justification of rising coal prices.
Mr Akbar expressed disbelief at claims of up to 200 per cent power generation efficiency from sugarcane bagasse, while CPPA-G officials clarified that the actual output had surpassed their benchmark estimate of 45pc.
The committee also raised concerns about inefficiencies at certain power plants. Riaz Fatyana criticised the closure of staff positions at the Balloki-based Bhikki plant, questioning why salaries were still being paid despite a lack of production.
He also questioned the decision to establish the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant in a region without coal deposits, suggesting the Kalabagh hydropower project as a more logical alternative.
 
 

Senator Mohsin Aziz inquired about the actual costs of these power plants, while Junaid Akbar sought to know why surplus electricity was not being directed towards industrial and agricultural sectors.
Another critical issue raised was the electricity billing structure. The committee discussed the financial burden placed on consumers using even slightly more than 200 units of electricity. “Even if usage crosses 200 units once, the consumer ends up paying higher bills for six months,” Mr Akbar said.
Power Secretary Dr Muhammad Fakhre Alam Irfan confirmed that 58pc of consumers fell in this category and acknowledged the dilemma of subsidy requirements if the limit was raised. He added that the government was working on shifting to a direct subsidy model using BISP data, aiming to phase out the existing system by 2027.
MNA Shazia Marri slammed the power division over prolonged power outages in her constituency, reporting 15 to 16 hours of loadshedding. She questioned the lack of transparency and poor sector management.
Dr Irfan attributed the high losses to technical issues and reiterated that policy decisions were subject to IMF conditionalities, requiring prior approval.
 
 

The PAC referred the IPPs-related issues to a subcommittee and directed a special audit.
In another session, the committee took up complaints over incomplete electricity schemes. MNA Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel revealed that Rs310 million was released to the Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) in 2021 for a new scheme in his constituency, which remained unfinished.
MNAs Aamir Dogar and Khawaja Shiraz Mehmood highlighted discrepancies in the reported number of schemes in the Multan Electric Power Company, demanding a special audit to uncover the truth.
“This is a ruthless system,” said Khawaja Shiraz, who also accused officials of enabling transformer theft and manipulating the system.
“The power sector alone is enough to ruin the country,” he said.

Tourists stranded in Deosai due to the blocking of the Skardu-Deosai road have also been rescued.
 
 

Monsoon death toll
The monsoon rains, battering the country since late June, have resulted in widespread devastation.
According to NDMA, 234 people have lost their lives and 596 injured. Moreover, 826 houses have been damaged while 203 livestock killed since June 26.
Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women and 113 children.

Two fatalities have been reported from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, while one child has been killed in Islamabad. No loss of life has been reported so far from Gilgit-Baltistan, according to NDMA.
Two fatalities have been reported in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, involving one man and one child. In Islamabad, one child was killed due to heavy rain and flooding.
Glof, flood forecast
In Punjab, houses and standing crops in hundreds of villages have been inundated because of low-to-medium level flooding in various rivers.
The deluge in Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Indus rivers forced evacuations and displaced hundreds of people in riverine areas of Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.
Over 20 villages in Jhang district have been inundated due to the rising water levels in the Jhelum River. The Sutlej river has seen low-level flooding at Sulemanki, while there are concerns about the potential releases of water from Indian dams on the Beas and Sutlej rivers.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a fresh alert for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Separately, KP PDMA has also issued a Glof alert for Chitral Upper, Chitral Lower, Dir Upper, Swat and Kohistan Upper.
A PMD advisory issued on Tuesday said the ongoing rainfall spell is likely to continue and can affect KP and GB during the week.
The prevailing weather conditions will increase the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions of GB and KP.
The Met Office has advised local authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to protect human lives and property.
The NDMA has warned of landslides in northern regions in view of the forecast monsoon rains.
 
 

The authority has cautioned PDMAs, rescue services, local administration, armed forces and NGOs to prepare for possible emergency situations.
As per the projection, isolated rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamir, Ghanche, Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, Haveli, Bagh, and Poonch areas of GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. A similar weather pattern is expected in Chitral, Dir, Kohistan and adjoining mountainous zones of KP.
The downpour will increase the risk of landslides, mudslides, rockfalls and ground subsidence in Kolai Palas, Lower Kohistan, Upper Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Jaglot, Nagar, Hunza, Rondu, Skardu and Chitral.
Relief operations
NDMA said it conducted 62 rescue operations across the country, rescuing 450 people stranded in flash floods during the monsoon season. The authority has established 27 relief and medical camps to serve the displaced population.

Shalkot Sub-Divisional Police Officer Athar Rashid told Dawn.com, “The daughter and the nephew died in the firing, while the suspect managed to escape after the incident.”
The bodies were taken to the hospital for medicolegal formalities, after which they were handed over to the heirs.
Rashid added that a team from Kechi Baig police station was conducting raids to arrest the suspect.
“The suspect will be arrested soon, while further investigation into the incident is underway,” he said.
The incident comes two days after the police  arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Quetta’s Degari area, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
Balochistan Assembly condemns ‘honour killings’
The Balochistan Assembly, during its session today, strongly denounced ‘honour killings’, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the assembly passed a joint resolution denouncing the brutal killing of the man and woman in Degari.
Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola presented the resolution, describing the act as inhumane, unlawful, and devoid of any cultural, religious, or legal justification. She reaffirmed that justice lies solely with the state, not individuals who take the law into their own hands, APP added.

Adviser Meena Majeed Baloch condemned the deep-rooted customs leading to recurring violence against women. She called for the elimination of parallel laws, underscoring the contrast between women’s global achievements and their oppression at home.
Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman Baloch addressed the need for both moral upbringing and systemic reform while acknowledging cultural sensitivities around honour. He strongly opposed vigilante justice.
MPA Farah Azeem Shah argued that the incident reflects a societal regression, urging adherence to the Islamic principles of compassion and justice.
