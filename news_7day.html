Trump then flew to Qatar, where he oversaw the signing of a deal for the Gulf Arab country to buy jets from US manufacturer Boeing.
He did not mention a controversial separate offer by Qatar to donate a Boeing jet to serve as the US president’s official airplane. That would be one of the most valuable gifts ever given to the US and it has triggered alarm in Washington over its security and ethics implications.

After Trump’s declaration that he would lift sanctions on Syria, he met interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who swept to power at the head of a group that Washington has called a terrorist organisation and once pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda.
According to the White House, Trump urged Sharaa to join the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, which normalised relations with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. “I told him, ‘I hope you’re going to join when its straightened out. He said, Yes. But they have a lot of work to do,” Trump said, according to a White House pool report.
Photos posted on Saudi state television showed the two men shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump said the meeting with Sharaa, who he described as a young, attractive guy with a very strong past, was  “great”.
 


“He’s got a real shot at holding it together,” said Trump. Trump’s four-day visit highlights the United States’ growing ties to the oil-rich region, where his real-estate company is also developing several projects.
Trump’s Middle East trip — which does not include a visit to Jerusalem — has fuelled doubts in Israel about where the country stands in Washington’s priorities.
Israel opposes lifting sanctions on Syria, which would clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations and boost foreign investment. But Trump told reporters the fact he has relationships with countries in the Middle East is  “very good for Israel”.

• Italy’s premier warns humanitarian situation in Gaza Strip ‘ever more dramatic and unjustifiable’
GAZA CITY: Gaza rescuers said at least 80 people were killed in Israeli bombardment across the Palestinian territory on Wednesday, as the IDF intensified their massive invasion of the conflict-stricken Palestinian territories.
Civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir said 80 people had been killed by Israeli bombardment since dawn, including 59 in the north.
Footage from the aftermath of a strike in Jabalia, northern Gaza, showed mounds of rubble and twisted metal from collapsed buildings. Palestinians, including young children, picked through the debris in search of belongings.
Footage of mourners in northern Gaza showed women in tears as they kneeled next to bodies wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds. “It’s a nine-month-old baby. What did he do?” one of them cried out.
 


Hasan Moqbel, a Palestinian who lost relatives, said: “There are no homes fit for living. I have no shelter, no food, no water. Those who don’t die from air strikes die from hunger, and those who don’t die from hunger die from lack of medicine.”
Israel’s military on Wednesday warned residents in part of a Gaza City neighbourhood to evacuate, asserting that its forces would “attack the area with intense force”.
Prisoners situation
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday spoke to US envoy Steve Witkoff about the release of prisoner held in Gaza.
Negotiations for the release of the captives held in Gaza have been ongoing, with the latest talks taking place in the Qatari capital Doha, where US President Donald Trump was visiting on Wednesday.
Netanyahu’s office said the premier had discussed with Witkoff and his negotiating team the issue of the prisoners and the missing.
Witkoff later said Trump had “a really productive conversation” with the Qatari emir about a Gaza deal, adding that “we are moving along and we have a good plan together”.
 


‘Unjustifiable’
From the occupied West Bank, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said on Wednesday he favoured a “ceasefire at any price” in Gaza, accusing Netanyahu of wanting to continue the war “for his own reasons”.
Mohammad Awad, an emergency doctor in northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital, said that supply shortages meant his department could not properly handle the flow of wounded from the Jabalia strike. “There are not enough beds, no medicine, and no means for surgical or medical treatment, which leaves doctors unable to save many of the injured who are dying due to lack of care”, he said.
Awad added that “the bodies of the martyrs are lying on the ground in the hospital corridors after the morgue reached full capacity. The situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word.”
Israel imposed an aid blockade on the Gaza Strip on March 2 after talks to prolong a January 19 ceasefire broke down.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners, unimpeded humanitarian access and an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “ever more dramatic and unjustifiable”.  A US-led initiative for aid distribution under Israeli military security drew international criticism as it appears to sideline the United Nations and existing aid organisations, and would overhaul current humanitarian structures in Gaza.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said the plan would make “aid conditional on forced displacement” and vetting of the population. It added in a statement that Israel was creating “conditions for the eradication of Palestinian lives in Gaza”.

Now brace for the fallout. This changes everything. Rarely have we seen fortunes reverse as rapidly as they just did.
The military’s standing has skyrocketed, and a long line will now form outside the general’s door of people and groups and parties waiting their turn to shower him with honorifics. Banners are going up in cities, ads in newspapers, by business and industry groups.
Let’s start with this. India’s aggressive intent regarding Pakistan has been made so clear now that there is no room left for debate on the need for defence preparedness. The J-10s that brought down the Rafales had been procured in 2022, the year Pakistan came close to default. In hindsight, it was a necessary decision. Remember the rushed summoning of a joint session of parliament in January 2022, during which the amendments to the State Bank Act were passed within minutes of being tabled? All that was done to hurriedly comply with IMF requirements that the government had spent the previous year resisting.
 
 

The programme review received Board approval on Feb 2, 2022, paving the way for the release of $1 billion from the facility that had been stalled since the outbreak of Covid. The first batch of six J-10Cs landed in PAF base Minhas in Kamra on March 4, barely four weeks later.
The second batch of six landed on Aug 30, literally days after the IMF Board approved another tranche of $1.1bn. And the subsequent batches all landed in the months ahead. At the time it was possible to ask questions about why a country that was struggling with husbanding its foreign exchange reserves should be buying such advanced fighter planes. But not anymore.

Reality is stubborn, and two things bring home reality better than anything else: war and the economy.

For someone who has been a peace dove all his life, who has advocated for redirection of defence expenditures towards peaceful, development purposes, these words are not easy to write. But reality is stubborn, and two things bring home reality better than anything else: war and the economy.
Both are enterprises ruthless in exacting the costs of folly and mistakes. Neither of the two can be wished away, spun into something other than what they are, or otherwise argued away.
 
 

The reality today is that Pakistan faces an adversary to the east that requires the highest levels of preparedness to confront. Two nuclear powers have never before exchanged missile fire of this magnitude. No nuclear power has initiated hostilities against another on the basis of a casus belli manufactured out of thin air.
In the case of Pahalgam, no evidence linking Pakistan to the attack has been provided. Not even an iota. In fact, at the time the Indian authorities had started blaming Pakistan they could not even answer simple questions about the attack in Pahalgam. How many attackers were there? What weapons did they carry? How many bullets were fired? What route did they take to get to the site? What conveyance did they use? How did they leave the site? Were they in touch with any handlers during the attack? And so on.
This is irresponsible behaviour on the part of a nuclear-armed state. It was also extreme recklessness to use the dual-use, nuclear-capable Brahmos missile to attack Pakistani cities and air force bases during the missile exchanges. These actions — leaping to kinetic hostilities even before any evidence has come in, using nuclear-capable missiles for delivery of conventional payloads — belie a political intent behind the aggression.
 
 

It is hard to figure out what military objectives India sought to achieve through this war. It is easier to see that their political leadership is using a muscular assertion of military power to score political points back home.
Except it backfired. As per the political script, Pakistan was supposed to wilt in the face of such bellicosity and aggression. Instead, Pakistan fired back and they hurried to call for a ceasefire. Perhaps they thought that because Pakistan is strapped for cash and on an IMF programme, relatively isolated from the world, it will not be able to take fire for very long and will sue for peace early in the engagements.
Whatever the calculus at the other end, it is clear now that Pakistan has no option but to upgrade its defences and prepare for another round. India was once living proof that a pluralist democracy is not a luxury only rich countries can afford. But its democracy succumbed to demagoguery almost a decade ago. Now that the demagogue whom they have elected as their prime minister, a man who has told his citizenry that he is not naturally born but a divine being sent down with a mission, is consolidating his place and using war as entertainment with which to power his politics. Pakistan cannot take this threat lightly.
As the government prepares its budget for fiscal year 2026, it will have to keep in mind the elevated requirements that will come from the upgradation of its defences and replenishment of inventory consumed during the war.
 
 

Everybody will seek to ride on the revitalised political capital of the military. Politicians and business leaders will compete with each other to sing their praises, and try to weld their own particular interests with those of the military. ‘You need dollars to maintain readiness, and we exporters can bring you dollars’, they will say. ‘But we need the cost of doing business to be brought down to be able to do so’, and so on.
The government, which was looking forward to a little more fiscal space in the year ahead compared to the year past, will have to postpone some of its plans to spend its way back into people’s hearts perhaps. And the opposition, the poor PTI, lost at sea as they already were after the collapse of their ‘final call’ last November, will struggle to find its voice amid the din of applause for the military. This is what the fallout of the war will look like.

India and Pakistan are signatories to the Charter of the United Nations.
On April 22, 2025, visitors to the Baisaran Valley meadow near the town of Pahalgam in held Kashmir were murdered. Twenty-four of the slain were Hindus, one a Christian and one a Muslim. Without a care for his own safety, Syed Adil Hussain Shah wrestled with the assailants and was slain by them. He was probably galvanised by the Quranic command, “if you save a soul [nafs, not just a Muslim] it is as if you have saved all of humanity”. He died true to his faith.
However, did India, a member state of the United Nations, live by the truth and abide by what it had pledged? “Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such manner that international peace and security, and justice” are not endangered (Article 2 of the UN Charter). Hubris overshadowed international obligations and common sense. There was no interest to ascertain who was behind the attack.
 
 

Pakistan is a country most afflicted by terrorism; thousands of attacks have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. My friends and colleagues have also fallen victim to terrorism. The BLA, whose actions our neighbour endorses, claimed to have killed chief justice Muhammad Noor Miskanzai as he stood praying in a mosque. And years before the senior most judge of the Balochistan High Court, Muhammad Nawaz Marri, was killed when he was on his way to the high court.
On Aug 8, 2016, terrorists killed over 70, predominantly lawyers, all of whom were known to me, in Quetta’s main hospital. The Supreme Court constituted a commission to inquire into the matter, and I was assigned the task. The Quetta Inquiry Commission Report noted 17,503 terrorist attacks from Jan 1, 2001, to Oct 17, 2016, in Pakistan, averaging three a day. The investigators suspected foreign involvement. However, blaming neighbours without sufficient evidence, creating war hysteria, would have been unprofessional and dishonest.

Before blaming outsiders, one starts with accountability within.

While terrorism has abated in Pakistan, it hasn’t stopped. The section of the Report titled ‘Recommendations’ commenced by stating: “The people of Pakistan have been subjected to sustained terrorist attacks, which continue unabated, and deserve answers. Those who have failed the people of Pakistan need to be held accountable. Things cannot go on as they have been. Without top-tier accountability, it is unlikely systemic change will be possible.” Before blaming outsiders, one starts with accountability within. Is any institution in India brave enough to call for it?
In our courts, like in the courts of every law-abiding country, there is a rebuttable presumption of innocence. Crimes are first investigated and evidence collected, then the prosecution proceeds to establish guilt before a neutral arbiter, the judge. Investigators, prosecutors and judges dispassionately consider the evidence and the motive; guilt is not to be assumed, nor should preconceived notions sway one.
 
 

Article 33 of the UN Charter requires that “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice”.
This India did not do. If Pakistan had not cooperated, Article 35 of the UN Charter could have been invoked to “bring any dispute, or any situation … to the attention of the Security Council or of the General Assembly”. Articles 39 to 46 of the UN Charter empowers the Security Council to act against recalcitrant members. The UN Charter forbids “The threat or use of force” (clause 4 of Article 2). Instead, India almost immediately after the gruesome Pahalgam attack, declared Pakistan to be guilty and elected to inflict punishment.
The UN Charter also requires that “the obligations arising from treaties” must be complied with. India and Pakistan executed the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 for “the most complete and satisfactory utilisation of the water of the Indus system of rivers”.
Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru signed on behalf of India. The treaty does not envisage suspension, nor does it empower either country to act unilaterally. The treaty stood the test of time for almost 65 years, till Prime Minister Narendra Modi by diktat decided to ‘suspend’ it. He also threatened to divert the waters of the Indus. Indian munitions struck the Neelum-Jhelum River waterworks. These wanton acts, if they cause large-scale environmental destruction, would constitute ecocide.
 
 

The membership of the United Nations was opened to all “peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter” (Article 4). Compliance is not optional. If a country does not want to abide by its terms, it is inexplicable why it continues to be a member of the UN. Neither international law, nor morality, permits benefits to be gathered while disregarding one’s commitments and obligations.
Narendra Modi as chief minister of Gujarat learnt about terrorism and how best to transform hate into public opinion and win elections. His popularity is hate-dependent, which recipe he again sought to use in the upcoming Bihar Legislative Assembly elections; for him the blood of 26 souls spilled in Kashmir served a purpose.

Though US President Donald Trump suggested that both states “go out and have a nice dinner together”, a dinner date is unlikely to melt away nearly eight decades of mistrust and animosity. Moreover, the Indian prime minister’s combative rhetoric in the speech to his nation on Monday also indicates that New Delhi will take a more hawkish line towards Islamabad.
Narendra Modi said that a “new normal” had been established, which entailed India taking military action against so-called terrorist targets in Pakistan. Mr Modi’s bellicosity seems to stem from rising domestic criticism, particularly over American involvement in de-escalation efforts. It is hoped that better sense prevails, as this Indian strategy is a recipe for disaster, and will lead South Asia into a destructive cycle of violence.
 
 

Whether it is with the help of foreign interlocutors — which the Indians oppose — or through bilateral channels, both states will have to restart the dialogue process, if perpetual conflict is to be avoided. PM Modi said that dialogue with Pakistan will only focus on terrorism and Azad Kashmir. If these are India’s main talking points, then it should be prepared to discuss all forms of terrorism in South Asia, including attempts by New Delhi to destabilise Pakistan through acts of terrorism.
Moreover, the talks should not remain limited to Azad Kashmir and should in fact include discussions on the entire internationally disputed territory. The Indian political class has taken umbrage at Donald Trump’s efforts to broker peace, with leaders saying that all disputes must be resolved under the umbrella of bilateralism, with many citing the 1972 Simla accord as the main blueprint for managing Pakistan-Indian relations.
If Simla — signed between Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi — is the yardstick, then India should remember that the agreement says, in black and white, that pending the final settlement of bilateral disputes, “neither side shall alter the situation”.
 
 

The BJP government’s unilateral scrapping of Article 370 in held Kashmir has significantly altered the situation. Moreover, the Simla accord also foresees “a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir”. Pakistan has been consistently calling for Kashmir to be discussed, but the BJP regime is not interested in talking about the dispute.
Instead of a ‘new normal’ that sows the seeds of mutually assured destruction, forward thinking is needed to resolve Pakistan-India disputes. As matters cool down, small steps should be taken to rebuild confidence, and establish a less bellicose discourse.
One major step India can take would be to honour the Indus Waters Treaty, as Pakistan cannot afford to have its rightful share of water blocked.

Turkiye and Azerbaijan, popular budget holiday destinations for Indians, issued statements backing Islamabad after India’s air strikes last week. “Bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkiye decreasing by 60 per cent (over the last week) while cancellations have surged by 250pc during the same period,” a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip said.
EaseMyTrip’s Chief Executive Officer, Rikant Pittie, said the platform had seen a 22pc rise in cancellations for Turkiye and 30pc for Azerbaijan “due to recent geopolitical tensions”.
Travellers had switched to Georgia, Serbia, Greece, Thailand and Vietnam, he added. Another ticketing platform, ixigo, earlier said in a post on X that it would be suspending flight and hotel bookings for Turkiye, Azerbaijan and China.
EaseMyTrip’s founder and chairman Nishant Pitti said in a post on X that 287,000 Indians visited Turkiye last year and 243,000 visited Azer­baijan. “When these nations openly support Pakistan, should we fuel their tourism and their economies?” Pitti said.

Ten persons were injur­ed.
The PPP rally led by its former Balochistan chapter president Ali Madad Jattak and MPA Obai­dullah Gorgag was on its way to Railway Hockey Stad­ium to attend a public meeting to celebrate Paki­s­tan’s victory against the recent Indian aggression when it was attacked, officials said.
Eyewitnesses said arm­ed men before hurling hand grenades fired into the air as the rally was passing through Munir Mengal Road in the Sariab area.
Ali Madad Jattak and Obaid Gorgag, who were leading the rally, rema­ined unhurt as their personal guards covered them before shifting them away, they said.
Police official Asif Ghafoor said, “The grenade exploded near the rally, injuring 11 party workers.” He said the injured were rushed to the Trauma Centre of the Civil Hospital, Quetta. “A PPP worker, Mehboob Ali Kurd, who received multiple injuries, lost his life during treatment at the hospital,” said Dr Wasim Baig.
While the law enforcement agencies immediately cordoned off the blast site and launched a search operation to trace out the attackers, most participants in the rally continued their journey towards the stadium where they later attended the public meeting.
 
 

Hospital sources said nine of the 10 injured were identified as Qurban Ali, Abdul Razaaq, Muhammad Asim, Muhammad Umar, Abdul Manan, Syed Naqibullah, Imran Khan, Mohammad Sadiq and Maharullah.
Another man passing through the area in a rickshaw also died during treatment, hospital sources said. His identity, however, could not be ascertained till the filing of this report in the late hours of Wednesday night.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti has strangely condemned the grenade attack at the political rally and said the elements involved in the terrorist attack would be brought to justice.
He expressed grief over the casualties and visited the hospital to inquire after the injured. He directed the health authorities to provide the best available treatment to them.

The meeting, originally slated for April 18, was rescheduled for May 2  and then again fixed for May 19, and was expected to finalise nominations for permanent appointments to the IHC, the Sindh High Court (SHC), the Pesh­awar High Court (PHC), and the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
However, the JCP headed by Chief Justice of Paki­stan Yahya Afridi issued a notification stating that the meeting was deferred. The notification did not mention a new date or any reason for the postponement, even though the four high courts are being led by acting chief justices after the respective judges were elevated to the Supreme Court.
 
 

The delay comes amid an ongoing constitutional challenge before the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench regarding the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the IHC — Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the BHC. The Minis­try of Law issued the transfer notifications on February 1, following which the IHC revised its seniority list on February 3, ranking Justice Dogar as the senior puisne judge.
This revision triggered opposition from five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Babar Sattar, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — who challenged Justice Dogar’s seniority and his subsequent appointment as acting chief justice on February 12.
The Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions, including those filed by the IHC judges, former prime minister Imran Khan, and four bar associations, challenging the legality of the judge transfers, the seniority list, and the February 8 decision on judges’ representation.
 
 

Then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq had rejected the objections raised by judges regarding the transfer. In his ruling, Justice Farooq cited Article 200 of the Constitution, which allows the president of Pakistan to transfer judges between high courts with their consent and following consultations with the chief justice of Pakistan and the relevant high court chiefs.
In its response, the Supreme Court registrar has defended the transfers, citing Article 200(1) of the Constitution, which allows the president to transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan and relevant high court chief justices.
The law ministry maintained that proper consultation occurred on February 1, the day of the notification. The judicial commission, in its written reply to the Supreme Court, emphasised that it operated under Article 175-A of the Constitution and remained committed to upholding the Constitution.

• Westerly system to hit north on May 19
RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The country is bracing for its first heatwave of the season, with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warning that temperatures across much of the country will soar well above seasonal norms from Thursday (today) and persist for three to four days.
According to a PMD advisory, a high-pressure system is likely to grip most parts of the country from May 15 to 20. As a result, daytime temperatures are forecast to remain 4 to 6 degrees Celsius above normal in the southern regions — including Sindh, southern Punjab and Balochistan — throughout the period.
Meanwhile, central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakht­unkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan are likely to experience temperatures 5°C to 7°C above normal from May 15 to 19.
A westerly weather system is also expected to enter the upper parts of the country on the evening or night of May 19. Under its influence, rain, wind and thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls and hailstorms are anticipated in Azad Kashmir, Islamabad, the Pothohar region, northeast Punjab, upper KP and Gilgit-Baltistan on May 19 and 20.
 
 

The PMD has urged the public, especially children, elderly citizens and women, to take precautionary measures during the heatwave, including avoiding direct sun exposure and staying well-hydrated.
Farmers have also been advised to adjust their agricultural activities and take steps to protect livestock. The high temperatures in northern areas may accelerate snowmelt, potentially increasing water flow in rivers. Authorities have been requested to remain alert and take preventive action to avert any emergencies caused by the extreme heat.
Emergency instructions
In Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has also issued a heatwave alert, instructing commissioners and deputy commissioners across the province to remain vigilant.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed departments including school education, health, transport, local government and Rescue 1122 to initiate precautionary steps. These include the provision of clean drinking water in public areas and first-aid readiness in hospitals and mobile units.
It advised citizens to take care of children, the elderly and outdoor workers, avoid unnecessary travel during peak afternoon hours, wear light-coloured clothing, and cover the head when outdoors.
The PDMA also stressed judicious water use across sectors and urged citizens to stay informed about further updates.
 
 

The National Institute of Health (NIH) had already issued a heatstroke advisory last month, urging both public and private hospitals to prepare for an increase in heat-related illnesses. The advisory noted that climate change and global warming are intensifying the frequency of extreme heat events in Pakistan, leading to a rise in morbidity and mortality.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted the impact of climate change on human health, including increased frequency and severity of heatwaves. Pakistan has experienced severe heatwaves in recent years, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
The country’s healthcare system faces challenges in responding to these events, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Heat-related illnesses can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
The NIH said the objective of its advisory is to sensitise health care authorities to take timely, appropriate actions for preparedness and prevention of heatstroke. Infants, elderly persons, individuals with certain comorbidities, athletes, pregnant females and outdoor workers are at high risk for heatstroke.
 
 

If a person shows signs of possible heatstroke, professional medical treatment should be obtained immediately. The most critical step is lowering the temperature of the patients. The patients should be moved to a shady area, unnecessary clothing should be removed, and cool, tepid water should be applied to the skin while soaking remaining clothes with water.
If the patient can drink liquids, they should be given plenty of cool water or other cool beverages that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Intravenous fluids should be maintained and the patient should be hospitalised if required.

• GDP growth projected at 3.6pc, inflation at 7.7pc
• Revenue collection forecast to increase by Rs1.4tr
• Fiscal deficit targeted at 5.1pc of GDP
ISLAMABAD: As virtual technical-level discussions on the upcoming federal budget begin, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Pakistan’s total revenue to grow to nearly Rs20 trillion in the next fiscal year, up from the current estimate of less than Rs17.8tr, with an emphasis on tight expenditure controls to ensure sustainable debt servicing.
After three days of technical discussions through video link, formal policy-level negotiations on budget finalisation are set to begin on Monday (May 19) and continue until Friday (May 23). The agreement between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year’s budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2.
The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year’s average of 5.1pc. The combination of economic growth and inflation is expected to jack up revenue collection by more than Rs1.4tr from the current year’s estimated collection of about Rs12.4tr.
 
 

However, besides the FBR’s revenue collection, a major push for expansion in revenue base is being envisaged to come from provincial governments and agriculture income tax would be a key area for additional efforts.
Overall revenues for the next year are targeted to cross Rs19.9tr or 15.2pc of GDP compared to Rs17.8bn of budget estimates for the current year or 15.9pc of GDP.
The Fund expects Pakistani authorities to continue to focus on expenditure control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to Rs20.3pc next year.
But even then the expenditures would get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget estimates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised expenditures, particularly those that have arisen recently due to the security situation.
The IMF expects Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year, or about Rs6.67tr. The government is also being asked to maintain a primary surplus — revenues minus non-interest expenditures — of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability. Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance has asked all the ministries and divisions to submit an additional pro forma (Form-III-C) to capture the climate-related component of subsidies to enhance and expand reporting on climate considerations in all allocations of the annual budget.
 
 

“Climate tagging of subsidies is one of the requirements under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreed with IMF,” read a circular issued to all government entities and ministries.
The federal budget is required to map climate relevance in three categories of adaptation, mitigation, and transition.
The public expenditure under the running of civil government and public sector development programme is being tagged and the process is now being extended to other expenditures like grants and subsidies to identify the overall climate-related public expenditure.

• Shares with UN chief concerns about inflammatory remarks by Delhi
• Pakistan returns Indian border guard
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The prime minister floated this offer during his visit to the frontline area of Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot, where he lauded the armed forces for giving an exemplary response to India under the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ conducted in response to Indian strikes inside Pakistan following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan had struck 26 Indian military facilities, including its airbases, using jets and missiles.
He said Pakistan’s response to the Indian attack on May 6-7 caused huge losses to the neighbouring country, in which the Pakistan Air Force downed multiple Indian Rafale aircraft. In reference to the Pakistani strikes on 26 military targets, the PM said Pakistan had “avenged” the 1971 war.
 


“You have taken revenge for the 1971 war…and now the whole nation is standing with you,” PM Shehbaz told troops during his address. He warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi against future aggression.
“If you again attack us, you will lose everything…,” the PM said in a warning to his Indian counterpart. “We are ready for war and dialogue. Now the choice is yours,” he said.
With reference to PM Modi’s recent address to the nation, PM Shehbaz said: “Do not dictate us. Water is our red line; don’t even think about diverting our water. Yes, water and blood do not flow together. You have also hit our Neelum-Jhelum water project. If the damage was severe, we could have destroyed your major dams, including Baglihar Dam.”
PM Shehbaz again asked PM Modi to shun differences and sit for a dialogue. “Let us extinguish this fire. Let us sit together to talk on Kashmir and water,” he added.
 
 

After the Pahalgam attack, India put the water treaty with Pakistan in abeyance, prompting a strong response from Pakistan. In an interview with an Indian media outlet last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said there was no suspension clause in the Indus Waters Treaty.
“There is no provision in the treaty to allow for suspension the way it was drawn up. It either needs to be gone, or replaced by another one, and that requires the two countries to want to agree,” he said. He also said that the bank played no decision-making role and acted solely as a facilitator.
PM Shehbaz said the blatant aggression against innocent civilians resulting in the martyrdom of children, women and the elderly and calling them terrorists was utterly shameful and against all international laws, norms and morality.
According to the PM, despite Pakistan’s offer for a neutral probe, India deliberately evaded this path, as it had nothing to prove, and India launched the offensive based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, “for which it has got a very befitting response”.
 






During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the troops. He met the officers and soldiers actively participating in the military operation, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
In a show of continued support for all branches of the military, the prime minister is scheduled to visit various air bases and naval bases in coming days to meet troops of the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The PM noted that Pakistan had agreed to the ceasefire understanding in the larger interest of peace in the region. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong resolve to promote peace in South Asia, while defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
Concerns shared with UN chief
In his afternoon telephone call with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the premier expressed his deep appreciation for the UN secretary general’s leadership and diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation in South Asia.
He stated that the UN chief’s continued engagement and preventive diplomacy demonstrated his enduring commitment to the protection of the UN Charter’s principles and purposes, as well as to fostering peace in South Asia.
This was the third phone call between the two leaders in the last two weeks.
 






He also expressed concern over the continued provocative and inflammatory remarks made by the Indian leadership, which were a threat to the fragile regional peace. He emphasised that the just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, was imperative to ensuring durable peace in South Asia.
The UN secretary general welcomed the ceasefire, while expressing condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He expressed his commitment to continued engagement with both sides to advance regional peace and stability.
Speaks to UAE president
PM Shehbaz held a telephone conversation with Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates.
According to a statement, the PM conveyed profound gratitude for the UAE’s diplomatic efforts and constructive role during the recent crisis. He added that the UAE had stood by Pakistan through thick and thin.
 






PM Shehbaz also met Khazar Farhadov, Ambassador of Azerbaijan to Pakistan, in Islamabad and expressed profound gratitude to President Ilham Aliyev for the unwavering solidarity and support during the recent tensions with India.
 






Indian guard repatriated
Pakistan returned a captured border guard to India on Wednesday, reported AFP. The guard was captured a day after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 people and sparked tit-for-tat missile, drone and fighter jet attacks.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but India blamed Pakistan. Islamabad rejects the accusations and has called for an independent probe.
“Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since April 23, was handed over to India,” India’s Border Security Force said in a statement.

According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the award ceremony was held in Rabat, the capital of Morocco.
Anushe Engineer was chosen as the winner from three finalists in her category, surpassing France’s Louis Boulay and the United Kingdom’s Issy Ronald, for her feature,  ‘It’s all or nothing for Arshad Nadeem in Paris’.  The finalists were shortlisted from 37 entries initially selected from the total submissions.
 
 

The award comes with an AIPS Scholarship at a top sporting event.
In the quiet, unobtrusive manner that has become his trademark in the elite men’s javelin, Nadeem stormed the Stade de France field to take a terrific, historic gold at August’s finals at the Paris Olympics with a mammoth 92.97 metres off his second throw.
It was an Olympic record, erasing the existing one of 90.57m, set by Andreas Thorkildsen at Beijing 2008. For the underpowered Pakistan contingent in Paris, this was arguably the country’s greatest moment in decades. His gold is Pakistan’s only gold medal outside of hockey. It is also Pakistan’s first medal of any colour since 1992.
Engineer’s feature focused on the trials and tribulations faced by the athlete in his career leading up to the historic Olympic gold.
The award was presented by jury members Andreas Schirmer and Vincent Amalvy, head of sports at Agence France-Presse, with the latter describing the finalist feature as a “great story”.
Lost for words, Engineer said she did not have an idea of what she was getting involved in upon deciding on the story in 2023.
“I really had no idea what was going on when I set out to do this story and I just went and did it,” she said of the achievement.

The provincial government is finalising proposals for the upcoming budget for the next financial year. The federal government will unveil the budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on June 2.
In two separate meetings at the CM House of the Finance and Planning & Development departments today, the chief minister finalised the Annual Development Programme (ADP), stressing that rehabilitation of flood-damaged infrastructure must be prioritised in the upcoming budget. He also emphasised the need to reduce non-development expenditures while increasing allocations for development projects.
He further instructed that canal and watercourse lining projects be included in the new development schemes, and highlighted the importance of agricultural growth by calling for schemes that focus on improving agricultural output and productivity. “It is time to pay special attention to the agricultural sector,” he said.
Murad reiterated the government’s ongoing commitment to the health sector, emphasising the need to enhance healthcare facilities across the province. Regarding the education sector, he stressed the urgency of upgrading primary schools to the elementary level, and giving focused attention to both formal and non-formal education systems. He also directed to introduce multiple schemes for technical and higher education, and called for projects that promote sports and healthy activities for youth.
The chief minister also called for the introduction of new schemes to expand the ADP and stressed the importance of fiscal prudence. He advocated for cost-saving measures to ensure that savings are redirected towards development activities.
The main projects identified for accelerated funding in the new fiscal year include the K-IV water supply project, the Shahrah-e-Bhutto expressway, a 38.75-kilometre expressway aimed at improving urban connectivity and reducing congestion, and ongoing transport schemes in Karachi.
The chief minister emphasised reducing non-development expenditures while increasing allocations for development projects. He highlighted the government’s efforts to enhance financial resources and expressed optimism that provincial tax collection agencies would meet their targets.
A day earlier, CM Shah had announced that water supply and drainage schemes would be included in the provincial ADP as part of the provincial budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Chairing a high-level meeting at the CM House, he had said that several development schemes focusing on water supply, drainage, solar energy, and both industrial and agricultural development would be included in the ADP. He also emphasised that reconstruction of the schools damaged by floods would be a top priority in the forthcoming uplift plan.
Highlighting the scale of this year’s development programme, the chief minister recalled that the ADP was worth Rs493 billion, with Rs55bn specifically allocated under the district ADP. He added that there were 4,644 development schemes in progress during the current fiscal year, and it was expected that 1,812 of them would be completed by the end of June 2025.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif earlier said that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget was to provide relief to the common man, stating that all-out resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and the middle class.
Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and considering the projects to promote industries and increase production.
“The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector,” he added.
The prime minister said that the government and private sector must work together for development and prosperity. He said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency to the government system and facilitate the business community and investors.</p><small>2025-05-14 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/141859583af8a5f.jpg?r=190840' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911006/islamabad-court-orders-jail-authorities-to-allow-imrans-contact-with-sons-check-up-by-personal-physician' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court orders jail authorities to allow Imran’s contact with sons, check-up by personal physician</strong></a><br><p>A special court in Islamabad on Tuesday instructed the Adiala Jail authorities to allow PTI founder Imran Khan to hold a telephone conversation with his sons abroad and also be allowed a medical checkup by his personal physician.
Last month, Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjum­and  approved two petitions filed on behalf of Imran related to the requests. The court had sought a response from Adiala authorities to provide the facilities.
Today, the judge heard a request by the prison authorities against the court order and dismissed it
A report to the judge from the jail superintendent on Monday had called for the court’s orders on January 10 and February 3 to be reviewed and set aside due to “being inconsistent and contrary to the basic rights and principle of recognition of the inherent dignity and equal inalienable rights of inmates”, arguing that extending the two facilities to Imran would be against the spirit of the Constitution, as well as Pakistan Prison Rules.
A court order issued today, available with Dawn.com, said the judgements passed on Jan 10 and 28 and Feb 3 were passed after taking into account all relevant factors and could not be received without any solid reason and thus, the jail superintendent’s request was turned down.
The order instructed the superintendent to “strictly follow” the three orders in “letter and spirit”. The hearing was adjourned to next Wednesday.
A day prior, Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration. The two, in a rare public appearance, had appealed for his release, claiming that their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”
They had further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p><small>2025-05-14 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/14154428ad3437a.jpg?r=154705' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910980/may-9-riots-lahore-atcs-to-hear-cases-4-days-a-week-to-speed-up-process' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Lahore ATCs to hear cases 4 days a week to speed up process</strong></a><br><p>The anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) in Lahore have stepped up the hearing of cases related to the May 9, 2023, riots after directives from the Supreme Court to wind them up within four months.
The cases pertain to the arrest of workers belonging to the PTI for their alleged role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The Lahore High Court registrar issued the new amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail.
 


The hearing of May 9 riot cases will now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to speed up their disposal.
The ATCs are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including the Jinnah House attack.
In December 2024, the Pakistan Army announced that the remainng 60 PTI activists have been convicted by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) for their involvement in the May 9 violent protests.
“The Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, said in a statement.
Those sentenced include Hassaan Khan Niazi, a nephew of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and two retired armed forces officers. Days earlier, 25 others were sentenced on the same charges.
The accused were sentenced to between two and 10 years of “rigorous imprisonment”, marking the conclusion of trials for those held in military custody over the attacks on army installations. Overall, 16 individuals were sentenced to 10 years, 11 for nine years, two for eight years, six for seven years, 10 for six years, two for five years, 13 for four years, three for three years, and 22 for two years.</p><small>2025-05-14 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1414243007f484a.jpg?r=162212' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910982/couple-burnt-to-death-in-kps-shangla-amid-blazing-wildfire' target='_blank'><strong>Couple burnt to death in KP’s Shangla amid blazing wildfire</strong></a><br><p>A couple were burnt to death on Tuesday night as blazing wildfires engulfed the forests of Hasham Khel Dab mountains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district in Martung tehsil, according to police.
Pakistan has grappled with an unprecedented surge in forest fires in recent years. Provinces, including KP and Balochistan, have seen huge wildfires in the past three years.
Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Usman Munir, while speaking to Dawn.com, shared that a man and his wife were burned to death while they were trying to protect the firewood kept near their home from the fire.
The SDFO of the forest department in Alpuri, Zahid Hussain told Dawn.com that the victims — identified as Hakim Zada and his wife Hajiroon — set fire to the bushes near their house. The fire then quickly got out of control due to intense and gusty winds, engulfing the forest.
The wildfire has now been extinguished, and the bodies of the victims have been recovered from the site.
According to Deputy Commissioner Shangla Mohammad Fawad, compensation will be given to the next of kin of the deceased.
In 2024, over 50 wildfire incidents were reported in Shangla, while in June 2022, four people were killed by a wildfire in the Chakesar area of the district.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/14122158ce6db62.jpg?r=122844' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966/pakistan-receives-second-tranche-of-1bn-from-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan receives second tranche of $1bn from IMF</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has received the second tranche of special drawing rights (SDR) worth $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the central bank said on Wednesday.
The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a post on X. It would raise the reserves to $11.355bn.
 






Last week, the IMF had approved the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
 


It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.
“Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.
“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.
“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1415172346e83b0.jpg?r=151756' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910984/pakistan-pulled-off-a-macroeconomic-miracle-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan pulled off a ‘macroeconomic miracle’: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s market has captured the attention of global investors amid its heightened tensions with India, US publication Barron’s reports.
Over the past two years, the country has seen a “macroeconomic miracle”. While inflation was down from 40 per cent annually to near zero, Eurobonds maturing in 2031 rose from 40 cents on the dollar to 80 cents. The KSE-100 index has also tripled.
The government reached a “stabilisation agreement” with the International Monetary Fund last September with the lender approving a $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Over $2bn has already been disbursed.
“Pakistan is a good story,” Genna Lozovsky, a chief investment officer at Sandglass Capital Management, was quoted by Barron’s as saying. “So good it’s not risky enough for us anymore.”’
The media outlet further stated that the recent conflict with India “won’t likely knock Pakistan’s recovery off course” but the “country’s own shaky underpinnings might”.
“Pakistan has been known for boom-and-bust cycles throughout its history,” according to Khaled Sellami, an emerging markets sovereign debt manager at Barings. He said there are some signs that this time could be different.
Pakistan’s period of stabilisation started with a near-default experience in 2022-23 following Imran Khan’s ouster. Alison Graham, chief investment officer at frontier markets specialist Voltan Capital Management stated, “Everyone thought Pakistan would default along with Sri Lanka in 2023.”
Instead, the State Bank of Pakistan hiked interest rates from 10pc to 22pc, putting the country into recession but wringing out inflation.
Last year, the country gained loans from sovereign creditors China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the GDP growth bounced back to 2.5pc. “The current account balance is positive, and they have a primary fiscal surplus [excluding interest payments],” Sellami said. “That’s something we haven’t seen in many years.”
Pakistan remains in “relative stagnation” with cotton, apparel and cereals accounting for two-thirds of exports compared to India’s development in advanced industries like IT and pharmaceuticals. Sellami said, “It is belatedly moving into IT outsourcing, foreign sales rising from near nothing to $3bn annually over the past few years,” adding that India was in the $200bn range.
Without a value-added ladder to climb, fate and free-spending election cycles may continue driving Pakistan’s boom and bust, according to Graham. She continued, “Pakistan remains extremely fragile to external shocks.
“When there is a rally, you need to be in early.”
Sellami was more optimistic, being “constructive” on Pakistani Eurobonds. He said that the country’s foreign friends, China and the Gulf states, made it clear in 2022 that they were not writing blank cheques. “The government knows if they deviate from the tightrope they are walking, they won’t have external finance,” he added.
On Monday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record 9pc — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire that boosted investor mood. “The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/14142625f0a794f.jpg?r=142924' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910971/trump-meets-syrian-president-says-he-is-looking-into-normalising-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Trump meets Syrian president, says he is looking into normalising ties</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump met with Syria’s president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, after a surprise US announcement it would lift all sanctions on the Islamist-led government, and said Washington was exploring the possibility of normalising ties with Damascus.
He made the comments during a summit between the US and Gulf Arab countries. Trump met Syria’s Ahmed al-Sharaa before the summit. Photos posted on Saudi state television showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.
Trump also urged Sharaa to normalise ties with Israel, a White House spokesperson said.
Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, virtually in the meeting, Anadolu News Agency reported.
MbS told the summit Saudi Arabia commends Trumps decision to lift sanctions on Syria.
The lifting of sanctions came despite deep Israeli suspicion of Sharaa’s administration, worries initially shared by some US officials. Israeli officials have continued to describe Sharaa as a jihadist, though he severed ties with al Qaeda in 2016. Israel’s government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.
The challenges were laid bare in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces, prompting revenge attacks in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, drawing strong US condemnation.

Trump is on a four-day visit to the oil-rich Gulf states that includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
Trump’s first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region was marked by lavish ceremony and business deals, including a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.
Later today, Trump will fly to the Qatari capital Doha, where he will participate in a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and other officials. Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US.
US ally Israel has opposed sanctions relief for Syria, but Trump on Tuesday said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who are both close to the US president, encouraged him to make the move.
Former Al Qaeda commander
Sharaa was for years the leader of al Qaeda’s official wing in the Syrian conflict. He first joined the group in Iraq, where he spent five years in a US prison. The United States removed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa’s head in December.
His interactions with Sharaa, who led rebel forces that toppled former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, will be closely watched as observers gauge how serious Washington is about resetting its relationship with Damascus.

Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafique told Dawn.com, “An IED was planted at the main gate of the MNA’s house and it exploded late at night.” He added that Zeb was not at home at the time of the explosion.
The police reached the site and a search operation was under way to “track down the terrorists”, he said.
Zeb said in a statement that his family and neighbours remained safe in the explosion, but it would not affect their resolve through such tactics. “I would continue my martyred brother Rehan Zeb’s mission,” he added.
National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq condemned the incident, expressing best wishes for Zeb and his family.
He directed KP’s relevant authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into the blast, saying the elements involved in the attack must be brought to justice.
 
 

Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.
Last month, four children were wounded when a mortar shell, fired from an undisclosed location, hit a house in the Lowi Mamund tehsil in Bajaur.
Also in April, eight people, including three security personnel and five residents, were injured after a roadside bomb targeted a vehicle of the Frontier Corps in the same district.</p><small>2025-05-14 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/14110959b3c2eed.jpg?r=111214' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910906/petrol-prices-expected-to-come-down-soon-relief-for-ke-subscribers-likely' target='_blank'><strong>Petrol prices expected to come down soon; relief for KE subscribers likely</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: With up to 14 per cent reduction in regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) prices notified for the current month, the electricity rates for Karachi and petroleum prices across the country are expected to come down in coming days.
With a reduction of Rs3 to Rs7 per litre in major oil products estimated for the next fortnight, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Tuesday notified a 14pc reduction in the price of RLNG on Tuesday for sales at the transmission stage by the two Sui gas companies for the current month.
The Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, has seen its system losses at the distribution stage drop from 16.16pc to 10.6pc.
 
 

On the other hand, the Lahore-based SNGPL, which provides gas to consumers in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw its system losses at the distribution stage drop to 7.47pc from 8.6pc until February this year.
According to a notification, the RLNG’s sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage has been cut by 12.42pc to $11.026 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May against $12.59 per mmBtu in April.

Ogra notifies 14pc cut in RLNG price

The sale price at distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 12.51pc to $11.79 per mmBtu for the current month, against $13.48 per mmBtu last month.
On the other side, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL has been decreased at transmission stage by 13.62pc to $9.74 per mmBtu for May, against $11.27 per mmBtu in April. The sale price at the distribution stage for the company was also reduced by 13.64pc to $10.87 per mmBtu instead of $12.59 per mmBtu last month.
The Ogra said the reduction in RLNG price was due to a decline in the delivered price on ship for both companies.
The overall decrease in absolute terms for SSGC’s transmission price amounted to $1.53 per mmBtu, while reduction at distribution stage was $1.72 per unit.
The reduction in RLNG price for SNGPL during transmission was reported at $1.56 per mmBtu and $1.69 per unit for distribution.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices for SSGCL $10.87 per mmBtu and $11.79 per mmBtu for SNGPL are almost $2.74 and $3.66 per mmBtu higher than the Pakistan State Oil’s $8.13 per mmBtu average delivered price ex-ship (DES), respectively.
This is mainly because of the fact that both LNG importers — PSO and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) — and port authorities also charge profit margins on account of retainage and margins at the rate of 3.15pc and 3.1pc of DES price, respectively, on top of 7.4pc losses of SNGPL and 10.6pc losses of SSGCL.
The basket RLNG price was based on a total of 10 cargoes for May, all under two LNG contracts between PSO and Qatar Gas at an average of about $8.13 per mmBtu — six cargoes at $7.24 and four cargos at $9.48 per mmBtu. Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) did not import any cargo this month as it deferred cargos for the current month owing to demand crash.
Petroleum prices
On the other hand, the prices of petrol and diesel are estimated to fall by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre for the next fortnight ending May 31, owing to a decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. This relief is, however, subject to unchanged tax rates.
Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go down by about Rs3.5, depending on final calculation on May 15, followed by a Rs7 per litre cut in high speed diesel (HSD).
 
 

The estimates for lower petrol price stem from about $1.5 per barrel decline in international price of petrol and about $3 per barrel in HSD over the past two weeks. The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle and lower-middle class.
The ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) stands at Rs256.64 per litre.
KE petition
In a formal petition, K-Electric has, however, requested the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) not to pass on entire benefit to consumers, and instead, set aside partial benefit to clear its past claims.
The company has already claimed Rs14.6bn past dues on account of partial load, startup costs, plant degradation and open cycle operations for the period between July 2023 and March 2025. Nepra has already set aside Rs9.4bn by disallowing full benefit of fuel cost reduction to consumers between November 2024 and January 2025.
A public hearing is scheduled for May 22.
Meanwhile, the electricity rates for consumers of K-Electric have also become entitled to Rs5.02 per unit refund next month on account of fuel cost adjustment for March, with a total financial benefit of Rs6.8bn.

The home department issued a letter about imposing an immediate ban on the use of rough papers or newspapers containing verses of the Holy Quran for packaging or preserving commodities. 
The order, enacted under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, aims at preventing potential disturbances to the public peace and tranquility. 
The directive, signed by the home secretary, cites concerns over the misuse of religious texts in everyday trade practices, which could offend religious sentiments. The ban will remain in effect for 90 days across the entire province, starting from May 12. 
The authorities were directed to ensure widespread dissemination of the order through official channels, including the gazette, newspapers and broadcast media. The Punjab Police, divisional commissioners, and deputy commissioners have also been directed to enforce the prohibition strictly.

The drivers were transporting LPG imported from Iran on May 9 when armed men intercepted their trucks in the Ahmedwal area on the Quetta-Taftan highway. The assailants burst the trucks’ tires and abducted the four men at gunpoint before security forces arrived at the scene, according to authorities.
Local residents informed the administration about the bodies, prompting Levies and other law-enforcement agencies to rush to the site. The bodies were taken to the district hospital in Noshki.
Hospital officials confirmed all four men died from multiple bullet injuries after being shot from a close range.
The deceased were identified as Moin and Huzaifa, residents of Pakpattan, and brothers Imran Ali and Irfan Ali, residents of Rahimyar Khan. 
Their bodies were sent to respective hometowns after legal formalities were completed.
An investigation has been launched, officials said. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the killings.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind strongly condemned the killings. “Those behind such heinous acts — enemies of peace — will not be spared,” Mr Rind said in a statement, describing the incident as “barbaric and deeply tragic.” 
“The provincial government is utilising all available resources to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
Mr Rind extended condolences to the victims’ families and assured them that justice would be served. He noted the victims were from Punjab and said the incident “appeared to be an attempt by terrorist elements to disrupt interprovincial harmony”.
“The Balochistan government is committed to conducting a transparent and thorough investigation. Those responsible will soon be apprehended and dealt with an iron hand,” Mr Rind affirmed. He reiterated the government’s determination to uphold law and order, asserting that “such cowardly acts would not shake the state’s resolve”.

The Wire said that Indian opposition parties asked whether the ceasefire was a result of US mediation, marking a clear departure from India’s longstanding policy of ‘no third-party mediation’.
Opposition parties have demanded to know why Modi remained silent on Trump’s claims, whether India has changed its longtime policy of no third-party mediation and if the US president’s claims of trade being used to end the conflict is true.
In a statement, Congress MP Jai­r­am Ramesh said Modi’s “much-delayed address to the nation was upstaged by President Trump’s revelations”.
“The prime minister was completely silent on them. Has India agreed to US mediation? Has India agreed to a ‘neutral site’ for a dialogue with Pakistan? The prime minister should immediately have a meeting with leaders of all political parties — something he has studiously avoided in the last 20 days,” he said.
Mr Ramesh said the coming months would ‘demand both painstaking diplomacy and a collective resolve’. “One-liners and dialogue-baazi are poor substitutes,” he said, “.
Congress MP Randeep Singh Surjewala earlier also sought to know if the ceasefire with Pakistan was on the basis of mediation by the US.
“Isn’t the Modi government aware that the US president, Mr Donald Trump has issued a statement expressing mediation to solve the Kashmir issue? Is the Modi government going to allow a third-party mediation in Kashmir in absolute derogation of India’s stated policy? If not, why has PM Modi not controverted the same?”
Special session of parliament
Also, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary M.A. Baby reiterated the opposition’s call for a special session of parliament and said the ceasefire announcement by Trump before any Indian official could declare it “has raised serious concerns”.
“It is an avowedly accepted policy of our country that we settle our disputes bilaterally, without allowing any third-party intervention. Therefore, this situation requires clear and authoritative clarification from the highest levels,” he wrote.
Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha demanded that Modi government make a statement for the US about not undermining India’s stated policy as well as denying Trump’s claim about the mention of trade being stopped.
“The kind of language he [Trump] chose, hits us Indians. I would request the prime minister that you have the country’s mandate, you should give a stern message to the US.”
All India Majlis-i-Ittehadul Musli­meen MP Asaduddin Owaisi said, “We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter. Why are we agreeing to talk on neutral territory? What will be the agenda of these talks?” He also asked if Indian government’s goal was to get a Trump-brokered ceasefire.

• FO says will closely monitor Indian actions, take necessary measures to preserve rights under Indus treaty
• Security forces jam, seize ‘Indian surveillance drone’ in Lahore
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Tuesday said it rem­ai­ned committed to the current ceasefire understanding with India, but any fut­ure aggression will be met with full resolve, as the Foreign Office lambasted a provocative spe­ech delivered by the Indian prime minister on May 12.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that Pakistan rejected “the provocative and infla­mmatory assertions” made by the Indian premier, and the remarks were “a dangerous escalation rooted in misinformation, political opportunism, and a blatant disregard for international law”.
In his speech, PM Modi had accused Pakistan of retaliating with strikes on Indian military and civilian targets, claiming that India’s air defence systems repelled the attacks and inflicted significant losses on Pakistan. He also said Pakistan requested a ceasefire through military channels on May 10 after its ‘failed’ retaliation. India accepted the ceasefire conditionally, PM Modi said, warning that future Indian responses would depend on Pakistan’s behaviour.
Pakistan dismissed this portrayal as “yet another blatant lie” and said that the ceasefire was achieved “as a result of the facilitation of several friendly countries” and any claim to the contrary was “misinformation and propaganda”.
 
 

In light of the ceasefire, the two sides are hammering out its operational details. The first post-ceasefire contact between the heads of military operations from the two countries resulted in an understanding that the two sides would uphold the truce and reduce troop deployment along the international border. Another round is expected soon.
The FO said the Pahal­gam incident was used as a pretext to attack Pakis­tan, “justify military adv­e­n­turism, serve domestic political objectives… and reinforce a manufactured narrative of a perpetual external threat”.
“After the unlawful and unprovoked Indian aggression…India recklessly provoked the situation further by targeting Pakistan’s military bases, risking an uncontrollable escalatory spiral,” the statement said, adding that the Indian actions brought the entire region to the brink of disaster. Pakistan accused India of “justifying the cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians… as the ‘new normal’ for the region”.
According to the statement, Pakistan will monitor Indian actions in the coming days and it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty. “Make no mistake, we will closely monitor India’s actions and behaviour in this regard in the coming days. We also urge the international community to do the same,” it said.
In response to India’s allegations of terrorism sponsorship, Pakistan said, “We are a victim of terrorism, being directly sponsored by India. … Our contributions and sacrifices in the global fight against terrorism are well known.”
The statement also condemned India’s unilateral actions, citing New Delhi’s violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. “Pakistan will take all necessary measures to preserve its rights under the treaty,” it said.
While alluding to the unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, the Indian premier had said, “India’s stand is very clear… Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.”
PM Modi, in his speech, declared that India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail or state-sponsored terrorism,” announcing a new policy that rules out dialogue with Pakistan outside the context of terrorism and Azad Kashmir.
 
 

The Foreign Office countered, saying, “Peace is the true strength. The world is not served by theatrical militarism and grandstanding but by mature leadership, regional cooperation, and respect for international norms.”
The statement reaffirmed Islamabad’s support for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
“Pakistan is a sovereign nation with resilient institutions, a committed populace, and a globally recognized role in maintaining peace and security,” the Foreign Office said. “Our commitment to peace must never be mistaken for weakness. Any future aggression will also be met with full resolve.”
Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in its reaction to FO statement, said, “The terrorist infrastructure sites that India destroyed were responsible not only for the deaths of Indians but of many other innocents around the world. There is now a new normal. The sooner Pakistan gets used to it, the better.”
Meanwhile, an Indian drone was spotted in Lahore by the security forces, who brought it down near the Lahore airport by using the GPS jamming technology.  Sources in the law enforcement agencies said it was an “Indian surveillance drone” which was launched by the neighbouring country after the ceasefire agreement.

Speaking at the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh, President Trump highlighted his role in brokering the weekend ceasefire between the two South Asian rivals and urged them to build on this breakthrough.
“I said, ‘fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles, let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully’,” Trump said, without clarifying which Indian or Pakistani leaders he had spoken to or when.
“They’re actually getting along. Maybe we can even get them together, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he said while addressing his Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who accompanied him to Saudi Arabia.

Development comes hours after Trump urges both nations to ‘go out to dinner’ together to resolve their disputes

In Washington, the State Department’s Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott told reporters that the United States was now focused on encouraging direct engagement between the two countries.
“We welcome the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan this weekend and we commend both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” said Piggott. “We also want to encourage direct communication between the parties.”
 
 

When asked whether Pakistan had given any commitments on ‘stopping terrorist activities’ that India accuses it of indulging in, Piggott declined to comment, but reiterated Washington’s support for dialogue.
Islamabad categorically rejects such allegations as unfounded and blames India for using them as an excuse to justify its aggression against Pakistan.
“We have been clear on that. We continue to encourage that direct communication,” Piggott said. “The president has been clear on that and the president has also been in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path for peace and wisdom.”
Responding to a question about the US reaction to India’s refusal to accept a US role in the peace process, Piggott said: “I am not going to speculate on that. What I can say is that we encourage direct communication.”
Asked if the US had sent a team to Pakistan following media reports about radiation leaks from some secure nuclear facilities in Pakistan, Piggott replied, “I have nothing to preview on that this time.”
When pressed on whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attitude was disappointing for Washington, the spokesperson avoided criticism. “What we are happy to see is a ceasefire. That’s what we are happy to see. That’s where our focus remains. We want to see the ceasefire maintained and we want to encourage direct communication,” he said.
“Our focus is the ceasefire. Our focus is on encouraging direct communication. That’s where our focus is going to remain. The president has spoken on this.”
Piggott was also asked whether President Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he helped resolve the Kashmir dispute.
“The president is a peacemaker. He values peace. He is also a dealmaker. And he has shown that again, and again, and again,” Piggott responded. “When it comes to solving conflicts, the president wants to solve the conflicts where he can. Stands ready to help.”
