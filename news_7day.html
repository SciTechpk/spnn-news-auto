In December last year, the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations. The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.

 

In the first incident, a 21-year-old man sustained injuries around his neck after coming in contact with a stray kite string in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The young man was returning home from a local market on a bike when the string became entangled around his neck, leaving visible deep wounds.
However, a police official claimed that the injured person was riding the bike without a safety rod.
Earlier, the government had instructed the motorcyclists to install protective steel wires to shield themselves from stray kite twine to prevent any tragic incident.
The police official said that Rescue 1122 reached the site of the incident, where the injured person was provided first aid and rushed to a hospital, where he underwent surgery.
He added that the injured person was now in stable condition.
Orders have been issued to launch an investigation into the matter and investigate the string’s quality.
In another incident, a 45-year old man suffered multiple injuries to his face and neck after a kite string fell on him while he was riding a bike.
Rescue 1122 officials rushed the injured man to a hospital.
A police official indicated that the injured men would be investigated for taking their bikes on roads without safety wires despite repeated warnings.
He added the act would be dealt with as a violation of standard SoPs.
The festival is set to run till February 7.

 

Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed, and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-06 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06113730b379b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971402/security-forces-kill-24-terrorists-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-ibos' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 24 terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IBOs</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday.
“On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts.
During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists.
“On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber.
Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-02-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06111201881a5b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971269/a-festival-of-spring-culture-and-shared-heritage' target='_blank'><strong>A festival of spring, culture and shared heritage</strong></a><br><p>Basant, also known as Jashn-i-Baharaan, has for centuries marked the arrival of spring in Punjab, announcing the end of winter’s restraint and the beginning of warmth, colour, and movement. Rooted in the ancient idea of Vasant — spring as both a natural and emotional rebirth — the festival gradually evolved from a seasonal observance into a deeply textured cultural practice. Traditionally celebrated around the fifth day of Magh, Basant was never confined to a single ritual. It unfolded as a collective mood: yellow garments echoing mustard fields, rooftops alive with kites, kitchens fragrant with seasonal foods, and streets humming with anticipation. In this sense, Basant belonged less to the calendar and more to the psyche of the region.
In pre-modern Punjab, whether rural or urban, spring was not merely observed but welcomed. The colour yellow symbolised both agricultural abundance and the strengthening sun, while the act of kite flying transformed the sky into a shared canvas. The festival gained particular prominence in the 19th century under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who formalised Basant celebrations at the Sikh court. Dressed in yellow, flying kites from palace rooftops, the ruler turned a folk tradition into an imperial spectacle without stripping it of its popular character. Cities like Lahore, Amritsar, and Kasur became synonymous with Basant, their skies thick with competing kites, their rooftops echoing with laughter, music, and calls of triumph. Yet even as the celebration acquired royal patronage, it remained rooted in the everyday life of the people.
Nowhere did Basant take on a more distinctive urban character than in Lahore. Over time, it became part of the city’s annual rhythm, a moment when social boundaries softened and neighbourhoods opened themselves to one another. Rooftops ceased to be private enclosures and turned into shared platforms of festivity. Kite makers, string dyers, musicians, food vendors, and artisans found their livelihoods intertwined with the season. The city, for a few days, seemed to breathe differently.
Cultural historian Nazir Ahmad Chaudhary, in his work Basant: A Cultural Festival of Lahore, captures this essence with striking clarity. In one passage, he observes, in translation:
“Basant was not merely the act of flying kites; it was the moment when Lahore lifted its head towards the sky. For a few days, the city forgot its divisions — rooftops became shared spaces, strangers exchanged greetings, and even silence felt festive. In those yellow mornings, Lahore revealed its true temperament: playful, generous, and incurably alive.”
Elsewhere, reflecting on the festival’s inclusive nature, he writes:
“No one asked who believed in what. The kite did not inquire whether the hand that released it was Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh. Basant belonged to the season — and the season belonged to everyone.”
For Chaudhary, Basant was a form of urban civility, a lived culture rather than a religious rite, an expression of how a city learned to live with itself.
This sensibility is echoed, though in a more intimate and elegiac tone, in the writings of A. Hameed. In his essays on Lahore, especially in Lahore Ki Yaadein, Basant appears as a repository of memory and feeling. He recalls the city during Basant as if it were a living being momentarily freed from the weight of time. In translation, he writes:
“In Basant, Lahore behaved like a child who has been promised a fair. Even the old forgot their age, and the poor forgot their troubles — if only for a day. The sky became a page on which the city wrote its happiness in colour.”
When the festival disappeared from public life, A. Hameed sensed a deeper loss:
“When Basant vanished, something else vanished with it — the courage to be openly joyful. A city that stops celebrating the seasons slowly stops recognising itself.”
His writing suggests that festivals like Basant function as emotional infrastructure, sustaining a city’s humanity as much as its roads and buildings sustain its movement.

 

Beyond memory and social practice, Basant has long occupied a rich space in the poetic and mystical imagination of South Asia. The association of spring with renewal, love, and awakening made it a natural metaphor for poets and Sufis alike. Amir Khusrau, the 13th-century poet and musician, is perhaps the most iconic figure linked with Basant’s poetic spirit. Legend recounts that upon witnessing Basant celebrations — women adorned in yellow, fields blooming with mustard — Khusrau dressed in yellow himself and composed verses celebrating the season. In a sense-translation attributed to his Basant compositions, he exclaims:
“Sakhi, Basant has arrived — the earth wears yellow, the sky leans closer, and even sorrow loosens its grip.”
In Khusrau’s work, spring is both literal and metaphysical: the blossoming of the earth mirrors the awakening of the soul, and joy becomes a pathway to the divine.
Punjabi Sufi poetry continued this tradition, using Basant as a symbol of inner transformation. Shah Hussain, in his kaafis, draws a direct parallel between the fields and the heart, reminding the listener:
“When Basant blooms in the fields,
let it bloom in the heart as well.”
The message is clear: external change is incomplete without internal renewal. Even poets like Bulleh Shah, who did not write explicitly about Basant, resonate deeply with its symbolism through their recurring imagery of colour, movement, and freedom. “Let me be dyed in the colour of love,” he implores, “yellow, red, or any that frees me.” In modern times, Faiz Ahmed Faiz reimagined spring as a metaphor for hope and resistance. His call to “bring colour back to the gardens — even if the season resists” echoes Basant’s enduring promise that renewal is possible, even under constraint.
Historically, Basant thrived in a pluralistic social landscape. Pre-Partition Punjab was home to Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and others who participated in the festival together, often without conscious reflection on religious difference. While Basant Panchami held religious meaning for some, the Punjabi expression of Basant became broadly secular, grounded in nature rather than doctrine. It exemplified what is often described as the Ganga-Jamuni ethos — a syncretic culture shaped by shared language, music, food and seasonal rituals. The festival’s eventual suppression in the early 2000s, through a blanket ban on kite flying, disrupted not only a practice but a collective memory. For many Lahoris, it felt as though a vital thread connecting past and present had been severed.
The recent revival of Basant under regulated conditions has, therefore, been greeted with cautious optimism. It is seen not simply as the return of kites to the sky, but as the re-entry of colour, rhythm, and communal joy into the city’s public life. Contemporary writers have aptly described Basant as “the last festival that did not ask for identity cards”, “a rehearsal for coexistence”, and “a sky large enough for everyone’s dreams”. Such descriptions underline the festival’s symbolic weight in an age marked by fragmentation and anxiety.
Ultimately, Basant endures because it speaks to something elemental: the human need to celebrate change, to mark time not only through hardship but through joy. From the poetic imagination of Amir Khusrau to the cultural histories of Nazir Ahmad Chaudhary, from the tender nostalgia of A. Hameed to the lived memories of generations of Lahoris, Basant emerges as a living archive of shared heritage. It reminds us that cultures remain vibrant not through preservation alone, but through participation. In a world increasingly suspicious of collective pleasure, Basant offers a quiet yet powerful lesson — that to celebrate the seasons together is also to reaffirm faith in one another.

In July last year, the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women ordered the removal of Alvi for harassing a former chief marketing and communication officer of KE and also directed him to pay Rs2.5 million to the complainant in compensation.
Alvi, however, had denied the charges and vowed to challenge the decision of the ombudsman before an appropriate legal forum.
“Syed Moonis Abdullah Alvi has tendered his resignation from the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of K-Electric Limited,” stated the disclosure, dated February 6, submitted to the PSX and available to Dawn.
The PSX was informed in “accordance with Section 96 and Section 131 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) of the Rule Book of Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited”.
“You are requested to disseminate the information to the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” said the form, addressing the chief listing manager at PSX.
In a post on X, Alvi confirmed that he had “decided to step down”.







“It has been an honour to serve an institution so central to Karachi’s life, alongside some of the most resilient and committed professionals I know,” said the former KE CEO, adding that he will “support a smooth transition”.
Following the provincial ombudsman’s decision in July 2025, the KE chief approached the Sindh High Court (SHC), which suspended the ombudsman’s order.
In a subsequent hearing in August last year, the SHC extended its stay against the provincial ombudsman’s decision.
Alvi had also filed a representation/appeal before Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori. On February 3, the governor set aside the order of the provincial ombudsman.
Tessori, after hearing both sides and examining the record, overturned the impugned order.
During the hearing, Alvi argued that the complaint was not maintainable and there was no harassment involved, while the order passed by the ombudsman was based on assumptions.
The complainant in her arguments stated that the findings of the ombudsman’s order were correct and in accordance with law, and there was no requirement under the law to approach any other authority by filing a complaint, and therefore, the question of maintainability did not arise.

While both sides have signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and its “treatment of their own people”, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.
Iran has said it wants Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in Muscat.







Iran’s foreign minister called on Friday for “mutual respect” ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme and other issues.
“Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X.
“Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. “
Tehran said it will engage in the talks “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue”.
“We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday.
Tehran’s leadership remains deeply concerned that US President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the US Navy near Iran.
The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada”, has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning.
“While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world,” she added.
Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes.
Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting US bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack.
“It’s very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the US credibly to be able to claim that it’s made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said.
Uranium enrichment
Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.”
Hours before the talks, Iran’s state TV said that “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile Khorramshahr 4” has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile complexes.
However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable.
Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Tehran’s influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the “Axis of Resistance” – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
US asks citizens to ‘leave Iran now’
Meanwhile, in a travel advisory issued by the US virtual embassy in Tehran dated February 6, US citizens residing in Iran were urged to “consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye if safe to do so”.
The advisory noted that “increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages” were going on in Iran.
“The government of Iran continues to restrict access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran,” it added.
The advisory outlined several actions for US citizens to take, including asking them to “leave Iran now”.
“Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said.
In case they are unable to leave, the advisory advised US citizens to “find a secure location within your residence or another safe building.
“Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added.
“Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings.
“Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-06 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06101016301b3b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971305/mani-urges-icc-chief-to-personally-address-pakistans-grievances' target='_blank'><strong>Mani urges ICC chief to personally address Pakistan’s grievances</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ihsan Mani has called on incumbent Jay Shah to play a role in defusing tensions after Pakistan decided to boycott its match against arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo on Feb 15.
Speaking to Dawn from London, Mani — who has also served as the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) — said that being the current ICC chief, Jay Shah should not only speak to Mohsin Naqvi to defuse tensions, but also save world cricket from potential financial losses.
“He should go to Pakistan to convince the government to end the boycott and also listen to their grievances,” he said.
Asked about media that the ICC had appointed Deputy Chairman Imran Khawaja to negotiate with the PCB, Mani said that Khawaja represented associate member Singapore, and was not the right man to deal with the matter. “It is better for the ICC chairman to deal with the government of Pakistan on his own.”

 

He was of the opinion that if the government of Pakistan had taken such a bold step, it must have some solid grounds, in case the matter is moved before the ICC’s Arbitration Comm­ittee in the future.
“There may be some weakness in Pakistan’s case, because the ICC shifted Pakistan’s matches from India to Sri Lanka (under the hybrid model), but a competent legal team can argue it effectively.”

 

It is possible, he opined, that India — holding much sway over the ICC — may get a decision in its favour from the arbitration committee, like what happened in 2018.
“If the ICC again fails to deliver justice to Pakistan, [and chooses to] please India, we have the right to take it to the World Court of Arbitration in Switzerland. There, Pakistan will have every chance to win the case because there are many incidents, which are enough to prove politics is involved in the ICC’s affairs,” Mani said.
When asked about the potential financial losses due if the India-Pakistan match doesn’t go ahead, Mani said that while the match yields massive revenues for the ICC, Pakistan only gets 5.75 per cent against India’s hefty share 38.5pc from the income of the game’s governing body.
“This is the time for Pakistan to fight for an end to politics in the ICC. [They] did not take any action against India when they [spoilt] the gentleman’s game by refusing to shake hands with the Pakistan team [at the Asia Cup]. The ICC did not take any action when the Indian team refused to accept the Asia Cup trophy from ACC Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, just because he is a Pakistani.”
“The boycott of India-Pakistan match may be a violation of members’ participating agreement (signed between PCB and the ICC), but the negative attitude of the BCCI is to blame, which forced Pakistan to take such a big decision,” he said.
Published in Dawn, February 6th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-06 05:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/69853d0dd03f4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971358/crisis-of-neutrality-at-icc' target='_blank'><strong>Crisis of neutrality at ICC</strong></a><br><p>UNLESS you’ve been perpetually asleep since 1947, Pakistan’s refusal to play an upcoming T20 World Cup group match against India would come as no surprise. Cricket between India and Pakistan has often been seen as a proxy war, and it used to be that this ‘war’ was played out on the field, with the competition between bat and ball determining victory and defeat. That was then. In recent times, even the selection of venues and itineraries has been weaponised. This is now.
You could make a convincing case that India started it, and Pakistan has finally had no option but to respond with tit for tat. India’s cricketers haven’t played in Pakistan since 2008, when the Asia Cup was held in Karachi. Over this period, Pakistan has nevertheless played at Indian venues no less than 19 times, the last in November 2023 as part of the ODI World Cup. Initially, India’s refusal could be justified as a matter of safety and security. After all, even Pakistan’s own team was forced to play in the UAE for several years after the Lahore terrorism of 2009.
Yet once Pakistan’s security situation improved and other top-tier teams such as Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand returned to play at Pakistani venues, India’s cricket board had to fetch another excuse. It came up with the notion of “government permission”, effectively ceding decision-making to the hardline BJP, India’s current ruling party. The mask was finally off.
As a result of this Indian intransigence, Pakistan’s hosting of last year’s Champions Trophy was reduced to a farce. While the rest of the eight-team tournament proceeded happily in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi, India was allowed to play all five of its matches in Dubai, including a high-voltage group match versus Pakistan on Feb 23 as well as the tournament final on March 9. What explains this extreme asymmetry is India’s clout as a cricketing superpower. With its massive billion-plus audience, India has dominated world cricket through revenues, sponsorships, lobbying and, ultimately, commandeering of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global body of cricket governance. The situation had become very frustrating for Pakistan to the point that it seemed we had no agency in the matter, no cards left to play.
Two recent dramatic political developments, however, have reset this calculus. One was the overthrow of Indian-backed Sheikh Hasina Wajid in Bangladesh, which has ignited a storm of Bangladeshi fury towards its meddling western neighbour. The other was the backfiring adventurism of Operation Sindoor, which has infused Pakistani administrators with a newfound confidence in their posture towards India. The ripples of these two convulsions have now converged in the cricketing world.

In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly.

First came Bangladesh’s request to the ICC to have their upcoming World Cup matches shifted outside India to Sri Lanka, a concession that Pakistan had already extracted. Ostensibly triggered by the unexplained expulsion of a Bangladeshi player from an Indian Premier League franchise, Bangladesh’s reluctance to play in India actually reflects worsening political ties. Emboldened by Bangladesh, Pakistan too dug in its heels, announcing ongoing internal deliberations, with a final call on World Cup participation to be made by the Pakistani government on Feb 1. That decision was made public in a tweet: Pakistan would play the World Cup but boycott the group match versus India. The possibility of facing India at a later stage of the tournament was left unaddressed.

 

In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal by the Pakistan Cricket Board, because you are throwing away two valuable points and jeopardising qualification to the next stage. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly. Pakistan has a terrible record against India in ICC tournaments, and it is highly likely we would have lost this match anyway. Fortunately, our other three opponents in the group stage are all associate-level teams which, although potentially a banana peel, is no mountain to climb either. Meanwhile, we have deprived the Indian public of its favourite spectacle — thrashing Pakistan at cricket. Simply put, these matches have become television gold for India. The India-Pakistan match in the 2023 ODI World Cup attracted a collective (terrestrial and digital) viewership of over 400 million, and the viewership of last year’s Champions Trophy India-Pakistan match exceeded 800m. The now-defunct encounter of Feb 15 would surely have garnered similar numbers. Should India and Pakistan clash later at the knockout stage, you can be assured all viewership records will be broken.
This selective boycott has triggered polite chatter in Pakistani circles while unleashing uproar in India. That tells you how effective it’s been. Indian hardliners are livid and the Indian public is crushed with disappointment. At the same time, some sensible Indian voices have also emerged. Shashi Tharoor, the erudite Indian politician and scholar, has urged India to reach out to Pakistan and Bangladesh under ICC’s umbrella and “call off this nonsense”. Sharda Ugra, a respected Indian cricket journalist, has laid the blame squarely on India’s cricket board, accusing it of petty egoism and institutional failure.
The real tragedy in this clutter, apart from cricket itself, is Bangladesh, who have every reason to feel hard done by. The could easily have played their matches in Sri Lanka, following Pakistan’s precedent; yet the ICC threatened them with replacement, and that threat was eventually carried out. This leaves the ICC with a lot to answer for. As an organisation tasked with the welfare of global cricket, it should be a neutral body; instead, it has been reduced to a mouthpiece for India. All cricketing nations need to join forces, take principled stands, and hold the ICC accountable. The costs of doing nothing are simply too high.

The first year of his second term has brought significant changes to the existing rules-based world order. Trump has so far mediated armed conflicts, including the India-Pakistan crisis last year, initiated a war against Iran in June 2025, established a Board of Peace to focus on Gaza, withdrawn from 66 global organisations, improved relations with China, strained ties with European allies, threatened Greenland, and treated friends and foes alike through a uniform ‘tariff’ yardstick.
In fact, the first year of the Trump 2.0 presidency has weakened existing alliance structures, nurtured mistrust among American allies, and introduced deep uncertainty regarding Washington’s strategic commitments to the prevailing world order.
How are states trying to protect their interests in this volatile Trumpian world? Naturally, they are attempting to adapt to new global realities and are readjusting their priorities based on four broader objectives.
First, states are actively seeking or building alliances with like-minded countries to ensure collective security. From the Middle East to Africa and from Europe to Asia, states are increasingly concerned about a fragmented and multipolar world order amid declining American security commitments. Trump’s ever-increasing demands on allies coupled with an overarching emphasis on the protection of the Western Hemisphere have compelled several Middle Eastern, North African and Mediterranean states to pursue defence pacts for collective security.

States are trying to protect their interests in a volatile Trumpian world.

Over the past 12 months, several defence agreements have been concluded by American allies in the Middle East. For instance, Greece, Cyprus and Israel inked a Joint Action Plan in the Eastern Mediterranean in December 2025. The Gulf Cooperation Council activated its Joint Defence Agreement in September 2025 following the Iran-Israel conflict. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement to collectively protect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The UAE and India signed a letter of intent for a bilateral strategic defence partnership. Similarly, several notable defence arrangements are under discussion, including a prospective Saudi-Egypt-Somalia trilateral defence pact and a Saudi-Pakistan-Turkiye trilateral defence framework.

 

Second, global uncertainty and a weakened rules-based order have accelerated the process of militarisation. Today, powerful states can take unilateral actions with limited fear of international accountability. This trend has compelled states to increase defence spending and acquire advanced weapons to ensure territorial integrity. Global militarisation is often measured through four parameters, including force modernisation, military expenditure, arms procurement, and alliance building. This trend has increased significantly over the past year. The EU has announced the Readiness 2030 initiative to mobilise €800 billion by 2030 for collective security. Around 15 middle powers have increased their defence spending by more than 10 per cent, notably Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Pakistan and India. Demand for fighter jets, particularly China’s J-20 and J-10, France’s Rafale, and the American F-35s has increased by over 73pc. This substantial rise in defence spending, force modernisation and arms procurement is intensifying the arms race and triggering security dilemmas in volatile regions such as the Middle East and South Asia.
Third, states have begun diversifying their economic partnerships to minimise the impact of US economic coercion. While states have, for the time being, absorbed Trump’s overt use of sanctions and tariffs, most export-driven economies have adopted a long-term strategy of seeking new markets and reliable economic partners. This explains why several major free-trade agreements have been concluded over the past 12 months. For instance, landmark free trade agreements have been signed between India and the EU as well as India and Britain. Although negotiations had been ongoing for several years, Trump’s economic coercion, including threats of tariffs on European allies and the imposition of 50pc tariffs on India pushed both sides towards finalising these agreements.
Fourth, states, including those in the EU, have begun considering China as an alternative and reliable economic partner. As Trump has recalibrated Washington’s relationship with Beijing, US allies have followed suit. India is gradually normalising socioeconomic ties with China. The EU and other Western countries have embarked on an unprecedented rapprochement with China with the aim of diversifying economic and political ties beyond Washington. Consequently, over the past 12 months, several European and Western leaders have visited Beijing, including French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Spanish King Felipe VI. These visits have not only strengthened bilateral cooperation through trade and investment deals but have also served as strategic signals to Washington that, in the presence of an unpredictable American president, states prefer engaging with a predictable President Xi Jinping.
Islamabad has largely followed three out of the four aforementioned global trends in one way or another. It has signed the SMDA with Saudi Arabia and offered similar defence arrangements to other Arab states. Likewise, it has strengthened and deepened ties with Beijing in defence, trade and infrastructure development. In September 2025, Beijing and Islamabad formally launched CPEC 2.0 with the aim of attracting additional Chinese investment. Furthermore, Islamabad has increased defence spending and restructured the command and force structure of its armed forces following the armed conflict with India in 2025.
However, Islamabad has neither been able to diversify its economy nor has it been able to find new markets for its exports. Today, despite global shifts and Trump’s unpredictable nature, Islamabad remains highly dependent on the American market for its exports. Islamabad’s top priority should be to identify and access new export markets, especially at a time when its competitors enjoy greater access to European and American markets due to lower tariffs. Moreover, Islamabad must recognise that security-oriented ties with Washington neither guarantee nor substitute for enhanced foreign direct investment and technology transfer. Similarly, heavy reliance on an unpredictable White House, coupled with the absence of new and lucrative partnerships, will not sustain a bloated defence budget.

This must include the kinetic factor, as evidenced by Operation Radd-ul-Fitna 1, which the authorities launched after last week’s deadly terrorist attacks in the province.
However, beyond this, there must be complementary legal actions, as well as political and socioeconomic steps to address both the immediate threat of separatist violence and the underlying factors that fuel it. The need to recalibrate the national counterterrorism policy to address fresh threats has been recently mentioned in this space. Yet the state must also mount a campaign on the foreign front to confront inimical actors in the region who appear to be playing a role in fuelling terrorism in both Balochistan and KP. In this regard, Pakistan has urged the UN Security Council to “act swiftly” and list the BLA as a terrorist outfit.

 

The BLA and other separatist terrorist groups have already been proscribed in Pakistan, while the US and UK have taken similar steps. But if the UNSC were to formally proscribe these groups, it would help in tightening the dragnet around them and squeezing their finances, while those foreign actors who aid them would have to think twice about providing material support to globally proscribed terrorists.
While the Taliban regime in Kabul provides a safe haven for the banned TTP, the state believes that India supports Baloch groups in their efforts to destabilise Pakistan. Therefore, the state must step up its campaign at the UN and other international forums to ensure that no foreign player is able to aid these bloodthirsty outfits. In the past, Pakistan has provided several dossiers containing evidence of Indian involvement in terrorist activities within its borders. A similar effort is needed now to help end foreign interference in Balochistan.
Yet simply proscribing groups will not be enough. For example, Pakistan has over the decades banned several terrorist and sectarian groups. While some have been dismantled, others continue to operate with lower profiles. Therefore, it is important to pursue legal steps against the individuals involved in terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Their finances must be cut off, and their arms supply severed.
These groups claim to fight for the ‘Baloch cause’, yet are involved in the heinous crimes of murdering innocent Baloch and non-Baloch civilians. But as we have said before, the kinetic and legal battle against terrorism in Balochistan must be supported by efforts to uplift the socioeconomic profile of the province, as well as creating the groundwork for an inclusive democratic process where all non-violent groups that respect the Constitution can work to politically address Balochistan’s problems.

In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide.
He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package.
Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers.
Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance.
He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated.
Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said.
While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package.
Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced.

The two countries signed the protocol to translate long-standing historical, political and diplomatic ties into measurable economic and institutional outcomes. The protocol was signed at the sidelines of the 10th session of the Pakistan-Jordan Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), held on Feb 4-5.
The JMC was co-chaired by Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan and Jordan’s Minister of Industry, Trade and Supply Yarub Qudah. Both sides agreed significantly expand bilateral cooperation across 16 priority sectors, ranging from trade, finance and industry to climate change, maritime affairs, health, technology and education.
The session marks a renewed push and a milestone to operationalise cooperation under the JMC framework established in 1975. Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said that the JMC reflected the shared resolve of both countries to pursue result-oriented cooperation, particularly in trade, investment and private-sector engagement. As a significant outcome, the two sides agreed to initiate consultations on a PTA aimed at improving market access and reducing trade barriers.
A Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment will lead the process, alongside efforts to activate the Pakistan–Jordan Business Council and promote business-to-business linkages. The JMC also welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Information Technology and Telecommunications, aimed at fostering cooperation in digital innovation, technology services and collaboration between the ICT sectors of both countries.
The JMC agreed to strengthen cooperation in banking and finance, including collaboration between central banks, and to expand engagement across industry, agriculture, halal standards, education, skills development, healthcare, climate change, energy, mining, maritime affairs, media, culture, and tourism through institutional linkages and joint working groups.
Secretary, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Muhammad Humair Karim Kidwai, underscored the importance of structured follow-up mechanisms to ensure effective implementation of the agreed decisions. The breadth of cooperation reflects a shared commitment to structured follow-up and implementation.
Both sides expressed their commitment to holding the JMC regularly as a key institutional mechanism to strengthen Pakistan–Jordan economic cooperation further. Pakistan and Jordan have agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse sectors.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Jordanian Minister for Industry and Trade Yarub Qudah expressed a strong desire to enhance bilateral relations with Pakistan. He was confident that this year would see a breakthrough in trade and economic ties. He said the two sides have agreed to establish a working group which will work on different sectors.
Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal said both countries enjoy brotherly relations and want to transform this relationship into strong economic ties. He said the two sides have agreed to enhance cooperation in trade and investment, industries, banking and finance, agriculture, higher education, vocational training, maritime, energy and minerals.

The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven.
The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja.

 

Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026.
Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm.
Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date.
All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks.
Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue.
Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London.
The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven. Four other men were previously charged and are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Feb 13.

Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.
According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.
Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.
She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.
She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.
The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.
Under an amendment made to Pemra Act, a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.
The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.
The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.
Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was appointed in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.
Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.
Regulator’s mandate
Pemra was established under the Pemra Ordinance 2002 to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.
It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.
The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell to a low of $66,675.12, its weakest since October 2024, a month before Trump won the US presidential election, having signalled his intention to support crypto on the campaign trail. It was last down 6.5pc at $67,817.
All told, the global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since hitting a peak of $4.379 trillion in early October, CoinGecko data showed, with some $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.
Bitcoin has already fallen 11pc for the week, taking its losses for the year so far to 23pc. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, was down more than 7pc at $1,973 on Thursday. Ether has fallen nearly 14pc this week, with losses of roughly 34pc so far this year.
Sentiment on crypto was affected by the latest selling in metals and stocks. Gold and silver, for instance, have become more volatile as a result of leveraged buying and speculative flows. Silver, for one, fell as much as 16.6pc to a low of $73.41.

 

“It’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,” said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. “If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition from distribution to reset — and these typically take months, not weeks.”
Trump’s selection of Kevin Warsh as his pick to become the next Federal Reserve chair has also fue­lled the latest rout in cryptocurrencies, due to expectations he could shrink the Fed’s balance sheet. “The market fears a hawk with him,” said Manuel Villegas Franceschi from the next generation research team at Julius Baer.

MANDLA Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela, joins members of the Global Sumud Flotilla activist group.—Reuters

• Last year, Israel had stopped 40 boats of the Global Sumud Flotilla from reaching the occupied territory• UN warns violence by Israeli settlers against West Bank residents ‘peaked in January’, 700 Palestinians displaced• NGO says settlers harassing, evicting Palestinians ‘with IDF, govt backing’
JOHANNESBURG/RAMAL­LAH: Activists behind a flotilla intercepted at sea by Israel last year while trying to bring aid to Gaza will try again this year, expecting more than twice as many boats carrying up to 1,000 medics, they said on Thursday.
The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla in October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants.
Organisers, who gathered at the foundation of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg on Wednesday, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt.
“It is a cause … for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all,” Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. “We want to mobilise the … global community to join forces with us.”
Israeli officials repeatedly denou­nced last year’s mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts.

 

Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the enclave are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid.
Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53 per cent of Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings.
If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza’s plight.
“We may not have reached Gaza physically, (but) we have reached … the people in Gaza,” said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. “They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege.”



Settler attacks cause record displacement
Violence and harassment by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank displaced nearly 700 Pales­tinians last month, the UN said on Thursday, the highest rate since the Gaza conflict erupted in Oct 2023.
At least 694 Palestinians were forcefully driven from their homes last month, according to figures from the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA, which compiles data from various United Nations agencies.
The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said in late January that settler violence has become a key driver of forced displacement in Israeli-occupied West Bank.
January’s numbers were particularly high in part due to the displacement of an entire herding community in the Jordan Valley, whose 130 families left after months of harassment.
“What is happening today is the complete collapse of the community as a result of the settlers’ continuous and repeated attacks, day and night, for the past two years,” Farhan Jahaleen, a Bedouin resident, said at the time.
Settlers in West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, use herding to establish a presence on agricultural lands used by Palestinian communities and gradually deny them access to these areas, according to a report by Israeli NGO Peace Now.
To force Palestinians out, settlers resort to harassment, intimidation and violence, “with the backing of the Israeli government and military”, the settlement watchdog said.
“No one is putting the pressure on Israel or on the Israeli authorities to stop this and so the settlers feel it, they feel the complete impunity that they’re just free to continue to do this”, said Allegra Pacheco, director of the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of NGOs working to support Palestinian communities against displacement.
She pointed to a lack of attention on the West Bank as another driving factor.
“All eyes are focused on Gaza when it comes to Palestine, while we have an ongoing ethnic cleansing in the (occupied) West Bank and nobody’s paying attention to the West Bank,” she said.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank is home to around 490,000 Israelis living in settlements and outposts considered illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory.

ABU DHABI: Ukraine and Russia swapped over 300 prisoners following “productive” talks in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, as a US mediator conceded that “significant” work lay ahead in the quest for a broader deal to end the war.
The negotiations are the latest bid in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting — Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes and much of eastern and southern Ukraine left decimated.
As talks were underway, large swathes of the Ukrainian capital were still without heating in sub-zero temperatures, after successive Russian strikes knocked out energy supplies to hundreds of apartment blocks in Kyiv.



“Today, delegations from the United States, Ukraine, and Russia agreed to exchange 314 prisoners — the first such exchange in five months,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said on social media during the second day of talks in Abu Dhabi.
Russia’s defence ministry later confirmed the two sides changed 157 prisoners each.
While Witkoff described the negotiations as “detailed and productive,” he dimmed hopes for a breakthrough saying “significant work remains”. On Wednesday, Kyiv had described the first day of negotiations as “substantive and productive”.
Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev also said talks were going well.
“There is definitely progress, things are moving forward in a good, positive direction,” he said.
But there was no update from any side on the contentious issue of territory, or any sign of concession from Moscow, which entered the talks refusing to compromise on its key demands.
The Russian envoy also slammed what he called attempts from European nations to “disrupt the progress,” without elaborating.
In a rare official admission of battlefield losses, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday that at least 55,000 of his country’s troops had been killed since Russia invaded in February 2022 — a figure lower than many independent estimates.







Russia has not disclosed how many of its soldiers have been killed.
Tracking of obituaries and family announcements by the BBC and independent Mediazona outlet has found the names of more than 160,000 Russian soldiers killed in the conflict.
‘Concrete steps’
Ahead of the two-day talks, Russia launched its latest massive attack on Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving many people without power and shivering through temperatures as low as minus 20C.
Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Wednesday that “concrete steps and practical solutions” had been discussed in the first day of the talks.
But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters fighting would persist “until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions”.
The main sticking point in the negotiations is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine.
Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas, including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, before any deal.
It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia.
‘Maintain pressure’
Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a pull-back of forces.
The talks in Abu Dhabi are the second round of trilateral negotiations between the US, Russia and Ukraine.
US President Donald Trump has been pushing both sides to negotiate an end to the war since he returned to office, boasting he could strike a deal in hours.
Zelensky said the US president’s role was crucial, telling French television in an interview that “Putin is only scared of Trump”.
Trump could use economic sanctions against Russia or transfer weapons to Ukraine to “maintain this pressure on Putin”, Zelensky said.

The commitment was conveyed by an Elaman Group delegation during a meeting with Minister for the Board of Investment (BOI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh in Islamabad on Thursday. The talks focused on investment opportunities in Pakistan’s mining sector, particularly placer gold mining in Gilgit-Baltistan.
The Kazakh delegation was led by Azamat Utegenov, founder and managing partner of the Elaman Group, and included Ulas Alimbaev, Director of Strategic Development; Rysbek Zhaksybaev, Head of Production; and Erik Akhmetzhanov, Chief Geologist.
During the meeting, the delegation presented the group’s experience and key achievements, outlined priority areas of activity and discussed prospects for expanding investment cooperation, including the possible implementation of joint projects in Pakistan.

Elaman Group identifies strong potential for placer gold exploration in Gilgit-Baltistan

According to a press release issued by the group, the engagement marked an important step towards implementing agreements reached at the highest level, opening new avenues for private-sector collaboration and joint investment projects, and contributing to economic growth and stronger bilateral ties.

 

Mr Sheikh emphasised the importance of strengthening economic relations between Pakistan and Kazakhstan, reiterating Pakistan’s interest in attracting foreign investment and assuring comprehensive support for Kazakh businesses.
The delegation also shared plans to introduce modern mining technologies in collaboration with Chinese partners, aimed at ensuring efficient, sustainable and environmentally responsible operations.
Elaman Group underscored its commitment to corporate social responsibility and community development, with a focus on local employment, skills development and social uplift in project areas.
It was further shared that discussions on forming a joint venture with local partners had been finalised, paving the way for smooth project implementation in line with Pakistan’s legal and regulatory framework.
Mr Sheikh assured the delegation of full facilitation at both federal and provincial levels, including regulatory support, coordination with relevant authorities and assistance through the BoI’s single-window operations. The minister highlighted the role of foreign investment in economic growth, job creation and regional development.

It was learnt on Thursday that  the SMBBMU registrar had last month approached the PMDC and drew his attention to the seats in the private  institutions going vacant as candidates failed in meeting the criteria  of the admission. 
In a letter, he stated that approximately 350  MBBS seats remained vacant due to the failure of aspirants in meeting  the existing PMDC criteria. 
It said the SMBBMU, Larkana, has received multiple requests from  private medical and dental colleges, expressing serious concern over the  inability to fill those seats despite repeated admission rounds.

SMBBMU seeks 10pc reduction for MBBS and BDS programmes

The  registrar said that during the previous academic year, the passing  criteria for MBBS and BDS admissions were reduced by five per cent in  order to fill the vacant seats in the private sector medical and dental  colleges. That measure proved effective in facilitating admissions and  preventing the wastage of precious seats. The current criteria fixed by  the PMDC for the admissions in MBBS is 55pc passing marks while for BDS  it is 50pc. 
The letter highlighted that during the current  academic session, the number of eligible candidates was even lower than  the last year while the number of vacant seats was comparatively higher.  Consequently, the prevailing circumstances warranted a greater  relaxation in the passing criteria than that allowed previously, it  added.
The SMBBMU registrar recommended a 10pc reduction in the  passing marks’ criteria. For MBBS minimum passing criteria should be  reduced to 45pc and for BDS to 40pc, the communication said. 
This  proposed adjustment was essential to ensure optimal utilisation of  available seats, continuity of academic activities and safeguard the  interests of the institutions and aspiring students while maintaining  reasonable academic standards and contributing to the fulfillment of  healthcare service needs of Sindh, the registrar added.
The copies  of the letter were also sent to the secretary health, Government of  Sindh, LUMHS, Jamshoro, vice chancellor, and the chairperson Supervising  & Steering Committee, Sindh. 
When contacted, SMBBMU Vice  Chancellor Prof Dr Nusrat Shah on Thursday confirmed sending the letter  and added that so far no response was received from the PMDC.

MUZAFFARABAD: Demo­nstrations, rallies, processions, and other events were held across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday, with participants condemning India’s brutal atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and highlighting the legitimacy of the anti-India struggle of Kashmiri people.
As these events, which took place in areas close to the Line of Control (LoC), where temperatures remain below freezing under a blanket of snow, the participants expressed full support and solidarity with the people of India-held Kashmir. 
In Muzaffarabad, where a large rally and public gathering was held under the aegis of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Cell, people waved the national flags of Pakistan and AJK and chanted slogans against Indian atrocities.
Prominent attendees included AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan’s deputy emir Liaquat Baloch, former national cricketer Shahid Afridi, and APHC leaders Ghulam Muhammad Safi, Pervez Shah, and Mahmood Ahmed Saghar.
Speaking on the occasion, PM Rathore said the day reflected the strong bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan. Mr Baloch described the Kashmiri freedom struggle as ‘a just and principled movement’, and said his party would stand alongside the Kashmiris until they achieved freedom from India.

At Kohala, ministers and officials from GB and all provinces affirm unwavering support to people of Kashmir 

Declaring that the people of Pakistan stood wholeheartedly with Kashmiris, Mr Afridi urged young people to play a positive and meaningful role in support of the freedom movement.
Events were also held at the points linking AJK with Pakistan, where people from both sides formed symbolic human chains to reaffirm their historic ties.
The major event was held at Kohala, attended by Punjab Minister Mujtaba Shuja-ur-Rehman, Sindh Minister Muhammad Ali Malkani, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister Arshad Ayub Khan, Gilgit-Baltistan Minister Abrar Ismail, and Balochistan’s Parliamentary Secretary Sanjay Kumar as special guests.
Speaking on the occasion, they collectively affirmed that representing Pakistan’s various provinces and diverse communities was a profound honour, especially when expressing unwavering solidarity with the Kashmiri people. 
A flag-hoisting ceremony was also held in Kohala, followed by a one-minute silence. In snow-covered Leepa Valley, large crowds marched waving the flags of Pakistan and AJK, while in Neelum Valley, students participated in speech competitions wearing traditional Kashmiri attire, with prizes awarded by local officials. Poonch divisional commissioner thanked the people for setting aside political affiliations to express solidarity with the Kashmiris.
South Asia peace linked to Kashmir resolution: Aseefa
In her message on the occasion, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s moral, diplomatic and political support and called upon the international community and the UN to honour their commitments and implement Security Council resolutions. 
She stressed that durable peace in South Asia remains linked to a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
She paid tribute to the resilience of Kashmiri women and youth living under occupation, reaffirming Pakistan’s solidarity with the people of India-held Kashmir and their right to self-determination. She drew particular attention to the suffering and strength of Kashmiri women.  
“The mass graves of their families represent only one part of a much larger reality. The silence imposed on entire communities is enforced through premeditated violence and brutal assaults against the women of the occupied valley. Despite this, the women of India-held Kashmir continue to stand firm as leaders at the forefront of what remains the longest resistance to the brute colonisation of a disputed region in the world.”
Ms Bhutto-Zardari recalled that the observance of Feb 5 as a national day of solidarity was initiated 36 years ago by her mother and former premier Benazir Bhutto. While addressing the youth of Kashmir, she acknowledged their key role in sustaining the freedom movement and urged them not to lose hope.

The remarks were made during a meeting of the PTI’s joint parliamentary committee at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad.
The meeting was attended by prominent political leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and PTI stalwarts Asad Qaiser and Taimoor Saleem Jhagra, among others. The meeting was closed off to the media.
Addressing the participants, Qaiser said that the meeting was called because of Imran’s health. He said that representatives of 40 million people were in attendance and unanimously announced that they would not compromise on the health of the PTI founder.
“Don’t push us against the wall; otherwise, all options are open,” Qaiser said in a warning to the ‘powers that be’.
Talking about the Feb 8 protest, he said, “Today, we pledge that we will make the protest successful.”
He further said that the PTI would meet the Supreme Court chief justice at 10am on Friday and share the resolution passed by today’s meeting regarding Imran’s health.
Reading out the declaration, Qaiser said that the meeting, chaired by Achakzai, expressed concerns over the PTI founder’s health and demanded that his visitation rights be restored.
The meeting also expressed concern over the law and order situation in Balochistan, which witnessed a spate of attacks over the weekend, and showed solidarity with the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
Additionally, the participants demanded that steps be taken to ensure the welfare of the people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah and to rehome those who had been displaced. They also elected to intensify the PTI’s ongoing street movement, so that the nationwide protest would be successful.
The participants also condemned the arrest of party leaders and workers in Sindh and announced that rallies would be staged after Isha prayers on February 8.
They also showed solidarity with the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir and emphasised their right to self-determination. They also denounced the revocation of Article 370-A by the Indian parliament in 2019, which stripped the region of its autonomy.
However, the participants expressed their appreciation for the meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP CM Afridi, demanding that the province’s dues be cleared.
Before attending the meeting, Raja said that all issues, including the upcoming protests, would be discussed during at the gathering.
He further said that a statement by Achakzai and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas had been misunderstood, as they said that it would not be a one-day protest.
“They meant that the struggle for democracy will carry on even after February 8,” he clarified.
The development comes after the government last week admitted that Imran was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), days after reports regarding the treatment of the ex-premier emerged in mainstream media.
Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
Subsequently, the Pims executive director, Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz, seeking his “personal intervention” for the PTI founder’s medical examination by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
Meanwhile, the PTI has called a massive nationwide shutter-down strike on February 8 against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections.</p><small>2026-02-05 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/052239166a1ba58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971221/pakistan-uzbekistan-aim-to-boost-bilateral-trade-to-2bn-within-next-5-years' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Uzbekistan aim to boost bilateral trade to $2bn within next 5 years</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on Thursday signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years.
This was one of the several agreements reached between the two sides on the first day of President Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan.
Under the protocol, the two sides shall constitute a joint working group to formulate an action plan for identifying sectors for enhancing bilateral trade and economic cooperation through mutual consultations, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
It is worth mentioning that last month, the two countries had agreed to expand bilateral trade to $2bn as PM Shehbaz met with President Mirziyoyev in Tashkent.
Taking to X on Thursday, PM Shehbaz said he was “delighted” to welcome President Mirziyoyev to Pakistan.
“We had a warm and most productive round of talks, covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, with special focus on trade and investment, regional connectivity, education and cultural exchanges,” he said.
“We also exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” he said, congratulating the visiting dignitary on receiving the country’s highest civil award, Nishan-i-Pakistan.
“Our two sides signed and exchanged 28 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and agreements and we signed a historic protocol to establish a joint working group to devise a five year roadmap of economic and trade cooperation,” he said.







MoUs and agreements
Earlier, it was announced at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on television, that 28 agreements and MoUs had been signed between the two countries. Twenty documents pertaining to these deals were exchanged in the presence of PM Shehbaz and Uzbek President Mirziyoyev.







The agreements and memoranda signed between the two sides covered several areas, including an action plan for defence cooperation, ecology climate change and disaster risk reduction, disaster management, cooperation in agriculture, protocol on sanitary requirements for exports of fruits, cooperation in the area of mining and geosciences, transfer of sentenced persons and cooperartion on combatting drug trafficking.

At the ceremony, an honourary degree of Doctorate of Philosophy and honourary title of professor was conferred on the Uzbek president in recognition of his “exceptional contributions […] towards fostering strong bilateral ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan and promoting peace and development in the region”.
‘Deep-rooted relations’
Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years.
“I would like to avail this opportunity, my dear brother, to congratulate you for being awarded the degree of professor and doctor by NUST University Islamabad, for your meritorious services, your unwavering dedication and your commitment to serve not only our brothers and sisters in Uzbekistan, but also your great contribution in promoting peace, progress and prosperity in neighbouring countries,” the premier said.
The Uzbek president was awarded that honourary degree and title earlier at the ceremony.
PM Shehbaz also congratulated Mirziyoyev on being awarded the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civil honour, for his “services and contributions to converting friendly relations into economic cooperation, trade, and investment in various sectors”.
“I think if we had a bigger title and award, you’d have been the fittest participant for that award [as well],” PM Shehbaz remarked.
He further stated that Pakistan and Uzbekistan had “deep-rooted historical, spiritual and cultural relations, connected by the ancient Silk Route, spanning over centuries”.
In this connection, PM Shehbaz also mentioned the legacy of the Mughal empire and intellectuals from Samarkand and Bukhara.
“These historical facts provide a very sound foundation of our durable relations and a very bright future,” he emphasised, thanking Mirziyoyev for his “leadership, vision and commitment to take these relations to heights not known till this point in time”.
The premier also expressed his gratitude for the hospitality he received during a visit to Uzbekistan last February, but apologised if anything was lacking in the visiting leader’s reception.
He added that the inaugural meeting of a high-level strategic cooperation council took place earlier today, adding that this structured mechanism “heralds a very bright future for both our brotherly countries and people”.
“I want to assure you that I will work very closely with you for regional connectivity, as we both are in total agreement that the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan rail project will be a game changer, not only for our countries but for the entire region.
“And in that, we are ready to join hands and work together to raise funds for this project on the basis of our feasibility and business plan,” he said.
Addressing Mirziyoyev, PM Shehbaz said, “I know for a fact, without a ray of flattery at all, that you are a man of action. You speak less and you act more.
“Today’s signing of this protocol … is a great manifestation of our commitment to work together, enhance and expand our economic relations in the fields of agriculture, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather, leather shoes, tourism, IT and so on and so forth,” he added.
Moreover, the premier spoke about a working group that would be constituted between Islamabad and Tashkent, which “will work day in day out to chart out a five-year plan which will cover all spheres of our economic activity”.
He mentioned that Haroon Akhtar, minister of state for industries and production, would represent Pakistan on the committee.
“This will be a game changer. This will really move towards a cooperation which the world will not have observed before,” the premier maintained.
Both leaders also agreed to quarterly review meetings to assess the performance and progress of this arrangement.
“Instead of having Zoom meetings, let’s put protocols and formalities aside; I will, with my delegation, land in Tashkent, drive straight to your office, have a two-hour working session and return,” PM Shehbaz said, suggesting that for the meeting after, the Uzbek president and his delegation could come to Islamabad and leave the same day.
“This will be a sure and guaranteed forum to have great achievements and dividends for times to come,” he stated.
Additionally, the premier expressed delight that Uzbekistan was part of the Board of Peace initiative, chaired by United States President Donald Trump.
“Together, hopefully, we will, under the chairmanship of President Trump, have long-lasting peace in Gaza, its reconstruction and hopefully materialise the two-state solution of Palestine,” PM Shehbaz said.
“We thank you also for your support to the cause of the people of Kashmir, and together, we will work for peace and prosperity, not only for our two countries but for the region.”
‘Reliable partner and closest friend’
Taking the podium, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.
“I’d like to specifically outline that Pakistan, which is developing very rapidly, is achieving higher and higher results and showing that a modern Pakistan can achieve a high level of development,” the Uzbek president said.
He lauded large-scale reforms ensuring public welfare and accelerated economic growth implemented under PM Shehbaz’s leadership, adding that these achievements “make us very pleased and very happy to acknowledge, since we consider ourselves your closest friends and a brotherly nation”.
The visiting president expressed his sincere gratitude for “accepting us and welcoming us at such a high-level”, noting that a lot was achieved within a short day.
“Especially, I would like to, on the outset, mention that remarkable outcome of the day [is] that I became a professor and doctor at the same time,” he quipped, adding that he would remember today as “a historic day”.
He hailed the honour as a great achievement and a responsibility.
“Today’s date, I can actually mark in my calendar. For my family, this is a remarkable historic day in which we received such a great honour in Pakistan, and I was also awarded the scientific level of professor and doctor,” the Uzbek president noted.
Mirziyoyev added that he had a brief, but very good, discussion with the president of NUST and mentioned the University of Mining in Uzbekistan, where he promised to establish a chair for NUST and said that he had instructed the university’s head, who is also the Uzbek mining minister, to do so.
“Of course, together with the National University of Science and Technology, the academia of Uzbekistan will be collaborating in close cooperation,” he stated.
Mirziyoyev promised to make sure that new discoveries would be made and the services of new scholars, scientists, startups and businesses would be provided to both nations.
“This collaboration between the universities shall cover other areas, including the exchange of faculty members of universities and the exchange of students,” the Uzbek president added.
“We have to make sure that this joint work will provide very effective and demanded outcomes, such as in the area of cybersecurity, as well as AI and many other areas. I believe this will be just the start of this great journey of scientific and collaborative work in education and training.”
Continuing his remarks, Mirziyoyev expressed further gratitude for being awarded the Nishan-i-Pakistan, calling the honour “a clear sign of respect and the close friendship and brotherly relations between both nations”.
“This is a high level of acknowledgement of the close cooperation, friendship and brotherhood; not just between the heads of states and not towards the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, but to the whole people of Uzbekistan,” Mirziyoyev emphasised.
He added, “We have all the grounds and reasons to assure and announce that today’s discussion, today’s work and the collaboration we had was really a truly historic one.”
The Uzbek president stated that all main issues, ranging from security and defence to political and economic issues, were discussed with the Pakistani side “in a detailed manner”.
“As a result of the talks, we have decided we would sign a protocol that will serve as a basis for signing larger agreements on establishing joint councils and working groups and our means to work further on those issues,” Mirziyoyev said.
According to the Uzbek president, this was the first such protocol signed in the history of Tashkent’s foreign ministry. He hailed the agreement as “a new discovery and a game changer”.
“We, as the heads of the two states, have signed it, and it serves as a fundamental basis and sealing promises from both sides that will deliver on those areas of discussion,” Mirziyoyev said.
Continuing his address, the Uzbek president praised the “very wise people” of Pakistan, emphasising that they have centuries of wisdom and they say “true friendship is the most cherished value of humanity”.
“Of course, the very fact that today we named one of the streets of Islamabad by the name of ‘Tashkent’, this already is a clear sign of the close friendship and brotherhood we have in respect to each other,” he added.
“I’d like to especially thank my dear brother, the honourable prime minister, for accepting our suggestion and permitting to build a park named after our great ancestor Babar in one of the areas of Islamabad. This is a great sign of close friendship and collaboration between us,” he stated, adding that PM Shehbaz suggested establishing a ‘Ferghana Village’ park as well.
The Uzbek president vowed to do his best to deliver and make sure that this park, which will be built in Islamabad, will provide leisure to the people of Islamabad, while teaching them about the two nations’ friendship.
On conflict, Mirziyoyev said Uzbekistan had observed many problems within conflicts every day and hailed PM Shehbaz’s efforts to “unite our efforts and to make sure that our position will be united”, starting by providing “long-awaited assistance and support to the people of Palestine, who have been suffering for quite a long time”.
“We will make sure that through our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we’ll be taking each and every step on the basis of the joint agreed actions and plans and each and every initiative will be discussed and agreed upon by both parties,” the Uzbek president vowed.
“If we unite our forces and our efforts, we will be able to cope with any problems and difficulties present nowadays, and what might be emerging in the future as well.”
Delegation-level talks
Separately, state-run PTV News reported that PM Shehbaz and the Uzbek president also held delegation-level talks.
PM Shehbaz welcomed President Mirziyoyev at the PM House today, a statement carried by PTV News said, adding that an official welcome ceremony was held on the occasion, which was followed by a one-on-one meeting and delegation-level talks between the two sides.







“During the talks, the leaders highlighted the positive trajectory of relations marked by common historical, religious and cultural affinities. Their discussions covered the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, with special focus on trade and investment, regional connectivity, education and cultural exchanges.

It added that the two leaders expressed satisfaction over the growing high-level interactions and regular meetings of bilateral institutional mechanism in diverse sectors.
They also welcomed the operationalisation of the High-Level Strategic Consultative Council (HLSCC), which would enable effective implementation of the decisions taken by the leadership. The HLSCC mechanism was established during the visit of PM Shehbaz to Tashkent in February 2025.
“The two leaders also committed to make concerted efforts to implement the roadmap agreed between the two sides in the follow-up of the PM’s visit to Tashkent,” the statement said.
It added that on regional connectivity, the two leaders appreciated ongoing efforts to enhance road, rail, air and maritime cooperation.
“Both sides agreed that Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project is the key driver of regional connectivity between Central Asia and Pakistani seaports.”
Underlining the multidimensional cooperation between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, the two leaders agreed to further enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in the areas of mining, energy, defence, tourism, education, and culture.
They also reiterated their commitment to enhance bilateral trade up to $2bn.
After the official talks, the two leaders unveiled the plaques of Tashkent Street and Babur Park in Islamabad, it said.
According to the statement, in addition to 28 agreements and MoUs, the two sides also signed a joint declaration on the outcomes of the Uzbek president’s visit to Pakistan.
He also invited the PM Shehbaz for the next round of Pakistan-Uzbekistan High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council in Tashkent next year, the statement said.
Visit to GIDS
The Uzbek president also, along with senior ministers, also visited the Global Industrial and Defence Solutions (GIDS) as part of his official tour to Pakistan.
Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir “warmly received the president and the delegation and conducted them during the visit to the facility”, a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
During the visit, the Uzbek president was briefed on the diverse portfolio of GIDS, encompassing advanced defence solutions, industrial capabilities, and technological innovations, the ISPR statement carried by APP said.
It added that the delegation toured key facilities and witnessed various defence products reflecting Pakistan’s growing expertise in indigenous defence production and industrial development.
“The visit underscored the shared commitment of Pakistan and Uzbekistan to deepen collaboration in defence, technology, and industrial sectors. Both sides emphasised the importance of enhancing partnerships, knowledge exchange and joint ventures,” it further said.
“The visit marked a significant step toward strengthening bilateral ties and exploring multifarious avenues of cooperation between Pakistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan,” it added.
Uzbek president’s arrival
Upon his arrival at Nur Khan Airbase the Uzbek president was received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari.







A post on the President Secretariat’s X account said: “A warm welcome to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan! President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz received the Uzbek president at Noor Khan Airbase today. This visit marks a significant step in strengthening bilateral ties and regional connectivity.”







According to state-run APP, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the PM on Industry and Production Haroon Akhtar were also present at the Nur Khan Airbase to welcome the Uzbek president.
Mirziyoyev was welcomed with a 21-gun salute, the APP report said.
It added that a smartly turned out contingent of the Pakistan armed forces presented a static salute to the visiting dignitary, and the tri-services band also delivered a performance.
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said that the Uzbek president was undertaking the official visit to Pakistan at the invitation of PM Shehbaz.
In its statement, the FO said that the President Mirziyoyev would lead a high-level delegation comprising cabinet ministers and business leaders.
The FO added that this was the Uzbek president’s second visit to Pakistan, as he had last visited Pakistan in 2022.
The visit “reflects the upward trajectory in Pakistan-Uzbekistan bilateral relations and the brotherly ties between the two brotherly countries, rooted in common history, faith and common aspirations for peace and prosperity in Central and South Asia”, it said.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have strengthened ties through trade and economic cooperation. A $1 billion trade deal was signed in 2023, and plans for further collaboration, including a roadmap for industrial cooperation, show the two sides’ commitment to boosting regional connectivity.
The Embassy of Uzbekistan said last week that President Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan was expected to mark a new phase in bilateral relations.</p><small>2026-02-05 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05234428c12fa02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254/t20-world-cup-sri-lanka-urges-pakistan-to-reconsider-boycotting-india-match' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to reconsider boycotting India match</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka’s cricket board on Thursday asked Pakistan to reconsider its decision to boycott their first-round encounter with arch-rival India in the T20 World Cup co-hosted by the island.
Pakistan decided not to play India on February 15 in Colombo to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who were excluded from the tournament after refusing to play their matches in India.
Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade and meet only at global or regional tournament events.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
“Any non-participation will have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows,” the board said.
It recalled that Sri Lanka had toured Pakistan to express solidarity and revive international matches there when other nations stayed away due to security concerns.
“We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two boards, and the broader interests of the game of cricket,” SLC said, calling on Pakistan to play their scheduled match against India.
India start the T20 World Cup on home soil against the US on Saturday. Pakistan play their first match of the tournament, also on Saturday, in Colombo against the Netherlands.
Despite Pakistan’s boycott of their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo, the arch-rivals may be forced to play each other if they reach the knockout stage.
If Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would consult the government, skipper Salman Agha said earlier on Thursday.</p><small>2026-02-05 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/052204479028364.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971248/1-arrested-after-explicit-videos-played-on-digital-advertising-boards-in-karachis-dha' target='_blank'><strong>1 arrested after explicit videos played on digital advertising boards in Karachi’s DHA</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: One person was arrested on Thursday for the alleged involvement in explicit videos being played on digital advertising screens in Karachi’s DHA.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza confirmed to Dawn that one person was arrested in connection with the incident.
He had earlier stated that police were investigating whether the screens were “hacked through Wi-Fi” or whether an insider indulged in mischief.
On Wednesday evening, several reports had emerged on social media, alleging that digital advertising boards of a private company was displaying obscene visuals.
Subsequently, a case was registered against unidentified employees on the complaint of the company’s legal adviser under Section 292 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prohibits the sale, distribution, public exhibition, or circulation of obscene books, pamphlets, papers, etc.
According to the FIR, the complainant said that on Wednesday, he received information from the company’s operation director that explicit videos were being displayed on the company’s surface-mount device (SMD) screens installed near Ayesha Masjid on Khayaban-i-Ittehad.
“We have reasonable doubts that the company’s employee(s) had displayed the obscene videos to defame the company,” the complainant said, adding that the company’s owners/directors wanted legal proceedings.</p><small>2026-02-05 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05153446a6524b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971239/train-services-restored-in-balochistan-after-5-days-mobile-data-still-suspended-in-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>Train services restored in Balochistan after 5 days; mobile data still suspended in Quetta</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Train services were restored in Balochistan on Thursday, after five days of suspension, as the tense security situation eased following a series of counter-terrorism operations in response to a spate of attacks in the province.
However, mobile data services remained suspended for the sixth day in Quetta and some other districts.
“Train services within Balochistan and to other provinces have been,” Muhammad Kashif, spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, confirmed to Dawn.
He particularly mentioned that the services of the Jaffar Express train on the Quetta-Peshawar route and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended since January 31.
The railway official added that both had been restored now.

 

He further said that operations of the Quetta-Chaman passenger train had also resumed, and it departed today at its scheduled time.
On the other hand, mobile data services remained suspended in the provincial capital for the sixth consecutive day.
The mobile internet was still inaccessible in Quetta, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn. However, it was expected to be restored till 12am, he said.
Mobile data also reportedly remained suspended in the Nushki, Sibi and Mastung districts.
The services have also been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns.
Separately, Balochistan Special Assistant to the Balochistan CM on Politics Shahid Rind said during a press conference in Quetta that examinations for grades 8 and 9 in the provincial capital would be held as per the schedule, and the polio campaign would continue as planned except in Nushki.
“National highways in the province have been cleared, except for an area of Noshki, which is disturbed,” Rind added. “The PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) is working on it, it will be cleared within the next 12 to 24 hours.”
The spokesperson said that all roads were open, though the standard operating procedure barring night travel remained in place.
“In Noshki, the road was damaged by bombs, so teams from CNW (Communication and Works Department) and the PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) are working on repairs,” Rind said, adding that the repair work should be completed within the next 12 to 24 hours.
After several days of “mop-up” actions in some parts in the wake of January 31 attacks, the military announced earlier today that security forces successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists.

 

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred as a result of the operations.
“[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed.
On January 31, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district.
Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year.
On the night of January 26, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track.
The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.</p><small>2026-02-05 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0518360813ee4e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971222/216-terrorists-killed-as-security-forces-conclude-operation-radd-ul-fitna-1-in-balochistan-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>216 terrorists killed as security forces conclude ‘Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1’ in Balochistan: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in the days-long clearance actions against “Indian-sponsored terrorist elements”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
“Security forces have successfully concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 in Balochistan under which a series of coordinated, swift, and intelligence-driven operations were conducted against Indian-sponsored terrorist elements seeking to disrupt peace and development by targeting innocent civilians, including women and children,” the ISPR said in a press release.
The development comes as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
“As a result of these well-coordinated engagements and subsequent clearance operations, 216 terrorists have been sent to hell, significantly degrading the leadership, command-and-control structures and operational capabilities of terrorist networks,” the military’s media affairs wing said.
“Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution, Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs), with support of intelligence agencies, under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve,” the statement read.
“During these operations, 36 innocent civilians, including women and children, embraced martyrdom, while 22 brave security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the protection of its citizens,” the ISPR stated.
“Their courage, professionalism, and unwavering commitment reflect the highest traditions of service. The nation honours their sacrifice and stands in solidarity with the families of all martyrs,” the military said.
Detailing the forces’ timely actions, the ISPR recalled that on January 29, “operations were initiated in Panjgur and the outskirts of Harnai District after credible and verified intelligence confirmed the presence of terrorist elements posing an imminent threat to local public”.

 

“During this phase, security forces undertook operations against identified terrorist hideouts, resulting in the elimination of 41 terrorists affiliated with Indian proxy networks,” it noted.
“Subsequently, aggressive and steadfast responses by the brave security forces effectively thwarted the desperate attacks of Fitna-al-Hindustan to destabilise the peace of Balochistan.
“Sequel to these, a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that a “substantial cache of foreign-origin weapons, ammunition, explosives and equipment has also been recovered during the process”.
“Preliminary analysis indicates systematic external facilitation and logistical support to these extremist proxies,” it observed.
The military reaffirmed that the armed forces remained steadfast in their “resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations under the ambit” of the government’s National Action Plan (NAP).

 

It asserted that “counter-terrorism operations will continue with full determination until the complete elimination of terrorist threats”.
“Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 stands as a testament to Pakistan’s and particularly Balochistan’s proud peoples’ unwavering commitment to always prefer peace over violence, unity over division and development over violence,” the ISPR said.
Following the January 31 attacks at multiple locations across Balochistan, security forces and LEAs continued “mop-up” actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province on Tuesday.
Mobile internet had remained suspended in parts of the province for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, with provincial authorities also halting train services.
President, PM hail forces for ‘crippling’ terrorists
President Asif Ali Zardari commended security forces and law enforcement agencies over the successful completion of the operation in Balochistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
According to the report, in a statement, the president noted that the timely action of the security forces thwarted the nefarious attempts of Fitna-al-Hindustan to disrupt peace in Balochistan.
“Eradication of foreign-backed terrorism is our top priority,” the report quoted him as saying.
“The president expressed satisfaction that intelligence-based coordinated operations crippled the leadership and capacity of the foreign-backed terrorist networks,” the report read.
It further said that President Zardari paid tribute to the innocent civilians and security personnel who were martyred during the operation, and expressed condolences to their families.
“The nation salutes the sacrifices of martyrs and stands united against terrorism,” he said.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the officers and security forces personnel, as well as the leadership of the armed forces, for the success of Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, Radio Pakistan reported.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz praised the professional capabilities of the security forces for “breaking the backbone of enemies for peace and development” in Balochistan during the operation.
The prime minister emphasised that the nation could never forget the sacrifices of its martyrs, Radio Pakistan said.
“He vowed that the cowardly and malicious attempts by the terrorists to sabotage the peace of Balochistan through targeting innocent civilians would always be crushed,” the report read.
“The terrorists have proved that they are enemies of development in the province and its people by targeting innocent civilians,” it quoted the premier as saying.
PM Shehbaz vowed that the war against the “scourge of terrorism will continue until it is completely eradicated from the country”.
“The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces in their unwavering determination to defend the homeland,“ he affirmed.







Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, in a post on X, stated that the operation was a “clear message to those committing acts of bloodshed in Balochistan”.
He maintained that the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was “a fitna targeting innocent civilians and labourers”, stressing that the group was working “at the behest of India”.
“Pakistan will not compromise on its unity, development, and the protection of its people,” Bugti said.
The chief minister warned that any effort to destabilise the country will be met with “a decisive response”.
“The nation stands united, and any hand raised against Pakistan will not only be dealt with law and full force but will be broken,” he vowed.
‘Search and combing operations ongoing in Quetta’
Later, Balochistan CM’s spokesperson Shahid Rind said that while most areas had been cleared, search and combing operations were still ongoing in Quetta.
“The situation across the province is normal, including in Nushki and Quetta,” he told reporters at a press conference in Quetta. “At least 100 suspects have been arrested during the combing and search operations in Quetta. They are being investigated.”







Rind added that during the operations, “illegal small arms, recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers were found in some homes”.
“The identification of terrorists killed in the operations is ongoing,” further stated.
He recalled that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti previously said that “families whose children [had links] with terrorist organisations were requested to inform security institutions, district administration and political people about those children,” Rind said.“If they do not inform [the authorities] … action can be taken against the families, and the law has the provision for it.”
Responding to a question, he said the terrorists’ target was the red zone in Quetta. “Balochistan police personnel and Frontier Corps soldiers kept the terrorists on their target until they were forced to move their vehicles from the spot.”
Rind added that one of the challenges faced during the operation was that the terrorists had blended themselves among the people. “So, there was risk of collateral damage,” he said, adding that a similar problem was faced in Noshki. “We had to prevent collateral damage.”
Asked if the Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) was on the target in the red zone, Rind said that the apparent target was the red zone itself.
He then answered a question about any existing threats, noting that amid the current situation, “multiple threats are generated” to which security forces respond.
“There were some threats pertaining to these incidents in the past,” he added. “When the red zone was attacked, it was not as if high-ranking officials were at home; the CTD DIG was leading the situation and the IG (Inspector General of Police) was present there.
“It means that there was a threat or alert, which was why high-ranking officials were present.”
In response to a question about attacks on prisons, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary on Interior Hamza Shafqaat stated that the Nushki jail superintendent was in stable condition and was receiving medical care.
“Two prisons were attacked, and prisoners under trial and serious criminals are at large,” he said. “There is a hot pursuit [for them] and combing and sanitisation operations are ongoing. As soon as we get updates from Nushki and Mastung, we will share them with you within 24 hours.”
Provincial Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar stated that when the attacks were reported, the health ministry promptly responded and announced an emergency. He also expressed gratitude to healthcare providers and medical staff who cared for the injured.
“These incidents affect people’s mental health,” he said, adding that a project related to mental health was ongoing. “Work on that will continue. The health department and the people are mentally ready for these kinds of situations.”
Rind added that those who attacked police stations had been identified. “Most of them appeared to be civilians, but action has been taken against them after their identification,” he said.
In response to another question, he two female terrorists had been killed during the operations while three civilian women had lost their lives in the attacks in Gwadar.</p><small>2026-02-05 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/051325178c9d816.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971233/provision-of-maximum-security-to-chinese-nationals-top-priority-interior-minister-tells-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>Provision of ‘maximum security’ to Chinese nationals top priority, interior minister tells envoy</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held an “important meeting” with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong in Islamabad on Thursday and told him that providing “maximum security” to Chinese nationals was Pakistan’s top priority.
A press release issued by he interior ministry detailed the exchange that took place during the Chinese envoy’s visit to the ministry, where Naqvi also briefed him about the situation in Balochistan.
The province saw a spate of attacks on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days while security forces carried out retaliatory action.
Meanwhile, Chinese citizens and projects have also come under attack multiple times in Pakistan in the past, including in Balochistan. According to data shared by the National Counter Terrorism Authority in December 2024, as many as 20 Chinese citizens had been killed and 34 injured in terror attacks in the country from 2021 until then.







During his meeting with Naqvi today, the Chinese envoy condemned the terrorist attacks on civilians and security forces in Balochistan and expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the affected families, the interior ministry’s statement said.
It quoted the envoy as saying that “China stands in complete solidarity with the victims in this hour of grief. China condemns terrorism in all its forms and stands firmly with Pakistan in the fight against terrorism”.
For his part, Naqvi conveyed to Zaidong that terrorism in Balochistan was carried out under an “organised and premeditated plan, and that the security forces responded in a timely and effective manner”.
He briefed the Chinese ambassador on the prompt and effective operations conducted by security forces in Balochistan, the ministry’s statement said, adding that Naqvi also briefed the envoy on measures taken for the protection of Chinese citizens and Chinese projects.
“The safety of Chinese citizens and projects is of paramount importance. No enemy can undermine the Pakistan–China friendship. Providing maximum security to Chinese nationals is our top priority,” the statement quoted the interior minister as saying.
The statement said that a special protection unit was being established for the security of Chinese nationals and modern Chinese technology and equipment would prove supportive for coordinated counter-terrorism operations.
Naqvi also briefed the Chinese ambassador on his recent successful visit to China.
‎During the meeting, detailed discussions were held on counter-terrorism, internal security, and security cooperation. Both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in intelligence sharing and the field of cybercrime, the statement said.
It said that the interior minister and Zaidong reaffirmed their resolve to further strengthen the Pakistan–China strategic partnership.
“‎The Chinese ambassador thanked Pakistan for the security measures taken for Chinese nationals,” the statement said, adding that Naqvi  expressed his gratitude to the Chinese ambassador for China’s unwavering support for Pakistan on every occasion.</p><small>2026-02-05 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05174625b1d5242.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971246/unicef-raises-alarm-over-ai-generated-sexualised-images-of-children-calls-on-governments-to-take-action' target='_blank'><strong>Unicef raises alarm over AI-generated sexualised images of children, calls on governments to take action</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) on Thursday said it was increasingly “alarmed” by reports of AI-generated sexualised images involving children, calling on governments and the AI industry to prevent the creation and dissemination of such content.
In a statement, the UN agency said, “The harm from deepfake abuse is real and urgent. Children cannot wait for the law to catch up.”
“Deepfakes — images, videos, or audio generated or manipulated with Artificial Intelligence designed to look real — are increasingly being used to produce sexualised content involving children through ‘nudification,’ where AI tools are used to strip or alter clothing in photos to create fabricated nude or sexualised images,” Unicef said in its statement.
It added that the “unprecedented” situation presented new challenges for “prevention, education, legal frameworks, and response and support services for children”. But, current prevention efforts were “insufficient when sexual content can be artificially generated”, the statement said.
Unicef’s statement said that the growing prevalence of AI-powered image or video generation tools that produce sexualised material marked a “significant escalation” in risks to children through digital technologies.
The UN body referred to a recent large-scale research, which the agency conducted along with child rights group ECPAT and Interpol, under the ‘Disrupting Harm project’.
The research showed that across 11 countries, at least 1.2 million children reported having had their images manipulated into sexually explicit deepfakes through AI tools in the past year.
In some of the countries, this amounted to 1 in 25 children, or the equivalent of one child in a typical classroom.
“Children themselves are deeply aware of this risk. In some of the countries, up to two-thirds of children said they worry that AI could be used to create fake sexual images or videos,” the statement read.
It added that the “levels of concern vary widely between countries, underscoring the urgent need for stronger awareness, prevention, and protection measures”.
“We must be clear. Sexualised images of children generated or manipulated using AI tools are child sexual abuse material (CSAM).”
The UN agency held that “deepfake abuse is abuse, and there is nothing fake about the harm it causes”.
The statement highlighted that “when a child’s image or identity is used, that child is directly victimised”.
“Even without an identifiable victim, AI-generated CSAM normalises the sexual exploitation of children, fuels demand for abusive content and presents significant challenges for law enforcement in identifying and protecting children who need help.”
On that note, the UN agency said that it welcomed “efforts of those AI developers who are implementing safety-by-design approaches and robust guardrails to prevent misuse of their systems”.
However, Unicef warned that the landscape still “remains uneven, and many AI models are not being developed with adequate safeguards”.
It stressed that the “risks can be compounded when generative AI tools are embedded directly into social media platforms, where manipulated images spread rapidly”.
“Unicef has urgently called for actions to confront the escalating threat of AI-generated child sexual abuse material,” the UN body’s statement said.
It added that all governments should expand definitions of CSAM to include AI-generated content, and criminalise its creation, procurement, possession and distribution.
Unicef further pressed AI developers to implement safety-by-design approaches and robust guardrails to prevent misuse of AI models.
It further said that “digital companies prevent the circulation of AI-generated child sexual abuse material — not merely remove it after the abuse has occurred; and to strengthen content moderation with investment in detection technologies, so such material can be removed immediately — not days after a report by a victim or their representative”.
The issue of AI-generated sexualised images most recently gained attention after Elon Musk’s platform X came under fire after users were found exploiting the platform’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok, to edit and manipulate photographs, including digitally undressing people — among them children — or portraying them in minimal clothing.
The European Commission has also said that it would investigate whether social media platform X protected consumers by properly assessing and mitigating risks related to Grok’s functionalities.</p><small>2026-02-05 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0515334353bbdbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971238/kp-apex-committee-deems-cooperation-with-centre-political-parties-vital-for-successful-counter-terrorism-policy' target='_blank'><strong>KP apex committee deems ‘cooperation’ with Centre, political parties vital for successful counter-terrorism policy</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa apex committee has termed “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy, it emerged on Thursday.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi chaired his first meeting of the provincial apex committee since assuming office on Wednesday.
The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna-al-Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”, as per a press release issued by the KP CM’s office today.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the meeting, the press release said, the committee agreed that “joint consultation, mutual cooperation, and practical coordination between all political parties, public representatives, and the federal government is essential for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy”.
The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, the Peshawar corps commander, the chief secretary and the KP inspector general. Senior civil, military and law enforcement officials were also present.







The apex committee “firmly resolved that the KP government will utilise all its resources, including the armed forces, police, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and other institutions, to combat terrorism and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices”.
The committee hoped that the “long-term strategy would identify all the causes of terrorism and eliminate them, and as a result, ensure the restoration of public confidence so that the government and the public” can work together for the country’s progress.
“The KP government’s agenda is that only good governance and public interest can unite the nation against terrorism,” read the meeting’s press release.
Under this agenda, it was decided that in the “first phase, areas affected by terrorism will be converted into model good governance districts”.
It further said “all government resources will be utilised to compensate for the lack in the provision of development, social services and economic growth” in terrorism-afflicted areas.
The committee also announced a “special package to provide security, communication, health, education, employment, basic amenities and other services in these areas under an organised programme”.
“The forum decided that the government will ensure complete care, rehabilitation, and the provision of basic needs for the welfare of the people affected in the areas where temporary relocation took place for sustainable stability, so that this temporary difficulty can form the base for peace, development and prosperity in the future,” the statement read.
“Their dignified return is a top priority for the [KP] government,” it stressed.
The federal and KP governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists.

 

Speaking during the meeting, CM Afridi stressed that the provincial government “will not make any compromise on peace” in the province.
He asserted that the “civil government, authorities, armed forces, and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are on the same page for law and order and will continue their joint efforts”.
He reiterated that the fight against terrorism was a “collective one and can only be won through joint efforts”.
The statement comes days after CM Afridi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, where the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism.

 

On counter-terrorism, PM Shehbaz had termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”.
“There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to combat terrorism.
Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, the premier said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare.
The PTI-led KP government and the Centre have mostly been at odds over counter-terrorism policies in the province, particularly military operations, with the former objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”.
CM Afridi has repeatedly called for a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terrorism policy-making.

 

The debate on the right approach to establish law and order comes on the heels of heightened militancy.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-05 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/051429439381bac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971235/lahore-qalandars-directly-sign-bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rehman-for-over-rs60m' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore Qalandars directly sign Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rehman for over Rs60m</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million.
“Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar.
“Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said.








Mustafizur had registered for the PSL in early January, following his release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.
He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season.
KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
The decision came amid strained relations between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.
In response, Bangladesh banned IPL broadcasts in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.
ICC, however, rejected the request, replacing Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament.
Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars.
Mustafizur’s direct signing has been made possible after the PCB announced sweeping changes to the player acquisition mechanism for PSL 11 last month, replacing the long-running draft with a full-fledged auction and raising the player purse to $1.6m per franchise.
Under the new framework, each franchise is allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in the previous season, giving teams an additional avenue to bolster their squads with new international talent.
PSL 11 will begin on March 26, and will also mark the return of Faisalabad as a host city, expanding the league’s footprint beyond the existing venues of Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.</p><small>2026-02-05 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/05113946c8df0c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971220/pakistan-must-create-30m-jobs-over-next-decade-world-bank-president' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan must create 30m jobs over next decade: World Bank president</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan must create up to 30 million jobs over the next decade to turn its youth bulge into an economic dividend or risk instability and outward migration, World Bank President Ajay Banga has stressed.
Pakistan is entering the implementation phase of a 10-year Country Partnership Framework (CPF) deal agreed with the World Bank last year, while also working with the International Monetary Fund to stabilise its economy. But Islamabad is still facing mounting pressure to deliver sustained growth and jobs.
“We’re trying to move the bank group as a whole from the idea of projects to the idea of outcomes,” Banga said in an interview with Reuters in Karachi during a visit to Pakistan this week.
“Job creation is the North Star.”
‘Generational challenge’
Pakistan needs to generate 2.5m to 3m jobs a year — roughly 25m to 30m over the next decade — as millions of young people come of age, Banga said. Failure to do so could fuel “illegal migration or domestic instability”.
Banga said Pakistan’s population dynamics mean employment creation will remain a binding constraint on growth over the long term, rather than a secondary policy goal.
“This is a generational challenge,” he said.
The CPF commits around $4 billion a year in combined public and private financing from the World Bank Group, with roughly half expected to come from private-sector operations led by the International Finance Corporation.
Banga said the reliance on private capital reflects a country where the government has limited spending capacity and 90 per cent of jobs are created in the private sector.
Banga said Pakistan’s job strategy rests on three pillars: investment in human and physical infrastructure, business-friendly regulatory reforms, and expanded access to financing and insurance, particularly for small firms and farmers that typically lack bank credit.
Infrastructure, primary healthcare, tourism and small-scale agriculture were labour-intensive sectors with the greatest employment potential, he said, adding that farming alone could account for about one-third of the jobs Pakistan needs to create by 2050.
A growing pool of freelancers also highlighted Pakistan’s appetite for entrepreneurship, but they need better access to capital, infrastructure and support to scale into job-creating businesses, he said.

 

The strain is readily visible in the exodus of skilled workers.
Nearly 4,000 doctors emigrated from Pakistan in 2025, the highest annual outflow on record, according to Gallup Pakistan data based on Bureau of Emigration figures, underscoring concerns that weak job prospects and poor working conditions are pushing trained professionals abroad.
Power first
Fixing Pakistan’s power sector is the most urgent near-term priority, Banga said, noting that losses and inefficiencies in electricity distribution have limited growth despite improvements in generation capacity.
Pakistan’s power sector has long been plagued by growing debt from distribution losses, weak bill recovery and delayed government subsidies, which has strained public finances and discouraged private investment. The debt has been a recurring focus of IMF-backed reform programmes, with successive governments struggling to contain losses while keeping energy affordable.

 

Banga said progress on privatisation and private-sector participation in electricity distribution would be critical to improving efficiency, reducing losses and restoring the sector’s financial viability.
He said rapid rooftop solar adoption, while easing energy costs for households and businesses, risks creating grid instability if distribution reforms are not accelerated.
“Electricity is fundamental to everything — health, education, business and jobs.”
Climate by design
Banga said climate resilience should also be embedded into mainstream development spending rather than treated as a standalone agenda.
Pakistan is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, hit repeatedly by floods, heatwaves and erratic monsoons.

 

Banga said climate-resilient investments should be integrated into infrastructure, housing, water management and agriculture to support jobs while reducing long-term risks.
“The moment you start thinking about climate as separate from housing, food or irrigation, you create a false debate. Just build resilience into what you’re already doing.”
Asked how Pakistan fits into the World Bank’s global portfolio, Banga said he does not view the country through labels such as fragility or crisis, but as a long-term job-creation opportunity.
“We’re in the business of hope,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-05 07:20</small></div><hr>
