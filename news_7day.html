According to officials, an intense exchange of fire continued throughout the night along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, the situation has since calmed after the firing subsided by morning.
Security sources stated that the Pakistan Army responded swiftly and in a coordinated manner by targeting multiple Afghan Taliban checkposts located across the border in Afghanistan’s Paktia province.
During the operation, Pakistani forces reportedly took control of five key Afghan checkposts and raised the national flag at the captured locations. Among the posts brought under control were two opposite Shawal, two facing the Angoor Adda sector, and one located opposite Zarmilan, security sources confirmed.
The operation, officials said, was aimed at restoring stability in the sensitive border region and effectively countering hostile activities.
Sources further revealed that Pakistani forces also destroyed an Afghan terminal in the Angoor Adda area, which was allegedly being used for military-related purposes.
As a result of the strong and coordinated response by Pakistani forces, Afghan Taliban elements reportedly suffered significant losses. Security officials confirmed that the Afghan Charlie Post and Afghan Babri Post in the Angoor Adda sector were completely destroyed during the engagement.
Authorities described the military response as a defensive measure intended to safeguard Pakistan’s territorial integrity and preempt any potential threats arising from cross-border hostilities.
While the situation remains tense, security forces are said to be on high alert and fully prepared to respond to any further aggression.
Officials added that developments in the border belt are being closely monitored to prevent escalation and maintain stability in the region.
Guns fall silent in Landi Kotal
With guns falling silent on the border, authorities are busy ascertaining any damage caused by last night’s artillery firing from the Afghan side.
Residents in Landi Kotal said they spent a sleepless night due to the continuous noise of heavy gunfire, which caused panic among the civilians located in the area.
Residents in Landi Kotal also held a demonstration against what they called the unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side, calling for an early ceasefire.</p><small>2026-02-27 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271107152f04bf6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976109/market-edges-up-in-midday-trading-after-morning-drop-of-over-1000-points' target='_blank'><strong>Market edges up in midday trading after morning drop of over 1,000 points</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark KSE-100 index recovered modestly by 11:55am on Friday, rising 65 points from its previous close of 168,893.08 after plunging more than 1,000 points earlier in the morning session.

PESHAWAR: Pakistan’s sec­urity forces swung into action after Afghan Taliban fighters launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries under the cover of darkness, the government said on Thursday night.
However, they received “an immediate and effective response” from Pakistan’s security forces, the information ministry said in a statement.
The action — dubbed ‘Ope­ration Ghazab Lil Haq’ — continued into the early hours of Friday, and by state media reports suggested the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had joined the response, targeting Afghan positions, including an ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, inflicting substantial damage.
However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press.
Authorities in Kabul had claimed launching a large-scale offensive, calling it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend.
Islamabad squarely blames Kabul for allowing terrorists aligned with the outlawed TTP and so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) groups to use its soil as a safe haven.
Earlier, in its weekly briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office had said that the strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan were carried out to pre-empt imminent attacks inside Pakistan, and that utmost caution was exercised to avoid civilian casualties.
‘Heavy casualties inflicted’
According to the information ministry, Pakistani forces had inflicted heavy losses on the Afghan Taliban in the Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur sectors.
According to security sources, Afghan Taliban fired at various places on the Pak-Afghan border. A counter-attack saw their positions destroyed, forcing the Afghan fighters to flee, they said.
Giving details, sources said that Afghan positions across the border from the Chitral and Bajaur sectors were destroyed, while forces responded with full force to excursions in the Nawagai sector of Bajaur, Tirah in Khyber, Mohmand district and the Arandu sector of Chitral.

In a late night tweet, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar said that at least 36 Afghan Taliban attackers had been killed by Pakistani forces. However, subsequent reports by state-run Pakistan Television put the toll at 58.
In a post on X, PTV News said over 100 Taliban fighters had been injured, at least 12 Afghan posts had been completely destroyed, while five of their positions had been captured Mr Tarar also said that two Pakistan Army personnel had been martyred, while three were injured, in the line of duty.







He accused the Taliban regime of launching attacks in Pakistan’s border regions in defence of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) outlaws, adding that Kabul’s patronage of terrorists had been laid bare for the world to see.
The information minister also refuted claims by Afghan and Indian media of killing or capturing dozens of Pakistani soldiers, asserting that the Taliban regime had resorted to “propaganda and lies to cover up its embarrassment”.
Ground reports
According to reports from areas along the border, Afghan fighters initiated hostilities around Iftar time near Torkham and Landi Kotal.
Local sources said that artillery shells were fired from the Afghan side, at least two of which fell in open areas, causing no damage to life or property.
In addition, Afghan families cleared by the authorities to return to their country — who were waiting at Zero Point for their departure — had been sent back to the Landi Kotal holding center as the security situation deteriorated at the border crossing point.
The Torkham border has been closed since October 12 last year due to the diplomatic row between the two countries.
Afghan shelling in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resulted in injuries to five people, including three women. The injured were being treated at DHQ Khar.
State-run Pakistan TV also carried visuals from a mosque that was damaged after being targeted by Afghan fire.



Witnesses in Mohmand also reported also reported intense fighting, but there was no word on casualties from the area.
An exchange of fire was also reported from Kurram and the Angoor Adda border area.
No quarrel with ordinary Afghans: FO
Earlier, at his weekly media briefing, FO spokesman Tahir Andrabi said that Pakistan’s actions over the weekend “were proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence”.
Military officials said the operation destroyed seven terrorist targets and killed between 70 and 80 terrorists. Afghan authorities, however, had alleged civilian casualties and condemned the strikes as a violation of their sovereignty.
Responding to questions about civilian harm, Mr Andrabi said the “intelligence-based selective targeting” of these seven terrorist camps and hideouts, located in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, were “primarily to ensure safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions,” he said.
Addressing bilateral tensions, he said Pakistan’s dispute was not with the Afghan people.
“In terms of people-to-people relations, we have nothing against the people of Afghanistan. The contentious issue is the terrorist outfits that operate in Afghanistan, and the official support and impunity being offered to that terrorism.
“As regards the people of Afghanistan, we respect them, and we have traditional historic linguistic ties with them. We do not wish any harm to the Afghan people,” he said.

He acquired the moniker ‘Butcher of Gujrat’ for presiding over anti-Muslim pogroms as chief minister in 2002. By undertaking a highly choreographed official visit to Tel Aviv, Modi is both rubber-stamping the Netanyahu regime’s genocidal assaults on Gaza and cementing the alliance between the fanatical creeds of Hindutva and Zionism.
The Christian Right has already upended ‘normal’ politics in the US by projecting a millenarian vision of the world that can only be achieved by totalitarian and violent means. Trumpism is now an entrenched, grassroots phenomenon that will very likely outlive Donald Trump. Meanwhile, various shades of both secular and religious right are running riot across Europe, with fearmongering about cultural invasions by the proverbial immigrant.
Despite their best pretensions, Muslim countries do not buck the trend. Reac­tio­n­a­­ry politics and repressive state nationalism are the order of the day across large swathes of the Arab world, Southwest Asia and the world’s largest Muslim state, Indonesia. The current hybrid regime in this country presents itself as a leader of this putatively coherent bloc of countries.
Some believe that this notional ‘Muslim’ bloc, along with other constituent parts of the ‘Global South’, can become a bulwark against US imperialism, Zionism and Hin­dutva. An ostensibly pro-people group of countries can now even rely on a superpower, China, to both resist the US-Israel-India axis and even usher the world towards a new tomorrow.

Reactionary politics and repressive state nationalism dominate.

The hypothesis is backed up by reference to some recent developments. Most notable was Pakistan’s successful deployment of Chinese-made aircraft to down India’s French-made fleet (and its armoury of Israeli drones). The subsequent defence agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as the former’s growing export of arms more generally, is also present as evidence of a burgeoning security alliance to resist Zionist aggression. There is even an argument that Iran has, as yet, not suffered a major assault because the ‘Muslim’ bloc, China and other countries have stood firm in its defence.
The fundamental problem with this hy­­pothesis is that there are just as many, if not more, examples that disprove it. To begin with, the notional bloc is united in its desire to win the good graces of the Trump White House. The calamitous ‘Board of Peace’ is just the tip of the iceberg. Military contr­a­cts and cooperation between Muslim countries and the US are old news. Pakistan’s mi­­litarised ruling class, like many of its ‘Mus­­lim brethren’, is inking all sorts of minerals, crypto and other deals with the US. The Gulf states do big business with India, not to mention happily call it a strategic par­­tner. The UAE even boasts annual bilateral trade with Israel in excess of $3 billion.

 

On the other end of the planet, Venezuela and Cuba are amongst the few states in our world that clearly articulate an anti-imperialist policy. How many countries stood up for Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro when he was kidnapped by US commandos in broad daylight? He still languishes in a New York jail.
Then there is Cuba, which, for those who do not remember, sent a team of its inimitable doctors to lead the relief effort after the massive 2005 earthquake in Azad Kashmir. Subsequently, hundreds of Pakistani students have received Cuban government scholarships to study medicine in Havana. Cuba today is literally being strangulated by a vicious US oil embargo. How many of the world’s countries are demanding a lifting of both the oil blockade and other long-running economic sanctions?
Global geopolitical change is happening. At the bro­a­dest level of ana­­­ly­-sis, we are living thr­­­­ough an age of intense reaction, the Hindutva-Zio­n­ist-Christian Right nexus amongst the most prominent em­­-bodiments of this global moment. But Pakistan, other Muslim countries and, frankly, most of the world’s states, are anything but bastions of anti-imperialism. The religious right remains highly influential here too — the Afghan Taliban fiasco yet again proves the disastrous consequences of state patronage for militant Islamism.
More generally, money talks; ruling classes everywhere are increasingly using state nationalism as a ruse to camouflage the universal pretensions of capital, including the immense contradictions generated by neoliberal globalisation.
The only silver lining is the many Indians who oppose Modi; the many Americans who oppose Trump; and the brave few within the Zionist entity who stand for Palestinian liberation.
Progressive segments continue to resist state and class power in Pakistan too. It is these pro-people elements, across nation-state boundaries, that counter reactionaries in their own midst. This is why we can continue to hope.

The actual yearly output of extracted minerals and their contribution to our GDP, however, seldom surfaces in the news as there’s nothing out of the ordinary in that data. The share of the mining and quarrying sector has stayed mostly between two to three per cent of GDP for the last 25 years. The latest reported share was 2.1pc of GDP at current prices in FY25. This share translates into $8.6 billion of a GDP of $407bn. The sector has declined continuously for the last four years. This, of course, does not rule out potential future spurts in mineral output, however unlikely it may be at this point, judging by past headlines and ensuing developments.
How does Pakistan compare with other countries in terms of actual mineral extraction? Let us explore this by browsing through the treasure trove contained in World Mining Data, 2025, (ministry of finance, Austria). This source provides mining data for 166 countries, including Pakistan, for the year 2023. WMD measured the total world mineral output at $5.5 trillion, of which Pakistan’s share stood at $8.3bn. While minuscule compared to the world total, Pakistan’s rank was 51 out of 166 countries in 2023. Compare this to Pakistan’s rank of 168 out of 193 countries in the 2023 Human Development Index. This comparison tells us that our mineral resources are way more developed than our human resources! This, of course, is an unfair comparison, but it brings out the underdevelopment of both our mineral and human resource sectors, as well as the lopsided priorities of our development planning. Nevertheless, we can say that Pakistan is not faring badly in mineral extraction. There seems to be much potential in expanding this output and undertaking new explorations pertaining to existing minerals as well as new prized minerals such as rare earth elements.

 

WMD revealed another interesting fact: the bulk of the value of extracted output comes from mineral fuels (petroleum, gas, coal and uranium) which were valued at $6.8bn, or 82pc of the total extracted value in 2023. Pakistan ranked relatively higher at 40 out of 166 countries in mineral fuels, demonstrating that it is not a resource-poor country in this category. Only 15 countries extracted uranium in 2023; Pakistan, extracting 53 tons of uranium, was one of them. Interestingly, the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, which published the extracted amounts of 21 principal minerals, did not include uranium in its list. The US produced only 23 tons of uranium, just about half Pakistan’s amount, according to WMD. Pakistan ranked 13 in world uranium production. Kazakhstan ranked the highest with some 25,000 tons. India produced 708 tons. As uranium is used in running nuclear reactors to produce green and low-cost electricity, the importance of its exploration in Pakistan cannot be overemphasised.

How does Pakistan compare with other countries in terms of actual mineral extraction?

WMD classified minerals into five broad categories: iron and ferro-alloy metals, non-ferrous metals, precious metals, industrial minerals and mineral fuels. As Pakistan did not extract precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, etc.), its relatively higher global ranking is more surprising. It seems that our well-endowed mineral bounties are waiting for optimal utilisation, which can strengthen and retain our human resources that are being pushed out of Pakistan in significant numbers. Pakistan’s rank in terms of the value of iron and ferro-alloy metals was 37 in 2023 — far better than Saudi Arabia’s ranking of 63. Readers of WMD can glean enough information from its contents to realise that we are not poor in natural resources. The fact that our human resources are of mediocre quality has everything to do with our political and economic policies. Despite being one of the 37 countries that extracted iron ore, Pakistan has not produced any pig iron in the last nine years because of the closure of the Pakistan Steel Mills, which smelted iron ore in its ballast furnace to make iron. It’s ironic that Pakistan produces steel by importing scrap, which means spending precious foreign exchange. Iron ore is exported, while a few local mills smelt the scrap taking advantage of the closure of PSM whose revival would raise the level of competition to an uncomfortable level.
In the extraction of non-ferrous metals (rare earth minerals belong to this category), Pakistan ranked 58 with a value of $271 million in 2023. This value may increase manifold when the mining of rare earth elements, driven by foreign investment, gets underway in earnest and the extracted material is exported. In 2023, only 11 countries mined rare earths. China, at 66.2pc, topped global rare earth production, followed by Myanmar with a 14.8pc share. The US ranked third with a share of 10.8pc, followed by Australia, Madagascar, India, Russia and five other countries. Even though the number of rare earth producers is very small, not all are economically developed. This shows that rare earth extraction does not necessarily lead to prosperity. As in the case of iron ore, bauxite — a non-ferrous metal — is also exported, when it could have been used to produce aluminium. Globally, Pakistan ranked 26th in bauxite mining in 2023. Aluminium is indeed produced in our country but relies on the import of aluminium scrap or recycling domestic scrap. The good thing is the environment-friendly aspect of our aluminium and iron industries.
In terms of industrial minerals, Pakistan ranked 28th globally in 2023 with a value of $605m. Our rank in mining baryte was 11, feldspar 15, fluorspar 16, gypsum 19, and rock salt 17. Our rank in rock salt could have been higher as Pakistan holds the second largest deposits of rock salt in the world. Obviously, the global demand for sacks of crude rock salt is limited and we hardly produce any quality value-added rock salt products. While the mining sector has exciting potential for our country and can progress a lot with foreign investment, the path to development lies in our human resource development.

Moreover, keeping in mind the growing footprint of IS-K locally, it is all the more necessary to neutralise this terrorist group before it can cause further havoc.
A meeting of federal and provincial officials, including senior police officers, on Wednesday decided to confront the wave of terrorism as a “top priority”, with the centre assuring the provinces of provision of resources and technical support. The minister of state for interior, who chaired the meeting, told this paper that the bases of terrorist groups responsible for bloodshed in Pakistan — including the Islamabad imambargah attack — were targeted in Afghanistan, and separately commented that retaliatory attacks were expected after Pakistan took military action. Afghanistan’s unprovoked firing at Pakistani positions on Thursday has confirmed these apprehensions.
Just as the nation came together in the past in the aftermath of the APS tragedy to formulate the National Action Plan, a similar effort is required today to confront the menace of terrorism. Working in silos is not an option; all pillars of the state must work in tandem to defeat terrorism. In this regard, while political differences can exist between the centre and the provincial governments, all stakeholders need to be on the same page to ensure maximum security for all.

 

The framework exists for a robust counterterrorism drive, such as NAP 2.0 as well as Nacta and the creation of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre last year. Just as Pakistan was able to quell the wave of terrorist violence during previous years, it can do so again if holistic policies are pursued, with buy-in from all. The state cannot control what occurs beyond its borders; but internal security can certainly be better managed by cracking down on terrorists and their facilitators.
In this regard, it has emerged that IS-K may prove to be a bigger security threat than the banned TTP — the latter group being at the forefront of the current wave of violence. As reported in this paper, following the Islamabad imambargah attack the mastermind of the atrocity was traced to Nowshera in KP. Subsequent investigations revealed that the suspect was leading an active IS-K cell in Bajaur.
This gang had reportedly been responsible for several targeted killings and suicide bombings, while women were also active members of the cell. One of the women members had reportedly delivered the suicide vest to the capital for the Islamabad bombing. Further probes are required to break any connected cells, with thorough action against IS-K terrorists within the country.

“Taken together, Israel’s actions appear aimed at making a permanent demographic change in Gaza and the West Bank, raising concerns about ethnic cleansing”, Turk said in a speech before the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Turk pointed in particular to an ongoing, year-long Israeli military operation in the West Bank’s north that has caused the displacement of 32,000 Palestinians. Elsewhere in the West Bank, entire Bedouin herder communities have been displaced by increasing harassment and violence from Israeli settlers, including near Mikhmas to the east of Ramallah, and Ras Ein al-Auja, in the Jordan Valley, since the start of the year.
In addition to roughly three million Palestinians, more than 500,000 Israelis live in settlements and outposts in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law.

Far-right minister Smotrich vows to encourage ‘emigration’ from Palestinian territories

Israel has approved a series of initiatives this month backed by far-right ministers, including launching a process to register land in the West Bank as “state property” and allowing Israelis to purchase land there directly, in a move condemned by several countries as well as Hamas.
Israel’s current government has accelerated settlement expansion, approving a record 54 settlements in 2025, according to Israeli settlement watchdog NGO Peace Now.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967.
‘Maximum land, minimum Arabs’
In the Gaza Strip, most of the territory’s 2.2 million inhabitants have been displaced at least once since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza”, the UN human rights office said in a report last week.
Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories in February.
“We will finally, formally and in practical terms nullify the cursed Oslo Accords and embark on a path toward sovereignty, while encouraging emigration from both Gaza and Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank.
“There is no other long-term solution,” added Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank.
“They want maximum land and minimum Arabs”, Fathi Nimer, a researcher with Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said, referring to a commonly used phrase used to describe Israeli settlement tactics.

The Taliban has restricted women’s movements and barred girls from education beyond primary school since coming to power in 2021, via a series of morality laws that also limit expression and employment.
Turk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said a decree signed by Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada last month “defines several crimes and punishments that contravene Afghanistan’s international legal obligations”.
“It provides for the use of corporal punishment for numerous offences, including in the home, legitimising violence against women and children,” he told a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva.

Germany deports 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan

“The decree, which is expected to come into effect soon, extends the number of offences that carry the death penalty.”
The decree also criminalises criticism of the de facto leadership and its policies, in violation of freedom of expression and assembly, he said.
Detailed provisions of the decree have not been officially published by the Taliban’s Ministry of Justice or Supreme Court, and this news agency has not been able to obtain the text from officials.
Turk urged the Taliban to rescind the decree, impose a moratorium on executions and end corporal punishment, saying women and girls face persecution under a system he likened to gender apartheid. The Taliban says women’s rights are internal matters and should be addressed locally.
Afghans deported
Germany on Thursday deported 20 convicted criminals to Afghanistan under a new agreement reached with the Taliban government to allow direct expulsions, the interior ministry said.
Berlin had already resumed deporting criminals to Afghanistan in 2024, using Qatar as an intermediary. But the agreement reached to enable Thursday’s flight “creates a reliable basis for direct and permanent deportations to Afghanistan”, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said.
Those deported were men who had committed crimes in Germany, including sexual offences, bodily harm and drug offences, according to the interior ministry. “Our society has an interest in ensuring that criminals leave our country. That is why we are acting consistently and expanding deportations step by step,” Dobrindt said. Germany stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. But it resumed them as part of efforts to take a tougher line on migration to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Two deportation flights of convicted Afghans have left Germany since 2021: 28 were returned in autumn 2024 and 81 in July last year. Germany’s interior ministry had announced last year that direct discussions were taking place with the Taliban authorities. But the talks are controversial because Berlin does not recognise the Taliban administration in Kabul.

They also testified that no announcement was made about the fire to alert the people present in the shopping centre as the fire engulfed it. One of the survivors also pointed out that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exit points of the building were closed.
The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court was tasked with probing the devastating blaze and fixing responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the tragic incident.
Ali Haider turned up and deposed that he was working as a salesman at a luggage shop on the ground floor of Gul Plaza, and his workplace was located near a gate opening towards the M.A. Jinnah Road.

Wonder why no fire alarm sounded, most exit points were found closed

He stated that he was about to close the shop on Jan 17 at around 10:15pm and suddenly noticed smoke on the floor and thus, he left the shop and saw a fire erupting on the mezzanine floor.
The witness also said that he came back to his shop at around 10:30pm to check if things were normal there, as thick smoke was rapidly spreading across the floor. His shop also caught fire in the next 10 minutes, since the luggage / items in it were flammable.
Therefore, he further testified, he fell unconscious after two fibre luggage pieces burst close to him, and upon regaining consciousness, he found himself in a hospital.
Mr Haider, in his statement, maintained that apart from one or two gates, the rest of the exits were closed, and he had not noticed any fire tenders or rescue agencies on the site before falling unconscious.
“It is further added that until the time of my falling conscious, there was no announcement of the fire made, nor did any person come to rescue the trapped people inside the building, either from the management side or from any government agency,” his testimony concluded.
Mohammad Junaid deposed that he had been working at a crockery shop on the mezzanine floor of the plaza for the last four years, and they were moving out after closing the shop at 10:15pm.
However, the owner of the shop suddenly realised that he had forgotten his cellphone inside the shop, and at the same time they noticed thick smoke spreading in the building and thereafter they realised severity of the smoke and fire, he added.
The witness also testified that he, along with two other persons who had worked in the same market / floor, attempted to escape at around 11:15pm and somehow managed to come out of the burning building through a bathroom’s side exit at around 11:30pm as there were no passages visible due to thick smoke.
Therefore, he further said, an Edhi ambulance had shifted him to a hospital due to chest congestion and suffocation caused by the smoke.
Mr Junaid deposed that no announcement was made about the fire until their evacuation, and nobody came to rescue the stranded people inside the building, either from the building’s management side or any government agency.
Around 80 people had lost their lives in the deadly inferno which erupted on the night of Jan 17 and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished. The fire left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some of its sections collapsed.

ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday highlighted structural fiscal challenges being faced by the federal government and called for comprehensive and forward-looking reforms in the Natio­nal Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
Speaking at the concluding session of the Pakistan Governance Forum, the minister, however, clarified that the constitutional vertical distribution of resources between the federation and provinces was not under review.
Mr Iqbal noted that from approximately Rs14 trillion in federal tax revenue and Rs5 trillion in non-tax revenue, around Rs8.2 trillion was transferred to the provinces under the NFC Award. After these transfers, he said, the federal government retained fiscal space of approximately Rs11.07tr against total expenditures of nearly Rs17.5tr.
“Nearly 50 per cent of federal expenditure goes toward debt servicing and approximately 25pc toward defence,” he explained. “After meeting these obligations, the federation must finance pensions, salaries, running expenses, development, grants, and social protection largely through borrowing. This equation is not sustainable.”
He further noted that despite social welfare being a provincial subject following the 18th Amendment, the federal government continued to fund major national social protection initiatives, such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), currently costing approximately Rs716bn. Additionally, he said, the federation bears financial responsibilities for Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
Turning to the NFC formula, the minister said with 82pc weightage assigned to population, there was little fiscal incentive for provinces to pursue population stabilisation.
“Similarly, with 10pc weightage link­­ed to poverty, provinces may inadvertently benefit from remaining poor rather than being rewarded for reducing poverty,” he said, proposing recalibrating the formula to incentivise poverty reduction, human development improvements, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, and population stabilisation.
Call for ‘true partnership’
Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who participated in the event via video link from Lahore, presented a comprehensive analysis of the objectives, challenges and current fiscal realities of the NFC Award while emphasising the need to protect the rights of smaller provinces.
She said the NFC should operate as a true partnership between the federal government and the provinces ensuring transparency, fairness and cooperation in all fiscal matters.
She noted that any future NFC framework must begin with a realistic assessment of national debt servicing obligations, defence financing requirements, climate vulnerability and water security challenges, which collectively place significant pressure on the federation’s fiscal space.
Ms Aurangzeb highlighted that expanding the tax base, improving the tax-to-GDP ratio, encouraging provincial revenue generation and promoting economic growth were essential to ensuring long-term fiscal stability.

The figure was down on 2024 when almost 9,200 deaths were recorded, but the International Organi­sation for Migration (IOM) said numbers nonetheless reflected the “global scale” of the crisis faced by migrants.
“The continued loss of life on migration routes is a global failure we cannot accept as normal,” said IOM Director General Amy Pope. She argued for safer legal routes, adding: “These deaths are not inevitable.”
Funding cuts for aid groups, crackdowns on humanitarian NGOs and limited access to data are making it more difficult to accurately track deaths, the UN agency said.
Sea crossings such as the perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe remain among the deadliest routes for migrants, the report said.
At least 2,108 people went missing while trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2025, and another 1,047 died or vanished while trying to cross to Spain’s Canary Islands, according to the IOM. The actual figures are “likely higher”, it said.
The first two months of 2026 have already seen “an unprecedented number of migrant deaths” in the Mediterranean, the agency warned, with
606 people recorded dead on the crossing as of Tuesday — even as arrivals in Italy decline sharply.

• Children gathered at a tribal elder’s house to receive yoghurt after breaking their fast
• President Zardari extends condolences to victims’ families
QUETTA: Seven children aged between 8 and 14 years were killed and 22 others, including women and children, were injured when a gas cylinder exploded in a house in Chaman, a town on the Pak-Afghan border, on Thursday.
Officials said the tragic incident occurred in Killi Mahmoodabad, a locality on the outskirts of the district headquarters, Chaman.
According to police officials, children from neighbouring houses had gathered at the house of one of a tribal elder to receive yoghurt to eat after breaking their fast. Meanwhile, a powerful explosion occurred in the kitchen, rocking the border town. The blast blew off the roof of the kitchen and damaged other rooms of the house. The children waiting for yoghurt were buried under the debris.
Rescue teams, along with police, rushed to the site and launched a rescue operation. “Seven children were found dead when the debris was removed,” police said, adding that 22 injured persons, including four women and 18 children, were shifted to the Civil Hospital Chaman.
“We had received seven bodies of children and 22 injured at the Civil Hospital Chaman,” Dr Owais, Medical Superintendent of the hospital, confirmed. He added that the injured included four women and 18 children.
Police said the intensity of the blast completely destroyed the kitchen and badly damaged other rooms of the house. “The children lost their lives after being buried under the debris, while the injured were also trapped beneath the rubble,” officials said, adding that the women injured in the blast were cooking food when the gas cylinder exploded.
Four women and six children who sustained serious injuries were later shifted to the Civil Hosp­ital Quetta for further treatment.
The district administration expressed deep sorrow and grief over the incident, extended condolences to the families of the deceased children, and ordered an investigation to determine the cause of the explosion.
Authorities have urged citizens to take precautionary measures while using domestic gas cylinders to prevent such tragic incidents in the future.
Meanwhile, in a statement, Pre­sident Asif Ali Zardari extended his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, particularly those who lost their children in the blast. “I share the grief of the families who have lost their loved ones, and my thoughts are with them during this difficult time,” he said.
“May the departed souls rest in peace, and may the bereaved families be granted patience and strength,” he added. The president also prayed for the speedy recovery of those injured in the incident.

“This is not an additional cost. You were given a lower tariff. You enjoyed Rs15bn in free working capital for 90 days. Now cost recovery is being done through the FCA,” said Rehan Akhtar, representing the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division, at a public hearing at the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
He was responding to a tirade by representatives of the business community from Karachi and Lahore — Rehan Javed, Tanveer Barry and Aamir Sheikh — who said the prime minister’s Rs4.04 per unit tariff reduction had been partly offset by a Rs1.78 per unit higher FCA for electricity consumed in January and recovered in March. They said the tariff rebasing from a fiscal year to a calendar year had been introduced as a facility for consumers but was resulting in higher FCAs because of a lower base rate.
Mr Javed said the FY26 reference fuel cost for January would have resulted in only 54 paise per unit in additional FCA instead of Rs1.78 per unit if the base tariff had not been shifted to the calendar year starting Jan 1, thereby imposing an additional Rs1.24 per unit burden. He feared the trend would be disastrous in June for all consumers.

Industrialists claim tariff relief has eroded; govt insists Rs15bn ‘free’ working capital is being recovered

Mr Akhtar said there was no change in the cost of power supply in either case. The lower reference fuel cost meant consumers were charged a lower electricity rate in January, and its actual cost would be recovered in March. A higher reference rate for January would have allowed distribution companies (Discos) to charge a higher fuel cost in January, retain Rs15bn for the following two months and then adjust it in March bills.
He said that, subject to Nepra’s approval, the new Rs1.78 per unit FCA in March would replace the existing 28 paise per unit FCA in February, resulting in a net additional FCA of Rs1.50 per unit. This would lead to a Rs2.55 per unit negative adjustment in the quarterly tariff after two months.
Mr Akhtar also explained that 46 per cent of industrial consumers and 35pc of agricultural consumers had availed themselves of a cheaper incremental package, which resulted in 14.4pc (11 million units) demand growth. As a few cheaper power plants — including nuclear, LNG and coal-based plants — were on forced outage for technical reasons, relatively more expensive plants, including furnace oil-based ones, were utilised to meet demand, leading to a higher FCA.
The CPPA reported that electricity consumption was 14.4pc higher than the pre-approved reference, around 12pc higher than the same month last year, and 8pc higher than December 2025.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Consti­tutional Court (FCC) ruled on Thursday that tax authorities can conduct raids and searches of taxpayers’ premises under Section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) 2001, even in the absence of any pending proceedings against them.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a three-judge FCC bench rejected a plea moved by M/s Sceptre Pvt Ltd against a Dec 24, 2025, Sindh High Court decision that had validated a tax raid on the petitioner’s premises.
The petitioner had challenged the raid conducted by tax authorities under Section 175. It said the section should be applied in case of ongoing proceedings, adding that a notice under Section 176, requiring certain documents and information, could not form the basis for a raid.
Authored by Justice Farooq, the judgement explained that Section 175 empowered the tax commissioner to act for the enforcement of any provision of the ordinance.
The words used by parliamentarians under the law are “enfo­rcement”, and “enforcement” requires “breach”. When a law is breached, then it is “enforced”. If the statute had used the word “implement”, then the situation would have been different, the judgement said.
Thus, the examination of Section 175 shows that the words used were very cle­ar and simple, that this pro­­vision can be invoked for the enforcement of any provision of the law, the ju­­dgement emphasised, ad­­­ding that the SHC had correctly rejected the petiti­oner’s plea on the grou­nds of the precedent set in the earlier Agha Steels case.
Although the bench does not agree with the view expressed in the Agha Steels case, the petition is nevertheless liable to be dismissed, Justice Farooq observed.
Even if the requireme­nts laid down in the previous case were not strictly followed, the mere fact rem­ained that the tax commissioner — or an authorised officer — was empowered to act for the enforcement of the law under Section 175, he added.
In view of the referred provision of law and the factual aspects of the matter, the impugned judgment does not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference, Justice Farooq observed.
The cardinal rule of the construction of acts of parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention expressed in the acts themselves, Jus­tice Farooq said, adding that the rationale for beg­i­nning with the ordinary and natural meaning of the statutory language was that legislation was often drafted to address specific situations in clear and straightforward terms.
In such instances, the words used are precise and are not intended to extend beyond their plain scope or to be expanded into bro­a­der contexts, he added.
Since the primary obje­c­tive of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the lawmaker, the most appropriate and reliable method is to commence with the ordinary and clear meaning of the words used, as per the judgement.
“If the legislature says that a deed shall be ‘null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever’, how can a court of equity say that in certain circumstances it shall be valid?” Justice Farooq observed.
The principle emerging from that dictum is clear: where the language of the legislature is express and unequivocal, the courts are not at liberty to qualify, di­­lute, or contradict it, he said.
Applying the same reasoning to the present case, when parliament has exp­ressly provided that “in or­­­­der to enforce any provision of the law, the commissioner or any authori­sed officer will at all times and without prior notice, have full and free access, including real-time electronic access to any premises, place, accounts, documents or computer”.
How can a court of law then read into the statutory provision to say that a proceeding must be pending before Section 175(1)(a) of the law to trigger the raid. The answer is that it cannot. Courts must be restrained from granting relief in a manner that runs contrary to clear and express statutory provisions, the judgement said.

MANSEHRA/ISLAM­ABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday vowed that the government would go to any extent to eradicate terrorism from the country and those involved in militancy would not go unpunished.
During his visit to the residence of Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz in Mansehra to offer condolences, the PM assured the officer’s family of the government and the Pakistan Army’s full support.
“We, the federal government and the Pakistan Army, are with you and will never leave you alone, as Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz Tanoli is our pride and embraced martyrdom while gallantly commanding forces against the country’s enemies,” he assured the family members.
The PM said that Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz laid down his life while safeguarding the country, setting an example of bravery and courage. “The entire nation and I are proud of our martyrs and their families and would never forget the sacrifices they rendered for our motherland,” PM Shehbaz added.
He also announced the establishment of a Daanish school named after the slain officer to commemorate his martyrdom. He also visited the grave of the fallen officer to offer Fateha.
On Feb 21, Lt Col Gul Faraz and sepoy Karamat Shah were martyred in the suicide bombing during an intelligence-based operation in Bannu district, the Inter-Services Public Relations had said.
Ramazan package
The PM formally launched the Rs38 billion Ramazan package to provide financial support to deserving families across the country. While chairing a meeting on the Ramazan Relief Package, PM Shehbaz termed the assistance package “the largest and most comprehensive”, saying that the amount per household had been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000.
According to the premier, the disbursement will follow a “transparent digital system successfully used last year”. Cash assistance is being delivered directly to beneficiaries through digital wallets, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and respect for recipients’ dignity by eliminating long queues, he added.
The PM was briefed that 64 per cent of the eligible individuals had received financial assistance eight days into Ramazan, while the verification and distribution of money to the remaining beneficiaries had been underway.
The briefing also noted that 12 banks and fintech companies were partnering with the government for distribution, and the beneficiaries had completed 1.1 million digital transactions and over 1.227 million automated calls had been made to inform people about the assistance package.
The prime minister praised the performance of departments involved in the disbursement of the package, saying that the digital wallet system provided a convenient and transparent means of reaching beneficiaries.

India posted a mammoth 256-4 and then restricted Zimbabwe to 184-6 in Chennai to make their clash with West Indies in Kolkata on Sunday a winner-takes-all decider for the last semi-final berth.
South Africa hammered the West Indies by nine wickets earlier in Ahmedabad.
At Chennai’s MA Chidambaram stadium, opener Abhishek Sharma blasted 55 and Hardik Pandya an unbeaten 50 as India piled up the second highest total in the history of the tournament after being invited to bat first.
“I think we wanted to leave everything behind. We didn’t think too much about what we did in the league stage or in the last game in Ahmedabad,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav.
“With contributions from the top order right down to number seven, I think there was hardly anything missing in our performance.
He said they had not thought about what is now a knockout match against the West Indies on Sunday.
“Once we reach Kolkata, we’ll sit down and plan properly for that game,” Suryakumar said.
“For now, it’s about taking a day off, travelling, and relaxing.”
Zimbabwe, who stunned Australia and Sri Lanka to reach the Super Eights, were never in the chase despite a brisk start as the asking rate kept rising.
Opener Brian Bennett was not out 97, the highest individual score by a Zimbabwean in T20 World Cup history, as his side exited the semi-final reckoning with a game still to play.
India’s left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh took 3-24 from his four overs.
‘Willing to improve’
“We are also a work in progress,” said Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza.
“We have a lot of youngsters, most of them are playing their first World Cup, first time ever in India for us.
“Not that I want to use that as an excuse, but certainly the lessons from the last game, from a batting point of view, I thought we took them really well.
“And you can see how quickly these boys are willing to improve and they showed up today.”
Zimbabwe’s bowlers conceded 510 runs in 40 overs in two Super Eights matches after West Indies posted 254-6 against the tournament’s surprise packages on Monday.
Raza won the toss and opted to field for the second match running, and again saw his bowlers flogged to all parts.
Left-handed Abhishek, who had struggled with three ducks in four innings in this tournament, hit four fours and four sixes to return to form.
Pandya and left-handed Tilak Varma, who hit a 16-ball 44, put on an unbeaten stand of 84 at the end, but India came up just short of the T20 World Cup record score of 260-6 made by Sri Lanka against Kenya in 2007.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson returned to the team to break the left-handed opening combination of Abhishek and Ishan Kishan and handed India a flying start.
Samson fell for 24 off Blessing Muzarabani but Abhishek kept up the charge, reaching his fifty off 26 balls in a 72-run stand with Kishan (38).
Abhishek fell to Tinotenda Maposa, caught at long-on, but his knock laid the platform for a big total. Skipper Suryakumar hit 33 off 13 balls.
Pandya finished with a flourish with two sixes off Brad Evans to get to 50 on the final ball of the innings.</p><small>2026-02-26 22:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261837090a6877b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975910/strikes-in-afghanistan-carried-out-to-ensure-safety-of-pakistani-citizens-prevent-imminent-terrorist-attacks-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Strikes in Afghanistan carried out to ensure safety of Pakistani citizens, prevent imminent terrorist attacks: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”.
FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing.
Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted.
In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”.
Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”.
“We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said.
He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad.
The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context.
He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”.
However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”.
Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”.
During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move.
The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region.
The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”.
The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan, “reinforce this conclusion”.
“These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said.
He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”.
In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”.
Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes.
“To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said.
The FO spokesperson was also asked to comment on the strengthening defence ties between India and Israel.
In response, Andrabi said, “We remain seized of the defence ties between Israel and India, including systems and platforms used by India against Pakistan. We are alive to the threat that they pose to our security and our sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the regional peace and stability.
“Pakistan remains cognisant of these threats. As regards the future threats emanating from India, let me reiterate that we have robust military preparedness to defend and deter any Indian aggression against Pakistan.”
Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack
In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.”
On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis.
Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”.
FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”.
On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”.
He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“

The decision was taken as prominent members of the alliance met at an Iftar gathering at the residence of TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar in Islamabad, and later held a meeting over the prevailing situation in the country.
The gathering was attended by National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) Sahibzada Hassan, and others.
One of the leaders who attended the meeting told Dawn on condition of anonymity that during the discussion after Iftar, Abbas shared that a “key figure from the ruling PML-N” had contacted him and offered talks.
He quoted Abbas saying that the person from the ruling party gave the assurance that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wanted to settle issues and resolve tensions between the government and the opposition.
The sources further said that the person had also assured that the PM “will never backtrack from his words if anything is decided”.
“It was then unanimously decided that the TTAP would give a positive response to any offer for talks by the government,” he said.
He also said, “We want to see if the government will once again backtrack from its words. If the government backtracks, people will judge it and will know who is serious about the future of the country.”
When Dawn contacted former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser regarding the matter, he said the TTAP had just one demand: that the government should allow incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s family to meet him and his personal physicians to examine him.
“Now it is in the hands of the government whether it wants to cool down the temperature or not,” he said.

 

Today’s development comes three days after PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah, in a Senate address, extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock.
It was not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial.
To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers.
TTAP’s warning
The TTAP also issued a statement after the gathering in Islamabad and warned that any criminal negligence with regard to the health of Imran could further aggravate the political crisis in the country.
According to a statement issued by the alliance on the social media platform X, the opposition leaders voiced their concerns during TTAP’s central committee meeting.
The statement said TTAP leaders demanded that Imran be provided immediate medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital, be examined by his personal doctors, and that restrictions on his access to his lawyers and meetings with family members be lifted forthwith.
It added that the ex-premier had been unjustly imprisoned and should be released.
The TTAP leaders also condemned the “government’s continued illegal secrecy” regarding Imran’s health and medical treatment, and reiterated the demand that he be shifted to Shifa International Hospital for specialised treatment and be examined by his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf.
“Opposition leaders expressed grave concern over the continued concealment of Imran’s medical reports and test results from his family, saying that such actions were further increasing doubts and fears about the PTI founder’s health condition,” the statement said.
“The TTAP leaders further warned that criminal negligence regarding the former prime minister’s health could push the country’s political crisis onto an even more dangerous path,” it said.
The statement reiterated that Imran Khan, who had been incarcerated in false cases, must be released, as this was the demand of the majority of the people of Pakistan.
The statement also drew attention to incarcerated SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, and demanded his release as well the release of other political prisoners, including Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry, Ali Wazir, and Mahrang Baloch.
Meanwhile, the statement also expressed serious concerns over the “alarming increase” in terrorism across the country, deteriorating ties with Afghanistan, the prospects of war in the region, the worsening economy, and growing repression and lawlessness.
Expressing deep concern over the increase in terrorist attacks across the country in recent weeks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said that the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, all political stakeholders, and the public, should formulate a concrete national strategy to address the issue.
The statement further urged the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to “avoid further confrontation and to initiate concrete, sincere, and meaningful negotiations to seriously address the problem of terrorism”.
“They also demanded that contacts be made with neighbouring countries and friendly governments such as Saudi Arabia and Türkiye to find a solution to the crisis that would save Pakistan and the entire region from further bloodshed and sabotage by external and hostile forces,” it added.
During the meeting, TTAP also expressed concern over the worsening economic conditions caused and drew attention to recently released figures showing that poverty in the country had risen to 29pc and unemployment has reached a 21-year high, the statement said.
“Contrary to the government’s claims of major economic agreements, both foreign and domestic investment have declined sharply,” it said.
“The exit of hundreds of major multinational companies from the Pakistani market in recent months was evidence of the country’s deteriorating risk profile,” it said.
The statement said that the government had no concrete plan to deal with the economic crisis.
It added that opposition leaders in the coming months would present an alternative budget and a series of economic and policy proposals with the help of experts, offering concrete solutions to the economic and legal crises facing the country.
The statement also cautioned against threats of a US attack on Iran and termed any such move as a cause of devastation for the region.
“The government should play a diplomatic role to prevent any such American action,” it said. It stated that US and Israel were attempting to encircle Iran and destroy and divide it through military attacks.
“At this moment, Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran is the need of the hour in order to protect Pakistan and the region from the destructive consequences of Zionist aggression.”
The TTAP leaders also condemned the current government’s joining of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
“Board of Peace is an attempt by the US to establish a non-representative alternative to the United Nations, and the exclusion of Palestinians from the board exposes the sinister intentions behind the plan … something Pakistan must not be part of under any circumstances,” they said.</p><small>2026-02-26 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261620494256e93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975898/it-secretary-denies-reports-about-shutdown-of-internet-firewall-ahead-of-5g-spectrum-auction' target='_blank'><strong>IT secretary denies reports about shutdown of internet ‘firewall’ ahead of 5G spectrum auction</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology on Thursday was informed that reports about the shutdown of the so-called internet firewall ahead of the 5G spectrum auction were incorrect.
At the outset of the meeting, Syed Aminul Haque, the committee chairman, noted that there were reports regarding the firewall. Meanwhile, Sadiq Memon called for a briefing on this system and its utility for the nation. He also enquired about the difference between an internet firewall and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s Web Monitoring System (WMS).
Information Technology Secretary Zarar Hashim Khan denied that any such system had been dismantled.
“The PTA’s WMS is fully operational,” Khan said, adding that neither a firewall nor the WMS had caused any delay in internet services.
After the initial briefing by the IT secretary, the floor was given to PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, who clarified that the word firewall was a colloqial term for the WMS, adding that it had been in place in Pakistan since 2006.
“This system has been upgraded four times, with the most recent upgrade carried out in 2023,” he said. The PTA chairman said that like firewalls, the WMS was meant to provide security for digital connectivity in the country.
He informed the committee that the WMS was installed to eradicate grey traffic in telephony, block social media platforms, and illegal websites within the country’s jurisdiction.
“Our digital borders must also be protected,” the PTA chairman said, adding that cyberattacks originating from India were thwarted during periods of heightened tension between the two countries.
“However, social media platforms are blocked on the directives by the government or under court orders,” he asserted.
Rehman further informed the committee that social media platforms had been blocked seven times so far on orders either from the government and or the court.
“But this does not mean that the internet speeds experience a slowdown or anything else happens due to the WMS,” he added.
The committee was told that regulatory mechanisms were in place to safeguard the national cyber infrastructure while ensuring continuity of telecom services, particularly ahead of the upcoming 5G rollout.
The committee was also briefed on preparations regarding the upcoming 5G spectrum scheduled for March 10. It was also told that all three telecom operators in the country — Jazz, Ufone and Zong — had expressed the will to participate.
The PTA chairman said that in the past 12 years, a total of four spectrum auctions had been held and the government had released 69 megahertz (MHz). He said that in the upcoming auction, 597 MHz was being offered and each participant had to obtain a minimum of 100 MHz each.
He added that the availability of more spectrum would not only help introduce 5G in Pakistan but also help improve and increase 4G coverage across the country.
Meanwhile, a senior official of the IT ministry told Dawn that the WMS was not designed to block any particular social media account and referred to the X account of PTI founder Imran Khan, highlighting that it continued to operate while the ex-premier was in prison.
“If the WMS could stop individual accounts, why did the government wait so long and finally approach the X management to block this account?” the official asked.
The development comes amid reports and speculation on social media regarding the government’s decision to shut down the so-called firewall ahead of the 5G spectrum auction.
In August 2024, after months of speculation about the installation of a so-called firewall that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed that the government was indeed upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.
Despite the rather ambiguous terminology used by Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja, this was the first time an official had acknowledged the government’s actions, which were blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data.
Up until then, official stakeholders — Khawaja’s ministry and the PTA — had either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.</p><small>2026-02-26 16:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26203729fa8fed9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975912/security-forces-kill-10-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 10 terrorists in Balochistan’s Zhob: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday that 10 terrorists were killed by security forces during an operation in Balochistan’s Zhob.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that after an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Zhob on February 24, in which eight Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed, security forces conducted a comprehensive sanitisation operation on Wednesday to hunt down “hiding khwarij” belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“During the conduct of the operation, own forces tracked down Khwarij on multiple routes and effectively engaged their locations. After an ensuing fire exchange, ten Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area,” it said.
The statement added that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
According to state-run APP, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to security forces over the successful operation in Zhob, noting that in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security personnel “are achieving major successes against terrorism”.
A statement carried by APP quoted the PM as saying that the entire nation was standing with the army in the fight against terrorism.
“We are determined to eliminate all kinds of terrorism from the country,” he said.







Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in a post on social media platform X that the successful operation in Zhib by security forces was proof their professional expertise and unwavering resolve against terrorism.
“Azm-i-Istehkam will continue until stability is restored in Balochistan,” he said.

A second Super Eights defeat, where Sri Lanka never threatened to get near their 169 target against New Zealand, ended their hopes of reaching the semi-finals.
It also provoked unprecedented booing from the 35,000-strong crowd in Colombo and calls for heads to roll.
The group win over Australia had hopes high for a run to at least the semi-finals, but it is now a distant memory after Sri Lanka’s batting was exposed time and again on turning pitches.
Sri Lanka head coach Sanath Jayasuriya had already informed the board that he would step down after the World Cup.
Now, captain Dasun Shanaka and the selectors seem likely to follow or be axed after an embarrassing campaign.
“We have one more game in the competition and we will address what went wrong during the World Cup after that game and take the necessary steps,” a Sri Lanka Cricket spokesperson told AFP.
Former captain Marvan Atapattu was scathing about Sri Lanka’s preparations.
“Most teams have moved on with the times playing T20 cricket, but we have stagnated and made little progress, “Atapattu told AFP.
“You need to identify your core players and stick with them,” he said.
“In Sri Lanka’s case, they had no idea what their team was going to be even a week before the tournament,” he added.
“It doesn’t work that way in international sport.”
Sri Lanka lost three front-line bowlers to injury in the first week of the tournament, with fingers being pointed at the amount of lucrative franchise cricket being played.
“When your players are involved in league cricket all over the world, there is a good chance that they break down just before a crucial campaign and that’s what happened to Sri Lanka,” Atapattu added.</p><small>2026-02-26 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26201703616a2f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975914/a-day-after-ordering-a-recount-ecp-again-notifies-ppps-ali-hassan-zehri-as-winner-of-2024-polls-in-hub' target='_blank'><strong>A day after ordering a recount, ECP again notifies PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri as winner of 2024 polls in Hub</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Thursday again declared PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri the winner of Balochistan’s PB-21 (Hub) constituency.
The development comes more than two years after the 2024 general elections and a day after the electoral watchdog ordered a recounting of votes polled in the constituency’s 39 polling stations “as soon as possible but not later than 3 working days positively”.
Subsequently, the ECP said in its notification issued on Thursday: “Pursuant to the order dated February 25, 2026 passed by the ECP […] and as a result of recounting at (39) polling stations conducted by the returning officer, PB-21 Hub, the notification dated December 19 2024, is hereby restored, whereby Ali Hassan Zehri was declared the returned candidate from PB-21 Hub.”
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court also took up the matter and directed that the operation of the Feb 25 order shall remain suspended until the next date of hearing.
The recounting saga
Originally, Balochistan Awami Party’s (BAP) Muhammad Saleh Bhootani, who had secured more than double the votes obtained by Zehri, was declared the winner in the constituency.
But, a recount at 39 polling stations two months after the Feb 8, 2024 general elections led to Zehri being declared the winner.
While the original count had not even declared him the runner-up, the recount not only got him the top spot but also pushed down Bhootani to the third spot. After the recount, the percentage of polled votes had also changed from 55.15 per cent to 58.48pc.
The significant change in the electoral figures was linked to a saga involving the arrest of five individuals from the strong room where the electoral record had been stored. They were allegedly found with three plastic bags containing fake ballot papers and were attempting to tamper with ballot papers on Feb 11, 2024, hours after the ECP ordered a recount at 39 polling stations for the first time.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of rejected votes exactly matched the decrease in the votes originally secured by BAP’s Bhootani.
The votes secured by Bhootani were reduced from 30,910 to 17,403, translating into a difference of 13,507. The number of rejected votes increased from 3,648 to 17,155, also a rise of 13,507.
Meanwhile, the number of polled votes jumped from 76,976 to 87,483, showing an increase of 10,507 votes. Of these, 9,854 were secured by Zehri originally, taking his total from 14,120 to 23,974.
A further 441 votes were added to the tally of Rajab Ali, the initial runner-up, keeping his position unchanged, while the remaining 212 votes were distributed among other candidates, except Bhootani.
Zehri was subsequently notified as the winner from PB-21 on Dec 19, 2024.
The ECP initially ordered a recount on Feb 11, 2024, but the process was marred by violence, arrests, and allegations of fake ballots. After multiple rounds of litigation, the Supreme Court on Nov 20, 2024, annulled all proceedings and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh.
Despite this, the electoral watchdog on Dec 16, 2024, in a split 3-2 decision, upheld the recount and notified Zehri as the winner, prompting Bhootani to approach the Balochistan High Court and later the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
Earlier this month, the FCC suspended Zehri’s notification and directed the ECP to re-examine the pending requests for a recount.
In its judgment, the FCC observed: “Recounting is always allowed on the basis of some material establishing illegality and irregularity in the count, and the powers to recount should be exercised sparingly after satisfaction, on the basis of material or evidence, that there has been any inclusion or exclusion of ballot papers in the count.
“The sanctity of the ballot is sacrosanct and, therefore, should not be permitted to be violated on frivolous, vague or indefinite allegations not supported by adequate statements of detailed material facts. It should only be allowed to do full justice between the parties, without a roving inquiry aimed at fishing for material to declare the election void.”
Last week, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail removed Zehri from the Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial cabinet with immediate effect. Zehri had earlier submitted his resignation to the chief minister.
IHC issues notices on Bhootani’s plea
As the ECP kept the winner in the PB-21 constituency unchanged on Thursday, the IHC took up a plea filed by Bhootani against the ECP’s February 25 order.
Subsequently, the court noted in its written order that the petitioner had sought a declaration that the ECP’s Feb 25 was “illegal and unlawful”.
The petitioner further sought a direction to the ECP to uphold the election result as incorporated in Form-47 prepared after provisional consolidation, and also sought instructions for the returning officer to prepare Forms-48 and 49 accordingly, the order said.
Form-47 provides a detailed look at the number of votes cast and/or cancelled while Form-48 provides an insight into the number of votes cast for each candidate in a particular constituency. Form-49 is the official result of each constituency and candidate.
The IHC order further said that the petitioner’s counsel contended that the Feb 25 order, prima facie, was “illegal and was passed in clear violation of Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, 2017”.
The counsel argued that it was coram non judice (lacking proper authority) and that there was no reason or material available before the ECP to justify the order for recounting, the IHC noted.
Rather, the lawyer insisted, the ECP’s order was passed merely on the basis of a “hypothetical assumption”.
“Even otherwise, no reasons were recorded, which is mandatory under Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, therefore, the order, being coram non judice, is liable to be set aside,” the IHC order further quoted the lawyer as saying.
The counsel also argued that when the recounting order was issued, the ECP did not issue a proper notice to the petitioner, “and without affording an opportunity of hearing, passed the order in violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution”.
The counsel requested the court to issue notices to the respondents “with the direction to file their report and para-wise comments within fortnight”.
After issuing notices to the respondents, the court decided that the operation of the Feb 25 order shall remain suspended until the next hearing.</p><small>2026-02-26 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2617092555d2444.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975906/india-israel-to-push-free-trade-pact-boost-defence-cooperation-modi' target='_blank'><strong>India, Israel to push free trade pact, boost defence cooperation: Modi</strong></a><br><p>India will soon give final shape to a mutually beneficial free trade agreement with Israel, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.
The two countries will also pursue joint development, production, and transfer of technology in defence, Modi said at the end of his two-day trip aimed at strengthening ties with Israel.
Modi said Tel Aviv and New Delhi agreed there was “no place for terrorism in the world”.
“India and Israel are clear that there is no place for terrorism in the world, in any form… We will oppose it shoulder to shoulder. We will always oppose it in the future,” Modi said at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
“Humanity must never become a victim of conflict,” he added.







Following their meeting, Netanyahu’s office said the “two leaders will sign a series of agreements between Israel and India in economic, security, and diplomatic fields”.
Separately, Modi said he and Israeli President Isaac Herzog held “extremely fruitful and wide-ranging” talks.







In his post on X, which included Hebrew and Hindi translations, Herzog said, “The people of Israel and India are stronger together.”
“Fully agree with you, President Herzog,” Modi replied.
“It was a delight to meet you and discuss diverse aspects of the India-Israel friendship. There is immense scope in futuristic areas such as technology, innovation, startups and more,” he added.







Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025.
Modi landed on a two-day visit to Israel on Wednesday, drawing sharp criticism at home.
He addressed the Israeli parliament, where he affirmed that India stands “firmly” with Israel.
While Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israel’s offensive, he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.
Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26163235b369813.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975874/iran-us-hold-talks-in-geneva-in-push-to-avert-war' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, US hold talks in Geneva in push to avert war</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States held talks in Switzerland on Thursday, in a last-ditch bid to avert war under the shadow of the biggest American military build-up in the Middle East in decades.
The Oman-mediated discussions follow repeated threats from Donald Trump to strike Iran, with the US president last Thursday giving Tehran 15 days to reach a deal.
The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador’s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade.







Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides expressed “unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions”.
He later said the talks had been paused but would resume later in the day.







Iran’s president insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon.
“Our Supreme Leader has already stated that we will not have nuclear weapons at all,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said, in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
United Nations nuclear chief Rafael Grossi would likely also attend the discussions in Geneva, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman said.
While Iran has insisted the talks focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region curtailed.
As part of the dramatic US build-up, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week, left a naval base in Crete Thursday, an AFP photographer said.
The developments follow massive protests in Iran that rights groups say saw thousands of demonstrators killed after the movement called for the end of the Islamic republic.
Trump makes case for invasion of Iran
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.
Trump also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.







The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.
However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.
Trump’s State of the Union accusations in Congress were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

 

Ahead of Thursday’s talks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem”.
He followed up by saying that the “president wants diplomatic solutions”.
But US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump’s threats “seriously”, saying the US president had a “right” to use military action.
“You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” Vance told ‘America’s Newsroom’ on Fox News.







‘People would suffer’
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, had called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”.
The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, Tehran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests that have posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.
Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.
Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.

After the West Indies fought back from deep trouble at 83-7 to post 176-8, Markram and Quinton de Kock put on 95 for the first wicket to set the platform for a thumping victory.
South Africa raced to their target with 23 balls to spare, scoring 177-1. Ryan Rickleton was not out on 45 at the end.
They are the only unbeaten side in the tournament, having also dismantled pre-tournament favourite India by 76 runs in the Super Eights.
An India win against Zimbabwe in Chennai later on Thursday will guarantee South Africa’s progress to the last four.
It will also make India’s clash against the West Indies in Kolkata on Sunday a winner-takes-all decider for the final semi-final berth.
Markram reached fifty off 27 balls and hit four sixes and seven fours.
De Kock scored 47 off 24 balls, with four sixes and Rickleton hit two sixes in his 28-ball knock in an utterly dominant display of batsmanship.
The West Indies has earlier needed a record eighth-wicket partnership by Romario Shepherd and Jason Holder to get to 176-8 afer an early collapse.
The pair came together with their team in deep trouble at 83-7 and put on 89, the highest eighth-wicket stand in the history of T20 internationals.
Shepherd was unbeaten on 52 off 37 balls with four sixes. Holder was run out off the penultimate ball of the innings for 49 off 31 balls with three maximums.
Both teams came into the match with a perfect five wins in the T20 World Cup so far.
South Africa have played four of their five matches in Ahmedabad and captain Aiden Markram had no hesitation in opting to bowl when he won the toss.
The West Indies took 17 off the first over, bowled by left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
Kagiso Rabada’s introduction halted their charge as captain Shai Hope (16) edged his second ball to keeper Quinton de Kock.
Shimron Hetmyer was dropped at mid-on by Corbin Bosch off the next delivery, but lasted only two more when he miscued to midwicket, where Maharaj snapped up the catch.
Lungi Ngidi got in the act in his first over when Brandon King on 21 edged to De Kock and two balls later Roston Chase chopped on.
From 29-0 after two overs, the West Indies had slumped to 43-4 after four. Ngidi took 3-30 from his four overs, Rabada 2-2 and Bosch 2-31.</p><small>2026-02-26 12:59</small></div><hr>
