<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04181410f5fc433.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946561/ppp-assails-maryams-remarks-on-canals-issue-as-violation-of-cci-decision' target='_blank'><strong>PPP assails Maryam’s remarks on canals issue as violation of CCI decision</strong></a><br><p>PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro on Saturday assailed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks regarding the contentious canals issue as a violation of the decision made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
In a statement issued today, the PPP said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”.
The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims.
 






The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader.
“Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.”
He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances.
Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum.
The senator said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue.
“Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River.
“Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.”
He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme.
“Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.”
Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”.
“Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.”
“If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/041831267a7c040.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946562/pia-to-resume-uk-flight-operations-from-october-25' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to resume UK flight operations from October 25</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Saturday that it would resume flights to the United Kingdom from October 25, with nonstop flights from Manchester to Islamabad.
This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit and Third Country Operator approval, but no exact date was given.
PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.”
 






In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit.
In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04174114b7e118e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946557/islamabad-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-imran-riaz-khan-kp-anti-graft-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court issues arrest warrants for Imran Riaz Khan, KP anti-graft officials</strong></a><br><p>A district and sessions court in Islamabad issued bailable arrest warrants for YouTuber Imran Riaz Khan and two officials from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s anti-corruption body, it emerged on Saturday.
The arrest warrants, issued by Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah yesterday and available with Dawn.com, were issued for Khan, head of the Directorate of Anti-Corruption Sadeeq Anjam and Adviser to the KP Chief Minister on Anti-Corruption Musaddiq Abbasi, over their alleged involvement in a social media campaign against Islamabad Judge Humayun Dilawar.
Dilawar was the judge who convicted PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case in 2023 and sentenced him to three years in prison.
All three warrants were issued under Sections 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 and Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) and 506ii (punishment for criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
There was no date given by which the three men needed to be produced before the court.
A day prior, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) dismissed a petition seeking to quash a cybercrime case registered against a petitioner accused of running the campaign.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, in a detailed judgement, ruled that the first information report (FIR) could not be quashed at this stage since a challan had already been submitted to the trial court. He further observed that partially quashing an FIR to the extent of one suspect, while others remained nominated, was a legal impossibility.
Last September, a judicial magistrate in KP’s Bannu issued arrest warrants for Judge Dilawar at the request of the Anti-Corruption Establishment, who were probing the Islamabad magistrate’s family’s alleged involvement in a graft case.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/041136337e1778c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946513/hamass-response-to-gaza-plan-creates-window-for-ceasefire-must-not-let-it-close-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas’s response to Gaza plan creates window for ceasefire, must not let it close: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Palestinian group Hamas’s response to US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan “creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again”.
Late Friday night, Trump told Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agreed to release hostages and accept some other terms in a US plan to end the war, but vexing issues like disarmament appeared unresolved.
Subsequently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’s response.
Meanwhile, the world welcomed Hamas’s positive response, with Pakistan also doing the same.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the premier said: “Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so.”
He also expressed gratitude to US President Trump, as well as the leaderships of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt and Indonesia, for their efforts during meetings on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
The eight countries, including Pakistan, and the US had met on the sidelines of the UNGA to discuss the conflict in Gaza.
“The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again,” he said, adding that Pakistan would continue to “work with all its partners and brotherly nations to [ensure] everlasting peace in Palestine”.
 






Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Hamas’s response was a “welcome step”.
“This must now result in an immediate ceasefire, end to Palestinian suffering, ensure hostages release, and allow free flow of humanitarian aid. Israel MUST immediately stop its attacks,” he said.
 






“We reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and a sovereign, viable State of Palestine on the pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” he added.
Later in the day, Dar held a telephone conversation with Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, wherein they discussed regional developments, particularly the situation in Gaza.
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO), they reviewed ongoing diplomatic efforts, including engagements and consultations among the eight Arab-Islamic countries and the United States in New York, aimed at “achieving an immediate and durable ceasefire, ensuring unhindered humanitarian assistance, and to secure lasting peace in Gaza”.
It added that Dar appreciated the Saudi foreign minister’s continued engagement and constructive role in these efforts.
 






“They also discussed recent developments, including Hamas’s response to the proposal of President Donald Trump. Both ministers reaffirmed their firm commitment to the Palestinian cause and agreed to remain closely engaged with Arab and Islamic partners, as well as the international community, to advance a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace based on the two-state solution,” it concluded.
Meanwhile, another statement issued by the FO also welcomed the Palestinian group’s response, stating: “This offers an important opportunity to secure an immediate ceasefire, end the bloodshed of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, ensure unhindered humanitarian assistance, and pave the way for a credible political process toward lasting peace. Israel must immediately cease attacks.”
In the statement, the FO appreciated the efforts of the American president for peace in Gaza and hoped it would result in a durable ceasefire and a just, comprehensive and lasting peace.
“Pakistan will continue to contribute constructively and meaningfully to this process,” it said.
 






“Pakistan reaffirms its principled support for the Palestinian cause and stands in complete solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, leading to the establishment of a sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions,” the FO said.

Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20.
 






In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”.
He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.”
 






Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!”
 






Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan.
A day ago, security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the province’s Sherani district.
On Wednesday, four terrorists were apprehended during an IBO in Khuzdar district.</p><small>2025-10-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04153319ebe6c01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946548/state-minister-says-probe-underway-into-who-operates-imran-khans-x-account' target='_blank'><strong>State minister says probe underway into who operates Imran Khan’s X account</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has said that authorities are in contact with X (formerly Twitter) over the use of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan’s account on its platform and an investigation into who has been operating it is underway.
Speaking on Dawn News TV’s programme ‘Doosra Rukh with Nadir Guramani’ on Friday, Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Investigations are underway [into who is operating PTI founder’s X account].“
 






“Evidence and further material will come forward, and that will disclose where the account’s links are and who is running it,” the state minister added.
“At this moment, all I can say is that there is definitely an [the authorities’] engagement with X. Along with this, I believe that the legal process which is being adopted in this investigation [and] its results will also be before you very soon.”
Imran was recently quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics, according to a post on his official X account.
Although Imran does not have access to his X account in prison, the detailed statement disclosed the five key areas of questioning and his responses.
The PTI founder has repeatedly been quizzed about his social media postings, and he has previously refused to answer any questions without his lawyers present.
That was also the first time that such an account of a questioning by law enforcement personnel was posted to his official X account.
It may be noted that Imran does not have access to the internet in jail and his X account is operated by someone else.
Last month, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p><small>2025-10-04 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0415205517185ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946546/right-wing-sanae-takaichi-set-to-become-japans-first-female-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Right-wing Sanae Takaichi set to become Japan’s first female PM</strong></a><br><p>Japan’s ruling party picked hardline conservative Sanae Takaichi as its head on Saturday, putting her on course to become the country’s first female prime minister in a move set to jolt investors and neighbours.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of the postwar era, elected Takaichi, 64, to regain trust from a public angered by rising prices and drawn to opposition groups promising stimulus and clampdowns on migrants.
A vote in parliament to choose a replacement for outgoing Shigeru Ishiba is expected on October 15. Takaichi is favoured as the ruling coalition has the largest number of seats.
 






Inherits party in crisis
Takaichi, the only woman among the five LDP candidates, beat a challenge from the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, who was bidding to become the youngest modern leader.
A former economic security and internal affairs minister with an expansionary fiscal agenda for the world’s fourth-largest economy, Takaichi takes over a party in crisis.
Various other parties, including the expansionist Democratic Party for the People and the anti-immigration Sanseito, have been steadily luring voters, especially younger ones, away from the LDP.
 


The LDP and its coalition partner lost their majorities in both houses under Ishiba over the past year, triggering his resignation.
“Recently, I have heard harsh voices from across the country saying we don’t know what the LDP stands for anymore,” Takaichi said in a speech before the second-round vote.
“That sense of urgency drove me. I wanted to turn people’s anxieties about their daily lives and the future into hope.”
Takaichi says her hero is Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first female prime minister, who offers a starker vision for change than Koizumi and is potentially more disruptive.

An advocate of late premier Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics” strategy to boost the economy with aggressive spending and easy monetary policy, she has previously criticised the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) interest rate increases.
Such a spending shift could confuse investors about one of the world’s biggest debt loads.
Naoya Hasegawa, chief bond strategist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo, said Takaichi’s election had weakened the chances of the BOJ raising rates this month, which markets had priced at around a 60 per cent chance before the vote.
Discussed redoing Trump trade deal
Takaichi has also raised the possibility of redoing an investment deal with US President Donald Trump that lowered his punishing tariffs in return for Japanese taxpayer-backed investment.
The US ambassador to Japan, George Glass, congratulated Takaichi, posting on X that he looked forward to strengthening the Japan-US partnership “on every front”.
 






But her nationalistic positions — such as her regular visits to the Yasukuni shrine to Japan’s war dead, viewed by some Asian countries as a symbol of its past militarism — may rile neighbours like South Korea and China.
South Korea will seek to “cooperate to maintain the positive momentum in South Korea-Japan relations”, President Lee Jae Myung’s office said in a statement.
Takaichi also favours revising Japan’s pacifist postwar constitution and suggested this year that Japan could form a “quasi-security alliance” with Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China.
Taiwan President Lai Ching-te welcomed her election, saying she was a “steadfast friend of Taiwan”.
“It is hoped that under the leadership of the new [LDP] President Takaichi, Taiwan and Japan can deepen their partnership in areas such as economic trade, security, and technological cooperation,” he said in a statement.
 


If elected prime minister, Takaichi said she would travel overseas more regularly than her predecessor to spread the word that “Japan is Back!”.
“I have thrown away my own work-life balance, and I will work, work, work,” Takaichi said in her victory speech.
Warnings for foreigners
Some of her supporters viewed her selection as a watershed in Japan’s male-dominated politics, though opinion polls suggest her socially conservative positions are favoured more by men than women.
“The fact that a woman was chosen might be seen positively. I think it shows that Japan is truly starting to change and that message is getting across,” 30-year-old company worker Misato Kikuchi said outside Tokyo’s Shimbashi station.
Takaichi must also seek to blunt the rise of Sanseito, which broke into the political mainstream in a July election, appealing to conservative voters disillusioned with the LDP.
 
 

Echoing Sanseito’s warnings about foreigners, she kicked off her first official campaign speech with an anecdote about tourists reportedly kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara.
Takaichi, whose mother was a police officer, promised to clamp down on rule-breaking visitors and immigrants, who have come to Japan in record numbers in recent years.
“We hope she will … steer Japanese politics in an ‘anti-globalism’ direction to protect national interests and help the people regain prosperity and hope,” Sanseito said in a statement.</p><small>2025-10-04 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0415012081ff37a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946547/test-skipper-shubman-gill-replaces-rohit-sharma-as-india-odi-captain' target='_blank'><strong>Test skipper Shubman Gill replaces Rohit Sharma as India ODI captain</strong></a><br><p>Test skipper Shubman Gill has replaced Rohit Sharma as India’s ODI captain, the country’s cricket board said on Saturday, starting with the series in Australia.
The 38-year-old batsman Rohit and fellow stalwart Virat Kohli, 36, were both however named in the squad for the three-match series beginning on October 19.
Top-order batsman Gill, 26, is now Test and one-day skipper, and vice captain of India’s T20 side.
 






He took over the Test captaincy from Rohit starting with the series in England in the summer, earning praise for both his leadership and batting.
He led from the front, scoring 754 runs in five Tests to help India draw the keenly contested series 2-2.
Gill also leads Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League.
Rohit, one of India’s most successful limited-overs captains, led the side to a record third Champions Trophy title in Dubai earlier this year.
He and Kohli have both retired from T20Is and Tests.
Gill’s vice-captain for the Australia series will be Shreyas Iyer.
India currently top both the ODI and T20 team rankings of the International Cricket Council.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant, who is recovering from a fractured foot and was ruled out of the ongoing test series against West Indies, was not selected for the tour Down Under.

“It is likely to move west-southwestwards and reach northwest and adjoining central north Arabian Sea by Oct 5, then it will recurve and move east-northeastwards during subsequent 24 hours and weaken gradually,” a notification issued by the PMD said.
It said that under the influence of the storm, wind/thunderstorm and light to moderate rain was likely today in Sindh’s Badin, Thatta, Sujawal and Jamshoro districts, and Balochistan’s Hub, Lasbela, Awaran and Kech districts, as well as at isolated places in Karachi Division.
The notification stated that sea conditions were likely to remain “rough to very rough” with squally winds gusting 55 kilometres/hour near the Sindh coast. It also advised fishermen not to venture into the deep sea till Sunday.

The department further said that sea conditions were likely to remain very rough to high, then very high over central North and the North Arabian Sea during the next 36 hours. Thereafter, very rough to high around the
system centre, it said.
“The PMD’s Cyclone Warning Centre, Karachi is monitoring the system and will issue the updates accordingly,” it added.
Zoom Earth’s radar also denoted Shakhti as a “severe cyclonic storm” with a speed of 100km/h as of 11am. According to former chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, regional cyclones are assigned names according to a list prepared by a 13-country panel.
A separate PMD alert issued for Karachi Division stated that the storm now lay south-southwest at a distance of about 390km from Karachi and was likely to move west-southwards.
“Isolated drizzle likely to occur in Karachi Division today. Hot and dry weather likely to prevail [in] most parts of the province,” it said.
The alert predicted partly cloudy and humid weather with chances of isolated drizzle for Saturday (today), partly cloudy and humid weather for Sunday and mostly sunny and humid weather on Monday.</p><small>2025-10-04 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04131826a4c87fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946512/more-rain-expected-across-punjab-till-oct-7-as-flood-survey-underway-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>More rain expected across Punjab till Oct 7 as flood survey underway: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>More rain is expected in the coming days across Punjab as surveys to assess the losses and damages from the recent floods are underway, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said on Saturday.
Since June, monsoon rains across Pakistan have killed at least 1,037 people, swelling major rivers and devastating rural communities along their banks. In Punjab only, over 4.7 million people have been affected across 4,700 villages, according to the PDMA.
Addressing a media briefing in Lahore today, DG Kathia said showers were expected to begin early tomorrow morning across Punjab, and continue till October 7 (Tuesday) in the northern parts.
The PDMA chief said the north and northeastern regions from Rawalpindi to Lahore were likely to receive 30 to 35 millimetres of rainfall on average, while the province’s southern parts could see 5 to 10mm.
He warned that the intensity of the showers would increase on October 6 and 7, with 50 to 70mm of rain anticipated in northern and northeastern Punjab, extending into central districts as well.
The shift in weather is already impacting river flows, as per DG Kathia, who detailed that the Chenab river recorded inflows of 20,000 cusecs at Head Marala.
However, citing “unofficial Indian sources”, Kathia said that in the next 48 hours, inflows could surge to 100,000 to 150,000 cusecs due to rainfall and silt flushing at the Dul Hasti hydropower project, located 210 kilometres upstream in occupied Kashmir.
 
 

The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad yesterday morning received light to heavy rain, which created a slushy mess in the low-lying areas.
According to an alert issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department on Wednesday, a Western Disturbance (WD) was likely to intensify from October 3 (Friday) and may persist until October 7 (Tuesday).
Survey in 27 districts to be completed by end of Oct
Moreover, the PDMA DG said loss and damage assessments were being carried out in 27 flood-affected districts across Punjab after the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers breached their banks.
Around 4.7m people across 4,700 villages were impacted, with 2.63m people and 2.11m livestock evacuated to safety. The death toll has reached 134, though the final figures may be higher, as the full-scale survey was only initiated in late September.
“The survey began on September 27 and is expected to be completed within a month, covering all 27 districts and 69 tehsils of Punjab,” the PDMA DG stated.
 
 

“On the directives of Punjab’s chief minister, 11,500 survey workers across 27 districts are on the field, with 2,213 teams in total, ensuring enumeration is done transparently,” he noted.
“The joint survey teams include the Pakistan Army, the Urban Unit, the agriculture and livestock departments, and a representative from the [relevant] district administration.”
However, Kathia highlighted that the teams continued to face challenges in reaching areas still inundated with water. He asserted that all involved authorities, including Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, were monitoring the survey in real-time, with data being sent to the Provincial Emergency Operation Centre (PEOC) as soon as it was enumerated.
The PDMA chief detailed that once data was received by the joint survey teams, it was sent to a tehsil flood relief committee working under an assistant commissioner for counter-checking, where it was verified and scrutinised before being forwarded to the district flood relief committee.
On the district level, the data was then sent to the Urban Unit, which verified and forwarded it to the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB).
At PITB, the data undergoes several layers of verification, DG Kathia pointed out.
He explained that the first step involves checks by the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), including Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) authentication, expiry status and out-of-province registration. The data is then cross-matched with livestock vaccination records to ensure accuracy, with vaccination details verified before finalising livestock cases.
In parallel, the Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) database was consulted to identify if any non-owners had been included or if any genuine owners had been left out. The PITB also runs its own internal data cross-checks to validate the process.
 
 

Only after these checks is the verified information forwarded to the Bank of Punjab (BOP), the PDMA DG added.
BOP counters will be set up for beneficiaries, with transportation arranged to facilitate access, according to Kathia. Beneficiaries will also receive messages notifying them of the date and centre they need to visit to collect compensation.</p><small>2025-10-04 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946417/sindh-introduces-new-traffic-penalties-demerit-points-system' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh introduces new traffic penalties, demerit points system</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh government has introduced a new system of traffic penalties, including fines and a demerit points system, by amending the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965, to improve road safety across the province.
Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said in a statement on Thursday that violations including overspeeding, driving without a license, signal violations, wrong-way driving, overloading, and reckless behaviour would now carry higher fines and demerit points.
Under the revised penalty structure, overspeeding will result in fines of Rs5,000 for motorcycles, Rs15,000 for cars, and Rs20,000 for heavy vehicles, along with eight demerit points. Driving without a license will be penalised with a fine of up to Rs50,000 and six demerit points. Reckless driving will attract a fine of Rs25,000 and eight points.
The new system also includes fines for one-wheeling, riding motorcycles without helmets, using tinted windows, driving in the wrong lane, and carrying passengers on vehicle roofs.
 






“These measures are not intended to collect revenue,” Mr Memon said. “They are aimed at saving lives and making roads safer for everyone.” He added that repeated violations could lead to license suspension or cancellation and that traffic offences such as signal breaking and overspeeding pose risks to public safety.
The minister also said the government is working to modernise traffic enforcement by introducing a digital monitoring system and increasing the capacity of the traffic police.
He noted that the demerit points system, which tracks repeat offenders, is in use in several other countries. He said public awareness campaigns would be launched to encourage compliance with traffic laws.
He appealed to citizens to support the new regulations to reduce accidents, improve traffic flow, and increase road safety.

Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and the Centre over a 38-point charter of demands were progressing but broke down last week after the JAAC pressed for the abolition of elite privileges and 12 seats reserved for Pakistan-based refugees from India-held Kashmir.
What started as a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike descended into violence when rival groups staged protests, and protesters and law enforcers clashed, leaving at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured. After two rounds of talks, the stakeholders finally sealed an agreement earlier today to end the ongoing unrest.
Here is what it entails:
FIRs for incidents resulting in LEA, protester deaths
First information reports (FIRs) will be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protesters”, with a judicial commission appointed where required.
“Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the agreement read, adding that those with gunshot injuries will be given Rs1 million in compensation while a government job will be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days.
 






An additional point detailed that for registering FIRs in the incidents of Banjosa (Sept 21), Muzaffarabad (Sept 30 and Oct 1), Plock (Oct 1), Dhirkot (Oct 1), Mirpur (Oct 2) and Rian Kotli (Oct 1), the matters shall be referred to the judicial commission comprising a high court judge.
An additional point stated that Kashmiri protesters arrested during various incidents in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Oct 2 and 3 would be released.
Educational boards, reduced cabinet size, dept mergers
Regarding education, it was decided that two additional intermediate and secondary educational boards (ISEBs) shall be notified for Muzaffarabad and Poonch Divisions, with all three ISEBs of AJK linked with the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education within 30 days.
Admissions to educational institutions will be given on “open merit”, another point stated.
The agreement also announced that the AJK government will issue funds for the implementation of a health card within 15 days. Further, MRI and CT Scan machines will be provided in each AJK district through funding from the federal government in a phase-wise manner.
The pact detailed that the size of the AJK cabinet shall be reduced to 20 ministers/advisers, and the number of administrative secretaries shall not be more than 20 at any given time. “Mergers like the departments of Civil Defence with SDMA (State Disaster Management Authority) will be carried out for this purpose.”
The Ehtesab Bureau and the Anti-Corruption Establishment shall be merged as well, with AJK’s Ehtesab Bureau Act to be brought in accordance with the National Accountability Bureau’s laws.
Rs10bn for improving AJK’s electricity system
The Centre also pledged to provide Rs10 billion for the improvement of Azad Kashmir’s electricity system.
The federal government agreed to carry out a feasibility study for the construction of two tunnels at Kahori/Kamser (3.7 kilometres) and Chaplani (0.6km) of Neelum Valley Road and the “project shall be prioritised as per PC 1 dated Dec 6, 2022 under Saudi Development Fund”.
 
 

“The possession of lands with extended families of Mirpur district in case of Mangla Dam Raising Project shall be regularised in 30 days,” it added.
The sides also agreed on the implementation of the 2019 high court decision regarding hydel projects and a feasibility study for the provision of a greater water supply scheme in 10 districts during the current fiscal year.
A review of the transport policy in light of a high court decision will also be carried out, “with special reference” for the use of 1300cc cars.
The pact also envisaged the formation of a high-powered committee comprising legal and constitutional experts to deliberate “on the issue of members of AJK Assembly other than AJK constituencies”. The body will comprise two legal experts each from the Centre, the AJK government and the JAAC.
“Till the submission of final report of the committee, the provisions/concessions/allocation of funds/status of ministries under the existing arrangements will be held in abeyance,” it added.
“The Local Government Act in its current shape shall be brought in conformity with the spirit of the original Local Govt. Act of 1990 and in accordance with the judgments on the subject by apex courts in 90 days.”
Some healthcare, water supply facilities under ADP
As per the “additional points” listed, funds for an operation theatre and nurseries at all tehsil headquarter hospitals, as well as for the construction of bridges at Gulpur and Rehman (Kotli) will be provided from the Annual Development Programme (ADP).
The agreement also proposed a water supply scheme and transmission line for the Kashmir colony in Dadyal, funded by the ADP. It pledged the grant of proprietary rights to refugees of Dadyal’s Mendor colony.
“Taxes on transfer of property shall be brought at par with Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within three months,” it said.
 
 

The pact further stated: “Reduction of advance tax on the analogy of Gilgit-Baltistan and Fata (esrtwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas).”
Meanwhile, a timeframe for an international airport at Mirpur will be announced within the current financial year after consultation and deliberations by the appropriate authority and the federal government.
Monitoring committee to define timelines for implementing decisions
In order to oversee and implement the agreement, a Monitoring and Implementation Committee comprising representatives from the federal government, its AJK counterpart and the JAAC will be notified, the document said.
Besides Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam from the federal government, the panel will also include two nominated representatives from the AJK administration and two members of the JAAC.
The committee will be responsible for dispute resolution, will formulate rules and regulations of the working methodology and define timelines for the implementation of every decision in the “light of budgetary allocation and other constraints”.
“The committee will also review existing perks and privileges/fringe benefits authorised to [the] judiciary, government officials and ministers in order to rationalise it,” the agreement reads.</p><small>2025-10-04 08:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0411283627bd32d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946505/pm-says-issues-resolved-amicably-as-govt-signs-agreement-with-ajk-committee-to-end-unrest' target='_blank'><strong>PM says issues resolved ‘amicably’ as govt signs agreement with AJK committee to end unrest</strong></a><br><p>A high-level federal government delegation on Saturday signed an agreement with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) to end days of unrest in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”.
The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout.
In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.”
 
 

“This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”.
Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required.
“Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days.
 






Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team.
 
 

From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry.
Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC.
On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir.
Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands.
Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz
Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”.
Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added.
 






PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”.
He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal
Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.”
He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”.
 






Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”.
He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”.
“The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.</p><small>2025-10-04 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/031858189b7d04b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946313/reserved-seats-case-why-the-constitutional-benchs-verdict-undermines-the-very-essence-of-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>Reserved seats case: Why the Constitutional Bench’s verdict undermines the very essence of democracy</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) has issued detailed reasons in the reserved seats review, and it’s easily among the most unwittingly comical decisions in our legal history. This distinction is notable in itself, given that Justice Qazi Faez Isa is no longer authoring judgments.
To recap, Justice Isa had stripped the country’s largest party, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), of its symbol right before the polls in 2024; the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) then made sure no symbol meant no party, and wrongly forced the PTI nominees to contest as independents.
When the independents ended up winning in historic numbers anyway, it followed that they’d be entitled to the most reserved seats. But the rules say that a lack of symbol precludes parties from such seats — the 80 independents in the assembly were thus forced to park themselves under the canopy of Sunni Ittehad Council (symbol: horse) to claim their share.
 
 

Still unimpressed, the ECP not only continued freezing out the PTI, it even doled out their haul of reserves to the loser parties. It took a 13-member judgment of the Supreme Court to put things right, and — in Sunni Ittehad vs Election Commission — hold that the 80 independents were either already PTI or could write in that they were PTI, and thus bag their rightful seats.
No sooner had democracy breathed a rare sigh of relief than the Supreme Court’s brand-new Constitutional Bench reviewed its own verdict and set it aside: the PTI’s reserved seats dropped back from 22 to 0. While this writer has already put down that whole sordid saga here, the detailed reasons released earlier this week merit a look of their own.
The reasoning
Armed, in the main, with a single unconvincing technicality — that the SIC was before the Court and not the PTI — the review bench has reversed a decision that was superior in reasoning, broader in scope, and far truer to the spirit of the law.
Amazingly, it hasn’t devoted even a single sentence to its most glaring inadequacy: the fact that a 12-member bench is in no position to review the decision of 13 members. The moment one of the judges recused themselves from hearing the matter in the middle of proceedings, the bench became incomplete.
All we hear of this in the verdict is a stray fact, from when the judge stepped down: “Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC, requested that the Bench should not hear the case any further. This request was declined. The Bench continued to hear the case.”
And that hearing’s conclusions are par for the course: from Tamizuddin on, Pakistan’s history is littered with verdicts that prize commas and contortions over justice, over federalism, over democracy.
Consider: the original decision had taken pains to correct an all-out fraud on the electorate. “For democracy to endure, political parties must be supported and strengthened, not eliminated,” Justice Mansoor Ali Shah had held. “A democracy without political parties is unlikely to sustain itself for long … The judiciary, tasked with ensuring electoral justice, must foremost preserve the will of the people.”
A third category
Yet, the review verdict marks a proud return to form: far from their votes being respected, the public gets pages and pages of bean-counting. As for the people’s will, the review actually holds that the voter knew full well that, when casting a ballot for an independent candidate, the winner would not secure any reserved seats.
Left out of this remarkable observation is any mention of the ECP’s disastrous missteps or Justice Isa’s ludicrous party symbol verdict, which disenfranchised the voter in the first place. Major miscarriages of justice are wiped from the story in favour of procedural detours: the review bench has skipped past the elephant in the room by cross-examining each mouse.
It then tops this off by holding that the original verdict actually ignored the rights of the returned candidates, “such as some of the review petitioners, who were elected on reserved seats in National Assembly and notified as such. These returned candidates had also taken oath.”

This is the first judgment in Pakistan’s history that seeks to elicit sympathy for losing candidates occupying seats their party never won. As for how these phantom members have themselves honoured their oath, the lesser said the better.

Interestingly, the review bench does seem to understand that seats should be held by parties that, well, won them. “The results of the general election,” it holds, “and the measure and extent of the success of a political party in the general elections has a direct bearing on the number of persons who get elected from that political party to a reserved seat.”
But it then chooses to upend this formula — a formula that can only ever be the essence of any democracy — by awarding all the reserved seats to the parties that lost. As this writer said previously, apart from women and minorities, the Constitutional Bench seems to have created a third category: losers that serve democracy’s latest derailment.
 
 

The review also takes issue with the original majority having continued to issue clarifications of its verdict. “The order whereby the majority had converted itself into a special bench to the exclusion of the minority members,” the review holds, “was both unprecedented and illegal.”
Whether the election commission brazenly disobeying court orders — hence the need for a special bench’s reminders — was unprecedented or illegal, is not discussed; whether a review could exclude five of the eight majority judges from the original decision is also left for others to discern.
Given these fundamentals are still unanswered, it may be too much to ask why the Constitutional Bench itself has been on the books for an entire year without the challenge to its own validity being heard. It nonetheless continues to achieve, through its judgments, what the authors of the 26th Amendment had always dreamed of.
And that amendment, it must be remembered, was passed without the original verdict having been implemented. That film has reached its squalid climax.</p><small>2025-10-04 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04102928fa6daee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946511/trumps-100000-fee-for-h-1b-worker-visas-challenged-in-lawsuit' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s $100,000 fee for H-1B worker visas challenged in lawsuit</strong></a><br><p>A coalition of unions, employers and religious groups filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to block US President Donald Trump’s bid to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers.
The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.
Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organisations. They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa programme.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement said Trump’s administration engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.”
The programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.
Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programmes say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour. But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.
Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.
Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
Trump in his unprecedented order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B programme have undercut its integrity and that the programme threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology. He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B programme threatens the country’s economic and national security.
The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa programme and cannot under the US Constitution unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.
“The Proclamation transforms the H-1B programme into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.
The groups argue that agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US State Department likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.
India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.</p><small>2025-10-04 05:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/040717579b3a0ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946348/trump-calls-on-israel-to-stop-bombing-gaza-after-hamas-conditionally-agrees-to-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Trump calls on Israel to ‘stop bombing Gaza’ after Hamas ‘conditionally’ agrees to peace plan</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said early on Saturday that Israel must stop bombing Gaza immediately and that he believes Hamas is ready for peace after an earlier statement by the Palestinian resistance group.
Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations.
 


Soon after, Trump posted Hamas’ response to his Truth Social account. Trump had earlier not specified whether the terms would be subject to negotiation, as Hamas is seeking.
 


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’ response.
Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce offensive activity in Gaza.
Notably, the resistance group did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarise Gaza — something Israel and the US want but Hamas has rejected before. It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal the group demands.
A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel’s occupation of the besieged enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties as the war approaches its two-year mark.
Hamas seeks further negotiations
In its statement, Hamas said it “appreciates the Arab, Islamic, and international efforts, as well as the efforts of US President Donald Trump, calling for an end to the war on the Gaza Strip, the exchange of prisoners, (and) the immediate entry of aid,” among other terms.
It said it was announcing its “approval of releasing all occupation captives — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange.”
But Hamas added: “In this context, the movement affirms its readiness to immediately enter, through the mediators, into negotiations to discuss the details.”
The resistance group said it was ready “to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing.”
Hamas has previously offered to release all hostages and to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a different body.
Earlier, Trump had given Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning the Palestinian resistance group faced “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms.
The US leader set the deadline — which would fall at 1am on Monday in Gaza — after an official for Palestinian group told AFP earlier on Friday that the group still needed time to study the proposal to end nearly two years of devastating war in the Palestinian territory.
“If this last chance agreement is not reached, all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump had posted on his Truth Social platform.
“Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.”
 


 
 

The proposal, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages within 72 hours, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. That would be followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself.
Hamas was not involved in the negotiations that led to the proposal, which calls on the resistance group to disarm, a demand it has previously rejected.
“Hamas is still continuing consultations regarding Trump’s plan … and has informed mediators that the consultations are ongoing and need some time,” an official had said earlier on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.
On Tuesday, Trump gave Hamas “three or four days” to accept his plan, which has been welcomed by world powers, including Pakistan among Arab and Muslim nations. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, had said in a statement on Friday that the “plan has points of concern, and we will announce our position on it soon”.
‘Places of death’
On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency — a rescue force operating under Hamas authority — reported heavy air bombardment and artillery shelling on Gaza City.
It said Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people across the territory, including eight in Gaza City.
AFP has contacted the Israeli military for comment.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP cannot independently verify details or casualty figures provided by the Israeli military or the civil defence.

The Israeli military is waging an air and ground offensive on the territory’s largest urban centre, from which hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee.
The UN on Friday reiterated there was no safe place in Gaza and that Israel-designated zones in the south were “places of death”.
“The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical,” Unicef spokesman James Elder said from the Gaza Strip.
Amnesty International condemned a “catastrophic wave of mass displacement” as Israel intensified its Gaza City offensive.
The rights group said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, many of whom had already been displaced multiple times, were being forced into “overcrowded enclaves in the south … that lack access to clean water, food, medical care, shelter and life-sustaining infrastructure”.
As the war nears the two-year mark and the death toll continues to rise, protesters around the world have railed at Israel’s interception of a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for Gaza.
On Friday, the organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said its last remaining boat had been intercepted and Israel’s foreign ministry said it had deported four Italian participants.
‘Two opinions’ in Hamas
As Hamas mulled Trump’s peace plan this week, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday that the Islamist movement wanted to amend some clauses, including the one on disarmament.
Hamas leaders also want “international guarantees” for a full Israeli withdrawal and that no assassination attempts would be made inside or outside Gaza, the source added.
Another source familiar with the negotiations told AFP that the group was split over Trump’s plan.
Structurally, the group’s leadership is divided between officials based in the Gaza Strip and those abroad, particularly in Qatar. Much of Hamas’s leadership has also been wiped out in Israeli attacks throughout the conflict.
The source told AFP that “the first [opinion] supports unconditional approval, as the priority is a ceasefire under Trump’s guarantees, with mediators ensuring Israel implements the plan”.
“The second has serious reservations regarding key clauses… They favour conditional approval with clarifications reflecting Hamas’s and the resistance factions’ demands,” the source added.
Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said “ultimately it’s not just about convincing Hamas leadership in Doha, but also the leadership in Gaza, as well as Hamas members and fighters in Gaza”.
“Additionally, Hamas must then be able to convince other factions in Gaza,” he added.
The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 66,288 Palestinians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory that the United Nations considers reliable.

Later, Interpol sent a letter to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Islamabad, the Karachi police and the Anti-Vehicles Lifting Cell (AVLC), alerting them about the stolen vehicle.
Talking to Dawn on Friday, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said that the Interpol’s letter was received two days ago at the office of AVLC SSP.
“We have sent an email to the UK police and asked them to send us a detailed log of the tracker fitted in the vehicle,” he said.

Interpol says the SUV was last tracked on Korangi Road in February

The IGP said that the police also sought the source of the active location of the vehicle from the tracker, as the vehicle was last spotted in Karachi on Feb 11, 2025.
According to the Interpol’s letter, the black Range Rover Sport was stolen from UK on November 11, 2022. The vehicle was fitted with a tracker, and it was last spotted in Leeds, where it was lost.
It said that the UK police requested cooperation from Pakistani authorities to trace and locate the vehicle.
Earlier in 2022, another luxury vehicle, Bentley Mulsanne, stolen from the UK was recovered from Karachi after a British intelligence agency tracked down the exact location of the car and informed Pakistani authorities.

• Murad says elected representatives, DCs and police will ‘forcibly’ vaccinate children whose parents refuse inoculation                 
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah is likely to take stern action against the parents who refuse polio vaccination for their children.  
The punitive measures include blocking of cell phone subscriber identification modules (SIMs) and suspending national identity cards and passports to restrict access to communication and travel facilities.  
“I have no other options but to penalise those who shirk their national duty of eradicating polio, a responsibility that starts at home and affects the entire province and country,” he said while chairing a meeting here at CM House on Friday.  
Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho and Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) Coordinator Irshad Sodhar briefed the CM.  
The meeting participants were informed that during the last month’s anti-polio campaign, 216,664 children missed the polio drops.  
Out of these, 181,142 children were not at home while 35,522 children’s parents refused vaccination.  
After listening to the briefing and the issue of refusal, the chief minister said that he was considering blocking mobile SIMs and suspending computerised national identity cards (CNICs) of those refusing polio drops.  
He directed Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah to submit to him a plan to block mobile SIMs, CNICs and passports of individuals refusing polio drops to their children.  
The CM directed to activation of the Refusal Conversion Committee (RCC) to address and eliminate refusal cases.  
He said elected representatives, deputy commissioners, and SSP would visit such households to administer polio drops to children “forcibly”.  
He also decided to set up a ‘Polio Vaccine Refusal Cell’ at CM House. The cell will be provided with union council-wise details of parents refusing to vaccinate their children so they can be addressed through social, political and administrative means.  
The CM expressed regret over the continued reporting of polio cases, despite intensive efforts. He directed the health department and district administration to work seriously towards eradicating polio.  
He warned that negligence in the polio campaign would not be tolerated.  
“Any official not showing performance will no longer be part of his team. I have already removed some officers from the health department and administration,” he said and added that further negligence in polio eradication would lead to the removal of responsible officers.  
“The purpose of today’s meeting is to launch the polio campaign at the Union Council level with renewed enthusiasm,” he said.  
“In the past week, two more polio cases were reported, raising the province’s total to nine, which is quite painful,” the chief minister said.  
Among the 29 polio cases reported nationwide, Sindh has nine, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has 18, while Punjab and Azad Jammu & Kashmir have one each police case.  
“I do not want a routine presentation regarding polio eradication,” the chief minister said and demanded a comprehensive plan from the health department.  
The new cases reported are two each from Thatta and Badin, while Mithi, Umerkot, Hyderabad, Qambar, and Larkana have one each. Most cases occurred because parents refused to give the polio drops to their kids, or children were not at home during vaccination campaign.  
The Karachi and Malir cases are due to refusal, the chief minister was told.  
Refusing polio vaccination is absolutely unacceptable, he emphasised. He questioned how parents could refuse polio drops and cause their children to become disabled.  
“Such refusal harms not only their children, but also spreads the virus to other children,” he added. 
Samples tested positive 
Environmental samples for polio in Karachi have tested positive, the meeting was informed.  
Currently, the polio virus is present in areas including Sohrab Goth, Machar Colony, Chakro Nalo, and Rashid Minhas in East Karachi. In West Karachi, virus presence is confirmed in Khamiso Goth, Orangi, and Muhammad Khan Colony in Keamari. In Malir, Bakhtawar Goth; in Korangi, Korangi Nala; in Central Karachi, Haji Merid Goth; and in South, Hijrat Colony and Manzoor Colony show the presence of polio virus.  
Drive from 13th 
The CM said that from October 13 the polio campaign must be conducted on a war footing and the entire administration must actively participate in the drive.  
He appealed to the public to come forward so that their children and their neighbours’ children remain polio-free.  
After receiving the briefing, the chief minister said that most of the new cases in rural areas had been reported from border areas of the districts. This time, he emphasised that the polio vaccination must also cover all nomadic families.  
Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas Divisions house nomadic families migrating from one area to another, he added.

• Pension liabilities rise to Rs1.055tr in 2024-25, driven by armed forces pensions         
ISLAMABAD: With some discretionary changes, the government announced on Friday that federal employees will contribute 10 per cent of their pensionable pay to qualify for a 12pc contribution from the public exchequer under the newly formalised contributory pension fund scheme. The total contribution rate will thus be 22pc, replacing the traditional pension system for new entrants.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) published the “Federal Government Defined Contribution (FGDC) Pension Fund Scheme Rules 2024” under the Public Finance Management Act 2019, which regulates the scheme according to the Voluntary Pension System Rules 2005 and Non-Banking Finance Companies and Notified Entities Regulations 2008. These rules supersede an earlier MoF order of August 2024, which had set the government’s contribution at 20pc.
On Aug 20, 2024, the MoF initially announced the introduction of the contributory pension scheme for new entrants to the civil government and armed forces. At that time, employees were to contribute 10pc of their basic pay, while the government was to contribute 20pc. The new scheme applies to civil employees appointed on or after July 1, 2024, including civilian defence staff, and will extend to armed forces personnel appointed from July 1, 2025, though the latter implementation is pending.
The government allocated Rs10bn for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget and Rs4.3bn in 2025-26 to support the new system.
The scheme was introduced on the advice of international lenders, notably the World Bank, to contain the rising pension liabilities, which the government has described as a growing fiscal risk. It does not apply to existing employees but aims to slow future growth in pension liabilities.
Federal pension expenditure is estimated at Rs1.055tr for 2024-25, up from Rs821bn in 2023-24 — a rise of nearly 29pc in two years. Armed forces pension liabilities account for Rs742bn in 2025-26, up from Rs563bn in 2023-24, an increase of about 32pc. Civilian pension expenditure is budgeted at Rs243bn for the current year, up 6.6pc from Rs228bn in 2023-24, reflecting some savings from reforms.
Under the new rules, only authorised Pension Fund Managers will manage the employer pension funds. The government, acting as the employer, will contribute 12pc of the employee’s pensionable salary through the Accountant General’s office, which will also ensure proper record-keeping and transfer of contributions.
The Accountant General will verify pension account details before salary payments and will collect and transfer employer contributions to the designated Employer Pension Fund. Employees will contribute their 10pc share alongside their salary deductions.
Employees cannot withdraw funds from their pension accounts before retirement. Upon retirement, they may withdraw up to 25pc of their accumulated balance, while the remaining amount must be invested as per the Voluntary Pension System Rules 2002 for at least 20 years or until age 80, whichever comes first.
Salary slips will include detailed information on employee contributions, employer contributions, and total accumulated balances.
The MoF will ensure annual budget allocations for government contributions and will enter agreements with Pension Fund Managers who support electronic transfer systems. These agreements will include mandatory insurance plans offering death and disability coverage, arranged by the Pension Fund Managers.
To oversee implementation and monitoring, the MoF plans to establish a Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC), which will temporarily perform the NBFC’s role until it is formally created.
In cases of resignation, termination, dismissal, or voluntary retirement, employee entitlements from the pension accounts will be determined by government rules issued from time to time.The new pension fund scheme marks a significant shift from the traditional defined benefit pension system towards a defined contribution model aimed at improving fiscal sustainability while providing retirement security for future government employees.

• PPP leaders question her mandate, see no point in ‘continuing alliance’
LAHORE: As Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst against it on flood and canal issues, the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
“Maryam Nawaz will never apologise (to the PPP) for raising her voice for Punjab. Rather, those (PPP leaders) who ridiculed Punjab in times of disaster should apologise,” the Punjab CM said while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the e-bus project in Lahore.
The war of words between the two sides, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N leaders met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces and the PPP leadership.
 
 

“I want to remind (President) Asif Zardari and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that I was deeply hurt when they held three press conferences in a single day mocking Punjab and spreading lies during the flood crisis here,” Maryam said, adding that she had remained quiet about Bilawal’s remarks because she did not want to get into a fight, as she was serving the people of Punjab “24 hours a day and did not have the time”.
She said Punjab wanted to build its own canals from its own resou­rces, but approval was denied at the CCI, and later protests were staged against Punjab. “If this isn’t provincialism, then what is?” she asked.
The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. “That water is the right of Punjab’s farmers, but it was politicised. Let me make it very clear… Whenever Punjab is targeted, there will be a response and a strong one. Think 100 times before talking negatively about Punjab,” she said.
Further targeting the PPP, she said when floods swept through Pun­jab, the people of one province (PPP in Sindh) not only wrongly criticised the PML-N government in Punjab, but also rubbed salt into the wounds. “If there is any issue in any province, do we level false allegations at press conferences? Do we spread lies? What we do is help them.”
Giving an example of how she had offered help to her party’s arch-rival during floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ms Nawaz said: “I called KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and offered him Punjab’s assistance during the floods despite him being a political opponent.”
BISP vs flood survivors data
On the Benazir Income Support Pro­­gramme, she said she did not wa­­nt the data of poor people but only that of the people affected by floods.
The Punjab CM also defended a controversial YouTuber who had made derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh over the canal issue.
“When someone (the YouTuber) apologises, you forgive them, right? But these people (PPP leaders) made fun of him. Still, I remained silent. However, I will not let this happen to another person in Punjab,” the PML-N leader warned.
 


False mandate, venomous speeches
Responding to Maryam Nawaz’s diatribe, PPP leader Sassui Palijo said: “Maryam Nawaz does not have a public mandate; rather, she is doing politics on charity seats. Without winning even a single genuine seat, Maryam Nawaz has been given the entire province. The people didn’t even find her worthy of seven seats, yet she was gifted a whole province. Where was your honour when you accepted a province on a charity mandate?”
Ms Palijo further said Maryam had no moral grounds to speak aga­inst smaller provinces, particularly Sindh. “Maryam’s domicile may be powerful, but in reality she is nothing more than a product of Form 47.”
She said false mandates and venomous statements cannot alter reality. “If there is ever a transparent election, Maryam Nawaz will not even be visible in the country’s politics. Her speeches filled with ethnic prejudice and animosity against smaller provinces have become a habit. But politics rooted in hate and lies never lasts long,” the PPP leader said, adding that the people of Sindh would never allow anti-Sindh dams or canals to be built.
Another PPP leader, Maula Bakh­­sh Chandio, said Maryam, after ousting her father Nawaz Sharif from politics, had now taken the driving seat and was targeting the PPP. “This alliance (of PML-N and PPP) cannot continue any more,” he said.

• Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’
• Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv
ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza.
Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan”, saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington.
He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”.
“Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House.
Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia. He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”.
 
 

He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc.
“It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity.
He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked.
He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank.
He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan.
Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said.
Flotilla
Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles.
He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return.
Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission.
The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza.
The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory.
The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police.
Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”.
Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody.
Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.”
The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”.
PM asked to apologise
Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence.
“If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said.
He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions.
The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier.
Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet.
“If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked. He noted that over 60,000 innocent Pale­stinians had been martyred in a brutal campaign of genocide, the likes of which the world had rarely witnessed.
Mr Qaiser categorically stated that Pakistan’s 250 million people would never accept recognition of Israel. “Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital,” he asserted.

• FBR, Punjab and Sindh govts under critical scrutiny for missing target, failing to meet cash surplus commitments
• Power sector shows improved recovery, lower circular debt
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan appears well-placed to secure over $1 billion as the third tranche of the Enhanced Fund Facility (EFF) despite some slippages, as the authorities enter policy-level talks with a visiting review mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday.
Informed sources said technical-level discussions had been concluded, indicating that the two sides would need to agree on a couple of waivers during policy-level engagements before wrapping up the review with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb by the weekend (Oct 9-10).
While the power sector has shown unusual performance in terms of improved recovery and a reduction in circular debt — through diversion of fiscal space allocated to subsidies and fresh replacement loans — federal revenues and provincial performance, particularly in promised budget surpluses and agricultural tax collections, have emerged as weak areas.
 
 

A combination of additional measures to be worked out over the next four days, along with relaxations in view of flood-related challenges, is expected to pave the way for the conclusion of the second review. This would lead to the disbursement of the next tranche worth over $1bn by early next month, subject to IMF board approval. The global political environment remains favourable for Pakistan, with major voting members backing the country.
According to the sources, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the provincial governments of Punjab and Sindh remain under critical scrutiny. The FBR not only missed the end-June 2025 revenue target by a wide margin but also recorded a similar shortfall in the first quarter of the current fiscal year — about Rs200bn, with a monthly average of over Rs65bn — despite an expansive transformation plan that included, among other things, a large fleet of vehicles.
The key question now is whether anticipated recoveries from court cases will be enough to bridge the gap or if additional measures will be required at the start of November.
Cash surplus commitments
On the other hand, despite being part of the coalition at the Centre, the Sindh and Punjab governments failed to meet their cash surplus commitments at the close of the last fiscal year, with Sindh even announcing a deficit budget at the outset of FY26. The IMF has used the review to push for corrective measures, as these slippages have also pressured the opposition-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to increase spending for political reasons, despite having so far maintained fiscal discipline.
Given flood-related demands, the provinces are unlikely to perform better this year, although they are being pressed by the IMF to correct their course. This pressure was reflected in Punjab chief minister’s public outburst on Thursday over being held accountable by the IMF for all financial matters. Punjab is required to deliver a Rs740bn surplus to the Centre, followed by Sindh with Rs370bn, KP with Rs220bn, and Balochistan with Rs155bn.
Moreover, both the federal and provincial governments have struggled to establish a comprehensive mechanism for agricultural tax collection. Given the recent floods, they appear more inclined to seek relaxations and waivers rather than implement the laws they passed last year to meet IMF conditions. The provinces have been attempting to link their budget surpluses to the federal government’s revenue collection performance. Both KP and Punjab have reportedly assured the IMF review mission that they will meet flood-related expenses from their own resources.
Although all provinces enacted agricultural income tax laws in time, their actual implementation and collection — scheduled to begin in September-October this year — remains uncertain, particularly due to the ongoing flood situation in Punjab and Sindh. As a result, authorities remain unclear about the extent of support required for flood-affected people, sectors, and infrastructure.
The dialogue also covered the rising circular debt in the gas sector, partly due to the shifting of liabilities from the power sector. The two sides are discussing benchmarking of the gas sector going forward, focusing on definitions and reporting mechanisms.
So far, the two sides have been unable to resolve issues related to compliance with the state-owned enterprises (SOE) laws, including matters concerning blue-chip companies under the Pakistan Wealth Fund and governance challenges such as public disclosure of assets and retu­rns of government officials across all tiers and organs of the state.
Overall, the authorities’ programme performance as of end-June 2025 has been mixed, and the outlook requires enhanced efforts. The IMF has reportedly rebuffed the authorities’ push for tax-related relaxations to incentivise the upgrading of ageing refineries — putting at risk around $6bn in fresh investment — on the grounds that such relaxations would be counterproductive to the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for climate change.
The policy to incentivise refinery upgrades had been announced two years ago in consultation with the industry, which was in the process of signing binding contracts when the authorities, under the IMF programme, committed not to grant any tax exemptions.
The Petroleum Division has argued that existing refineries produce significant environmental hazards during both refining and consumption, creating health risks and contributing negatively to climate conditions.
While the government is seeking funds under the RSF for various projects, it has been losing ground domestically due to the continued use of outdated refining technology, a situation it blames on what it describes as the IMF negotiators’ technical misunderstanding and the stance of the finance ministry and FBR.
Pakistan has largely met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025 but is lagging in meeting indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future implementation. Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.4bn climate-related RSF, the two sides must agree on both past performance and future implementation prospects.

In a telephone conversation with JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman, the PM said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had been assigned to lead these efforts and coordinate with friendly countries and international organisations.
A statement issued by the PM Office said that the discussion also focused on the broader Middle East conflict, particularly the urgent need for a ceasefire in Palestine and the ongoing violence against innocent Palestinians.
“[PM Shehbaz] reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, emphasising that Pakistan’s stance is clear and resolute. He reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position advocating for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem (Al-Quds) as its capital,” added the statement.
Later, the JI leader also took to X (formerly Twitter), saying that during their conversation, he had also conveyed his party’s reservations to the PM on the proposed peace plan in Gaza.
 






“I also expressed, on behalf of Jamaat-i-Islami as well as the entire nation, serious reservations regarding Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, and stressed that Pakistan must remain firm on the demand for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Justice Ali Zia Bajwa announced the verdict, allowing a petition filed by a young lawyer as a public interest litigation, challenging the practice of humiliating and exposing individuals in custody through media trials.
The judge observed that despite being fully aware of their statutory duties, institutions such as the police, FIA, Excise Department, Pemra and PTA had failed to curb the practice.
Reports submitted by these agencies admitted that exposing suspects during custody undermined investigations and weakened prosecution cases.
Justice Bajwa, in a strongly-worded ruling, held that “an arrest, however lawful, does not strip the accused of fundamental rights. Neither the cloak of custody nor the zeal of investigation can justify humiliation, public parading, or compelled confessions.”
He said coerced or publicized confessions amount to persecution, not justice.
The judge said the Constitution guarantees interconnected rights — including dignity (Article 14), liberty (Article 9), fair trial (Article 10-A), and protection against self-incrimination (Article 13) — that extend to every individual, whether free or in custody.
The judge termed custodial media interviews as “media trials” that prejudice public perception, erode the presumption of innocence, and damage the credibility of the justice system.
“Trial by media does more than prejudice the right of an accused to a fair trial, it dents the credibility of the entire criminal justice system,” the judge warned.
Issuing a set of directions, Justice Bajwa ruled that no law enforcement agency shall permit or facilitate media interviews of under-custody accused persons, as such exposure gravely tarnishes and compromises their dignity, self-respect, and future course of life.
The judge said the act constitutes a clear violation of fundamental rights and invites unwarranted public prejudice, declining the very essence of fair trial and due process.
The judge maintained that any violation of the order will constitute misconduct, and responsible officers will face legal proceedings.
The judge noted that the heads of investigating agencies shall bear responsibility for ensuring strict compliance and shall not disregard or condone any act of misconduct committed by their subordinates.
Justice Bajwa observed, “It is high time that the role of media be effectively regulated by the competent regulatory authorities to ensure that its unchecked conduct neither transgresses the limits of law nor encroaches upon the fundamental rights, dignity, and liberties of citizens.”
The judge said the humiliation of citizens at pickets and checkpoints by law enforcement agencies, through their exposure to the media for displaying performance, is condemnable.
The judge admitted that the law enforcement agencies are empowered to take action against individuals found involved in violation of the law, however, any attempt to secure media attention at the cost of the dignity, respect, or privacy of citizens shall not be permitted.
Concluding the judgement, Justice Bajwa stressed that freedom of expression under Article 19 of the Constitution cannot override the rights of suspects to dignity, fair trial, and privacy.
Advocate Vishal Riaz, the petitioner, had filed the petition in 2023 challenging the practice of recording interviews/confessional statements of suspects by the mainstream media and vloggers.
Through an interim order, Justice Bajwa had already restrained public functionaries from exposing under trial/custody suspects to media coverage and ordered the Pemra to ensure privacy of the citizens is not invaded by any person carrying a camera or mic.
