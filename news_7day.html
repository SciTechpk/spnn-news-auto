In the aftermath of the recent hostilities with India, several references have been made to 1971 by the prime minister himself. On Thursday, while on a visit to Azad Kashmir, Shehbaz Sharif said that Operation Bunyanum Marsoos was “divine retribution” for 1971. Earlier, while visiting troops in Pasrur last week, he asserted that the military had “avenged” the 1971 war.
 
 

While staunch defence of the country and the ability to fend off unwarranted Indian aggression are indeed something to be thankful for, we must not let triumphalism and hyperbole cloud our view of history, particularly of an event as traumatic as the separation of the eastern wing.
The fact is that we have not had any national-level reckoning of the separation of East Pakistan, and the creation of Bangladesh. Resultantly, our rulers have, over the decades, continued to make the same mistakes that were made in the lead-up to the 1971 war. Political disputes in the former eastern wing were dealt with through administrative and later security steps, largely because of Ayub Khan’s long spell of military rule, followed by Yahya Khan’s mishandling of the crisis, which by that time had reached existential proportions.
Politicians in both wings were not free of blame either; but the fact is that it was the martial rulers of the time who bore the ultimate responsibility for the loss of the eastern wing. No doubt, India played an extremely damaging role, meddling in what was essentially Pakistan’s internal matter and abetted the break-up. Considering these grim facts, is it apt for Mr Sharif to describe the recent thwarting of India’s hostile designs as revenge for the loss of East Pakistan?
 
 

Instead of evoking triumphalism, the latest clash with India requires Pakistan to soberly reflect on both its internal and external challenges. Defence of the country is non-negotiable, and the administration along with the armed forces must remain vigilant.
Yet it is equally important to face our internal challenges with sagacity and determination. Amongst the foremost of these is countering the wave of terrorism afflicting the nation, as well as reviving the economy. Internal political reconciliation is also essential. In short, there is much work to be done.
Once we put Pakistan on the path to prosperity, where its people have health, education and sufficient employment, where constitutional protections are extended to each citizen, and there is peace in the larger neighbourhood, we can say that the losses of the past have been ‘avenged,’ and that Pakistan has risen.

• IMF spokesperson rejects Indian claims regarding misuse of funds by Pakistan
• President meets IMF delegation, praises it for supporting Islamabad’s economic stability
ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday postponed the announcement of the federal budget 2025-26 by more than a week to June 10 amid inconclusive discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on some of the critical fiscal measures and to avoid the Eid break during the budget session.
Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion on Friday, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The minister’s adviser, Khurram Schehzad, confirmed that the federal budget for the next year will be presented on June 10, and the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 will be released on June 9. Earlier, the budget announcement was set for June 2.
 






Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Dawn that discussions with the IMF had just concluded, and it was thought that the budget announcement should be made soon after Eid holidays to ensure continuity of the budget session.
Sources said there was also a view that it would be difficult for the government to recollect a sufficient number of members of parliament from their hometowns for the budget debate if the budget was announced before Eid which is likely to fall on June 7.
Therefore, the budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.
Also, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was leaving for a whirlwind visit to Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Iran, and some other friendly countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, and would be unable to personally indulge in budgetary settings. He would be back from abroad on May 29.
As a consequence, the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) for finalisation of federal and provincial development plans set for Monday (May 26) has also been postponed to a fresh date to be set later.
 
 

Sources said the recent sudden announcement of national tariff policy envisaging a drastic cut in customs tariffs from 19 to 9.5 per cent on raw materials and semi-finished items for a few industries, besides the removal of additional customs duties, had also created a lot of concern among the relevant industrial sector.
The five-year tariff policy approved for inclusion in budget inclusion in the budget this year by the prime minister himself compelled the powerful industries to launch a counter campaign.
Coupled with this, the defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the wrap-up meeting with the finance minister, although discussions between FBR’s top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.
Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr. Staff-level discussions on the next budget began on May 14.
 
 

Sources said there is no plan the to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of carbon levy on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in second year to meet a requirement of Climate Resilience Support Fund (RSF).
The sources said the relief measures for the salaried class, real estate, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year’s budget.
India’s objections
As the talks with IMF staff concluded, the Fund’s spokesperson at its headquarters in Washington rubbished Indian concerns about recent approval by its executive board of $1.4bn in additional RSF support besides disbursement of $1bn second tranche of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
“The [IMF executive] board approved the disbursement after finding that Pakistan had met all performance targets and made progress on structural reforms”, said IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack at a regular news briefing, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.
 
 

An Indian journalist asked the spokesperson about the recent bailout package by the IMF to Pakistan, saying “the Indian government has expressed a lot of displeasure with Pakistan planning to use this package to build — rebuild — areas that allegedly support cross-border terrorism.”
Another journalist asked about the implications of the escalation between Pakistan and India on both economies, while another questioned what “safeguards the IMF has that its funds won’t be used for military or in support of military actions.”.
In response to the questions, Ms Kozack said the IMF’s Executive Board approved Pakistan’s EFF programme in September of 2024.
“The first review at that time was planned for the first quarter of 2025. And consistent with that timeline, on March 25, 2025, the IMF Staff and the Pakistani authorities reached a staff-level agreement on the first review for the EFF,” she said.
She added that the agreement was then presented to the IMF’s executive board, which completed the review on May 9. “As a result of the completion of that review, Pakistan received the disbursement at that time,” she said.
Ms Kozack explained that the global money lender had a standard procedure in place under its programmes, which allowed its executive board to conduct periodic reviews of lending programs to assess countries’ progress. The board, she said, particularly looked at whether the programme was on track, whether the conditions under the programme were met, and whether any policy changes were needed to bring the programme back on track.
She then said that Pakistan’s programme was approved after the country successfully met all of the required targets. Regarding the question on safeguards, she clarified that IMF financing was provided to members for the purpose of resolving balance of payments problems, therefore, in the case of Pakistan, all the disbursements received under the EFF were allocated to the reserves of the central bank.
“So, those disbursements are at the central bank, and under the programme, those resources are not part of budget financing. They are not transferred to the government to support the budget,” she said.
Zardari meets IMF delegation
President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday said that the IMF programme had played a supportive role in stabilising Pakistan’s economy, according to the APP.

The president, in a meeting with an IMF delegation led by the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department, Jihad Azour, highlighted the lender’s positive role in promoting economic development in developing nations.
He also acknowledged and appreciated the IMF’s contribution to Pakistan’s economic progress.
The delegation expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s efforts for economic reforms and implementation of the IMF programme, which they observed was progressing in the right direction.
Mr Zardari thanked the IMF for its support and cooperation with Pakistan and also appreciated the finance ministry for its efforts to improve the national economy.

The investigation was launched after the FIA received a report that an Afghan national, Agha Khan, had departed from Sialkot Airport to Saudi Arabia in May 2023 on a Pakistani passport and had not returned.
The inquiry team extended the scope of the probe following revelations that at least 41 Afghan nationals had left for Saudi Arabia via Sialkot Airport during the same period, allegedly with the connivance of FIA personnel posted there.
The FIA also sought the record of the 41 passengers in question from the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra), which said they were not registered with it.
The Director General of Immigration and Passports also confirmed that his office also did not have their record.
 
 

Though their passports bore scanned protector registration numbers at the immigration counter, the numbers were later confirmed to be fake.
The inquiry identified 10 FIA officials allegedly involved in facilitating the travel: Sub-Inspectors Asad Zameer, Suleman Liaquat Virk and Imran Shaukat Virk; ASI Saqib Ameer; and Head Constables Muhammad Shahzad, Shahzada Latif, Fayaz Ahmad, Muhammad Idrees, Muhammad Nawaz and Haider Ali.
All 41 Afghan nationals were also found culpable for travelling abroad on fraudulent documents.
However, the inquiry said that the role of the FIA’s supervisory officer in this matter will be determined later.
“How come the inquiry team could absolve the supervisory officer(s) in this matter as no junior staff could allow any suspected traveller to leave the country without the approval of their boss,” an official privy to the development told Dawn. “And in case of obliging the suspected travellers after receiving a bribe, the subordinate staff could not do it in isolation.”
“A deputy director has a supervisory role, and human smuggling is not possible without his nexus with the junior staff. The inquiry team seems to have given a clean chit to him, being a senior officer, and made junior staff a scapegoat,” he said.
The FIA also booked the 41 Afghans and six travel agents, including Mikael Bangia, Khalid Khan, Muhammad Daanish, Aslam Gulfam, Salah Shah and Zahoor Khan.
All those involved have been booked under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, the Emigration Ordinance, 1979, the Foreigners Act, 1946, the Passport Act, 1974, and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.

• Zafar says ‘ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off’
• Caution advised when ministers discuss water issue
• Shibli decries ‘tyranny of majority’ in Senate
ISLAMABAD: Senators on Friday made it clear that India would not be allowed to suspend or amend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) warning that any unilateral move to this effect would be treated as an act of war.
They said the treaty was a settled matter and international law would justify Pakistan’s military response if India blocked the water.
Speaking on a motion on the unilateral suspension of IWT by India, PTI parliamentary leader Ali Zafar said the impending water crisis was as serious a threat as terrorism.
“This is also a war thrust on us. The ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off,” he remarked.
 


The PTI lawmaker said international law and UN resolutions have called water a fundamental human right for the lower riparian regions.
Noting that India was violating international law by holding the IWT in abeyance, Mr Zafar said the UN Charter and resolutions and international conventions would permit any action taken by Pakistan in self-defence, including military action if India stops its share of water.
“If India stops a drop of our water, the [international] law, UN resolutions and international conventions say that Pakistan can destroy the structure through missiles, planes and soldiers”.
Calling the matter highly sensitive, he advised the government to be cautious while speaking about the issue because it may damage Pakistan’s case.
Senator Zafar stressed that Pakistan was fast moving towards a water-scarcity crisis due to climate change and increasing population.
The Indus basin is a “lifeline” for 90 per cent of people and crops that depend on its water.
He stressed the need to rise above party lines to tackle the water issue with India.
The opposition leader, Shibli Faraz, said IWT was a settled matter and Pakistan “should not even talk to India over the treaty”.
“It is a treaty and can only be changed with both parties’ consent. Otherwise, it stands as it.”
No government in Pakistan even has the mandate to change the treaty, he said, adding the government should not give a knee-jerk reaction and build up its case carefully.
He said water was a serious crisis for Pakistan and called for a “well-thought-out plan” to address it technically and internationally.
PTI Senator Humayun Mohmand also said talks shouldn’t be held on IWT.
The officials “should not be apologetic on the issue”.
 
 

JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza took a more cautious tone, saying it would be difficult for Pakistan to give a military response to a country that has an economy of $700 billion.
He said Pakistan had already lost its case over water with India at the international forums.
The JUI-F lawmaker said that a house committee comprising legal experts from all parties should be formed to examine all agreements with India, including the Shimla Agreement and IWT.
‘Tyranny of majority’
Earlier, at the outset of the proceedings, Mr Faraz deplored the way the Senate had been run for the past year.
He observed that democracy does not mean the tyranny of the majority.
“The house has been turned into a mere post office. We have to make ourselves relevant”, he remarked.

He regretted the frequent suspension of rules and hasty legislation, saying the role of the upper house of parliament must not be compromised.
Mr Faraz said the house “should be run in a democratic manner” and lamented that bills were tabled in the upper house without even sharing their copies with lawmakers.
He said the culture of debate in the upper house had vanished and stressed that it was a dangerous tradition.
Mr Faraz said it was the opposition’s responsibility to keep an oversight on the government’s affairs.
But the ruling coalition kept key committees, including the Finance Committee, with it to “willingly and wilfully destroy this spirit”.
He asked the members to play their role in restoring the dignity of the Senate and earn respect for themselves.
The PML-N parliamentary leader, Irfan Siddiqui, who was presiding over the sitting, agreed to most points raised by the leader of the opposition.
However, he recalled when he became senator in 2021 — with PTI in power — the situation in the house was no different.
He said only one minister used to respond to questions for all ministries back then too.
Mr Siddiqui agreed the question hour should be held. He said it may be taken as his ruling that any decision on the question hour in the future should be taken after mutual consultation between the government and the opposition leadership instead of taking a unilateral decision.
“I also agree that we should all try to enhance the dignity of the House and ensure good presence and representation. Details about legislation should also be provided to the members well in time,” he maintained.
Former deputy chairman and PPP lawmaker Saleem Mandviwala also said the question hour should be held regularly.

“For nearly 80 days, Israel blocked the entry of life-saving international aid,” he said in a statement. “The entire population of Gaza is facing the risk of famine.
“The Israeli military offensive is intensifying with atrocious levels of death and destruction.
“Today, 80 per cent of Gaza has been either designated an Israeli-militarised zone or an area where people have been ordered to leave.”

More than 50 Palestinians dead or missing in Israeli strike on Jabalia

Aid also began trickling into the Gaza Strip on Monday for the first time in more than two months, amid condemnation of the Israeli blockade that sparked severe shortages of food and medicine.
“Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law,” Guterres said. “As the occupying power, it must agree to allow and facilitate the aid that is needed,” he said.
More than 50 Palestinians were killed or went missing after an Israeli air strike on a residential building in the Jabalia al-Balad area of northern Gaza, Palestinian Civil Defence sources say.
Israeli drones targeted more than five locations near the entrance to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on Friday morning, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
When people rushed to help the victims, Israeli forces attacked them again, injuring several more Palestinians.
Separately, three people, including a young girl, lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment near Abdel Aal junction on al-Jalaa Street in Gaza City.
 
 

Two siblings were killed, and their father suffered critical injuries when an Israeli strike hit a home in the western camp area of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.
In eastern Khan Yunis, several casualties are reported after Israeli forces struck a home in the town of Abasan al-Kabira.
Israeli air strikes also killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters, Hamas officials said, underlining the problems hindering supplies from reaching hungry people in Gaza following Israel’s 11-week-long blockade.
The Israeli military claimed 107 trucks carrying flour and other foodstuffs as well as medical supplies, entered the Gaza Strip from the Kerem Shalom crossing point on Thursday. But getting the supplies to people sheltering in tents and other makeshift accommodations has been fitful.
So far, an umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said, 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday in the face of an international outcry.
But distribution has been hampered by looting by groups of men, some of them armed, near the city of Khan Yunis, the network said.
A Hamas official said six members of a security team tasked with guarding the shipments were killed. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
The aid groups network also said the amount of aid coming into Gaza was still inadequate and only included a narrow range of supplies. It said Israel’s agreement to allow trucks to enter the war-shattered enclave was a “deceptive manoeuvre” to avoid international pressure calling for the lifting of the blockade.

• FO slams Modi’s allegations
• UNSC condemns school bus attack
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani authorities on Friday said they would continue with intelligence-based operations (IBOs) to combat terrorism in Balochistan, instead of launching a large-scale kinetic military campaign at this stage.
“The intelligence-based operations would continue,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), during a joint press briefing with Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha near the military headquarters in neighbouring garrison city of Rawalpindi.
The joint appearance of military and civilian officials underscored the government’s unified approach to counterterrorism, especially in the wake of escalating regional tensions with India and aggravating security situation in Balochistan.
Their remarks come days after a suicide attack in Khuzdar targeted a school bus carrying children of military personnel, in which eight people, including six children, were martyred and dozens others were injured. Two more students Haider, 13, and Malika, 12, succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to eight.
 






Pakistan’s military had accused India of “planning and orchestrating” the att­ack using its terrorism proxies in the restive province.
Condemning the attack, Interior Secretary Agha said, “The attack on school bus in Khuzdar was an attack on our values, our education system and the very fabric of our society.” He added that initial investigations indicated the assault was orchestrated by India-backed terrorist operating as “Fitna al Hindustan” (Indian mischief).
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that terrorism in Balochistan was being tackled “rationally”, noting that Pakistan had developed advanced counterterrorism techniques through decades of experience.
 


“Intelligence-based operations are very effective way of dealing with terrorists. We are hunting them down and eliminating them,” he said. “The number of terrorists killed in these intelligence-based operations are much higher as compared to the large-scale operations.”
This emphasis on intelligence-based operations highlights the government’s preference for targeted strikes to minimise collateral damage, possibly in response to past criticisms of heavy-handed military campaigns.
Soft targets
The military spokesman said the military is currently conducting nearly 150 IBOs on a daily basis without disrupting civilian life. “The terrorist groups after suffering heavily at the hands of law-enforcement agencies are now attacking soft targets. This shows the effectiveness of our operations,” he added.
Interior Secretary Agha echoed the approach, noting that a broader military campaign akin to Operation Zarb-i-Azb could be launched if necessary, but only after all preparatory steps are completed. “If need be, there can be a major operation like Zarb-i-Azb but that would be at a later stage. Currently, all operations are continuing,” Agha said.
 
 

The reference to Zarb-i-Azb, a 2014-17 operation that significantly reduced militancy in the country, signals the government’s readiness to escalate if IBOs do not bring the problem of terrorism under control, but also its caution to avoid destabilising Balochistan further.
He added that the National Action Plan (NAP) was being “reinvigorated” to support future counterterrorism efforts. “All facets of the national action plan are being reinvigorated so that all domains including social, economic, legal, counterterrorism, information and political are fully functional,” he stated. “So that when we go into a big operation… all facets are in place.”
The NAP, introduced in 2014 after the Peshawar Army Public School attack, is a comprehensive counterterrorism framework. Its reinvigoration suggests a holistic approach to address not just security but also socio-economic drivers of unrest in Balochistan.
Proxies activated
Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted how synchronised attacks during the night of May 9 and 10 — involving 33 terrorist incidents in Balochistan — demonstrated collaboration between India and proxy groups in Balochistan.
“At a time when India was firing projectiles and missiles into Pakistan, it had also activated these proxies,” he said. “This synchronisation of attacks proved the collaboration between Fitna al Hindustan and India.”
 
 

He attributed India’s alleged targeting of Balochistan to Pakistan’s recent economic advancements in the province. “Balochistan has reached its take-off phase with improvements in the socio-economic sector… the inauguration of the airport in Gwadar and expansion of road network,” he said.
“Balochistan’s terrorism issue is being addressed rationally where military approach is one aspect. The problem is being addressed synergetically by all elements of national power.”
This holistic approach reflects the recognition that military solutions alone cannot resolve Balochistan’s complex issues
Agha reiterated the government’s readiness and resolve: “The state has the wherewithal and will to dismantle these networks and bring their handlers and perpetrators of these acts of terrorism to justice. Such actions will have consequences… Our resolve is firm and response will be decisive.”
Touching on recent tensions with India, the DG ISPR warned of dire consequences if provocations continue. “India is using terrorism as a tool against Pakistan through Fitna al Hindustan and Fitna al Khawarij,” he said. “Pakistan is on the other hand maintaining peace as a rational actor through the resolve of the people and the capabilities of the armed forces.”
He further condemned India’s “arrogant political mindset,” citing its refusal to address the Kashmir dispute and alleged suppression of minorities as the reasons behind India becoming a source of instability in the region.
FO rejects allegations
Earlier on Friday, Pakistan categorically rejected the “baseless, provocative, and irresponsible” allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan, asserting that such statements clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains, APP adds.
“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains. Such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms of responsible statecraft,” Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said.
 
 

He said that resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation was a grave breach of the UN Charter and established principles of international law and that this dangerous approach also undermined regional peace and stability.
The spokesperson said that Pakistan remained a consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism and any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism was factually incorrect and patently misleading. He said it was a tactic often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges, as well as its repressive policies in India-held Kashmir.
“India’s attempts to mask its serious human rights violations are well-documented and well-recognised by the international community. The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection,” he remarked.
He urged the Indian leadership to exercise responsibility and restraint as escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.
UNSC condemns Khuzdar attack
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, calling it a heinous and cowardly act that claimed the lives of at least six people, including four children, and left more than 50 others injured.
 
 

In an official press statement, the Council members expressed profound sorrow over the attack, which occurred on May 21, and extended heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families and to the government.
The UNSC members expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan, and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured, the statement read.

Vehicles cross the Gatidas area near Babusar Top after the road was reopened on Friday.—Dawn

GILGIT: Babusar Road, which connects the picturesque town of Naran in the Kaghan Valley with Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan, was reopened to traffic on Friday after remaining closed for seven months.
The scenic Babusar Top and Babusar Pass usually remain closed from November to June every year owing to heavy snow. Through Babusar Pass, the journey from Diamer to Mansehra takes seven hours, while the same distance is covered in 14 hours through the Karakoram Highway. The reopening  of this high-altitude pass is likely to increase tourist influx in GB  and also tourism activity across the Naran and Kaghan Valley and  adjoining areas.
Situated at an altitude of 13,700 feet above sea level, Babusar Top is a famous tourist spot. Tourists visiting Gilgit-Baltistan prefer to travel through Babusar Pass to enjoy the weather and breathtaking sights.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) has completed the road clearance operation two days ago after removing snow. Officials of Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan confirmed to Dawn that the Babusar road has been cleared for traffic and allowed traffic on both sides.
An official of district administration said that traffic on both sides was allowed on Thursday. The NHA crew cleared over 21 glaciers between Naran and Babusar Top in phases and Diamer district administration cleared snow avalanches on the Diamer side.
The Diamer district administration has suggested travellers to follow SOPs for travelling on the road as the traffic accidents report from Babusar top to Chilas of Diamer section annually. Diamer Police have established check posts at Babusar top and mobile towers have made functional to provide Internet facility.
A local hotel association said there has been a noticeable increase in the number of tourists from various parts of the country, with hundreds of visitors now arriving daily in Naran. Hotels, restaurants, and tour operators are reporting a sharp rise in bookings and activity, signalling a strong start to the summer tourism season, reports APP.
It added that the local stakeholders, including hoteliers and tour guides, have welcomed the reopening and are hopeful for a prosperous season, provided that authorities continue to ensure road safety and timely communication regarding weather conditions and travel advisories.

A Notam (notice to airmen) issued by the Pakistan Airports Autho­rity (PAA) said the ban on Indian aircraft using its airspace will remain in place till June 24.
“The ban on Indian aircraft flying through Pakis­tani airspace has been extended until 4:59am on June 24, 2025,” the PAA said.
The airspace will not be available for Indian-regis­tered, operated or owned aircraft or those leased by Indian airlines, including military flights with no exceptions, the Notam stated. The restriction will apply to airspace starting from the ground to unlimited airspace height, it added.
Under the directive, no flight operated by Indian airlines or operators will be allowed to enter or transit through Pakistani airspace. However, other inte­r­national airlines would not be affected by the ban.
 
 

India’s Civil Aviation Ministry issued a corresponding Notam, saying Pakistani-registered, operated, owned, or leased aircraft, including military flights, would be barred from Indian airspace through June 23.
India and Pakistan first imposed the airspace restrictions last month after the shooting in India-occupied Kashmir.
On April 24, Pakistan had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.

Four bodies have been pulled from vast tides of floodwater engulfing parts of northern New South Wales, a fertile region of rivers and valleys some 400kms up the coast from Sydney.
Salvage crews launched a major clean-up operation as waters receded a bit on Friday, surveying the damage from half a year’s worth of rain dumped in just three days.
Kinne Ring, mayor of the flood-stricken farming town of Kempsey, said dozens of businesses had been swamped.
State Emergency Serv­ice boss Dallas Burnes said more than 2,000 workers had been deployed on rescue and recovery missions.
“A real focus for us at the moment will be resupplying the isolated communities,” he said, adding that 50,000 people were still stranded.
People clambered atop cars, houses and highway bridges before helicopters winched them away.
The storms have dumped more than six months’ worth of rain over three days, the government weather bureau has said, smashing flood-height records in some areas.
“These are horrific circumstances,” Prime Min­ister Anthony Albanese said Friday as he travelled into the disaster zone.
“There’s been massive damage to infrastructure and we’re going to have to all really pitch in.”

Around 6:30pm (1600 GMT), Hamburg police said on X they were carrying out a major operation at the main train station in Germany’s second-largest city.
“A person injured several people with a knife at the main train station” and a suspect had been arrested, they said. The suspect, police subsequently said, was a 39-year-old woman who was thought to have “acted alone”.
Investigations into the incident were “running at full speed”, police said, without giving an indication of a possible motive.
 






A spokesman for the Hamburg fire department told AFP that 12 people had been injured in the knife attack. Among them were “six people with life-threatening injuries”, the spokesman said.
German media, however, reported that the number of people with very severe injuries was lower.
Security concerns
The attack took place around 6:00 pm in the middle of rush hour at the end of the working week, according to German media.
The suspect was thought to have carried out the attack “against passengers” at the station, a spokeswoman for the Hanover federal police directorate, which also covers Hamburg, told AFP.
Images of the scene showed access to the platforms at one end of the station blocked off by police and people being loaded into waiting ambulances.
Some of the victims in the attack were being treated on board waiting trains in the station, Bild reported.
German rail operator Deutsche Bahn said on X that four platforms at the station had been closed.
The incident would lead to “delays and diversions in long-distance services”, Deutsche Bahn said in a post on X.
 






Germany has been rocked in recent months by a series of violent attacks with extremist motivations that have put security at the top of the agenda.
The most recent, on Sunday, saw four people injured in a stabbing at a bar in the city of Bielefeld.
The investigation into the attack had been handed over to federal prosecutors after the Syrian suspect in the attack told the police officers who arrested him that he had extremist beliefs.
The question of security, and the immigrant origin of many of the attackers, was a major topic during Germany’s recent election campaign.
The vote at the end of February saw the conservative CDU/CSU top the polls and a record score of over 20 per cent for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p><small>2025-05-23 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2322284663552eb.jpg?r=223043' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912867/federal-budget-to-be-presented-on-june-10-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Federal budget to be presented on June 10: Finance Ministry</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister, Khurram Schehzad, on Friday announced that the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 will be presented on June 10.
Earlier, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal announced that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
The adviser published a post on X today, which read, “The Federal Budget for FY 2025–26 of Pakistan will be presented on June 10, 2025.
“The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024–25 will be released a day before the Federal Budget, on June 9, 2025,” he added.
 






Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.
 
 

Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.
The government also set an ambitious tax collection target for the Federal Board of Revenue at Rs12,970bn, a 38pc increase from last year’s goal.
Earlier on Friday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “met all the targets” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.
During a press briefing in Washington DC, IMF Director of the Communications Department, Julie Kozack, said, “Our Board found that Pakistan had indeed met all of the targets. It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”</p><small>2025-05-23 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2317345482da4c1.jpg?r=173615' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912845/trump-renews-trade-threats-taking-aim-at-european-union-apple' target='_blank'><strong>Trump renews trade threats, taking aim at European Union, Apple</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to ratchet up his trade war once again, pushing for a 50 per cent tariff on European Union goods starting June 1 and warning Apple AAPL.O he may slap a 25pc levy on all iPhones bought by US consumers.
The twin threats, delivered via social media, roiled global markets after weeks of de-escalation had provided some reprieve. The S&P 500 fell 1pc in early trading, the Nasdaq fell 1.2pc, and European shares fell 1.5pc.
Trump’s broadside against the EU was prompted by the White House’s belief that negotiations with the bloc are not progressing fast enough. But his saber-rattling also marked a return to Washington’s stop-and-start trade war that has shaken markets, businesses and consumers and raised fears of a global economic downturn.
The president’s attack on Apple, meanwhile, is his latest attempt to pressure a specific company to move production to the United States, following automakers, pharmaceutical companies and chipmakers. However, the United States does not produce any smartphones — even as US consumers buy more than 60 million phones annually — and moving production would likely increase the cost of iPhones by hundreds of dollars.
“All the optimism over trade deals wiped out in minutes — seconds, even,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com, in a note.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Friday that the 50pc EU threat will hopefully “light a fire under the EU,” adding that other countries have been negotiating with Washington in good faith.
“The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!”
The European Commission on Friday declined to comment on the new threat, saying it would wait for a phone call between EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic and his US counterpart Jamieson Greer scheduled for Friday.
 
 

Envoys from the 27 EU countries are also due to meet on trade in Brussels later in the day.
Speaking to reporters in The Hague, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he agreed with the EU’s strategy in trade talks with the United States, and said the EU would likely to see this latest announcement as part of the negotiations.
“We have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US,” he said.
The White House paused most of the punishing tariffs Trump announced in early April against nearly every country in the world after investors furiously sold off US assets including government bonds and the US dollar. He left in place a 10pc baseline tax on most imports, and later reduced his massive 145pc tax on Chinese goods to 30pc.
“My base case is that they are able to reach an agreement, but I am most nervous about negotiations with European Union,” said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citigroup in New York.
A 50pc levy on EU imports could raise consumer prices on everything from German cars to Italian olive oil.
EU’s total exports to the United States last year totaled about 500 billion euros ($566bn), led by Germany (161bn euros), Ireland (72bn euros) and Italy (65bn euros). Pharmaceuticals, cars and auto parts, chemicals and aircraft were among the largest exports, according to EU data.
The White House has been in trade negotiations with numerous countries, but progress has been unsteady. Finance leaders from the Group of Seven industrialised democracies tried to downplay disputes over the tariffs earlier in the week at a forum in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.
“The EU is one of Trump’s least favourite regions, and he does not seem to have good relations with its leaders, which increases the chance of a prolonged trade war between the two,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.
Shares in Germany carmakers and luxury companies, some of the most exposed to tariffs, fell on the threats.
Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters on Friday that customers would have to pay a large part of tariff-related cost increases, and that it could become impossible to import the company’s smallest cars to the United States.
But he remained hopeful that Europe and the United States will soon come to an agreement.
“It could not be in the interest of Europe or the US to shut down trade between them,” Samuelsson said.
Apple declined to comment on Trump’s threat, which would reverse exclusions he granted on smartphones and other electronics imported largely from China, in a break for Big Tech firms that sell consumer goods. Shares fell 2.5pc in Friday trading.
 
 

“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday, referring to the Apple CEO, without additional details.
Any effort to impose a tariff on Apple alone would likely face legal hurdles, according to experts.
“There’s no clear legal authority that permits company specific tariffs, but the Trump administration may try to shoehorn it under its emergency power authorities,” said Sally Stewart Liang, a partner at Akin Gump in Washington. Company-specific tariffs would require long investigations, such as those on anti-dumping, Liang said.
Apple is speeding up plans to make most iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026 to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China.
But the odds on moving production to the US are slimmer. In February, Apple said it will spend $500bn over four years in nine American states, but that investment was not intended to bring iPhone manufacturing to the US.
“It is hard to imagine that Apple can be fully compliant with this request from the president in the next 3-5 years,” D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.</p><small>2025-05-23 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2310485178a7670.jpg?r=104858' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795/latest-round-of-us-iran-nuclear-talks-ends-in-rome' target='_blank'><strong>Latest round of US-Iran nuclear talks ends in Rome</strong></a><br><p>Iranian and US negotiators closed on Friday a fifth round of nuclear talks in Rome with “some but not conclusive progress”, mediator Oman said, after a public disagreement over Tehran’s uranium enrichment.
The talks, which began in April, are the highest-level contact between the foes since the United States quit a landmark 2015 nuclear accord during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, backing talks but warning of military action if diplomacy fails.
Iran wants a new deal that would ease the sanctions which have battered its economy.
“The fifth round of Iran-US talks have concluded today in Rome with some but not conclusive progress,” Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X, adding that he hoped “the remaining issues” would be clarified in the coming days.
 






Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei had earlier said that chief US negotiator Steve Witkoff had left the talks “due to his flight schedule”.
The fourth round of talks, in the Omani capital Muscat, ended with a public spat over enrichment.
Witkoff said Washington “could not authorise even one per cent” enrichment — a position Tehran called a red line, citing its rights under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
‘Fundamental differences’
Ahead of Friday’s talks, Araghchi said “fundamental differences” remained with the United States, while adding that Tehran was open to its nuclear sites undergoing more inspections.
“We will not have an agreement at all” if the United States wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, he said.
The talks came ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the October expiry of the 2015 accord.
The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aimed to allay Western suspicions that Iran was seeking a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition that Tehran has consistently denied.
 
 

In return for curbs on its nuclear programme, Iran had received relief from international sanctions. But the accord was torpedoed in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States and reimposed sanctions.
A year later, Iran responded by ramping up its nuclear activities.
It is now enriching uranium to 60pc — far above the deal’s 3.67pc cap but below, though close to, the 90pc level needed for a nuclear warhead.
‘It’s quite simple’
Analysts in Tehran said Iran was unlikely to back down.
“It’s quite simple; if the US expects Iran to halt nuclear enrichment, then there can’t be a deal,” said Mohammad Marandi, a political scientist who was once an adviser on the nuclear issue.
The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran says the country’s nuclear industry employs 17,000 people, similar to other countries where uranium is enriched for civilian use.
“The Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Brazil and Japan enrich [uranium] without possessing nuclear weapons,” its spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said.
Iran’s enmity with Israel, whose main backer is the United States, has been a constant backdrop to the talks.
In a letter to the United Nations, Araghchi wrote: “We believe that in the event of any attack on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Zionist regime, the US government will also be involved and bear legal responsibility.”
The warning came after CNN, citing unnamed US officials, reported Israel was making preparations to carry out such a strike.
The White House said Trump had a “productive discussion” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday about Iran and the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington.
‘Irreversible’
The 2015 deal provides for the possibility of UN sanctions being reimposed through a mechanism called “snapback” if Iran fails to fulfil its commitments.
The agreement’s three European parties — Britain, France and Germany — have warned they will trigger the mechanism if the continent’s security is threatened.
Araghchi said such a move would have “consequences — not only the end of Europe’s role in the agreement, but also an escalation of tensions that could become irreversible”.</p><small>2025-05-23 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23150002e7ab7a5.jpg?r=224729' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912830/khuzdar-attack-driven-by-indian-provocation-had-nothing-to-do-with-baloch-identity-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Khuzdar attack driven by Indian provocation, had nothing to do with Baloch identity: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that “Indian state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan” — which he said had been ongoing since the inception of the country — was also responsible for the recent attack in Balochistan’s Khuzdar.
On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
On Thursday, the army’s top brass, during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC), had also pointed out India’s involvement in the incident, vowing that the armed forces will prevent the country’s peace from being compromised by “externally-sponsored terrorism.”

Key points

Initial findings confirm that Khuzdar attack fits pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan
“Pakistan has irrefutable evidence of Indian involvement in terrorism,“says DG ISPR
DG ISPR, interior secretary reiterate that Pakistan will not let India succeed
Says BLA has expressed willingness to be Delhi’s “practical and military arm”
DG ISPR vehemently criticises BYC, says media needs to “unmask” the group
Says attacks have no relation to Baloch identity


Lt Gen Chaudhry was addressing a press conference in Islamabad today alongside the Interior Secretary, Captain (retd) Khurram Muhammad Agha.
“India was planning and instructing terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, the funding for which is also provided by India,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India’s provocation.”
The DG ISPR highlighted that the attack on the Chinese envoy in Karachi in Oct 2024 also had Indian backing. “The Indian social media accounts affiliated with the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) posted about the attack beforehand.”
 
 

He added that the same thing happened during the hijacking of the Jaffar Express train in March when more than 400 passengers were taken hostage by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists.
“Before the Jaffer Express incident occurred, they [the social media accounts] were asking followers to ‘keep an eye on Pakistan today and tomorrow’.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry pointed out that the Indian media was “celebrating” the attack in Khuzdar.
“These are all Indian accounts, affiliated with RAW [and] posting for BLA and Fitnah al Hindustan, he said, referring to the government-designated term for all terror outfits in Balochistan. “What kind of a country celebrates acts of terrorism?”

Indian involvement in terrorism ‘since inception of Pakistan’
The DG ISPR also maintained that New Delhi had been involved in perpetrating terrorism across the country “since the inception of Pakistan.”
“In 2009, the Pakistani government handed a dossier containing irrefutable evidence [of India’s involvement in terror attacks across Pakistan] to the Indian prime minister,” he said. “The publicly disclosed documents released in 2010 are part of history. In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the form of [Indian spy] Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,” he said.
Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016, in a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan’s Mashkel area for his involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.
“Then in [2020], a dossier full of evidence was presented to the United Nations. Very recently, the international media has seen confessions and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this Fitnah al Hindustan,” he said.
Interior Secretary Agha also said that India was behind the terrorist incident in Khuzdar on May 21.
“In the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in the early morning of May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children, our future, resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.
“Let me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, our education, and the very fabric of our society,” Capt (retd) Agha said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“On behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior, in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies, is looking into all [aspects] of this dastardly attack.”
Capt (retd) Agha said initial findings confirmed that this attack was a continuation of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan, operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing].
“Having miserably failed in the so-called Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed.
“Pakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan, reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the perpetrators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.”
He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, Fitnah al Hindustan has resorted to hitting soft targets, wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.
“Much against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted. I assure you that the State, in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus, will defeat them.
“These Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have … commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decisive. They will not succeed.”
‘Will we be deterred? Absolutely not’
Lt Gen Chaudhry then spoke about the Indian attacks on Pakistan on May 6 and 7, which were carried out by New Delhi after blaming Islamabad for April’s Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir and led to civilian deaths.
“Never in modern history have you seen any nation, any media celebrating the killing of children and women the way [India] is celebrating.
“This is the low moral fibre and level that the current Indian political elite has brought the society to.”
 
 

He said that one of the proxies of the Fitnah al Hindustan on May 11 issued a press release displaying a post from BLA.
In the post, he said that the BLA had assured India that if it received “political, diplomatic and defence support” from New Delhi, “We, along with the entire nation, is ready to attack from the western border and we will become its [India’s] practical and military arm”.
He said that RAW made BLA issue this press release “because they are unable to deter the state of Pakistan … They attack but the resolve of Pakistani people has not diminished.”
“Will we be deterred by the Fitnah al Hindustan with such press releases and cowardly actions? Absolutely not. Never,” he said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He further said, “Instead of refraining from their oppression of minorities or finding a solution, India is carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan and the region.”
“They are externalising internal issues and when anyone asks for evidence, they do not have evidence. Who is the state sponsor of terrorism and the epicentre of destabilisation in this region?” he questioned.
The DG ISPR also called out the Indian media for spreading propaganda and said: “The Indian media is not free but controlled by the state,” he said, adding that those who were questioning media freedom in Pakistan were now aware of how free it was, compared to the “conditions of media in a so-called democracy [India].”
‘Terrorists who surrendered confessed to having links with India’
Speaking about terrorists who had surrendered before the State, the DG ISPR said: “There were some brave ones who stood up and surrendered because they realised that they were not there to fight India’s war. They [surrendered terrorists] come and tell us how India was involved.”
He highlighted the case of Adeela Baloch, a former militant who had surrendered herself to the authorities.
“She was exploited and blackmailed by the Fitnah al Hindustan to become a suicide bomber,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, adding that India was “exploiting young women from Balochistan.”
In response to a question about a policy to counter Fitnah al Hindustan, the DG ISPR replied: “I would say that our one-liner policy is that the nation, this iron wall, we fought in a gallant and exemplary manner against the Indian military aggression on the night of [May] 6 and 7, and you saw it again on May 10.
“This steel wall needs to be in unison and turned against the forces of terrorism.”
The DGR ISPR further said: “We need to understand certain facts. Why did the Indians feel the need to resort to this military escalation? One of the very important reasons was that all elements of national power over the last two years have gelled together.”
He went on to say that Pakistan had begun “squeezing the space for terrorists to operate” and that in the first five months of this year, 203 terrorists had been killed in Balochistan alone.
“Illegal Afghans are being pushed out and actions are being taken against the crime-terror nexus. In Balochistan, illegal trade routes are being shut down to stop funding for these terrorists,” DG ISPR added.
Answering another question, the DG ISPR vehemently criticised the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and its leader Dr Mahrang Baloch, saying that the media needed to “unmask” the group and its membership.
“The state has taken action against the BYC [and] their space has been squeezed,” he said.
He said that India’s military escalation was a necessity to create space for their proxy groups in the region, but stated that Pakistan did not disengage a single soldier from its counterterrorism force.
“Did we take even one soldier out? No. Because we knew they would operate in unison.”
He added that India was growing frustrated and desperate, stating that the country’s media was “howling” about Balochistan.
“It is clear that this is not a war of the Baloch, it is a war against Indian terror proxies who are killing children for money. Once they know it, then they get worried,” DG ISPR said.
‘A rational player’
DG ISPR reiterated that Pakistan was the “rational player” in the scenario with India and stated that the Pahalgam attack took place due to “India’s own oppression in Kashmir”.
“Their response was totally irrational, illogical and unilateral,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “Pakistan is approaching the issue of terrorism in Balochistan rationally because we are resolving it in unison and with the synergetic application of all elements of national power.
“[The] military is one part, where we have carried out more than 93,000 operations across Pakistan in one and a half years,” he added. Another part is socioeconomic, another is diplomacy, while the other part is us sitting here telling the people and the international community that this has nothing to do with Balochistan.
“This is state-sponsored terrorism by India.”
DG ISPR added that Pakistan “striking Indian cities and temples” would not resolve the problem, adding that “that is not how a rational state acts.
“We are going to tell the world … that this is the epicentre of destabilisation in this region, India,” he added. “[They have] a history that starts from 1971 with the Mukti Bahini, and even before.

I will not name it now but there is proof, the world knows it.”</p><small>2025-05-23 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2320444684bd3c5.jpg?r=205004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912859/20-year-term-sought-for-french-surgeon-in-mass-patient-abuse-trial' target='_blank'><strong>20-year term sought for French surgeon in mass patient abuse trial</strong></a><br><p>A French prosecutor on Friday requested the maximum 20-year sentence for a former surgeon who admitted to sexually abusing almost 300 mostly child patients.
An additional trial will also likely be required for Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, to cover the cases of further victims whose abuse is not part of the current process, said prosecutor Stephane Kellenberger as he outlined the sentencing demands.
Le Scouarnec has been on trial since February accused of 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults on 299 people, mostly of minors under 15, at a dozen hospitals in western France, in one of the country’s largest child sex abuse cases.
He admitted in March to sexually abusing all 299 victims between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations.
Le Scouarnec, who is already in prison for a previous conviction for child sex abuse, should receive the maximum possible term of 20 years in jail on the single charge of aggravated rape, said Kellenberger.
Warning of the “high risk of re-offending” in the case of Le Scouarnec, Kellenberger said the defendant should serve at least two-thirds of his term in jail before being allowed any chance of parole.
Even once released, he should be placed in a centre for treatment and supervision, in a special but rarely used measure allowed under French law, the prosecutor added, pointing to the accused’s “serious personality disorders and the danger posed by these disorders”.
The verdict is expected on Wednesday.
Other victims ‘not forgotten’
The months of hearings have been marked by horror over the acts of the ex-surgeon, who confessed to the abuse, but also frustration over the failure of medical and judicial authorities to act sooner.
Kellenberger said that “in a case of this magnitude”, spanning from 1989 to 2014 and across multiple areas in France, the judicial authorities have not identified every one of the victims, at least within the time limits set for this trial.
But “these victims have not been forgotten”, and “further investigations are underway and could lead to a trial”, he said.
“There will probably be another Le Scouarnec procedure,” he told the court.
The former surgeon practised for decades until his retirement in 2017, despite a 2005 conviction for owning sexually abusive images of children.
Directly addressing the question of why the surgeon was allowed to carry on practising, the prosecutor asked: “Should Joel Le Scouarnec have been alone in the dock?”
“It could have been done better, could have been done differently, even with the well-known complexities of French bureaucracy, with everyone happily passing it on until it’s lost and hurts innocent people,” he said.
‘Utterly guilty’
The former surgeon told the court on Tuesday he also felt “responsible” for the deaths of two of the victims — Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.
Le Scouarnec said he had “come to terms” with his actions.
The former doctor is already in prison after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.
“He is utterly guilty,” said one of his lawyers, Maxime Tessier.
While the surgeon admitted responsibility, he also repeatedly said he did not remember his acts anymore.
There has been frustration among some parties in the trial that it has not had the impact in France that they hoped for. The case has not won the attention given to the case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed last year for recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his now ex-wife Gisele.
Many victims’ lawyers also questioned the sincerity of Le Scouarnec’s apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial, sometimes word for word.</p><small>2025-05-23 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/231837156eedf60.jpg?r=184437' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912850/pakistan-met-all-economic-targets-eff-decisions-taken-by-consensus-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan met all economic targets, EFF decisions taken by consensus: IMF</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “met all the targets” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.
Despite Indian attempts to derail Pakistan’s loan programme, the IMF approved the immediate disbursement of about $1 billion to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
During a press briefing in Washington D.C., IMF Director of the Communications Department, Julie Kozack, said, “Our Board found that Pakistan had indeed met all of the targets.  It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”
An Indian journalist asked the spokesperson on the recent bailout package by IMF to Pakistan, saying “the Indian government has expressed a lot of displeasure with Pakistan planning to use this package to build—rebuild—areas that allegedly support cross-border terrorism.” She also asked a question related to the “majority vote that was received in approving this bailout package for Pakistan on May 9.”
Another journalist asked about the implications of the escalation between Pakistan and India on both economies, while another questioned what “safeguards the IMF has that its funds won’t be used for military or in support of military actions.” The journalist also asked about the controversy about the termination of India’s IMF Executive Director, KV Subramanian.
In response to the questions, Kozack said the IMF’s Executive Board approved Pakistan’s EFF programme in September of 2024.
“The first review at that time was planned for the first quarter of 2025.  And consistent with that timeline, on March 25th of 2025, the IMF Staff and the Pakistani authorities reached a Staff-Level Agreement on the First Review for the EFF,” she said.
She added that the agreement was then presented to the Fund’s Executive Board, which completed the review on May 9.  “As a result of the completion of that review, Pakistan received the disbursement at that time,” she said.
Kozack explained that the global money-lender had a standard procedure in place under its programmes which allowed its executive board to conduct periodic reviews of lending programs to assess countries’ progress. The board, she said, particularly looked at whether the programme was on track, whether the conditions under the programme were met, and whether any policy changes were needed to bring the programme back on track.
She then said that Pakistan’s programme was approved after the country successfully met all of the required targets.
Regarding the question on safeguards, she clarified that IMF financing was provided to members for the purpose of resolving balance of payments problems, therefore, in the case of Pakistan, all the disbursements received under the EFF were allocated to the reserves of the central bank.
“So, those disbursements are at the central bank, and under the programme, those resources are not part of budget financing.  They are not transferred to the government to support the budget,” she said.
The IMF spokesperson added the programme provides additional safeguards through conditionality that includes targets on the accumulation of international reserves.
“It includes a zero target, meaning no lending from the central bank to the government.  And the programme also includes substantial structural conditionality around improving fiscal management,” she said, adding that any deviation from the established programme conditions would impact future reviews.
Kozack said that the appointment and resignation of an executive board member was the prerogative of any country, and it was completely up to the country’s authorities to determine who represented them at the Fund.
On the Pakistan-India tension, Kozack expressed regrets and sympathies for the loss of life and hoped for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
Earlier this month, the IMF had approved two major financing arrangements for the country — a $1 billion disbursement under the EFF and a new RSF aimed at supporting climate-related initiatives.
In a statement, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF Arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR or special drawing rights 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
President lauds IMF programme’s role in Pakistan’s economic stability
In a separate development on Friday, President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with a delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), led by the Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department Jihad Azour, highlighting the Fund’s positive role in promoting economic development in developing nations.
Discussing Pakistan’s current economic situation and the ongoing IMF programme, the president acknowledged and appreciated the IMF’s contribution to Pakistan’s economic progress, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
The delegation members expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s efforts for economic reforms and implementation of the IMF programme, which they observed was progressing in the right direction.
“The delegation further emphasised that the programme assisted in reducing inflation and fiscal deficit and strengthening Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves,” per the report.
President Zardari thanked the IMF for its continued support and cooperation with Pakistan and also appreciated the finance ministry for its efforts to improve the national economy, it added.
A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also held a meeting with the delegation, reaffirming his government’s commitment to fast track institutional reforms alongside macroeconomic stabilisation, asserting that Pakistan was now firmly on the path to economic development.
“Pakistan is now moving from economic stability toward sustainable growth,” the prime minister had said, emphasising that the government’s top priority was not only to sustain macroeconomic gains but to expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.

The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered ceasefire following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a mediator.
According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” the FO added.
“The prime minister will also be attending the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe, Tajikistan from 29-30 May 2025,” the statement read.
 






Earlier this week, the PM decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“In a telephonic conversation with Chairman Pakistan People’s Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him,” the report said.
The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report added.</p><small>2025-05-23 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23192027d5511e7.jpg?r=192045' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912852/harvard-sues-trump-administration-for-blocking-enrollment-of-foreign-students' target='_blank'><strong>Harvard sues Trump administration for blocking enrollment of foreign students</strong></a><br><p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration on Friday over its decision to revoke the Ivy League school’s ability to enrol foreign students, ratcheting up White House efforts to conform practices in academia to President Donald Trump’s policies.
In a complaint filed in Boston federal court, Harvard called the revocation a “blatant violation” of the US Constitution and other federal laws and had an “immediate and devastating effect” on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders.
“With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” Harvard said.
“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the 389-year-old school added.
Harvard asked a federal judge to block the revocation, citing “the immediate and irreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action.” The case was assigned to US District Judge Allison Burroughs.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed the lawsuit.
“If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with,” Jackson said.
“Harvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,” she added.
The termination of Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, effective with the 2025-2026 academic year, was announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
She said the termination was justified because of Harvard’s “fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party.”
Harvard defends ‘refusal to surrender’
In a letter to the Harvard community, the school’s president Alan Garber condemned the administration’s actions.
“The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government’s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,” Garber wrote.
Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 per cent of total enrollment.
 
 

In its complaint, Harvard said the revocation would force it to retract admissions for thousands of people and has thrown “countless” academic programs, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray, just a few days before graduation.
The revocation follows Noem’s demand on April 16 for a large trove of information from Harvard about student visa holders.
In a letter to Harvard, which was attached to the complaint, Noem said the information was needed because the university had “created a hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to Harvard’s failure to condemn antisemitism.”
On Thursday, Noem said Harvard could restore its certification by turning over within 72 hours a raft of records about international students, including video or audio of their protest activity in the past five years.
In his letter on Friday, Garber said Harvard responded to Homeland Security Department requests as required by law.</p><small>2025-05-23 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23203119c64355a.jpg?r=203131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912849/airspace-ban-on-indian-airlines-extended-until-june-24-paa' target='_blank'><strong>Airspace ban on Indian airlines extended until June 24: PAA</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Friday announced that the airspace ban on Indian airlines was extended until June 24 amid the recent escalation with India.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
On April 24, Pakistan’s top brass had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.
According to today’s statement by the PAA, “The ban on Indian aircraft flying over Pakistani airspace has been extended until 4:59 am on June 24, 2025. All Indian registered, operated, owned or leased aircraft will remain under the ban.
“No flights operated by Indian airlines or operators will be able to use Pakistani airspace,”  the authority said, adding that the ban also applied to Indian military aircraft.
The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times during the hostilities earlier this month. Pakis­tan reopened its airspace for all types of flig­hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-05-23 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2314181204659d8.jpg?r=144738' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912826/aseefa-world-bank-officials-hand-over-home-ownership-papers-to-flood-hit-families' target='_blank'><strong>Aseefa, World Bank officials hand over home ownership papers to flood-hit families</strong></a><br><p>Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, the youngest daughter of President Asif Ali Zardari, on Friday visited a flood rehabilitation housing project in Shaheed Benazirabad district of Sindh accompanying a delegation of officials from the World Bank.
The WB officials included its managing director Anna Bejerde and country director Najy Benhassine. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also accompanied them as they visited the flood rehabilitation housing project in Nazar Muhammad Laghari village in Shaheed Benazirabad district.
This project, under the Sindh Peoples Housing for Flood Affectees (SPHF) programme, aims at rebuilding homes destroyed by the 2022 devastating floods, said a statement by the CM House.
During the visit, Aseefa and Bejerde distributed ownership rights certificates to women homeowners, and interacted with female members of the Village Reconstruction Committee, as the latter showcased their handicraft work. The committee was briefed that 32 homes were destroyed in the village and had now been rebuilt.
 






Bejerde reaffirmed the Bank’s commitment to supporting the Sindh government in flood recovery efforts, praising the resilience of the local people and the leadership’s dedication.
She emphasised that sustainable community-level rehabilitation is achievable despite climate change challenges.
Aseefa highlighted that granting women ownership rights under the SPHF project is a historic socio-economic empowerment initiative by the Sindh government, significantly benefitting rural women.
The Sindh chief minister noted that over 2.4 million homes were destroyed in the 2022 floods. He said the Bank initially provided $500m to kick start the recovery, later increasing funding by $450m over two years. Murad said this assistance helped construct 778,000 homes, and allocate $54.92m for water, sanitation, and hygiene, benefitting 66,691 families in 1,000 villages.
SPHF CEO Khalid Mahmood Sheikh informed them that 104,822 homes were destroyed in Shaheed Benazirabad; about 60,000 are under construction, while nearly 40,000 are completed.
He said across Sindh, over 111,000 disabled people are receiving accessible homes, and more than 800,000 women have opened bank accounts for the first time, thereby promoting financial inclusion. He elaborated that the programme provides safe shelter to over six million people and creates more than a million new jobs.
They later also visited the Basic Health Unit Jam Sahib in Shaheed Benazirabad.
 






Earlier this month, Aseefa distributed ownership documents of houses to flood-hit people in Mirza Farrukh Baig village of Daur taluka.
Accompanied by Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, she visited the village and met womenfolk of the flood-hit families. She sat with some of the families in their newly-built houses and inquired about their problems.
Aseefa distributed ownership documents of the houses among female beneficiaries of the free residential project. The women apprised her of their issues which she assured that would be resolved.
“I have come here on behalf of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to give you the ownership documents … now you have your own roof with the ownership rights … I have fulfilled the promise made to you by my grandfather and former prime minister Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” she said.</p><small>2025-05-23 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23132757b48f01d.jpg?r=132801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912820/3-terrorists-killed-six-escape-in-mianwali-operation-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists killed, six escape in Mianwali operation: CTD</strong></a><br><p>Three terrorists were killed while six others escaped after the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) near Rehmanikhel in Mianwali, according to the specialised police force on Friday.
A statement issued by the CTD read that it conducted an IBO to arrest the terrorists.
However, the terrorists opened fire on the police.
In an exchange of fire, the terrorist killed three of their own while the remaining six escaped.
The police found rifles, three hand grenades, bullets and explosives on the slain terrorists.
A search operation was underway to arrest the terrorists who had escaped, the statement said, adding that the teams had set up a blockade near Rehmanikhel.
The process of identifying the slain terrorists was underway, the statement continued.
It added that the terrorists who were targeted had completed their planning for carrying out major attacks on police posts.
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police, in a statement, said that unidentified miscreants carried out “unsuccessful attacks” on Fatehkhel chowki in Bannu district and Takia post in Bara tehsil of Khyber district, adding that both attacks were repelled by the police’s immediate response.
A young man was injured in an exchange of fire in Bannu, the statement said.
KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police foiled the attacks with professionalism and courage, adding that the evil elements in society will be brought to their end.
“The soldiers showed great devotion to duty by remaining alert,” IG Hameed said, adding that the morale of the youth was high and they were determined to continue the struggle until terrorism was eradicated.
The IG paid tribute to the bravery of KP police and announced cash rewards and certificates of appreciation.
In a statement, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the forces for foiling the attack on a police post in Bannu and the killing of three terrorists in Mianwali.
He said that the Bannu police personnel bravely confronted the terrorists and foiled the attack.
He congratulated KP Police personnel for foiling the nefarious intentions of the terrorists, emphasising that the KP police were fighting the war against terrorism with courage.
The country “is proud of the brave sons of the KP police”, Naqvi said.
Speaking about the Mianwali incident, Naqvi said that CTD personnel bravely fought the terrorists.
Naqvi said he was proud of the CTD’s professional skills, adding that the team deserved praise for bringing down the terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Earlier this month, a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on Friday on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.</p><small>2025-05-23 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2311530974b2d45.jpg?r=121733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912808/naila-kiani-scales-worlds-third-highest-peak-kanchenjunga' target='_blank'><strong>Naila Kiani scales world’s third-highest peak Kanchenjunga</strong></a><br><p>Mountaineer Naila Kiani on Friday summited Mount Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain situated in Nepal, becoming the only Pakistani female mountaineer to summit the world’s 12 highest mountains above eight thousand metres.
The summit marked a historic milestone in her pursuit of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Mingma G, famous Nepali climber and the owner of Imagine Nepal, said that Kiani stood at top of the peak at 6am local time (5:15 am PKT).
Mingma G added  that after the successful summit, the expedition team started their descent to camp four and were heading towards basecamp.
Secretary Alpine Club of Pakistan, Karrar Haidri, congratulated Kiani for the feat.
According to press release issued by Kiani’s team, the achievement cemented her place not only in Pakistan’s mountaineering history but also on the global stage, etching closer to a rare and elite global record: becoming one of fewer than 20 women in history to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000m peaks.
It said that the summit push began at approximately 6:30pm on Thursday and continued through the night in severe high-altitude conditions, including intense snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.
“Despite the challenges, Kiani safely reached the summit, driven by unshakable determination and the support of a nation behind her,” the statement said.
“From Pakistan to Kanchenjunga, this summit is not just a personal milestone, it’s a message to every girl and woman in Pakistan and beyond: you are stronger than you think,” Naila said during her descent, according to the statement.
“I’m proud and grateful, but the journey has just started. Pakistan, this is for you.”
Before starting the summit push, through a message to her team, Kiani had said, “Climbing Kanchenjunga has been an incredibly difficult expedition and a harsh reminder of how hard it is to climb mountains over 8,000m.”
Kiani has already summited 11 out of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m, including Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu.
“Kanchenjunga is known for its treacherous terrains and unpredictable weather,” she added.
“But with determination and the support of my family, team and followers, I’m hopeful for a successful summit.”
Kiani has a bunch of mountaineering feats to her name.
Earlier this month, Kiani became the first Pakistani woman to summit 11 8,000m peaks in the world.
In April last year, she became the first Pakistani woman to climb Nepal’s Annapurna peak, the world’s 10th-highest peak, standing 8,091m tall. The next month, she went on to summit Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain, becoming the second Pakistani woman to do so.
In July, Kiani attained the feat of becoming the first Pakistani woman to climb the world’s ninth-highest peak, the 8,125m Nanga Parbat. The same month, she became the first Pakistani woman to summit Broad Peak, the world’s 12th-highest mountain at 8,051m.
Months later, Kiani and Sirbaz Khan became the first Pakistani duo to summit the 8,201m Cho Oyu, the world’s sixth-highest peak in China’s Tibet.</p><small>2025-05-23 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/231011036d3679d.jpg?r=101131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912791/pakistan-rubbishes-indian-pm-modis-bid-to-link-islamabad-with-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rubbishes Indian PM Modi’s bid to link Islamabad with terrorism</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday categorically rejected the “baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations” made by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in a heated speech accused Pakistan of carrying out terrorist attacks in his country.
The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
Yesterday, the Indian premier said that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.
According to a statement issued by the FO on X today, “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.
 






“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,” the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.
“Resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,” the FO said.
“This dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,” it added.
The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a “consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism”.
“Any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,” it continued.
It noted that the Indian premier’s tactic was “often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges”, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its “serious human rights violations” in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.
“The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.”
Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to “exercise responsibility and restraint”, the FO said.
“Escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.
“Rather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,” the FO noted.
It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to “peaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement”.
“However, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,” it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were “fully prepared and capable of defending the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“Any misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,” the FO added.
It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.
“The international community must take serious note of India’s aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,” it said, adding that it was “imperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia”.
“Glorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,” it concluded.</p><small>2025-05-23 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23102705aec89f7.jpg?r=102725' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912792/unsc-condemns-heinous-cowardly-terrorist-attack-on-school-bus-in-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC condemns ‘heinous, cowardly’ terrorist attack on school bus in Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council on Friday condemned “in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly” terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar earlier this week.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “relentlessly pursue” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad would present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on the school bus.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the UNSC condemned the “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” on a school bus in Khuzdar in the strongest terms.
In a press release, the UNSC said that the “reprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss”, with its members expressing deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government.
“They [UNSC members] wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,” it added.
The council reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”, underlining the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.
It urged all states to cooperate actively with the government of Pakistan, reiterating that any acts of terrorism were criminal and unjustifiable.
The council reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, according to the UN Charter and other international obligations.</p><small>2025-05-23 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23073951b0471f5.jpg?r=094316' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912760/army-chiefs-elevation-to-field-marshal-splits-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief’s elevation to field marshal splits PTI</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: There appears to be a split in the PTI over Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir’s promotion to the rank of field marshal, as its interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan felicitated the newly appointed field marshal as opposed to the incarcerated party founder, Imran Khan, who criticised the government’s move.
If a message posted on his X handle is to be believed, Imran Khan criticised the promotion in his interaction with lawyers, family members, and journalists during a hearing in the Adiala Jail  courtroom on Wednesday. The tweet was posted on Thursday morning,  however. It may be noted that the PTI leader had also met his sisters and lawyers, including Salman Safdar and Usman Gill, on the jail premises on  Wednesday.
 






The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of Mr Khan’s social media handler.
The PTI founder said it would have been more app­ropriate if Gen Asim Munir had been declared ‘king’ as Pakistan was being run according to the ‘law of the jungle’. He quipped that in the law of the jungle, “there is only one king”.
The harsh stance taken by the former prime minister comes in contrast to his party leaders, particularly Gohar Ali Khan, who also met him in jail on Thursday. Barrister Gohar told a local news channel that Allah has given the honour to COAS Asim Munir and also entailed responsibility. “I request all to improve/normalise the situation of the country,” he said.
Dawn.com quoted him as saying that there would be a formal statement by the PTI on the development. “This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated, but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better,” he told reporters outside the jail as per Dawn.com.

“We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial,” he added.
PTI leader’s sister Aleema Khan criticised the interim chairman, Barrister Gohar, in her interaction with media persons, saying that he gave the statement felicitating the army chief in his personal capacity. The opinion of the party is not the opinion of Barrister Gohar, she added.
“We have given the statement of the founder of PTI yesterday,” she said, adding that Barrister Gohar could speak for the PTI in the presence of the party founder. The founder clearly said yesterday (Wednesday) that there was “a law of the jungle here, it would be better if the army chief gave himself the title of the king”, she added.
Earlier this week, the federal cabinet approved the promotion of COAS Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal for his leadership in the recent conflict with India known as ‘Marka-i-Haq’.
‘No deal’
A post on Mr Khan’s X account said the rumours regarding a deal were not correct, but he still invited the establishment for talks for the sake of the country.
The post added Mr Khan did not want any deal or relief.
It was “unfortunate that the law only applied to the weak in Pakistan and it was against the principles of democracy and the rule of law”.
The post also criticised the drone attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and directed the provincial government to register a protest with the federal government and make sure that it was not repeated. He said that the killing of people with drones cannot reduce terrorism.
It added that Pakistan made a lot of efforts to stop drone attacks by the United States, adding that bombs should not be dropped on own people.
As per the post, Mr Khan praised the role of armed forces, especially the air force, which thwarted Narendra Modi’s attempts to attack Pakistan and suggested they be ready for such actions in future.
Gandapur’s IMF warning
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur warned the federal government that it could reconsider its cooperation with the federal government over the IMF conditions if party leaders were not allowed to meet the incarcerated leader.
Speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, the CM said the PTI founding leader was willing to initiate dialogue “in the best interest of Pakistan”.
He said that if party leaders were denied access to Imran Khan, the PTI would reconsider its cooperation with the government, including on key issues like compliance with IMF conditions.
Meanwhile, the PTI spokesperson issued a statement, condemning the delays in scheduling bail hearings in the cases of the party’s founding chairman.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Thursday, flayed the regime for allegedly subjecting Imran Khan to harsh conditions.
“Such oppressive and sinister tactics are destined to fail, as (Imran) Khan’s spirit remains unbroken and resolute as the entire nation stands firmly behind its leader. PTI will not hold talks…because they (government) did not have legal, constitutional and moral authorities in this regard,” he claimed.
He emphasised that the government should not trust India and refrain from resuming dialogue until it renounces terrorism, restores the Indus Waters Treaty, and reinstates the constitutional status of occupied Kashmir.

At a time of global and regional conflict, all efforts to bring together states in the neighbourhood are welcome. Two principal developments emerged from the meeting. The first was an improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, as both states agreed to exchange ambassadors.
Second, Kabul has been invited to join the multibillion-dollar CPEC scheme under the BRI. Along with improving ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan, these developments highlight China’s diplomatic prowess.
Beijing has quietly been making strides in international diplomacy. For example, in 2023, it helped broker a thaw between Saudi Arabia and Iran, while last year Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah signed a ‘unity deal’ in the Chinese capital. The trilateral effort bringing together Pakistan, Afghanistan and China is the latest in this series of diplomatic manoeuvres.
With Deputy PM Ishaq Dar and Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi by his side, Chinese FM Wang Yi highlighted the main outcomes of the talks. Significantly, he said it was “imperative to deepen Belt and Road cooperation, promote the extension” of CPEC to Afghanistan and improve regional connectivity.
Moreover, in an apparent nod to Pakistan’s concerns about the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Mr Wang called upon the three states to “oppose all forms of terrorism” and “jointly combat terrorist forces of concern to each side”.
 
 

Pakistan has valid concerns about TTP activity originating from Afghanistan, as the banned terrorist group has spilt much blood in this country. In fact, concerns about the TTP and other terrorist groups have been the biggest obstacle in the way of better ties with Kabul. Border and territorial disputes are also a matter of concern, and both sides have traded fire on account of these issues. Hopefully, with Chinese involvement, these matters can be addressed to the satisfaction of all.
If CPEC is extended to Afghanistan, and China increases its investments in that country, it could prove to be a regional game-changer. However, it must be remembered that trade and security are inseparable, and for the Afghan Taliban to take advantage of the opportunities ahead, they must take strong action against terrorist groups on their soil.
Trilateral cooperation and commercial activity can lead to prosperity for all involved, specifically delivering much-needed investment and jobs to Afghanistan. And, if the Taliban assure Afghanistan’s neighbours of zero tolerance for terrorism on their part, and promise basic rights to the Afghan people, it may even lead to international acceptance of their government. Here China could succeed where many others before it have failed — bringing hope and stability to Afghanistan.

• Govt seeks relief measures in budget; Fund reviewing proposals
ISLAMABAD: Amid week-long talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on next fiscal year’s budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fast-track institutional reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability.
During a meeting with an IMF delegation led by Regional Director for the Middle East and South Asia, Jihad Azour, the prime minister said the country was now firmly on the path of economic development after a period of recovery and stability.
“By the grace of Allah, Pakistan is now moving from economic stability towards sustainable growth,” PM Shehbaz said in an official statement.
He said the government’s top priority was to sustain macroeconomic gains and expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.
The high-level meeting took place at the last leg of negotiations between an IMF staff mission and Pakistan’s economic team to finalise next year’s budget in line with commitments made as part of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. The IMF mission has been in formal engagements with authorities since May 14 and is slated to conclude the visit on Friday (May 23).
The Fund wants the initial achievements under the programme to move into the next phase without compromising programme objectives. Central to that phase include effective implementation of Agricultural Income Tax across provinces, tangible recoveries from the retail sector alongside expansion of the tax net, financial devolution, and greater contribution from provinces for national security.
The engagements are likely to continue virtually until the announcement of the federal and provincial budgets and their passage by parliament to ensure no lapses from agreed budgetary propositions.
Sources said Pakistan has proposed modest relief measures in the upcoming budget, including a slight reduction in super tax, incentives for the real estate sector and relief for the salaried class.
However, the IMF has yet to reach a conclusion and is still examining the viability of such measures in the context of revenue target and expenditures and possible recoveries from litigation cases.
During the meeting, also attended by ministers for finance, planning, and economic affairs, besides the finance secretary and the FBR chairman, the discussions focused on the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF loan programme. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes, the official statement said.
The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress made under the reform agenda and assured the prime minister of continued support from the Fund in the country’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth, the statement added.
PM meets WB team
Separately, the prime minister also met a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde on Thursday and assured her of the steadfast implementation of the economic reform programme necessary to build a solid and sustainable growth. He told the delegation that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank’s development investment.
He hoped that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20bn in development investment to Pakistan and appreciated the World Bank’s assistance to the victims of the 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties.
Ms Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Programme.
Also appreciating Pakistan’s recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible and the bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework and uplift the Pakistani people for which policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth was necessary.

• Senate panel slams India’s ‘provocative action’
NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, a month after a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir led New Delhi to suspend a key river water-sharing treaty between the neighbours.
The attorney general for Pakistan, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islam­abad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to the decades-old treaty.
The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, was among a slew of measures announced by India against Pakistan last month after the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.
New Delhi had said the attack was backed by Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad den­ied and the nuclear-armed neig­hbours were involved in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on May 10.
“Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack … Pakistan’s army will pay it, Pakistan’s economy will pay it,” Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan.
 
 

The Indus treaty provides water for 80 per cent of Pakistan’s farms from three rivers that flow from India but Pakistan’s finance minister said this month that its suspension was not going to have “any immediate impact”.
The AGP, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters that Pakistan is “willing to talk about or to address anything”.
He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.
The treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,” he added.
The ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and “there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly”.
“The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message…that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,” Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS.
“If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,” he added.
Senate committee
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu­rs­day said India’s actions threatening Pakistan’s water security were “illegal”.
The committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.
The meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India’s actions.
Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.
He said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.
The committee unanimously condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.
“This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan”, said the committee in a unanimous statement.
It said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement could not be held in abeyance by one party and continued.
“The committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.”
The members vowed to “vigorously defend” Pakistan’s rights under the treaty at all international forums.
This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.
The committee also condemned India’s attack on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action “nothing less than water warfare and aggression”.
“India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan’s rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries”, the panel asserted.
The meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India’s aggression.
“We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.”
The panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
However, Pakistan “will not compromise on existential water rights”.
