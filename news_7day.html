The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
While the fire at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the total number of missing persons was 38, whose locations had been traced to Gul Plaza via their phone numbers.
He added that another 37 have been confirmed not to be present at the site. The total number of missing was earlier reported to be over 60.

 


Earlier, Mayor Wahab, who was present at the incident site overnight, said that the “blaze has been brought under control with the joint action of district administration, rescue agencies and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC)”.
He added that rescue teams were clearing the debris and had entered the basement of the mall and assured that “all possible help will be provided to the affected families”.
Wahab vowed that “until all missing persons are found and the rescue operation is completed, all departments of the KMC are to remain on high alert”.
Heavy machinery was also brought in to clear the mall’s roof, the mayor said.
The rescue teams have begun removing vehicles parked on the roof using cranes.
The mayor added that the heavy machinery will be present at the site until the operation is completed.
On late Monday night, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that 23 bodies had been recovered from the debris. He added that the body parts of some of the victims had been recovered.
In a statement, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal said that while “more than 20 bodies have been recovered, the final number of dead cannot be stated at the moment”.
“Some bodies have been recovered in the form of body parts from various locations,” he said.
“Until it is determined through a technical and forensic verification whether these parts are of the same person or different people, confirming the correct number [of deaths] is difficult.”
‘65 people remain missing’
On Monday, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Mayor Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing.
“Others are saying there are 77 missing, but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies, but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said.
He said that firefighting operations had concluded, and cooling work was ongoing.
“We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said.
The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received, but when rescuers accessed those areas, there were no signs of life.
He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution.
Asked about which institutions were responsible, the mayor said that assigning responsibility was not the primary focus at the moment. He said that an inquiry committee had been formed to ascertain the facts.
He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged which need to be investigated for negligence,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-20 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20101825ca88b9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968025/pm-shehbaz-to-lead-delegation-to-wef-summit-in-davos-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to lead delegation to WEF summit in Davos: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level delegation to the annual summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
According to a statement by the FO, the annual WEF meeting will be held in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland from January 20-22. PM Shehbaz will be accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and others.
The statement added that the prime minister’s programme includes “multiple substantive engagements”, including participation in the WEF’s Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders (IGWEL) session on “Restoring a Spirit of Dialogue in a Divided World”.
It added that the prime minister would also host and chair a Pakistan-specific “High-level Business Roundtable” with different corporate leaders.







“On the sidelines, the prime minister is expected to interact with several world leaders, including business executives,” it said.
“Articulating Pakistan’s perspective on global and regional peace and development and highlighting the government’s vision and achievements in the areas of economy, trade and investment opportunities will be part of the prime minister’s key messages during the visit,” the statement added.
According to the FO statement, the WEF Annual Meeting brings together political leaders, business executives, heads of international organisations and civil society representatives. It deliberates on contemporary geopolitical, economic, social and environmental issues.</p><small>2026-01-20 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/20101253f81dfe3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967956/cda-reviews-fire-safety-in-high-rise-buildings-in-islamabad-after-karachi-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>CDA reviews fire safety in high-rise buildings in Islamabad after Karachi tragedy</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prompted by the recent Gul Plaza inferno in Karachi, which claimed over 20 lives, city managers on Monday held a meeting to ensure proper fire and safety systems in all high-rise buildings of Islamabad.
They decided to conduct ground surveys of all high-rise buildings in the capital.
“Besides fire and safety systems, the CDA should also ensure that every building owner has a completion certificate, which covers fire safety, structural stability, and implementation of approved building plans,” said a CDA official.
He added that a majority of high-rise and apartment buildings in Islamabad have been operating without this certificate.

Completion certificate covers fire safety, structural stability, and implementation of approved building plans

The meeting, headed by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, discussed “detailed arrangements for current fire safety measures, making protective measures more effective, and formulating a comprehensive strategy for private and public buildings,” according to a CDA statement.
The civic body chief directed that all high-rise private and public buildings in Islamabad be formally surveyed and categorised. “He emphasised that all necessary fire safety measures and emergency exit routes must be mandatory in high-rise buildings,” the statement added.
A participant of the meeting said that the Karachi Gul Plaza tragedy was discussed. “Although Islamabad does not face similar risks, as most buildings here have good fire safety arrangements and are constructed according to approved plans, we want to ensure safety and emergency exits in all high-rise buildings to avoid any mishap,” he said.
He added that special focus will be on buildings 15 meters and above, of which around 600 are located in Islamabad.
The meeting was attended by CDA Board Member Finance Tahir Naeem, Member Planning and Design Dr Khalid Hafiz, Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon, Director General of Building & Housing Control, Director General of Capital Emergency Services, and other senior officers.
During the briefing, officials said that approval of a building’s fire safety plan from the CDA is mandatory before constructing any new building. For new private and public buildings, fire certification according to Pakistan Engineering Council standards is compulsory. Drones will also be utilised in firefighting operations in high-rise buildings.
“Chairman CDA said a clear mechanism must be established to ensure full compliance of sensitive and older buildings with fire safety regulations. He stressed that the fire safety audit system should be strengthened and fully implemented,” the statement said.
The meeting also directed the Capital Emergency Services, in collaboration with the district administration, to arrange regular simulation exercises in high-rise buildings. The chairman instructed that human resource requirements of the Capital Emergency Services be fulfilled immediately.
Officials reviewed the activation of a modern emergency operation centre using digital technologies and the establishment of new rescue stations at key locations across the city.
It is relevant to note that a completion certificate (also known as an occupancy certificate) is mandatory for every building once construction is completed. However, in Islamabad, many high-rise and apartment buildings, particularly in sector E-11, operate without this certificate.
“Building owners often avoid obtaining completion certificates due to additional construction,” said an official. He added that besides fire audits, CDA management will ensure every building has a completion certificate to guarantee the safety of all occupants.

The animal was spotted in the area about two months back after its long disappearance for more than 10 years.
The deputy ranger of wildlife department, Shafiq Ahmed, and regional programme manager of Snow Leopard Foundation, Jamigh Sherazi, told Dawn that after receiving a report about spotting of the snow leopard carcass, they reached the spot along with a team.
They said the carcass was frozen, which meant that the animal had died many hours before their arrival. They said the cause of death of the wild cat would be ascertained only after the postmortem was carried out in the veterinary hospital, where the body was being shifted.
Earlier, the leopard was spotted in Wakht, Munoor and Beghusht villages, which attacked the goats of the local people. The people had also been voicing concern about their losses.
The area has recently received snowfall forcing the animal to come to lower altitude areas in search of food and that was how it came in close conflict with the local population, an official said.
An environmentalist requesting not to be named told Dawn that the death of the wild cat might not be natural.

Courts were defanged, risky deals struck with old patrons of autocracies and political foes jailed, all in the name of national progress.
Since the claims are tall and mass misery great, public hopes are high about delivery, which is crucial for the government, too, to help mask its dubious mandate. So, 2026 must be the year of growth. But herein lies the rub. This set of rulers has more autocratic powers than all set-ups after Gen Musharraf’s, but they only help it to survive; its ability to use them to usher progress is weak. Painful IMF medicine was unleashed as well. It lowered inflation, but undercut growth. A recent national household survey shows that to recover from the cost of past inflation, strong growth is needed, which the IMF says may remain elusive even next year.
To spur growth, while also cutting our ever-rising external deficit, the set-up must raise investment and exports. Its best idea on exports so far seems to have been to set up committees of clueless people, while the best one on investments is to dash to Gulf states. But despite dozens of meetings, Saudi Arabia and others have given few inflows. We need industrialisation; instead, we seem to be chasing avenues such as crypto, corporate farming, mining and defence exports that may even impede major industry. What is on display is crony capitalism, autocratic excesses and a lack of ability to ignite sustainable and equitable progress.
Sadly, the main alternative to our crony capitalism is the free-market neoliberalism pushed by the IMF and like-minded national economists. While crony capitalism can’t provide even the first two elements of progress — stability and growth — neoliberalism fails on equity and sustainability. It is naïvely said that to have progress, we need reforms to cut taxes, reduce state size and deregulate across the board. But no major state has progressed based on this mix alone. The world’s fastest growing state for decades, China, ranks in the lowest category ‘repressed’ on the Index of Economic Freedom.

What is on display is crony capitalism.

Cosmologically, the debate rages on among adherents of natural evolution and intelligent design. But economically, global evidence shows that only an intelligent design developed by the visible hands of an able state delivers progress rather than natural evolution spurred only by the invisible hand of markets.
A state-led intelligent design for us must include strategies for ensuring industrial and export upgradation and expansion, cutting regional and class inequities, ensuring sustainability and lessening the twin deficits.
To pursue such a design, the state must not cut its size blindly — it must shed its fat, but develop muscles. Reforms on taxes, tariffs, subsidies, etc, under such a design are not open-ended, but sequenced to support all its elements, as done by China. People who talk of reforms without invoking such an intelligent design are as clueless as our hybrid set-up and the IMF.
But the minds who could lead such a progressive developmental design are nowhere to be seen in our economic and political arena. So, for the near future, we will continue to pursue an odd mix: pretending to implement neoliberalism but actually pursuing crony capitalism. None of our governments ever had the capacity to implement export-led growth, and all pursued im­­port-led growth.
The telltale sign of that was that in all our brief growth spurts in recent decades, foreign reserves fell despite growth, as it came from rising imports rather than exports. This raises the current deficit, depletes foreign reserves and takes us back to the IMF.
Unfortunately, this set-up faces a double jeopardy. It lacks the ability to provide export-led growth and also foreign reserves for import-led growth. Already, even with just two to three per cent growth, the external deficit is rising despite high remittances, as exports are stagnant while imports are increasing.
The big dreams of the civilians in the set-up are centred on being able to churn up growth before elections and thus shun the economic-political crutches and shackles of the IMF and hidden forces. But given the inability to crank up our foreign reserves despite the three-pronged strategy of ‘beg, borrow and squeeze’ from the local market, they may have to continue serving both for long. Meanwhile, the chances of salvation for the masses will remain distant until democracy and civilian sway prevail.

“Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions? Then you will find your doubts and your self will melt away.”
A young journalist put out a video clip last week that should have impressed Gandhiji. Some of the poorest men, women and children have been sleeping in the freezing Delhi winter, covered only with plastic sheets and gunny bags, outside AIIMS, India’s premier hospital. The people include very ill or old patients who have travelled for treatment from Bihar and Uttar.
It’s not that there is no night shelter outside the hospital, but it still leaves around 100 miserable people in the cold while they await their turn to see the doctor or be called for a procedure that could take days or even weeks to begin.
Reports from abroad are equally dismaying. India has never been humiliated like this. Donald Trump is misbehaving with everyone. Everyone is standing up to him, even Europe, but not India. All BRICS countries censured Trump for the military assault on Venezuela and the kidnapping of its president. Brazil is wary of the US because its president has been in prison at America’s behest. Yet it condemned Trump’s assault on neighbouring Venezuela.
South Africa and Russia expressed outrage, and China’s response was priceless. Expressing grave concern over the forcible abduction of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, China said: “Release them at once, stop toppling the government of Venezuela, and resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation.” And how did Vishwaguru, who plays host to the BRICS summit this year, respond?
“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the foreign ministry’s statement read. Not naming the US is understandable, given India’s desperate need to have a trade deal with Trump. But “recent developments”? Wasn’t the president of a sovereign country that once supplied oil to India just seized by the US military?

The very least the fractured parties can do is to stop carping at each other publicly.

It’s perplexing at the very least, therefore, that the Indian opposition continues to be in disarray, despite there being every reason for it to take a lesson from Gandhi’s talisman and give a piece of its mind to the government for an abysmal show at home and abroad.
There isn’t room for excuses. The opposition has known all along that the prime minister has acquired an elixir of invincibility from the handpicked election commission. Modi changed the rules to allow only him to decide who would be the election chief to govern the elections and how. Modi also closed all legal options to remedy what Rahul Gandhi described as “vote chori” or brazen theft of votes. Having slammed all forms of electoral malpractice and to good effect, what has the opposition done about it?
Thinking calmly and collectively should be their first action. If the elections have become a mere formality and the outcome is suspiciously one-sided, with little support coming from the supreme court, what should the people expect of the opposition under the circumstances?
The very least the fractured parties can do is to stop carping at each other publicly. And this is where it’s a curious mystery that Rahul Gandhi, who has spoken on earlier occasions of the need for a second freedom movement, hasn’t stood up, for the sake of peace among his opposition allies, to assure them that he would not be a candidate for the prime minister’s job without a complete consensus.
He could clarify that, though the Congress party historically had the widest nationwide reach, more than the BJP, it is not putting its hat in the ring for the illusory top job. Gandhi could say to himself, yes, the Congress can be influential outside the government. The communists were, as was Gandhiji. And the nation would owe a standing ovation to him and his family for helping create the conditions to unite the fractious opposition behind a common minimum programme. All this without eyeing power.
The overarching need for the Gandhis, together with the rest of the opposition, is to first get Indian democracy running again as prescribed by the constitution, and not by the wilful fiat of an autocrat. The resolution should not be about power sharing, if it can be helped, but about saving the country and restoring trust in its once fabled electoral democracy.
It just so happens that India is in a double bind for the opposition to take guard. It’s being plundered relentlessly by a handful of favoured corporates on the one hand, while being fractured by communally divisive politics on the other. The opposition must display moral courage to wage a veritable two-front battle. The businesses are wary of Gandhi as he speaks of crony capitalism. Communalism grows because its financiers are the same lot.
Above all, the problem is one of extremely selfish interests that the opposition masks. Last week’s headlines were cheering Prime Minister Modi for winning another municipal election for his party, this time in Mumbai. What was left unsaid was equally important. The opposition had cut each other’s votes.
Elections are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, where the communists are rooting for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s arrest. In Kerala, the communists have the Congress in their crosshairs. And each one of them was an enthusiastic member of the now almost-defunct INDIA alliance. Perhaps Rahul has a way of retrieving lost hope from Gandhi’s talisman.

Those of us brought up on Dastaan-i-Ameer Hamza and Tilism-i-Hoshruba imagined lone men on horseback rushing between cities and fiefdoms, carrying letters or messages to and fro. They were known as ailchis.
In this age of modern communications, when we can even chat the Jetsons way with a video call, one would have assumed we no longer need ailchis. But we still do. They are no longer needed for the mighty and powerful to communicate with each other as such — though the ‘stories’ about the various London plans suggest otherwise — but they are still used, town-crier style, to talk to the awaam, or masses, as we like to call them in English-language newspapers.
The more politically correct term would be ‘citizens’, but why bother to be PC when the awaam in Pakistan barely have any rights, which is perhaps what defines a citizen?
To return to the point, the powerful still need to pass on messages to those who are mere mortals. It can be a warning, a threat, a message or even a bid to test the waters. And this can be done via anonymous accounts on social media or through individuals known to enjoy the confidence of the powerful. In recent days, a few such well-connected people have been informing their listeners that those who have their ears are considering changing the voting age from 18 to 25. The reason being given is that if one can’t be elected to parliament before the age of 25, then those who make this election possible should also be of that age.
It was also pointed out, with considerable pain, that this was simply a proposal under consideration and no final decision had been taken. And this, in our hack world, ladies and gentlemen, is called a feeler — to use a news story to gauge the reaction. Test the waters, so to speak.

What if after yet another amendment, it turns out it wasn’t enough to increase the age to 25?

Why in the world, in the middle of crises such as convincing the IMF to ease fiscal restrictions, decisions about Gaza, a security crisis, and even rolling back the NFC, would the government take on another constitutional amendment? Especially if they still have not been able to create a consensus on the NFC and the provinces-versus-local-government debate? But then, these are useless questions — for who knows how the minds of the powerful work?
But it is an idea being taken seriously on talk shows. Analysts have discussed it and politicians have been asked about it. And a senior politico, when asked about it, did point out that Gen Z doesn’t even read manifestos before voting. Valid argument, because every 30- and 50-year-old is making voting decisions after a detailed comparison of the manifestos.
Dare one say, though, that the argument about manifestos or the uniformity between voting and eligibility age is all just red herrings? Justifications conjured up post-decision making are akin to being told that the 26th Amendment had to be brought in to ensure judges could be recruited from a wider cross-section of society than just a law firm or two in Lahore. Because two dynastic families prioritise fresh blood — even if it is only in the judiciary.
What might just remain unsaid — like other issues such as trees or conflicts to the west — is that the increase in the voting age will be aimed at the PTI’s support base. This stubborn Gen Z, which the state now associates with the party, has to be kept from voting for its preferred party, hopefully reducing the PTI’s chances.
But why would the powerful do this? For it would be yet another admission of failure. Why admit that the trips to universities and colleges, which began all the way back with the caretaker prime minister, all the laptop schemes and the grand events where students weep and credit the government for their success, have not worked? All those talk shows with students and the discussion about Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Maryam Nawaz being an inspiration for young people — will these conversations be discarded?
And will we be denied further conjecture on what happened when officials who can’t be named go to a university or college to ‘talk’ to future generations? And it might just mean that new, young leaders such as a television anchor and a former musician would give up their efforts to carve out a political career. Surely, this would be most unfair. This would deny far too much enjoyment to us mortals.
And what if after yet another amendment, it turns out it wasn’t enough to increase the age to 25? The 25-to-35 age group also outnumbers the 50-year-old group and is impervious to the old-world charms of the 1990s leadership. Will there be another amendment? It might just prove exhausting for the 70-year-old parliamentarians who will have to vote again.
Surely, it would be easier to simply hone the election management technique introduced before, during and after the 2024 elections. It has proved rather successful so far, and the judiciary, which tried to tinker with the results, has also been brought to heel. Why try and fix what is already working?
In fact, it is also important to point out that when there is a way to simply discard the votes of younger people, why bother disenfranchising them altogether? The latter might upset them more than they already are. Indeed, it would be better to insist that the current strategy is working and not admit to failure. Stick to the visits and the engagements, grooming new political leaders. Continue to win over the young, one weeping student at a time. And even if it doesn’t, the Election Commission is always there.

This tragedy did not come out of nowhere.
It grew out of years of regulatory neglect and inaction. And now, compensation announcements and inquiry committees will do little to address the failures that turned a commercial building into a death trap. Gul Plaza was an ageing, densely packed structure with more than 1,000 shops squeezed into narrow corridors, basements and upper floors.

 

Like many older markets in Karachi, it reportedly lacked adequate emergency exits, fire alarms and ventilation. Combustible materials, substandard wiring and overcrowding formed the perfect recipe for disaster. That such a building continued to operate in the heart of the city points to a system where safety rules exist largely on paper. The official response has been troubling.
Firefighting efforts were hampered by water shortage, access problems and crowd mismanagement. Residents and traders insist that a faster, better-resourced response could have saved lives in the crucial first hours. With a fire station only minutes away, these claims cannot be dismissed. When flames reignite days later and bodies are recovered in fragments, the cost of delay becomes clear.

 

The Sindh government has announced Rs10m in compensation for each victim’s family and promised inquiries, forensic reports and traders’ rehabilitation. These steps matter, but they follow a familiar script.
Similar assurances after past market fires led to little change. Inquiries rarely result in prosecutions, and rebuilding often ignores the flaws that caused the disaster. The central question is not what sparked the fire, but why such a building was allowed to operate for decades without corrective action.
Regulators tasked with enforcing building and fire codes have been weakened by political interference, leadership changes and tolerance of illegal alterations. Karachi has seen this before: factories without exits, markets without safety plans, high-rises without oversight. Each time, lives are lost, grief is expressed and compensation paid.
If the Gul Plaza tragedy is to mean anything, it must trigger more than condolences and cheques. It demands strict enforcement of safety codes, accountability beyond junior officials, and sustained investment in emergency services.
Without that, this will not be the last fire to show how governance failures can be as deadly as the flames.

The area has gas and electricity connections, and most streets are paved. Yet in 2026, his house has still never been connected to a water pipeline.
Like many of his neighbours, Jahangir plans his household routine around the arrival of a private water tanker, an expense that was once considered temporary but has long become permanent. What was once seen as an exception has quietly become the norm, as the experience is no longer confined to informal settlements.
Across Quetta, even residents of established urban localities are surviving without a regular public water supply. Instead, they are relying on private arrangements rather than a functioning municipal system.
To top it all off, unregulated use of tube wells, many of them illegally installed, has significantly worsened Quetta’s water crisis. Excessive pumping to compensate for weak public supply has rapidly depleted groundwater reserves, with extraction far exceeding natural recharge in the arid region.
Groundwater under strain
Behind people’s daily struggles lies a deeper structural crisis rooted in geography, climate and policy failure. Despite covering nearly 44 per cent of Pakistan’s landmass, Balochistan receives less than 200mm of annual rainfall, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. Data from the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) shows that agriculture depends on groundwater for over 90 per cent of its needs, while only five per cent of farmland is connected to canal irrigation.
In Quetta, groundwater levels are falling by two to five metres annually, driven by unchecked extraction, including more than 30,000 illegal tube wells, per the Balochistan Agriculture Department. Moreover, a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) shows that the water table has dropped from about 50 metres in 2,000 to over 150 metres by 2023, posing a serious threat to agriculture and livelihoods.
An issue long ignored
In September last year, Commissioner of Quetta Division Shahzaib Khan Kakar and Deputy Commissioner of Quetta Captain (Retd) Mehrullah Badini warned that the water shortage in the provincial capital was worsening with each passing day, urging joint action by the government and citizens. “We are going to announce a water emergency in Quetta,” they cautioned.

For residents, the problem is neither new nor unheard of. Jahangir said people living on his street have repeatedly submitted applications to elected representatives for pipeline installation, but their complaints were ignored, and no action was taken.
Fareed Bugti, a social activist living in the Nawa Kili Teachers Colony of Quetta, told Dawn that his neighbourhood is also deprived of basic facilities.
“The Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) installed a water pipeline in my area 10 years ago, but supply from these pipelines has not been restored to date,” Bugti said.
According to Bugti, the population of Nawa Kili has exceeded 200,000, yet the area relies on just two government-owned tube wells, which serve only Mandokhelabad and Pashtunistan Chowk.
“Citizens have installed hundreds of tube wells themselves without obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the local administration, due to which the groundwater level is decreasing day by day,“ he said. “And areas where there are no tube wells, people are forced to depend entirely on private tankers.”
Even where water is supplied, it is irregular. In some localities, residents receive water only once a day for a few hours, while others get a supply once a week.
Uneven relief across the city
While some areas have seen limited intervention, relief remains uneven and fragile. Shahryar Kasi, a resident of Shaldara on Kasi Road, said water shortages in the area were once severe. “Wasa used to supply water after a week or 10 days, and even that would stop within minutes,” he said.
He added that during the tenure of the previous government, a tube well was installed on Kasi Road, easing shortages in the surrounding areas. “Now we get water once a day, which has provided clear relief,” he added.
The situation, however, has not improved uniformly throughout the city, with many areas receiving water only once a week.
Khair Muhammad Dehwar, a resident of Kalat Street in the Jail Road area, said water supply deteriorated after Balochistan faced a prolonged drought from 1998 to 2006.

“Some tube wells installed by the government were damaged, but they never got repaired,” he said, adding that Wasa later refused to take over certain wells, citing insufficient groundwater.
“Wasa provides water once a week for half an hour or an hour, but due to low pressure, it does not reach houses at the end of the streets,” Dehwar said. “As a result, about 60 per cent of households have to order private tankers.”
In Pashtunabad, resident Rehmatullah Durrani said water is supplied for about an hour a day through a tube well installed at a school. “If it develops a fault and is not repaired, residents are forced to call tankers,” he said.
‘Water reaches nearby streets, not ours’
In several neighbourhoods, even state-led interventions have failed to deliver equitable access. Umair Parkani, a resident of Killi Bangulzai in Quetta Saryab district, said his neighbourhood has relied on private tankers for years despite elected representatives from his area making repeated promises.
A tube well installed during the previous government failed to supply water to the entire area due to insufficient groundwater. Although two damaged tube wells were later repaired, Parkani said water still does not reach his house. “It reaches only a few nearby streets. People living farther away still have no option but tankers.”
Others have to keep paying the water bill despite their houses being largely deprived of water.
Mansoor Ahmed, a retired banker living in the Smungli Housing Scheme of the Quetta Development Authority (QDA), said he spends thousands of rupees monthly to purchase water from tankers. Like others, he too has a water supply connection in his house, but receives water for just less than an hour on alternate days. Yet, he has to pay for the whole month.

“Even then, I keep paying the water bill for a full month,” Ahmed told Dawn, adding that the situation gets even worse during the summer months.
“People living in the area have no other option but to purchase water from the private tanker mafia,” he lamented.
‘Serious act of administrative negligence’
Concern has also reached the judiciary. On October 15, the Balochistan High Court (BHC) expressed strong disappointment over the severe shortage of drinking water in Hazara Town and surrounding areas, terming the deprivation of such a basic necessity a “serious act of administrative negligence.”
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen heard a petition, ordering immediate action from Wasa, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHE) and Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco). The court observed that residents were facing extreme difficulties due to poor inter-departmental coordination and funding delays.

Residents of Hazara Town, appearing before the court, claimed that a private water supply mafia was illegally selling water through Wasa pipelines. They claimed that citizens were being charged Rs30,000-40,000 for illegal connections and monthly fees of Rs2,500-3,000.
The court ordered the cancellation of illegal contracts and directed authorities to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply to operational tube wells.
Despite the court’s orders, citizens said the situation could hardly improve.
‘Planning and regulation failure’
Experts say the crisis reflects long-standing failures in planning and regulation. Dr Munir Ahmed Babar, Professor at US-Pakistan Centre for Advanced Studies in Water (USPCAS-W) at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, told Dawn that Quetta’s continued reliance on tube wells was fundamentally unsustainable.
“Quetta depends almost completely on groundwater, and that groundwater is going down by around one to 1.5 meters every year,“ he said. “This means that more water is being pumped out than nature can refill, while continuing to install tube wells — even solar-powered ones — is not sustainable.”
Dr Babar compared groundwater to a bank account. “Quetta keeps withdrawing without making deposits,“ he said, adding that with very low rainfall and almost no natural recharge, this approach will lead to dry wells, land subsidence, agricultural collapse and worsening drinking water shortages.
“Sustainability is only possible if new tube wells are restricted or banned, illegal wells sealed, groundwater pumping is measured and priced, recharge dams are built, and rainwater harvesting is introduced.
“Without regulation and recharge, Quetta is moving towards water exhaustion,“ he said.

Speaking about why alternative long-term water sources were not developed in the city earlier, he said, “Quetta did not fail because solutions were unknown. It failed because of weak governance, lack of long-term planning, political interests, and dependence on groundwater, because it was cheap and easy,“ he said.
He added that urgent regulatory steps are needed to protect groundwater and ensure fair access. “Every tube well must be registered and metered, tanker businesses regulated, illegal extraction criminalised and recharge infrastructure prioritised. Quetta’s water crisis is man-made, and only governance reform combined with conservation and recharge can reverse it.”
‘Arid climate, low annual precipitation main reasons’
Wasa Managing Director Mujeebur Rehman Kakar said the authority supplies water to just 51 per cent of Quetta’s population, which makes about 1.275 million people.
“We have 544 tube wells, of which 387 are functional,” he told Dawn, adding that around 1,000 may be unauthorised.

He cited arid climate, low rainfall, poor geology, droughts, rapid urbanisation and weak monitoring as major contributors to the crisis.
PHE Secretary Muhammad Hashim Ghilzai said Quetta requires 60 million gallons per day but receives only 31.575 million gallons.
He added that the Mangi Dam project, expected to be completed in March 2026, would initially supply 8.1 million gallons daily.
‘Situation needs dedication, time and proper planning without delay’
As pressure mounts to move beyond short-term fixes, officials say resolving Quetta’s water crisis will require sustained political will, strict enforcement and long-term planning rather than ad hoc measures.
Deputy Commissioner Quetta Captain (Retd) Badini said resolving the crisis would require sustained effort, expert input and strict enforcement.
“We are keeping an eye on the installation of illegal tube-wells,” Badini said, adding that the use of potable water for car-washing at homes and workshops had also been banned. He said efforts were underway to supply treated wastewater for irrigation, plantations and roadside trees.
“No one uses fresh water for irrigation, providing water for roadside trees and for lawns in the houses,” he said, adding that a drip system had been adopted for roadside plantations. He pointed to countries that avoid using groundwater, relying instead on rain, snowfall, rivers, lakes and dams to preserve underground reserves for future generations.
Badini stressed the urgent need to raise awareness among farmers and other segments of society about conserving groundwater. “We have left nothing underground for the next generation,” he said, noting how unrestricted solar-powered pumping had accelerated depletion.
The president of the Quetta Press Club, Irfan Saeed, also expressed serious concern over the crisis, questioning what future generations would inherit. Recalling his childhood, he said groundwater was once available at depths of just 15 to 20 feet and rose to 10 feet after rainfall.
“Water is life, and we are rapidly depriving it,” he said, urging the construction of dams to store rain and floodwater for future use.

In a letter sent to the Parliamentary Affairs Division secretary, the commission has proposed an amendment in Section 219(1) of the Elections Act.
Section 219(1) of the Elections Act in its original form reads: “The commission shall conduct elections to the local governments under the applicable local government law, and the rules framed thereunder, as may be applicable to a province, cantonments or Islamabad Capital Territory.”
The proposed amendment by the ECP, however, states: “The commission shall conduct elections to the local governments under the applicable local government law at the time of the expiry of term or dissolution of the local governments, and the rules framed thereunder, as may be applicable to a province, cantonments or Islamabad Capital Territory.”
Explaining the rationale for the proposed amendment, the letter refers to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which mandates that each province shall establish a local government system by law, devolving political, administrative, and financial authority to elected representatives.
According to the Elections Act, 2017 (Chapter XIII), the ECP under Article 140-A (2), read with Article 219 (d) of the Constitution, is under an obligation to conduct local government elections.
In the letter sent to the Parliamentary Affairs Division secretary, the ECP said, “Local government is an important tier and bedrock of democracy, which provides basic facilities to the public at grass‑root level”.
“It is observed that no government has generally shown readiness to conduct local government elections and the Election Commission faces difficulties in timely holding of local government elections as mandated under the Constitution and the law,” it added.
Issued with the signatures of ECP Additional Director General (local government elections) Chaudhry Nadeem Qasim, the letter went on to say, “In order to fulfil its constitutional obligation, the commission has always strived to hold timely local government elections but the federal and provincial governments repeal or amend the local government laws even after the expiry of the term of the local government which causes inordinate delay in the conduct of election and the commission faces difficulty in [the] fulfilment of its constitutional duty”.
It is worth mentioning that Section 219 (4) of the Elections Act states that the commission should hold polls within one hundred and twenty days of the expiry of the local government’s term.
In May last year, the ECP had explained its failure to meet its constitutional responsibility of conducting long-overdue local government elections in Punjab and Islamabad, with ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan blaming Article 140-A of the Constitution for the inordinate delay.
“If the political parties desire timely local government elections, an amendment to Article 140-A is inevitable,” the ECP secretary had remarked.
The ECP had already summoned the Punjab chief secretary and the local government secretary to appear in person before the commission on Jan 22 to explain the delay in activities required to hold long-delayed local elections in the province.
Experts, however, note that the ECP had vast powers under the Constitution and was in a position to assert itself for the timely conduct of local government polls.
They say that guarding against corrupt practices was a constitutional obligation, and it was clearly a corrupt practice to allow governments to defeat the spirit of the law by amending the law even after the announcement of the election schedule.
A legal expert also referred to section 219 (5) of the Elections Act, which reads, “The commission shall organise and conduct elections under this chapter and shall make such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law and that the corrupt practices are guarded against.”
He said that the commission cannot only bar the respective governments from amending the local government law after the announcement of the election schedule, but can also punish them if they fail to comply.
“Asking the federal government to amend the Elections Act against its political interest amounts to helping the government drag its feet in conducting the electoral exercise,” he remarked.</p><small>2026-01-20 03:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2008193113753f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967999/sc-regrets-apathy-towards-domestic-violence-victims' target='_blank'><strong>SC regrets apathy towards domestic violence victims</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court, in a poignant observation, has called out society for its apathy towards victims of domestic violence, noting that despite sustained maltreatment by their husbands and in-laws, women are still forced to return to the same abusive environments.
“With a heavy heart we state that in similar cases, where daughters are subjected to sustained maltreatment by their husbands or in-laws, it is the sad state of our society, though with a few exceptions, that families still compel them to return to the same abusive environment,” observed Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim in a six-page judgement regarding domestic violence in an abusive marriage case.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, a three-judge SC bench had taken up a jail petition of Khursheed Ahmad against the Feb 1, 2022 rejection of his plea by the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi bench.
The SC, however, upheld the conviction of the petitioner for the murder of his wife, Gulshan Bibi.

Husband’s conviction upheld as no evidence of natural death found

In the verdict, Justice Ibrahim expressed deep regret that women subjected to such treatment were undeniable victims of domestic violence and deserved protection, compassion and effective legal recourse. But societal pressures and entrenched cultural norms often compelled families to send their daughters back into circumstances that amounted to nothing less than a ‘living hell’, he observed.
Khursheed Ahmad was initially convicted by an additional sessions judge, Fatehjang (Attock), under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on Feb 12, 2021. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for his wife’s murder and directed to pay compensation of Rs200,000 under Section 544-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to the legal heirs of the deceased.

 

The petitioner then challenged his conviction before the LHC, Rawalpindi bench, which dismissed his criminal appeal though it also set aside the conviction and sentence under Section 302(b) of the PPC. Instead, he was convicted under Section 316 of PPC for committing Qatl Shibh-i-Amd and was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay Diyat amounting to Rs2,055,936 to the legal heirs of the deceased.
Through the present jail petition before the SC, the convict sought leave to appeal against the LHC decision. The apex court carefully examined the record and the evidence produced during the trial.
The SC noted that the convict, according to one of the prosecution witnesses, was unemployed, addicted to narcotics and frequently quarreled with his wife. In 2018, following repeated physical abuse, Gulshan Bibi left the petitioner’s house and began living with her parents. Upon the intervention of family elders, the parties reconciled and resumed cohabitation on the eve of Eid.
The witness deposed that he received a call from a woman residing in the vicinity of his sister’s house, informing him that the convict had murdered Gulshan Bibi, on July 21, 2019.
The complainant, along with his brothers Rasheed, Naseem Gul and Muhammad Akhlaq Ahmad, immediately rushed to their sister’s residence, where they found her lying dead.
Another prosecution witness, Muhammad Ali, testified that the minor son of the deceased and the appellant had informed them that during the previous night, his father, Khursheed Ahmad, had assaulted his mother with a wooden plank. He also alleged that one Raees Pathan had slapped her, as a result of which she lost consciousness and subsequently died.

GILGIT: A 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted Gilgit-Baltistan on Monday, killing one person, injuring four others and damaging dozens of homes, cattle sheds, and public and private properties.
The quake also triggered landslides that blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) and several other roads.
According to the Pakistan Mete­orological Department (PMD), the earthquake struck at 11:21am at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre located in northwestern Kashmir.
Meanwhile, the European Medi­terranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which reports magnitude using the Moment Magnitude Sca­le, recorded the quake at a magnitude of 5.7 at a depth of 31 kilometres. The EMSC said the earthquake was recorded about 58 kilometres northwest of Barishal in Pakistan.
Officials said that when the earthquake struck, heavy landslides occurred in mountainous areas, with clouds of dust seen rising from the slopes.
Gilgit-Baltistan caretaker Information Minister Ghulam Abbas told Dawn that a land-slide hit a motorcycle carrying two riders near Barswat Lake in the Ishkoman Valley of Ghizer district.
The riders were travelling from Imit village to Ishkoman when a falling rock struck them.
He said that Khush Baig, aged 60, a resident of Bilhanz, died on the spot, while Afzal Khan, aged 35, a resident of Barswat, was injured.
After receiving first aid at the Imit Dispensary, the injured man was shifted to the District Head­quarters (DHQ) Hospital in Gah-kuch, where his condition is rep­orted to be stable and out of danger.
The minister said the earthquake severely affected the Chipurson Valley of Upper Gojal in Hunza district. According to initial reports, the access road to the valley was blocked at multiple locations, while several kacha houses and cattle sheds were damaged or collapsed.
Rescue 1122 said that two children and a woman injured in the earthquake in Chipurson village were safely shifted from Chipurson to the Rural Health Centre (RHC) Hospital in Sost after receiving initial medical aid.
Mr Abbas said the Karakoram Highway was also blocked at multiple locations from Nagar to Khunjerab Top due to landslides. He added that machinery from the Gilgit-Baltistan Communi­cation and Works Department was mobilised to clear the roads, and the KKH and several link roads have since been reopened for traffic.
According to Rescue 1122, the most affected area was the Chi­pu­rson Valley in Gojal, Upper Hunza, located near the Pakistan-China bor­­der close to the Khunjerab Pass.
Hunza Deputy Commissioner Nizamuddin told Dawn that Chipurson was the worst-hit area. He said the earthquake’s epicentre was likely located in the surrounding vicinity.
He added that road access to the valley was blocked and, according to initial assessments, several homes, cattle sheds, and public and private properties were damaged. Large cracks developed in parts of the valley, while roads and water channels supplying power houses were also damaged.
The deputy commissioner said damage assessment was under way and would be completed once road access was fully restored. He added that the Chipurson Valley has been experiencing undergro­und tremors for several months.

WASHINGTON: The crisis in Iran, driven by economic collapse, soaring inflation and deep public anger, has underscored both the limits of external military intervention and the resilience of Tehran’s clerical regime, analysts and former officials said.
US President Donald Trump publicly encouraged Iranian protesters, warning Tehran that it would face consequences if it “violently kills peaceful protesters”.
But behind the scenes, Washington came close to — and then stepped back from — military action, exposing the operational, political and strategic constraints shaping US policy.
According to a detailed Axios investigation, senior military, political and diplomatic officials across Washington and the Middle East believed US strikes on Iran were imminent.
Preparations were real, officials stressed. US troops began evacuating from Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and from the Navy’s Fifth Fleet base in Bahrain, while Iran closed its airspace.
“It wasn’t fake or a ruse,” one US official told Axios. Yet by that afternoon, the moment passed. “It was really close,” another official said. “The military was in a position to do something really fast,but the order didn’t come.”
A central factor for the stand-down was force posture. Axios reported that since the last clash with Iran in June, many US military assets had been redeployed to the Caribbean and East Asia.
“The theatre was not ready,” one source said bluntly. Another added: “We sort of missed the window.”
Limits of military leverage
The lack of readiness shaped not only strike options but also contingency planning for Iranian retaliation, which US officials warned could endanger American forces and allies across the region.
Regional leaders reinforced those concerns. In a call with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel was not prepared to defend itself against Iran’s likely missile and drone retaliation.
He also believed the US plan “was not strong enough and wouldn’t be effective”, according to one of his advisers. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman similarly expressed deep concern about regional destabilisation.
A diplomatic backchannel also provided an exit ramp. Axios reported that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent messages to Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, committing to halt planned executions of detained protesters and “stop the killing”.
Trump later acknowledged the messages had an impact, though a White House official insisted they were “not the only reason”.
For now, US officials say military action remains “on the table.” However, the near-miss suggests Washington’s restraint reflected not just caution or diplomacy, but the hard limits of military leverage over Iran’s internal struggle and the high costs of getting it wrong.
Even if strikes had been launched, analysts say they would have done little to protect protesters on the ground.
Andrew P. Miller said foreign military intervention is unlikely to create a stable democracy, especially one that benefits the intervening power.
Any action would probably have been restricted to “a single or brief set of strikes”, avoiding ground troops yet risking Iranian retaliation and escalation, Miller added.
Sanam Vakil, of Chatham House, said Trump’s approach relied more on coercive signalling than intervention. The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, she said, was designed to pressure Iran’s leadership rather than shield civilians.
“His references to wanting an agreement and to ‘making Iran great again’ are transactional signals aimed at the leadership rather than Iranian society,” Vakil said. “The strategy is less about engineering internal change in Iran than about forcing its leadership to confront the limits of resistance.”
Regime resilience
Vali Nasr, a prominent Iranian-American scholar in Washington, emphasised the durability of Iran’s security apparatus. For protests to seriously threaten the regime, he said, parts of the state — especially the security forces — would need to defect.
“There is no sign of any defections … or that it has in any way fractured,” Nasr said. “I am not certain the balance of forces necessarily lies with the protesters.”
Sustained unrest over a longer period would be required to alter that balance, he added, highlighting the gap between public anger and the state’s capacity to withstand it.
Scholars also note that the protests remain decentralised and leaderless. While symbolic support exists for former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi or, less frequently, MEK leader Maryam Rajavi, most Iranians appear focused on internal change rather than exiled leadership.
Most experts agree there is little appetite inside Iran for either the restoration of the monarchy or the return of the MEK.

TEHRAN: Internet access in Iran will “gradually” return to normal this week, a senior official said on Monday, as the government faces international fallout from an 11-day communications blackout imposed during deadly anti-government protests.
The announcement came the same day organisers of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, confirmed the Iranian foreign minister would not attend the summit because it would not be “right” following the recent crackdown.
Simultaneously, the United Nations issued a report condemning Tehran for using executions as a “tool of state intimidation”.
“The internet will gradually return to normal operations this week,” Hossein Afshin, Iran’s vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said on Monday on state television.
The government imposed a nationwide communications blackout earlier this month amid huge demonstrations triggered by anger over economic hardship.
Limited internet access briefly returned on Sunday for some foreign websites such as Google, but opening links from search results remained impossible as of Monday.
The shutdown began on Jan 8. Norway-based Iran Human Rights said it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic Republic’s health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources.
The NGO warned the true toll is likely far higher. The media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not provided an exact death toll.
‘Not right’
Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the Davos su­­mmit in Switzerland this we­­ek, the organisers said, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran.
Abbas Araghchi had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday during the annual gathering of the global elite at the upscale Swiss ski resort town.
But activists have been calling on the World Economic Forum organisers to disinvite him amid what rights groups have called a “massacre” in his country.
“The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the World Economic Forum said on X.
“Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added.







‘Intimidation tool’
Iran appears to be using executions “as a tool of state intimidation”, the United Nations said on Monday, as it denounced a jump in capital punishment globally in 2025.
The Islamic republic reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
“The scale and pace of executions suggest a systematic use of capital punishment as a tool of state intimidation, with disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities and migrants,” he warned.
The spike in executions in Iran — which according to rights groups is the world’s most prolific executioner after China — had contributed to “an alarming increase” in the use of capital punishment worldwide last year, Turk said.
While the overall global trend continues to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty, Iran and a handful of other states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States saw executions surge.
“Many of those executions were “for offences not meeting the ‘most serious crimes’ threshold required under international law,” Turk said, also criticising “the continued execution of people convicted of crimes committed as children, as well as persistent secrecy around executions”.

MOSCOW: The White House on Monday extended invitations to leaders from Russia, Poland and Israel to join a so-called “Board of Peace” which aims to address global conflicts and manage governance and reconstruction efforts in Gaza.
While others weigh participation, Central Asian leaders moved quickly to accept. The press secretaries of Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev confirmed their leaders’ readiness to join the board.
Both leaders have been courted by Trump, who invited them to the G20 summit in Miami.
Meanwhile, the Kremlin said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin received an invitation to join the board, which would be chaired by Trump.
“President Putin also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. He said Russia was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington but did not specify if Putin was inclined to join.
Last October, Putin praised Trump’s efforts, noting that “he’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises”.
Additionally, Israel has received an invitation, though it is unclear whether it has been accepted. Furthermore, Polish president’s foreign policy adviser said that President Karol Nawrocki of Poland has also been extended an invitation.
As Washington canvasses for participants, Britain signalled its willingness to play a role. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that the UK was in discussions with allies on the terms of the initiative.
Speaking at a press conference, Starmer indicated Britain is ready to assist in the second phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, particularly regarding the US-led board.
‘Us or them’
However, the initiative faces significant internal headwinds within Israel. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to shut down the US-led Civil Military Coor­dination Centre (CMCC) established last October to support the peace plan.
“The time has come to dismantle the headquarters in Kiryat Gat,” Smotrich said in remarks distributed by his office, referring to the facility where international personnel work on post-war planning.
Smotrich, a far-right cabinet member, argued that Britain, Egypt and other nations “hostile to Israel” should be removed from the coordination centre.
“Mr Prime Minister, it’s either us or them,” Smotrich said. “Either full Israeli control, the destruction of Hamas, and the continued long-term suppression of terrorism … or permanent Israeli settlement.”
Smotrich added that Hamas should be given a short ultimatum to disarm and go into exile, followed by an assault with “full force” if refused.
Netanyahu’s office has not responded to Smotrich’s remarks but has previously criticised the composition of the Gaza Execu­tive Board — a body falling under the Board of Peace authority — citing objections to the inclusion of Turkey and Qatar.
“The head of state sent a letter to the president of the United States expressing sincere gratitude and confirming his agreement to join this new association,” Tokayev’s spokesman, Ruslan Zheldibay, said.
Trump originally proposed the Board of Peace as part of a 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. The White House recently announced the plan is moving to its second phase, focusing on demilitarisation and reconstruction, following a ceasefire in October that saw the release of remaining hostages.
According to a draft charter seen by Reuters, the board is described as an international organisation seeking to secure enduring peace in areas threatened by conflict. Trump has invited 60 countries to join, with permanent membership available to nations that contribute $1 billion.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s nati­onal transmission system, one of the largest in the world, suffers from a damaging mix of overloading and underutilisation, creating operational constraints that unde­rmine merit-based power supply and impose an unquantifiable financial burden on consumers and the national economy, the National Electric Power Regul­atory Authority (Nepra) has said.
In a detailed review of the national grid system, the regulator pointed out that the backbone of the transmission network — 500kV and 220kV lines — remained “mostly overloaded” at the close of FY2024-25. It said the National Grid Company (NGC) faced critical overloading in several sections of its 500kV and 220kV network, particularly during summer peak demand.
“Many grid stations and power transformers are operating beyond 80 per cent of their rated capacity, risking equipment failure, voltage instability and outages,” it said. In FY25, out of 192 transformers across 68 grid stations, 116 were overloaded beyond 80pc, it added.
Providing a breakdown, Nepra said 30 of 47 transformers at the 500/220kV level were overloaded beyond 80pc. In addition, 86 of 145 transformers at the 220/132kV level were overloaded beyond the same threshold.
Regions with notable overloading included Hyderabad, Islamabad, Lahore and Multan, with persistent constraints at key grids like Gatti, New Multan, Sarfaraz Nagar, Muzaffargarh and Sheikhupura.
“These limitations have led to reliance on expensive generation in violation of economic merit order (EMO) and rising project costs due to delays,” it said.
Ironically, most of these grid stations at Rawat, Sheikhupura, Gatti, Multan, Yousafwala, Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh have been in an overloaded condition since 2017-18 and onwards.
According to the review, these constraints have limited full power evacuation from the 1,300MW Sahiwal coal-fired plant, overreliance on Attock, Halmore, Sapphire and Liberty, limited transformation capacity in the south-central corridor and aggravated bidirectional power flows in the network.
The regulator called for fast-tracking the completion of critical transmission projects, upgrading existing substations with higher-capacity transformers and reactive power support, and enhancing real-time grid monitoring to address persistent overloading in the transmission network.
It said the resulting financial burden could not be calculated under current conditions because assessing the severity and duration of overloading would require hourly digitised operational data to determine how long a transformer or circuit operated beyond its rated capacity.

 

The regulator warned that transmission system constraints significantly impact the overall efficiency, reliability and affordability of electricity supply. When the transmission network lacks adequate capacity or flexibility, it restricts the flow of power from generation sources to demand centres.
“This leads to congestion, increased transmission losses and underutilisation of low-cost or renewable generation, ultimately raising the overall cost of electricity,” Nepra said.
“Transmission constraints not only raise reliability concerns for consumers but also lead to higher electricity tariffs. This is primarily because, in the absence of adequate transmission capacity, the system must rely on more expensive and less efficient power generation sources, even when cheaper alternatives are available but inaccessible,” it explained.
It said that one of the key challenges in the country’s power sector was the persistent inadequacy of the transmission system, particularly in evacuating electricity from cost-effective and indigenous generation resources located in the southern part of the country.
It noted that the system was often forced to rely on more expensive power plants in the northern region, which significantly increased the overall cost of electricity supply.
Despite the critical importance of resolving these issues, many transmission bottlenecks have remained unaddressed for years. The NGC has consistently failed to resolve them in a timely and efficient manner.
Observations show that nearly every second project undertaken by the NGC suffers from time delays and cost overruns. These delays not only inflate capital costs but also result in operational inefficiencies, such as the forced dispatch of power plants in violation of the EMO, leading to substantial financial losses for the power system.

 

The south-to-north transmission corridor remains a major bottleneck in NGC’s network, limiting the transfer of cost-effective electricity primarily from coal, nuclear and gas plants in the south to key demand centres in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
As a result, the system continues to rely on more expensive residual fuel oil (RFO) and re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) generation in the north, pushing up generation costs and tariffs.
The regulator cited the example of the overloaded 500kV Jamshoro and Matiari grid stations and their associated lines, which it said restrict power flow to about 1,800MW against available system capacity of 4,500MW. This bottleneck causes frequent load curtailment of up to 1,750MW of cheaper power. Evacuation of more than 2,000MW from Karachi’s two nuclear power plants was another example.
As a related event, the 4,000MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Matiari-Lahore transmission line, commissioned in September 2021 over 878km, still remains underutilised due to delays in completing the 500kV Lahore North substation and related transmission lines.
“This inefficiency imposes a financial burden on end-users despite the line’s full operational readiness,” the regulator said, adding that average loading of the line in FY2024-25 was recorded as 1,401.40MW with utilisation factor at just 35.04pc. There are many other such examples of smaller scale, Nepra noted.
The regulator also highlighted weaknesses in grid monitoring infrastructure. It said the original Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, the telecom backbone operational since 1992, had become obsolete due to the lack of hardware and software upgrades, impairing functionality.

In their petition, Advocate Saleem Michael and Muhammad Haris named the Sindh government, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, chief fire officer, Sindh Emergency Rescue Service director general, South deputy commissioner and director general of civil defence as respondents.
They stated that the “tragedy was not an unavoidable accident but a direct consequence of gross negligence, failure of inspection, non-enforcement of safety laws and maladministration by the respondents who are legally bound to ensure building and fire safety”.
Referring to a 2020 SHC order relating to public safety, fire prevention and protection of human life, the petitioners stated that despite a passage of more than four years, the respondents had “wilfully, deliberately and contumaciously failed to implement” the court directions.
The petitioners pleaded that the court declare that the Gul Plaza incident occurred “due to negligence, maladministration and failure of statutory duties by the respondents”.
They further sought the court’s directions for the respondents to initiate criminal, departmental and contempt proceedings against responsible officials.
The petitioners further urged the court to order a judicial or independent technical inquiry into fire safety compliance at commercial buildings across Karachi.

The restaurant was in the commercial Shahr-i-Naw neighbourhood of Kabul that includes office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said.
The district is considered one of the safest in the city.
The Chinese noodle restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community, Zadran said.
One Chinese national, identified as Ayub, and six Afghans were killed in the blast, which occurred near the kitchen, while several others were injured, Zadran added.
Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a large hole torn into the front of the restaurant building.
“So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCYs Country Director in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“Among the wounded are four women and a child … Unfortunately, seven people were already dead on arrival.”
There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosion. Authorities said they were investigating.
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the bombing and expressed grief over the loss of lives.
“The president conveyed sincere sympathy with the injured and their families and prayed for their early recovery,” the statement read.
“He paid tribute to the spirit of Chinese citizens who have continued to work for the development of Afghanistan despite rising insecurity and serious risks to their lives.”







According to the statement, the president noted the Afghan Taliban regime’s failure to honour commitments made under the Doha Agreement, particularly the obligation to prevent the use of Afghan soil for acts of terrorism.
“He recalled that Pakistan has repeatedly stressed that no terrorist groups should be allowed safe havens in Afghanistan and that regional peace and security must be upheld,” the statement said.
The statement noted that other countries neighbouring Afghanistan, including Tajikistan, were recently affected by terrorists operating from Afghan soil.
“The president further stated that the failure to establish a broad-based and inclusive government by the Taliban is contrary to the Doha Agreement,” the statement added.
“He emphasised that full implementation of the agreement, in letter and spirit, along with concrete steps to end cross-border terrorism, remains essential.”
The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the militant Islamic State group.</p><small>2026-01-19 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19222421695b82b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967874/italian-fashion-great-valentino-garavani-dead-at-93' target='_blank'><strong>Italian fashion great Valentino Garavani dead at 93</strong></a><br><p>Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani has died, his foundation said on Monday. The cause of death was not immediately known.
Usually known only by his first name, Valentino was 93, and had retired in 2008. Founder of the eponymous brand, Valentino scaled the heights of haute couture, created a business empire and introduced a new colour to the fashion world, the so-called ‘Valentino Red’.
“Valentino Garavani passed away today at his Roman residence, surrounded by his loved ones,” the foundation said on Instagram.
The lying in state will be on Wednesday and Thursday, while the funeral will take place in Rome on Friday at 11am (3pm PKT), it added.

‘I love beauty’
Valentino was ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of the great designers from an era before fashion became a global, highly commercial industry run as much by accountants and marketing executives as the couturiers.
Lagerfeld passed away in 2019, while Armani died in September.
Scaling the heights of high fashion, he was the first Italian to feature on the exclusive Paris haute couture catwalks.
Passionate about film, he dreamed as a young man of dressing the “beautiful ladies of the silverscreen”, as he called them, among them 1950s Hollywood stars Lana Turner and Judy Garland.
Valentino would eventually design Elizabeth Taylor’s wedding gown, and was the first choice for numerous Oscar winners, including Sharon Stone and Penelope Cruz.
His romantic designs, simple at first glance, were full of intricate detail.
“I love beauty,” Valentino said. “It is not my fault. And I know what women want: they want to be beautiful.”
The designer, who also dressed Jackie Kennedy, created a business empire under his own name before selling it off ahead of his retirement, in 2008.
‘You need a lot of patience’
Valentino was an only child, born into a well-to-do family in Voghera, south of Milan, where his father ran an electrical supplies company.
Having started drawing and appreciating high-end clothes from a young age, he studied couture in Milan and Paris, where he then worked as an apprentice for designer Jean Desss. He returned home in 1960, opening his own fashion house in the heart of Rome.
That year, Elizabeth Taylor chose a white Valentino gown for the premiere of blockbuster “Spartacus”.
Also in 1960, he met Giancarlo Giammetti in a Roman cafe. Giammetti would go on to be his partner in business and in life.
“To share life with a person for your whole existence — every moment, joy, pain, enthusiasm, disappointment — is something that cannot be defined,” Valentino said of him.
Giammetti took on the managerial part of the business, leaving creative matters to the designer.
“To be with Valentino as a friend, as a lover and as an employee is a bit the same: you need a lot of patience,” Giammetti said in ‘Valentino: The Last Emperor’, a documentary that followed the designer in the last two years of his career.
Valentino’s georgette fabrics, chiffon ruffles and ornate embellishments, including the exclusive budellini technique — where long strips of sheep’s wool are hand rolled into tubes, wrapped in silk and stitched together — won him a multitude of awards, including France’s highest civilian distinction in 2006.
“Fame and fortune didn’t change him,” Giammetti said at the time. “He is still the little guy I met 45 years ago.”
Superstitious and introverted, Valentino loved chocolate, skiing and his pugs. He told Corriere in 2017 that he was afraid of death.
‘The perfect moment to say adieu’
In 2007, he wowed Rome with lavish celebrations to celebrate his decades in fashion — a three-day event that included dinners, parties and exhibitions with thousands of guests flying in from around the world.
Months later he announced that he would stop designing for his company, which he no longer controlled after selling the firm almost a decade earlier for some $300 million.
“I have decided that this is the perfect moment to say adieu to the world of fashion,” he said. “As the English say, I would like to leave the party when it is still full.”
His last catwalk show was held in January 2008 in Paris, a city he called his second home and which he said had taught him to love fashion and life.
The business that bears his name was bought by Qatari fund Mayhoola for 700 million euros in 2012. French luxury group Kering bought a 30 per cent stake in 2023, with a commitment to fully acquire the business from 2026, but then deferred the move to 2028 at the earliest.
Valentino and Giammetti remained active in supporting the arts. Their foundation opened the PM23 gallery in the centre of Rome in 2025, next to the Valentino headquarters.
Fittingly, the opening exhibition — “Horizons/Red” — focused on the colour most closely associated with Valentino.
“Red isn’t just a colour,” Giammetti said at the time. “It’s a symbolic and aesthetic force of extraordinary power.”</p><small>2026-01-19 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1920290271973f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967872/in-first-speech-as-na-opposition-leader-achakzai-vows-unconditional-support-for-strengthening-house' target='_blank'><strong>In first speech as NA opposition leader, Achakzai vows ‘unconditional support’ for strengthening house</strong></a><br><p>In his first speech after being appointed the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday vowed unconditional support for strengthening the lower house of Parliament.
It is worth mentioning that several parts of Achakzai’s nearly 30-minute speech were muted in the NA’s livestream.
At the outset of his address, Achakzai said: “The TTAP makes a promise to the whole country — if you wish to strengthen this house … you will receive our unconditional support.
“Without this house, we are nothing,” he said, adding that the NA should be at the centre of Pakistan’s policies.
“Mistakes happen in the world. Sit, think, sleep on it, as they say in English. What’s happened has happened but having animosity and hurling abuse at each other will not help us,” he said.



Quoting the Holy Quran, Achakzai said that work which focused on welfare and aid must be supported. “Whenever you talk about the public’s welfare, our votes will be with you,” he asserted.
“We want this house to be a reflection of strength … that Pakistan’s domestic and foreign policies emerge from it,” he said.
Achakzai also requested that lawmakers treat each other with respect both inside and outside of parliament and refrain from “saying things you would not say in front of your mothers or sisters”.
In his address, Achakzai also said that he was not someone who “sold his vote”. He asserted that he had not broken the oath he had taken.
In his address, he also talked about PTI founder Imran Khan. He said he was grateful for Imran and the party for nominating him as the NA opposition leader.
He said he was also grateful for NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, for appointing him after a delay.
“For five months, this house functioned without an opposition leader, which is very wrong … these people are the true representatives of this house who voted for me,” he said, gesturing to the opposition benches.
“We are ready to go to any extent for strengthening this house,” he said, as the opposition thumped their benches.
Talking about the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, he said, “I wish they were used for strengthening this house … it is still not too late.”
He asked what the harm was in passing a resolution for withdrawing the cases registered against political workers. “If we pass a resolution for withdrawing the cases against aged women who are jailed, releasing them … if this house says that Imran Khan is the most popular leader … he is in jail and this house unanimously decides that he should be released; the [political] temperature will come down. All this boxing will end,” he said.
“If that cannot happen, then at the very least the bar on meetings with Imran should be lifted,” he said. “We are ready to cooperate with you for any positive development,” he said.
He said that what happened on Feb 8, 2024 had raised the political temperature in Pakistan. “To bring that down, you hold the button. If you lower the pressure, the road for dialogue will open,” he said.
Talking about Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, who has been nominated as the opposition leader in the Senate, he said, “We will cooperate with you in positive developments but excuse us from negative developments.”</p><small>2026-01-19 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19201440ee2cac5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967870/gilani-to-notify-mwm-chief-as-senate-opposition-leader-by-tomorrow-ptis-ali-zafar' target='_blank'><strong>Gilani to notify MWM chief as Senate opposition leader by tomorrow: PTI’s Ali Zafar</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI Senator Ali Zafar said on Monday that Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had communicated to him that Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas would be notified as the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament by tomorrow (Tuesday).
Speaking to Dawn, Zafar said he had submitted a letter to the Senate chairperson, seeking the appointment of Abbas.
According to the PTI senator, Gilani had accepted the opposition’s demand of appointing Abbas to the vacant position and said that an announcement about his appointment would also be made in the House.
In a post on X, Zafar said that he had a meeting with the Senate chairman regarding the appointment of the opposition leader.
“[The] chairman informed me that he has approved the appointment and directed the secretariat to issue a formal notification,” Zafar said.
He welcomed the decision, saying that the party would be able convey its perspective in the Senate more effectively.







The opposition leader’s posts in the Senate and the National Assembly (NA) had fallen vacant in August 2025, following the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz and Omar Ayub, respectively. The two were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan after their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023 riots.
The PTI had then nominated Abbas as its candidate for the opposition leader’s position in the Senate and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to fill the NA slot. After a months-long delay, Achakzai was notified as the NA opposition leader last week.
In his letter to Gilani, seen by Dawn, Senator Zafar recalled that the PTI had “duly nominated the honourable Senator Mr Raja Nasir Abbas for the post of the leader of the opposition in the Senate of Pakistan”.
“The continued non-appointment of the leader of the opposition is not only inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, but also runs contrary to well-established democratic traditions and parliamentary conventions,” the letter read.
It added that the “opposition is an indispensable pillar of any democratic system. A House without a formally recognised leader of the opposition remains institutionally incomplete, and its ability to perform its constitutional role of oversight, accountability, and meaningful debate is seriously undermined”.
“Parliamentary democracy rests upon the balance between the treasury and the opposition benches. Denial or delay in recognising the duly nominated leader of the opposition weakens democratic norms, erodes parliamentary decorum, and sets an undesirable precedent inconsistent with constitutional values and democratic practice.
“It is, therefore, once again respectfully requested that, in accordance with Rule 16(3) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, Senator Raja Nasir Abbas may kindly be appointed as leader of the opposition in the Senate of Pakistan at the earliest, in the larger interest of parliamentary democracy and the proper functioning of this august House,” the letter said.
Earlier on Monday, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali also spoke about the matter while talking to the media at the Supreme Court.
Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”.
He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today.
“Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said.
On Saturday, senior PTI leaders imprisoned in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail had demanded in a letter that Abbas be appointed the Senate opposition leader immediately.
The letter by PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and Omar Sarfraz Cheema was shared with the media by their counsel, Rana Mudassir.</p><small>2026-01-19 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19203454f76ad1c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967871/india-uae-sign-3-billion-lng-deal-agree-to-boost-trade-and-defence-ties-at-leaders-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>India, UAE sign $3 billion LNG deal, agree to boost trade and defence ties at leaders’ meeting</strong></a><br><p>India signed a $3 billion deal on Monday to buy liquefied natural gas from the United Arab Emirates, making it the UAE’s top customer, as the leaders of both countries held talks to strengthen trade and defence ties.
The agreement was signed during a very brief two-hour visit to India by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
They pledged to double bilateral trade to $200bn in six years and form a strategic defence partnership.
Abu Dhabi state firm ADNOC Gas will supply 0.5 million metric tons of LNG a year to India’s Hindustan Petroleum Corp for 10 years, the companies said.



ADNOC Gas said the agreement brings the total value of its contracts with India to over $20bn.
“India is now the UAE’s largest customer and a very important part of ADNOC Gas’ LNG strategy,” the company said.
The UAE is India’s third largest trading partner and Sheikh Mohammed was accompanied by a government delegation that included his defence and foreign ministers.
The two sides signed a letter of intent to work towards forming a strategic defence partnership, India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters.
India’s arch-rival Pakistan signed a mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia last year, and last week, a minister announced the preparation of a three-way draft defence agreement between Pakistan, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, after being close allies for years, have increasingly diverged over regional policy, with their rift exposed in Yemen, and they have also had disagreements over oil output.
Misri, however, said that the signing of the letter of intent with the UAE does not mean that India will get involved in regional conflicts.
“Our involvement on the defence and security front with a country from the region does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that we will get involved in particular ways in the conflicts of the region,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-19 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1919590525b4b0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967869/pti-forms-3-member-committee-to-support-members-incarcerated-in-punjab-their-families' target='_blank'><strong>PTI forms 3-member committee to support members incarcerated in Punjab, their families</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has set up a three-member committee aimed at providing legal aid and welfare support to its members incarcerated in Punjab and their families.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja has formally notified the committee, called the ‘PTI Punjab Legal and Welfare Committee’. Haider Majeed, Faiza Murad and Ali Ijaz Buttar have been named members of the committee.
The notification states: “The PTI hereby announces the constitution of the PTI Punjab Legal and Welfare Committee for the support of party members who have been convicted or are currently incarcerated as well as for the welfare of their families.
“All matters concerning the imprisonment, legal proceedings and welfare of PTI-affiliated prisoners and their families in the province of Punjab may be referred to any member of the committee,” it added.
The committee will convene meetings as required and will remain in close coordination with the party leadership, it said.
It further stated that it would keep the office of the secretary general fully informed of all developments and issues requiring support or intervention at the provincial or central level.
“The PTI remains committed to providing legal assistance and welfare support to its members and their families in these challenging times,” the notification added.
The development comes amid concerns among PTI workers, who felt as if they were being ignored as all the attention was focused on getting party founder Imran Khan released from jail.

A copy of the text of the letter was posted by the foreign affairs and defence correspondent for PBS News, Nick Schifrin, on social media platform X, who said he had obtained it from multiple officials. Schifrin added that the letter had been forwarded to “multiple European ambassadors in Washington”.
“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped eight Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump said in the letter.
“Although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”







As Bloomberg pointed out, the Nobel Peace Prize is not decided by the Norwegian government but rather awarded by an independent committee.
“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway?” the US president added.
“There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.”
Trump also called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) to “do something for the United States”, saying, “I have done more for Nato than any other person since its founding”.
“The world is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!”
Trump has put the transatlantic alliance to the test with threats to take over Greenland “one way or the other”, with European countries closing ranks against Washington’s designs on the vast Danish territory.
German and French leaders denounced as “blackmail” weekend threats by Trump to wield new tariffs against countries which oppose his plans for the Arctic island, and said on Monday that Europe was preparing trade countermeasures.
The European Union said it was holding an emergency summit on Thursday to weigh its response, and that while its priority is to “engage, not escalate”, it is ready to act if needed.
Greenland, for its part, said the tariffs threat does not change its desire to assert its own sovereignty.
“We will not be pressured,” Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post, adding that the autonomous territory “is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions”.
Støre said the statement had been received in response to a message from him and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, where they had “conveyed our opposition” to Trump’s tariff threats.
Bloomberg quoted Støre as saying: “Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, I have several times clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize.”
A request for comment sent to the White House was not immediately returned, the outlet added.
Last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado had given her own medal to Trump in recognition of what she called his commitment to the freedom of the Venezuelan people. However, the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked even if the medal is given away.







Russia, China threat?
Trump has repeatedly said his country needs vast, mineral-rich Greenland for “national security”, despite the US already having a base on the island and security agreements with fellow Nato ally Denmark.
“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,” Trump said in his message to the Norwegian premier, doubling down on that sentiment in a post to Truth Social on Monday.
Denmark’s defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said on Monday that steps had already been taken along with Nato allies to “increase military presence and training activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic”.
Lund Poulsen added that he and Greenlandic foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt would be meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte later on Monday.
‘Blackmail’
This weekend, Trump said that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would be subject to a 10-per cent tariff on all goods sent to the US — a duty which could go higher.
Germany’s vice chancellor Lars Klingbeil slammed the move as blackmail and said on Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures.
French finance minister Roland Lescure, speaking at a press conference alongside Kingbeil, agreed.
“Blackmail between allies of 250 years, blackmail between friends, is obviously unacceptable,” Lecurse said.
Klingbeil said Europe’s response could have three main strands.
First, the current tariff deal with the US would be put on hold, he said.
Second, European tariffs on imports from the US, currently suspended until early February, could come into force.
And thirdly, the EU should consider using its toolbox of instruments against “economic blackmail”, he added.



Europe’s stock markets fell as the week’s trading began on Monday, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warning that a “trade war is in no one’s interest”.
Greenland — whose tiny population of 57,000 has voiced disquiet at Trump’s threats — continued to make its preferences clear on Monday.
Greenland’s dogsled federation (KNQK) said that the new US special envoy to the Arctic island had been disinvited to its annual race.
Jeff Landry had been invited to attend the race by a private Greenlandic tour operator, an invitation the KNQK federation has previously called “totally inappropriate”.</p><small>2026-01-19 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19180454a6945cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967864/lesson-for-all-of-us-ppps-sherry-rehman-says-no-need-to-politicise-fire-at-karachis-gul-plaza' target='_blank'><strong>‘Lesson for all of us’: PPP’s Sherry Rehman says no need to politicise fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza</strong></a><br><p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman on Monday said that there was no need to politicise the fire which broke out in Karachi’s Gul Plaza shopping mall, saying that it was a “lesson for all of us”.
She made the remarks in the Senate after Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Senator Khalida Ateeb called the House’s attention to the incident, lambasting the Sindh government for its negligence.
Calling the incident “heartbreaking”, Rehman said that there could be no compensation for all of the lives lost in the incident.
She asserted that the entire Sindh government was active and dealing with the situation. However, she conceded that the fire brigade took time to reach the site after the fire broke out as there was a large crowd gathered at the scene.
She added that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had announced Rs10m as compensation for the affected families.
“Shutting down private enterprise is harmful since this is such a big plaza. But fire safety is necessary for a city like Karachi and one should ask the administration of Gul Plaza about how it happened since they run the market,” she added.
“I am not giving excuses; it was a huge lesson for all of us. It was a tragedy for the whole of Pakistan, not only for Karachi or Sindh,” she said.
“It was a big and tragic incident but there is no need for pointing fingers or engaging in politics,” she stated.
“If there is any aid or assistance that they (the MQM) can extend to us, then I urge them to do that but sadly, it will be politicised,” Senator Rehman added. “Our doors are open for both relief and criticism.”
MQM senator assails Sindh govt
In her remarks, Ateeb took aim at the Sindh government and highlighted that there were no safety or emergency measures at Gul Plaza.
“The whole building collapsed and there was no emergency exit,” she highlighted. “Whose responsibility is this? If people are saying the fire brigade turned up too late, then how did the building authority allow 1,200 shops in a space which only allows for 500?”
“Permission is granted to build the mall but all the things needed for such a building need to be considered,” she emphasised.
“Windows were shut because of air conditioners and were either blocked by items or had grills so people were unable to escape,” she added.
Senator Ateeb stated that the government was responsible for failing to ensure safety measures.
“The government says they will compensate the victims’ families for the damages, but there is no compensation for the lives lost,” she said.
“The people of Karachi are drowning in sorrow right now, yet we are here passing bills and giving speeches on different subjects. This needs to be our priority: the city which gives nearly 70 per cent in taxes to the Centre,” she said.
‘It’s incompetence, but pointing fingers alone will not help’
Speaking right after Rehman, PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar agreed with her that the incident should not be politicised. But, he also highlighted that the incident “exposes corruption”.
“Corruption has its price,” he said, recalling that the Supreme Court had also ordered an investigation into authorities related to buildings’ construction in Karachi.
“What’s happening — in Karachi and across the country — is that building bylaws are only on paper,” he remarked.
Zafar said that because of corruption, building maps not meeting legal requirements and lacking features such as fire exits were being approved. “And once the building is constructed, there is no supervision of it, which is also because of corruption.
“This happened in Karachi, Lahore and other cities.”
He added that after incidents such as the Gul Plaza blaze, opposition members would usually hurl criticism and those from the government would defend themselves. “Chief ministers arrive at the site of the incident and express condolences. And compensations are paid from the treasury.
“But this does not solve the problem.”
Zafar urged that the implementation and enforcement of building bylaws, as well as penalties for their violations, be discussed in the upper House of Parliament.
“These are two major issues that we need to address,” he said, further highlighting the need for suggestions to prevent incidents like the Gul Plaza inferno.
“Our MQM senator made a good point, but let’s also give suggestions on how to stop this.”
Terming the Gul Plaza blaze an example of “incompetence” of the Sindh government, he stressed that “pointing fingers alone will not help. The issue will only be resolved once we address this issue.”
‘Extremely tragic’
PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi said the incident was “extremely tragic, disheartening, and saddening”, adding that there were more shops at the mall than had been approved, with “nearly 250 having been illegally set up”.
“The problem is that the building was constructed in the 1990s and only 900 shops had been approved, but approximately another 250 were built illegally,” he claimed.
The senator also noted that the building’s completion certificate was issued around 2003-04 by then-Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim.

Maneka had filed the plea on January 16, seeking meetings with her mother, who is the wife of jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
The court registrar’s office had, however, objected to the maintainability of the plea, asking Maneka to approach the LHC’s Rawalpindi bench instead.
During Monday’s hearing, Justice Farooq Haider sustained the registrar office’s objection pertaining to territorial jurisdiction, observing that the plea was not maintainable before the LHC’s principal seat.
Maneka’s counsel then withdrew the petition, following which Justice Haider disposed of the plea.
The petition, filed through Lahore High Court Bar Association President Malik Asif Nissoana, listed the inspector general of prisons, the superintendent of Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, and others as respondents.
It said the Adiala jail administration had barred Maneka from meeting her imprisoned mother without providing any written reason to the petitioner.
Despite Maneka being a blood relative of Bushra Bibi and Tuesday being the designated day for meetings, permission had not been granted to the petitioner to visit her jailed mother, the petition said.
It further stated that Maneka was deeply concerned about her mother’s physical, emotional and psychological well-being and argued that jail authorities’ actions amounted to “mala fide intent” and “misuse of authority”.
The petitioner requested the court to issue directives to the respondents for an immediate meeting with her mother.
Bushra Bibi is currently serving a seven-year sentence in the £190 million corruption case. She was also recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana-II case, which contains charges of purchasing an expensive jewellery set gifted to the former prime minister Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-19 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191720457d5b729.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967857/trump-to-charge-1bn-for-permanent-spot-on-board-of-peace-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to charge $1bn for permanent spot on ‘Board of Peace’: reports</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his “Board of Peace” aimed at resolving conflicts, according to US media reports.
The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban and Canada’s Mark Carney.
Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the sum.
“Each member state shall serve a term of no more than three years from this charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman,” stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media.
“The three-year membership term shall not apply to member states that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.”
The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second “executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role.
“The Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” the charter says.
‘Failed institutions’
The document was sent to dozens of world leaders who were invited to join the board, The Times of Israel reported.
It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.
Trump has regularly criticised the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organisations and treaties — roughly half affiliated with the UN.
Membership of the board would be “limited to states invited to participate by the chairman”, according to the full draft charter published by the Times of Israel.
Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-thirds of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman.
The “Board of Peace” began to take shape on Saturday as the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, Argentina and Canada were asked to join.
Trump also named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff as members.
Israel has objected to the line-up of a “Gaza executive board” to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.
Putin invited to join ‘Board of Peace’: Kremlin
Separately, Russia said it was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington, without adding if the Kremlin chief was inclined to join.
Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told AFP in an interview that Putin “also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace”.
Moscow for years tried to balance relations with all major players in the Middle East — including Israel and the Palestinians.
But since the conflict in Gaza and Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Putin has moved away from Israel, boosting ties with its foes like Iran.
Moscow has also sought closer relationships with the Gulf states amid growing Western isolation.
The White House has reached out to various figures around the world, including Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to sit on the so-called “Board of Peace”, chaired by the US president himself.

Putin has previously praised Trump’s efforts to resolve conflicts.
“He’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises, which have lasted for years, even decades,” Putin said last October.
Referring to the situation in the Middle East, Putin said: “If we succeed in achieving everything Donald has strived for, it will be a historic event.”
The assault on Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza have strained Moscow’s traditionally good relations with Israel, home to a large Russian-born community.
The Kremlin has repeatedly criticised Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks and called for restraint.
“The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe in the full sense of the word,” Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency RIA Novosti at a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas last May.
“Russia, as a friend of the Palestinian people, is trying to provide regular assistance,” the Russian president added.</p><small>2026-01-19 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/19164932056c4b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967853/pakistans-trade-deficit-widens-pushing-current-account-negative' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s trade deficit widens, pushing current account negative</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s external financing position weakened in December 2025 due to a rise in imports and persistent income outflows that pushed the current account back into deficit.
According to data provided by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Pakistan recorded a current account deficit of $244 million in December, compared with a $98m surplus in November of the same year.
As a result, the cumulative current account position for July to December FY26 rose to a deficit of $1,174m compared to a surplus of $957m during the same time last year.







The monthly decline was driven primarily by changes in trade. Imports of goods rose to $5.74bn in December, while exports stood at $2.75bn.
Trade in services also remained negative. Services exports for the month were $936m while imports were $1.31bn, adding $370m to the deficit.
Overall, strong remittance inflow did provide support, with workers’ remittances amounting to $3.59bn in December.
Other notable findings were that the financing account posted a net outflow of $596m in December, while foreign direct investment showed a net outflow of $135m.
The December data is representative of the fact that Pakistan’s external stability remains heavily dependent on remittances and official financing, imports are rebounding, and export growth seems to be softening, indicating that the balance of payments remains vulnerable to shifts in internal and geopolitical conditions.</p><small>2026-01-19 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/191628549bc601e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967852/gul-plaza-blaze-plea-filed-in-shc-seeking-criminal-departmental-proceedings-against-responsible-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza blaze: Plea filed in SHC seeking criminal, departmental proceedings against responsible officials</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A petition was filed in the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday, seeking the initiation of “criminal, departmental and contempt proceedings” against officials found responsible for the Gul Plaza fire.
The fire, which erupted late on Saturday night, raged for almost 24 hours before it was doused. The death toll from the inferno rose to over 20 today from six reported on Sunday as rescue workers continued a search operation for several persons reported missing following the incident.
Meanwhile, a lawyer, Advocate Saleem Michael, and a resident of Karachi, Muhammad Haris, filed a plea in the SHC, stating that the “tragedy was not an unavoidable accident but a direct consequence of gross negligence, failure of inspection, nonenforcement of safety laws, and maladministration by the respondents who are legally bound to ensure building and fire safety”.
The Sindh government, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Karachi’s chief fire officer, the Sindh Emergency Rescue Service director general, South district deputy commissioner and director general of civil defence at the home department have been named as respondents in the plea.
The plea, seen by Dawn, has been filed “in public interest on behalf of affected citizens, traders, shopkeepers and victims of the Gul Plaza fire incident”.
It referred to an SHC order dated December 8, 2020, relating to public safety, fire prevention and protection of human life.
The petition recalled that in the 2020 order, the SHC had directed that the availability and functionality of fire tenders within a stipulated timeframe be ensured and fire emergency helpline 16 be maintained, activated and made fully operational.
The court had also issued directives for “constituting and operationalising divisional, district and sub-divisional task forces with defined inspection mechanisms, mandatory meetings, random inspections, complaint redressal within 48 hours and strict enforcement of fire safety laws”.
The petitioner contended that the respondents in their plea, who were public office-holders, were “expressly bound to comply with the clear, mandatory and continuing directions” issued by the SHC in its 2020 order.
“The directions were neither advisory nor directory, but mandatory in nature, involving issues of fundamental rights, protection of life and dignity of citizens, and constitutional obligations of the state under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution,” the petition said.
It added that despite a passage of more than four years, the respondents “have willfully, deliberately and contumaciously failed to implement the aforesaid directions in their true spirit”.
“The so-called task forces exist largely on paper only; inspections remain sporadic, reports are not acted upon, and enforcement against violators is virtually non-existent,” the plea alleged.
It added: “The recent tragic fire incident at Gul Plaza, Karachi, resulting in loss of precious human lives, serious injuries to several persons and devastating financial losses to shopkeepers, stands as a living indictment of the respondents’ continued defiance, disregard and non-compliance of the binding order dated December 8, 2020.”
The petitioners pled that the court declare that the Gul Plaza incident  occurred “due to negligence, maladministration and failure of statutory duties by the respondents”.
They further sought the court’s directions for the respondents to initiate criminal, departmental and contempt proceedings against responsible officials.
Moreover, they requested the court to order the suspension of negligent officers pending an independent inquiry and issue directives for the payment of  “adequate compensation to the families of deceased victims under the principle of state liability”
They also sought directions for the payment of “state-funded compensation” to traders and shopkeepers for their financial losses.
The petitioners further urged the court to order a judicial or independent technical inquiry into fire safety compliance at commercial buildings across Karachi.
Moreover, the court was requested to issue directives for the “strict enforcement” of the Sindh Fire Safety Act, 2016 and building laws to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies.
The petitioners also requested the court to direct the respondents to submit compliance and inspection reports pertaining to Gul Plaza.
They further sought court directions for the attachment of the property in question, Gul Plaza, until the “finalisation of the dispute of settlement/ compensation [payment] to the lawful owners/ renters (stock owners)”.
They also requested the court to “restrain respondents from concealing or destroying relevant records”.</p><small>2026-01-19 11:30</small></div><hr>
