But what does that look like?</strong></a><br><p>On the night of October 9, explosions erupted in Kabul, as well as other parts of eastern Afghanistan. Soon after, social media was abuzz with speculations that Pakistan had struck the leadership of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the wake of a string of bloody attacks on this side of the border by the terror outfit.
The Pakistani military, at a press conference the next day, neither accepted nor denied the rumours. “Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” said Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry.
Two nights later, the Afghan Taliban attacked Pakistan’s border posts. Islamabad was quick to retaliate, forcing the Taliban fighters to retreat. By morning, dozens were dead on both sides of the Durand Line.
Four years ago in August 2021, when the Taliban seized Kabul, few could have imagined what is unfolding today: a full-blown conflict between the Afghan Taliban and Pakistan — once friends, now foes. In the years since, deteriorating ties between the neighbours have come to the fore, with crossfire at the border, exchange of scathing rebukes, and stern warnings.
But the latest clash, so far the deadliest confrontation, has brought the two countries close to war. In the early hours of Oct 15, the Pakistani military said it again repulsed an attack by the Afghan Taliban in the Spin Boldak area, killing about 15-20 fighters. On the other hand, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid claimed that his forces were “forced to retaliate” after cross-border attacks by Pakistan.
Later the same day, both countries agreed upon a ceasefire for the next 48 hours after Pakistan said it conducted “precision strikes” in Kabul and Kandahar.
Even though the fighting has stopped for now, the situation remains extremely volatile, and hence, questions arise: what triggered this situation, and where do we go from here?
A strategy that backfired
It is no secret that the Afghan Taliban, since the group’s emergence in the 1990s, have remained a close ally of Islamabad, especially after Pakistan extended a swift recognition to the Taliban regime in 1996. That strategy, of having a malleable government in Kabul that won’t act against Islamabad, has now backfired, with the group’s strident refusal to recognise the Durand Line and its provision of sanctuary for militants such as the TTP.
At the same time, Islamabad’s erstwhile ‘friend’ has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP. But it is not just Pakistan that believes the Taliban is actively providing support for the TTP.
 
 

A 2024 UN report found that “the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group: the bonds are close and debt owed to TTP significant”, referring to the outlawed group’s assistance in the former’s 20-year insurgency campaign. Noting that the “TTP continues to operate at significant scale in Afghanistan and to conduct terrorist operations in Pakistan”, the report highlights the Taliban’s support — in the form of funding, provision of weapons left behind by Nato forces, and safe haven — for the group.
The TTP, too, considers itself to be closely linked to the Taliban, with its emir Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud renewing his oath of allegiance to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan two days after the Taliban recaptured Kabul in 2021. Not coincidentally, the TTP’s violence in Pakistan has since only continued to soar. The current year is on track to be the deadliest so far, with the first three quarters of 2025 witnessing nearly as much militant violence as all of 2024.

In response to the TTP’s activities, Pakistan has tried to exert pressure on the Taliban regime by restricting trade, expelling thousands of Afghan refugees over the past two years, and carrying out sporadic airstrikes against alleged TTP strongholds in eastern Afghanistan.
Strikes in the Afghan capital, though, are an unprecedented escalation — one that would be a sore humiliation for any country but more so for one that lacks any real air defence.
The man who makes a difference
The discussions on social media following the Oct 9 strike on Kabul claimed that Pakistan had targeted a TTP convoy carrying the organisation’s chief, Noor Wali Mehsud. While Islamabad neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, claims later emerged that Mehsud had survived, with Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid insisting that the TTP emir was neither in Kabul nor Afghanistan.
If Mehsud indeed was the target, his death would have been a substantial triumph for Pakistan — in the TTP’s war against the state, he is a man who makes a difference.
Ascending the TTP’s ranks, Mehsud combined the unlikely roles of jurist, scholar and commander. A veteran from the Afghan Taliban’s early years, he served at various points as a deputy for TTP leaders previously in power, a qazi in the group’s sharia courts, and its Karachi chief. Thus, when the then-TTP emir, Mullah Fazlullah, was killed in an American drone strike in 2018, Mehsud was anointed his successor.
Fazlullah — the only non-Mehsud TTP chief to date — had been a controversial choice, which led to infighting and defections that weakened the organisation during his reign. The public and military backlash after the 2014 Army Public School massacre, too, had forced the group on the back foot.
But Mehsud pulled the TTP back together, smoothing over ruffled feathers and brokering agreements. He brought allies to the table, pushed offshoots back under the umbrella, and shifted the organisation’s focus from civilian to military targets — likely to avoid further alienation of the population and to stand apart from the Islamic State’s brutality. With his leadership and the sanctuary given by the post-2021 Afghan government, the group reorganised and escalated its cross-border assaults.
 
 

Under Mehsud, the TTP may be the most serious threat Pakistan faces within its borders, yet again. The past few years have seen the group inflict heavy casualties on security forces. And so, it is no surprise that the state would jump at a chance to eliminate him.
Such decapitation strategies aim to cut off terrorist organisations at the head, disrupting operations, denting morale and sowing discord within the ranks. After all, it makes intuitive sense that eliminating leaders will only weaken a group. The TTP has, however, survived over the years despite three of its previous chiefs being killed.
Research has found that decapitation may work against young, small groups, but not for older and bureaucratised groups with popular support. Groups with networked structures divided into semi-autonomous cells, transnational sanctuaries, and steady financing tend to be more resilient.
And the TTP fits the bill.
For the group, it is Noor Wali Mehsud who makes a difference. Killing him would certainly be a substantial blow for the TTP. But would it stop their war against the state or leave them wounded beyond repair? Unlikely. From the TTP’s perspective, the recent strikes in Kabul would serve as a warning, pushing the group to deepen its security, send its leadership into hiding, and potentially escalate its attacks across the border.
Dealing with the Taliban
Over the past four years, Pakistan has made several overtures — through religious and tribal to official diplomatic channels — to urge the Afghan Taliban authorities to rein in the TTP.
Delegations of ulema, tribal elders, federal ministers and top-level officials have visited Kabul to no avail. Meanwhile, assurances by the de facto Afghan government and increasingly tough warnings by the Pakistani state made little difference as the TTP continued to ramp up its violence across the border.
Increasingly desperate, Pakistan has in the last two years resorted to kinetic strikes targeting TTP strongholds in eastern Afghanistan. At the same time, Islamabad also imposed trade restrictions on its neighbour and began deporting over a million Afghan refugees residing in the country, hoping to coerce the Taliban into complying with its demands. But this too made little difference.
Earlier this year, as highlighted by former ambassador Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan shifted from its coercive strategy to a carrot-and-stick approach with the resumption of diplomatic visits and confidence-building measures. Yet, Islamabad remained unsuccessful in shifting the course of the Taliban regime.
So where does the problem lie?
It is rooted in the fact that the Taliban have a long-held principle: it won’t give up its militant allies. The group didn’t give up Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden to the US, even when the cost was engaging in a two-decade war with the West. And, now that it no longer needs Pakistan’s help to survive, it has no reason to give up the TTP either. Rather, keeping the TTP close can be more useful to it, giving it leverage over a potential proxy.
By now, Pakistan’s patience appears to have run out, especially after Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to New Delhi, just months after the India-Pakistan standoff in May, signalling a rapprochement between the two countries. For Islamabad, this budding friendship portends a hostile agenda from both its eastern and western borders — a position untenable for Pakistan.
 
 

Amid these developments, one wonders: what is the strategy now?
The state will, as Pakistani officials imply, continue to respond offensively against Afghanistan in retaliation for terror attacks. This, perhaps, is the new normal — albeit a dangerous one, in the region — with India setting the precedent in its strikes on ‘militant bases’ in Pakistan just a few months back.
This has amplified concerns about deepening mistrust, complicating security dialogues, and, potentially, leading to war.
A war against Afghanistan?
In the past few months, Pakistan has shown that it can handle itself on the battlefield, and it certainly has the military and technological superiority for it. It has an operational edge too, being no stranger to Afghan conflicts — it knows the language, the geography, the politics of the land, and has strong intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan, especially when it comes to human intelligence.
The problem, though, is that the Taliban don’t fight on the battlefield — a lesson the US learned over the 20-year war. Their fighters and allies are battle-hardened insurgents who would likely find renewed purpose and unity in a conflict against Pakistan, a conflict that would not be fought conventionally.
Instead, it is more likely that the Taliban would retaliate with its own proxies, including the TTP, for stealthier attacks and waves of suicide bombings across the border. The Pakistani state could ramp up security, of course, but there is only so much it can secure. And the logic of substitution in terrorism means that attacks would only shift from hardened targets to softer, likely civilian, ones. This is something Pakistan cannot afford, not after years of devastation at the hands of the TTP.
 
 

In fact, neither country would want a full-blown war to add to their struggles. The Taliban regime has an economic crisis on its hands and few international allies. Pakistan, too, has its own financial and political instabilities to deal with, as well as the looming threat of a fresh conflict with India.
There are other considerations as well. War with Afghanistan could push the Taliban regime even closer to New Delhi, which had been a close ally of the former US-backed government in Kabul. Pakistan’s own alleged support for the Taliban had been a way for it to hedge bets against the Indian threat. Then again, much of the Afghan population already harbours resentment against Islamabad for its past interference and current refugee expulsion policies. Continued conflict is likely to deepen this hostility and create sympathy for the Taliban and, maybe, even the TTP.
For its part, the Taliban regime would be right to exercise caution. Pakistan’s extensive intelligence networks and on-ground links in Afghanistan will allow it to gather information on prominent figures and vulnerabilities within the setup, and it is no hard task for it to enter Afghan airspace as it pleases.
It may look like we’re edging closer to war with recurring clashes and political chest-thumping on both sides. However, these statements were primarily aimed at the people of each country — after all, neither government wants to appear to be backing off in the face of a major threat.
For the Taliban, if it wants to curry favour with a population that already holds it in dislike, denouncing a neighbour that is similarly loathed is just good PR. And the push at the border is the bare minimum; it needs to show its resolve and at least try to establish some level of deterrence, even if it is a small match for Pakistan’s military might in a head-on battle.
For Pakistan, Kabul’s latest overtures to New Delhi place the Taliban alongside not just the TTP, but an enemy that has repeatedly threatened Pakistan’s very existence. Between the TTP’s lethal attacks, Muttaqi’s trip to India and now the Taliban’s attacks at the border, there is no way that it can hold back from taking action. For now, though, it seems that action is still restrained, even as government officials take pains to emphasise the fragility of the current ceasefire.
In an all-out war, Pakistan could inflict significant damage on the Taliban — though victory may come at a steep cost. Thus, restraint may still be needed.
Questioning the regime
Over the weekend, the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement, hinting at a shift in the country’s stance on how it sees the de facto Afghan government’s legitimacy.
Urging the Taliban to “act responsibly, honour its commitments, and play a constructive role in achieving the shared objective of rooting out terrorism from its soil”, the ministry voiced its hope that “one day, the Afghan people would be emancipated and they would be governed by a true representative government”.
The implication, of course, is that Pakistan is retreating from its view of the Taliban regime as a legitimate government. The statement also has a whiff of threat, the threat of regime change, obliquely paving the way for engagement with the opposition in Afghanistan.
 






At the same time, media outlets in Pakistan have started referring to the government in Kabul as the ‘qabiz [occupying] Afghan Taliban’, reinforcing the rapidly changing perceptions.
The thought is tempting: a friendly government in Kabul has, after all, long been the establishment’s desire. Realistically, though, overthrowing the Taliban would bring chaos to Afghanistan once again, which has never boded well for Pakistan, with each episode of instability pushing another surge of violence and refugees next door.
Moreover, Pakistan has long kept its Afghanistan eggs in the Taliban basket. Will it actually be able to find any potential allies among the opposition? Perhaps, but with its longstanding unpopularity across the border, it seems unlikely that any significant opposing forces will want to throw in their lot with the state.
What’s more, the TTP would still not be put down; rather, the inevitable weakness of a new Kabul government and anger at such regime change efforts may well combine to give them both the space and added motivation to continue their charge against the Pakistani state.
A bit of carrot, a bit of stick
Simply put, Islamabad needs to rethink its approach to the Taliban. And voices calling for the same have already emerged, case in point: Mushahid Hussain.
“Unfortunate eruption of hostilities due to Kabul regime’s failure to control terror proxies is also a moment of introspection for Pakistan, given flawed and failed Afghan policy that’s now in tatters, with faulty assumptions and an ambitious overreach that failed to take cognisance of Afghanistan’s ground realities and regional geopolitics.
“Our policymakers now need to calmly and coolly review past mistakes & take effective remedial measures to tackle [the] consequences of a potentially lethal emerging Indo-Afghan Axis,” the former senator said in a post on X.
The question, however, remains: how to get them to reconsider their support for the TTP?
The goal is to raise the cost for Kabul, whether direct or opportunity costs. In the past, we have tried carrots and we have tried sticks — the sticks that may still lead to dangerous outcomes.
For now, Pakistan has signalled its willingness to talk, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif explaining to the federal cabinet on Thursday that the “ball is in their [Afghanistan’] court”.
“Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he added.
Perhaps this is where international partners who have stakes in the Afghan-Pakistan region can come in, both to pile on the diplomatic pressure and to entice Kabul to shift its course, with carrots such as bilateral engagement, trade agreements and development projects that are conditional on reining in the militancy. Beijing has already offered to play a constructive role in establishing peace. There are also rumours of a diplomatic effort afoot in Qatar, but the details remain scant.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has also hinted at getting involved in the conflict, gloating: “I’m good at making peace.” While his statement is easy to dismiss, Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to retake the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. His involvement, if it happens, could change the situation drastically.
 


At the same time, adopting the carrot approach doesn’t mean giving up on the stick altogether. Strikes on high-value TTP targets would continue to impose consistent pressure on both the Taliban and the TTP, but such action must try to avoid the loss of civilian lives, which has previously been reported, and it must be backed by the proof of sponsorship that the Pakistani security establishment claims to have.
That proof is important. With the War on Terror came the concept of contingent sovereignty — the idea that sovereignty is not absolute, but rather depends on a state meeting its fundamental obligations both to its own people and to the international community. Sovereignty, in this understanding, demands responsibility over your own territory.
While contingent sovereignty is normally associated with the responsibility to protect, since the 9/11 attacks, it has also been used to justify interventions against active threats within other states. And so, Pakistan must be able to justify any kinetic strikes within Afghanistan with concrete evidence of terrorist activity emanating from the neighbouring territory.
Another reason why this is important is that a substantial portion of the country’s own population sympathises with the Taliban. In their eyes, these are holy warriors fighting the enemies of Islam — a view that the Pakistani state is responsible for encouraging during the Afghan jihad against the Soviets. This view extends somewhat to the TTP as well, which saw little animosity from the public even during its peak.
Not until the APS massacre did people and even mainstream politicians turn against the group. And their current strategy of focusing on security targets has succeeded in subduing that anger, too.
Pakistan cannot win against the Taliban or the TTP until it deals with the public sympathy for these organisations. At the end of the day, it must change the narrative, or any action against the Taliban, whether kinetic or otherwise, risks a backlash from its own people.</p><small>2025-10-17 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/171101034941ab2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949497/pakistan-seeks-chinas-support-for-brics-backed-bank-membership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks China’s support for BRICS-backed bank membership</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with China Deputy Finance Minister Liao Min in Washington and sought Beijing’s support for Pakistan’s membership in BRICS’ New Development Bank (NDB), the Ministry of Finance said on Friday.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC, where Aurangzeb had arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip from Oct 13 to 18.
NDB — established in 2015 by the BRICS  — is a multilateral development bank aimed at mobilising resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS, as per their website. In February, the Economic Coord­ination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had approved Pakistan’s membership in the NDB.
In a statement issued today, the ministry said, “Aurangzeb sought China’s support for Pakistan’s membership in the NDB and welcomed enhanced investment from Chinese enterprises in key sectors, including information and communication technology, agriculture, industry, and minerals.”
 






The minister briefed Min on the staff-level agreement reached with the IMF last week, terming it “external validation of the government’s ongoing economic reform agenda”.
The pair also discussed “latest developments regarding the issuance of the Panda Bond in the Chinese market”.
“The finance minister expressed gratitude to the office of the executive director [at the] IMF for extending full support to Pakistan during recent Board meetings,” the statement added.
Aurangzeb also extended an invitation to the Chinese official to visit Pakistan “at a mutually convenient time”.
Formerly the BRICS Development Bank, NDB was set up by founding members — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa —  to support public or private projects through loans, guarantees, equity participation and other financial instruments.
NDB is headquartered in Shanghai, China and has regional offices in other member states. India originally proposed that the bank simplify mutual settlement and lending operations among BRICS countries and reduce dependence on the US dollar and the euro.
Aurangzeb meets US congressman
The finance minister also met with US Congressman French Hill, who is the chairman of the US House Financial Services Committee.
As per the finance ministry, the pair discussed avenues for “strengthening Pakistan-US economic and financial cooperation, with particular emphasis on the digitisation of financial services, development of the new economy, mineral sector collaboration, and broader partnerships in information technology”.
“Both sides expressed interest in enhancing bilateral engagement to promote sustainable economic growth and innovation-driven collaboration between Pakistan and the United States,” the statement added.
 






Auragazeb also held meetings with representatives from Bangladesh, Japan and attended seminars arranged by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and JP Morgan.
In his meeting with Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) Governor Nobumitsu Hayashi, he welcomed JBIC’s commitment to join the Reko Diq lender group.
He reassured Hayashi that “the government attaches high importance to ensuring the security and confidence of foreign investors”.
 






Meanwhile, in a meeting with Special Envoy to the Hon’ble Chief Adviser of Bangladesh Lutfey Y Siddiqi, the minister underscored Pakistan’s commitment to “fostering closer regional economic cooperation.”
 






The finance minister has held a series of meetings during his six-day visit, which is set to conclude tomorrow.
On Thursday, he met Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan, where Aurangzeb apprised him of the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports.
The two finance ministers also reviewed the growing trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Later in the day, during a select gathering of scholars and economists at the Atlantic Council in Washington, the minister discussed Pakistan’s approach to economic reform, disaster response and private-sector-led growth.
He also met an S&P Global team, welcoming its recent ratings action and noting that the three major international agencies are now aligned.
He briefed the team on recent fiscal, monetary and external-sector developments and progress under the government’s reform programme.</p><small>2025-10-17 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/171007377bb87a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949494/saudi-arabia-in-talks-with-us-for-defence-pact-report' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia in talks with US for defence pact: report</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia is discussing a defence deal with the United States which it hopes to seal when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House next month, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
A senior Trump administration official told the Financial Times there were discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but the details are in flux.
The FT said the deal in discussion was similar to the recent US-Qatar pact that pledged to treat any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to the United States. The US deal with Qatar came after Israel last month attempted to kill leaders of Hamas with an air strike on Doha.
The US State Department told the FT that defence co-operation with the kingdom was a “strong bedrock of our regional strategy,” but declined to comment on details of the potential deal.
The US State Department, the White House and the Saudi government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the FT report.
Last month, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.</p><small>2025-10-17 05:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f16f70d7ac8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949474/when-patience-runs-out' target='_blank'><strong>When patience runs out</strong></a><br><p>SINCE the Afghan Taliban’s accession to power, Pakistan’s approach to Afghanistan has largely been one of patience, quiet diplomacy and cautious optimism, sometimes interrupted by defensive military counter strikes. The assumption was that a shared history and geography would translate into shared security interests. Islamabad placed its faith mainly in dialogue, believing that persuasion could prevent the Afghan side from allowing anti-Pakistan groups to operate across the border. Yet the events of the past months — the growing boldness of militant sanctuaries, the deadly border clashes, and Kabul’s defiant rhetoric — have underscored that diplomacy without accountability breeds impunity.
At no point since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has Pakistan’s border security been so fragile as now. Each promise of cooperation from Kabul has been followed by another attack on Pakistani soil. Each meeting, each delegation, each attempt at quiet mediation has ended with the same grim pattern — militants re-emerging across the Durand Line, launching raids, killing soldiers, and retreating into what Pakistan calls ‘protected zones’. It’s time to rethink what ‘engagement’ means — not as an abandonment of diplomacy, but as its recalibration. Real peace must rest on mechanisms that compel compliance and consequences that deter transgression.
 
 

The recent clashes on the border were the culmination of years of unreciprocated restraint. Pakistan’s soldiers, accustomed to exercising caution on a volatile frontier, faced heavy fire from across the line — and paid with their lives. Statements from Kabul, denying responsibility or shifting blame, deepened public outrage. The national consensus is that dialogue alone will not secure the frontier. A firm, accountable strategy does not mean reckless aggression or collective punishment. It means replacing appeasement with deterrence — a model rooted in law, precision, and protection of civilians. It begins with one principle: when one state’s territory is used repeatedly for attacks against another, the victim state has both the right and obligation to defend itself. The challenge is to exercise that right intelligently.
The first step is accountability. For too long, violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty have gone unanswered in international forums. Documentation of cross-border incursions, militant safe havens, and targeted killings should form the basis of a formal diplomatic case, presented to regional partners and international organisations. The goal is to expose patterns of behaviour that can no longer be ignored. Evidence-based accountability will isolate those within Afghanistan who enable militancy while protecting its civilian population from broad sanctions.

Pakistan has been a patient neighbour — at times too patient for its own security.

The second step is defensive deterrence. Pakistan’s border is long and mountainous, but it cannot remain porous. A modernised surveillance grid, combining satellite imagery, drones and local intelligence as well as rapid response can sharply reduce infiltration. The message should be: incursions will meet with immediate, proportionate response — not to provoke war, but to prevent it.
Third, Pakistan must harness economic and diplomatic leverage. Afghanistan’s economy remains heavily dependent on cross-border trade, transit revenue and remittances. Conditional trade facilitation will create tangible incentives for cooperation. At the same time, Pakistan can mobilise regional partners to impose targeted sanctions on networks financing cross-border militancy. This is not collective punishment; it is pressure applied exactly where it hurts the enablers most.
Yet firmness must not blur into vindictiveness. Humanitarian channels must remain open. Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades, often with little international help. That tradition of generosity may selectively continue, but it must be insulated from exploitation. Humanitarian corridors should be monitored, aid flows regulated and border populations protected from both militant recruitment and retaliatory policies. The moral high ground remains Pakistan’s most potent diplomatic asset; it must not be surrendered.
The fourth pillar is legal and multilateral engagement. Pakistan’s case must not rely solely on rhetoric. By submitting documented evidence of cross-border attacks to regional and UN mechanisms, Islamabad can shift the burden of proof. It can demand verification missions, border-monitoring arrangements, or third-party observers. If Kabul resists, its refusal will speak louder than any propaganda. This approach transforms Pakistan’s narrative from one of grievance to one of governance — a state acting within the law.
Fifth, Pakistan should build a coalition of the willing. No regional state benefits from an unstable frontier. China, Iran, and the Central Asian republics all share concerns about cross-border militancy. Coordinated intelligence-sharing, joint patrol frameworks, and shared surveillance capacities can dilute the burden Pakistan currently shoulders alone. Regional consensus would deprive militant groups of the illusion that they can exploit one neighbour against another.
But all these measures depend on clarity of intent. A firm posture is not an end in itself; it is a tool to restore deterrence. The objective is not perpetual hostility with Afghanistan, but a relationship redefined by boundaries — political, physical and moral. Peace cannot emerge from fear, but neither can it survive without respect — which must now be earned, not assumed. The lessons of history are unambiguous. States that fail to defend their borders under the guise of restraint invite greater aggression. States that act rashly without legal and moral legitimacy invite isolation. The middle path — disciplined strength — is the only viable route.
For a long time now, Pakistan has been a patient neighbour — at times too patient for its own security. India’s and Afghanistan’s aggressions have demonstrated this. Pacifist voices are needed to maintain a semblance of sanity, but they should be rooted in reality, rather than a one-sided insistence on negotiations and self-defence. It is time now to take a harder stance. When dialogue becomes a loop of promises and denials, patience becomes vulnerability.
It is time Islamabad replaced vulnerability with vigilance, and dialogue without consequence with diplomacy that carries weight. A firm, lawful, and strategically calibrated posture towards Afghanistan is the overdue recognition that peace without accountability is fiction. If Kabul truly desires a stable relationship, it will find a willing partner in Islamabad. But if Kabul continues to allow violence to flow across the border, it will face a neighbour that no longer confuses restraint with weakness.

FOR most of Pakistan’s existence its elites and the institutions they dominate have governed, controlled, deceived, robbed, and suppressed its people. They continue to do so. Instead of being servants of the people they have become their masters. As such, they are the principal obstacle in the way of the development of the country including the rights and freedoms its people are guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan.
Unfortunately, in both letter and spirit, the Constitution has been systematically violated and rendered almost irrelevant. Accordingly, these irresponsible ruling elites and their cohorts have demonstrated a hostility towards their own country few external adversaries could match. Mor­eover, the near fatal prospect they have created for the country does not particularly bother them.
And yet a ray of sunlight seems to break through the dark clouds over the country in the shape of a courageous and defiant person considered too young, too poor and too honest to be the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. KP now has a leader who represents the hopes of the youth and the poor of the entire nation. He also has the confidence of an imprisoned national leader in whom an overwhelming majority repose their hopes. Byzantine conspiracies are accordingly afoot to thwart these hopes and possibilities for the freedom, prosperity, and survival of Pakistan. Nothing could be more outrageous and tragic.
 
 

Moreover, the critically important Pakistan middle class intelligentsia has, by and large, prioritised their personal comforts and security over their responsibilities. They cleverly deploy specious arguments for a status quo they know to be fatal for the country. Their conscience apparently does not deter them from willingly or unwillingly serving their cynical superiors and benefactors.
Nevertheless, hopeful questions surface: can a callow young man induce a transforming epiphany among practised cynics? Will the power of hope disperse cynical calculation? Will a failing state reconstitute itself in unity, resolve, struggle, sacrifice and success? Despite an ocean of distressing developments I cannot accept hopeless answers to such questions. Nor should anyone.

We are at a ‘to be or not to be’ moment in which common moral sense must prevail.

Externally, the puppet show in Sharm el-Sheikh including the fawning flattery of Trump should have instilled a modicum of sharam in us. Celebrating the conclusion of the genocidal first phase of the expulsion of Palestinians from Palestine (which is the ultimate goal of the monster leaders of the US and Israel) as a saving of the Palestinians has been a new low for the Arab/Muslim world, including Pakistan. The coming apart of the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan at the first exchange of fire between Afghanistan and Pakistan is hardly surprising given the colloquial epithets of ‘miskeen’, ‘rafiq’, ‘siddiq’, etc that the Gulf clients of America confer on their poor Pakistani ‘brethren’.
The omission of any commitment to Palestinian statehood in the Trump Declaration demonstrates the ‘peace of the graveyard’ that Jewish and Christian Zionists led by Netanyahu and Trump have always had in mind. This renders UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 inoperable. As such it also renders both the recognition of Palestinian statehood and the reiteration of a two-state solution by European and Arab/Muslim leaders very bad jokes.
Pakistan’s association with this charade has direct implications for UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir which call for a plebiscite to determine the wishes of its people. Despite Trump’s meaningless heaping of praise on Pakistan’s leadership, will he revive the long-abandoned US commitment to a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir? Absolutely not! Modi or no Modi, India is too important for the US.
Moreover, Modi has made clear he will not be pushed around by Trump, who is now pandering to him. Trump will nevertheless insist Pakistan prioritise his interests over its national interests with regard to Bagram, CPEC, the quashing of democracy, and the selling of Pakistan’s priceless resources for ‘a few pieces of silver’. Long ago, Kissinger referred to the fatal cost of American friendship!
Hopefully, the restoration of the sovereignty of the people of Pakistan will end such charades. Once the constituent elements of Pakistan’s ruling elites and their apparatchik intelligentsia cease to ‘live in bad faith’, a whole world of exciting possibilities will open up. There need be no individual, elite or institutional villains. The challenges confronting the country will remain in place. But their nature will change from fatal to manageable to resolvable. That alone will inaugurate an era of confidence, energy, and innovation. Instead of risking their lives to escape Pakistan our youth will realise their potential to reshape Pakistan.
All of this may be idle fantasy today. But if those at the helm introspect they may find the better part of their natures commanding them to desist from frustrating and undermining the possibilities of Pakistan. They will find personal fulfilment in bowing to the dictates of their conscience and serving the dictates of khair instead of sharr. We are at a ‘to be or not to be’ moment in which common moral sense must prevail.
Accordingly, the people’s mandate of Feb 8, 2024, must be restored. Only then can the Quaid’s Pakistan be progressively restored in friendship and cooperation with Bangladesh, and maybe eventually, principled accommodation with India. This would be a blessing for more than two billion of the most vulnerable people on earth. This would facilitate constructing a relationship with Afghanistan and Central Asia that our history, culture and values demand. Only then can we begin to realise the colossal potential of our relations with China which is rapidly emerging as the best hope for all oppressed peoples and nations.
Isn’t this a breathtaking prospect? Why would any decent person choose to gratuitously ruin it? None of the foregoing is fantasy if we believe we are a nation and our people are politically sovereign. Accordingly, we should be confident we can address and overcome all challenges and thereby transform our possibilities into our reality.

Though a temporary truce was reached on Wednesday, and the prime minister indicated yesterday that Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul met certain conditions, there had been fierce fighting earlier when the Afghan Taliban launched an attack on the Chaman border. Pakistan hit back, targeting camps in Kandahar used by TTP terrorists, as per the military. Explosions were also heard in Kabul.
Earlier in the week, there were similar exchanges at Kurram, after the Taliban attacked Pakistani positions on Oct 11. Before the outbreak of hostilities, explosions were heard in Kabul last week, in which the TTP chief was reportedly targeted. Pakistan has not officially acknowledged this operation.
 
 

While the nation must be defended against foreign aggression, a long-term conflict against Afghanistan should be eschewed. These hostilities have occurred at a time when the Afghan Taliban foreign minister was touring India. In a display of diplomatic theatre, India, which does not recognise the Kabul regime, gave a rousing welcome to the Taliban delegation.
This is quite a turnaround for New Delhi, which had previously demonised the Taliban, and financially and diplomatically supported their Afghan rivals. In fact, after the Taliban retook Kabul in 2021, Narendra Modi reminded the UN that Afghanistan must “not be used to spread terrorism”. Now that anti-Pakistan terrorists have found sanctuary in Kabul, India seems to have forgotten these concerns.
Therefore, Pakistan must act with sagacity. The eastern border is already hot, and further adventurism from New Delhi cannot be ruled out. Hence, a conflict with the Afghan Taliban will only benefit India.
For Pakistan, the best option in these difficult circumstances appears to be to coordinate a response with regional allies, including China. For one, Muslim states, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have been instrumental in brokering truces. These channels need to be kept open.
Moreover, at the recent Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, in which both Pakistan and Kabul’s representatives participated, it was declared that Afghan soil cannot be “used as a threat to the security of neighbouring countries and beyond”. Pakistan faces a grave threat to its security from TTP terrorists who have found a sanctuary in Afghanistan. The UN, too, has endorsed Pakistan’s concerns, saying that the Taliban provide the TTP with “logistical and operational space”, while also providing training sites for Al Qaeda.
A regional meeting of states should be organised, where Pakistan should present these proofs, and the Afghan side should be asked to clarify. What is beyond doubt is that unless the threat of terrorist groups present in Afghanistan is addressed, the whole region will suffer, not just Pakistan.

• CJP calls for ensuring that principles of harmony and equality are reflected in judicial practice
ISLAMABAD: Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said on Thursday that procedural safeguards were being introduced by the government in blasphemy-related cases to prevent misuse of the law, and ensure timely justice.
Speaking at a symposium on “Interfaith Harmony and Fundamental Rights – A Constitutional Imperative”, the minister urged members of the judiciary to continue providing leadership in protecting constitutional rights and guiding jurisprudence to safeguard vulnerable communities.
 
 

Jointly organised by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) and the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA), the symposium was held at the Supreme Court auditorium.
The minister appealed to religious leaders to use their influence to promote compassion, humanity, and tolerance, noting that their voices shape hearts and minds.
 


He further urged educators and media professionals to use their platforms to amplify messages of pluralism and social cohesion, while encouraging business leaders and civil society to invest in community projects that promote equal economic opportunities across social divides.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, in his welcome address earlier, said the message of Islam, from the very beginning, has been peace, compassion and respect for all humanity.
Referring to the theme of the symposium, the CJP said the purpose of dialogue on interfaith harmony was not merely understanding and transformation but ensuring that the principles discussed should also be reflected in judicial practice.
He expressed hope that the dialogue on interfaith harmony would bring Pakistan closer to a society where rights are not only declared but also realised, where justice is not delayed but delivered, and where the law serves as a common language of peace and equality.
Speaking next, Dr Al-Issa who has also served as head of the Saudi Judiciary and delivered the sermon at Arafat during the 2022 Haj, said Pakistan was considered as one of the leading international models in preserving the rights of minorities. He lauded the Supreme Court for its role as the guardian of Pakistan’s Constitution.
 
 

Former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani emphasised that the judiciary has a sacred constitutional duty to protect equality, pluralism, and the rule of law.
Declaration adopted
Meanwhile, a declaration on interfaith harmony adopted at the conclusion of the symposium called for integrating interfaith sensitivity and human rights education within the justice sector; strengthening institutional mechanisms for the protection of minorities and the realisation of fundamental rights; promoting interfaith harmony, social inclusion, and mutual respect as the foundation of fundamental rights; and upholding the constitutional promise of equality and justice for all citizens.

According to local news reports, hours after Mr Trump claimed that Mr Modi assured him in a call on Wednesday that New Delhi would stop purchasing Russian oil, India’s Ministry of External Affairs “clarified” that no conversation between the two leaders took place “yesterday”.
Earlier, in a statement, the foreign ministry said that its import policies are guided entirely to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario.
“India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective,” the MEA spokesperson said in the statement.

Foreign ministry ‘clarifies’ no conversation took place between the two leaders

“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” he said, reiterating India’s position since early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine.
“Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement. This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” the spokesperson added.
Mr Trump, while talking to reporters on Wednesday during a White House event, said, “This is a war that should have never started, but it’s a war that Russia should have won in the first week, and they’re going into the fourth year. And I want to see it stop.”
“So, I was not happy that India was buying oil, and he [PM Modi] has assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. You know, you can’t do it immediately. It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” he said.
“That’s a big step. Now we’re going to get China to do the same thing,” he said, adding that pressuring Beijing would be “relatively easy compared to what we just did over the last week in the Middle East”.
The US president was referring to the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of Israeli and Palestinian prisoners under a peace plan brokered by him, the Indian Express said.
“If India does not buy oil, it makes it [ending the Russia-Ukraine war] easier. They have assured me that within a short period of time, they will not be buying oil from Russia, and they will go back to Russia after the war is over,” Trump said.
 
 

The US president further said that he raised concerns with PM Modi about India’s continued imports of Russian oil, which the US sees as indirectly funding President Vladimir Putin’s war. “I was not happy that India was buying oil,” he said.
Trump also spoke warmly of his relationship with PM Modi.
“Modi is a great man. He loves Trump,” he said, referring to himself in the third person. “I’ve watched India for years. It’s an incredible country, and every single year you’d have a new leader. My friend has been there now for a long time.”
Trump’s claim has come amid ongoing talks for a trade deal with India, and almost two months after the US imposed 25 per cent tariffs on India over those oil imports, the Indian Express said.

• Turkiye to send disaster experts to help find prisoners’ remains as Israel, Hamas trade blame
• Trump threatens to ‘go in and kill’ Hamas if killings continue
RAMALLAH / CAIRO: The Palestinian Authority’s prime minister met Thursday with UN and diplomatic officials to present a plan for Gaza’s reconstruction, despite uncertainties over his government’s role in the war-shattered territory’s future.
“I would like to believe that 12 months from now, the Palestinian Authority will be fully operational in Gaza,” Mohammad Mustafa said, days after a US-brokered ceasefire came into effect in Gaza.
The Gaza peace plan set out by US President Donald Trump does not rule out a Palestinian state, and also suggests allowing a role for the Palestinian Authority once it has completed a set of reforms.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to fight the establishment of a Palestinian state and has all but rejected the option of the Ramallah-based PA ruling over post-war Gaza.
Mustafa said the PA had crafted a five-year plan for Gaza that would unfold over three phases and require $65 billion for 18 different sectors such as housing, education, governance and more.
The plan builds on what was agreed at a summit of Arab countries in Cairo in March 2025, and Mustafa said that “police training programmes initiated with Egypt and Jordan are already underway.”
“Our vision is clear,” he told an assembly of Palestinian ministers, UN heads of agency and diplomatic heads of mission from his office in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
“Gaza shall be rebuilt as an open, connected and thriving part of the State of Palestine,” Mustafa said.
He also said that technical discussions were ongoing with the European Union over “secure crossing operations, customs systems, and integrated policing units”.
The EU is one of the largest donors to the PA.
Above all, the post-war reconstruction plan aims to make way for a single Palestinian government.
The process will “reinforce the political and territorial unity between Gaza and the West Bank, and contribute to restoring a credible governance framework for the state of Palestine,” said Mustafa.
Trading blame over bodies
Meanwhile, as Israel and Hamas continued to trade blame over the latter’s failure to hand over bodies of all deceased prisoners held in Gaza, Turkiye has deployed dozens of disaster relief experts to help search for the remains.
 
 

A dispute over the return of prisoners’ bodies threatens to derail the truce and other unresolved elements of the peace plan, including disarmament of militants and Gaza’s future governance.
Hamas has handed over 10 bodies, which it said were all it could recover.
The recovery of the rest of the remains would require heavy machinery and excavation equipment, which was not currently available, they said.
Also on Thursday, a senior Hamas official accused Israel of flouting the ceasefire by killing at least 24 people in shootings since Friday, and said a list of such violations was handed over to mediators.
Later on Thursday, local health authorities said an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza killed two people.
Separately, US President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to “go in and kill” Hamas if it keeps killing people in Gaza, in an apparent reference to recent shootings of Palestinian civilians following a ceasefire deal with Israel.
Trump’s comments come just days after he said that the Hamas shootings – which included public executions – “didn’t bother me much” and described them as killings of gang members.
“If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network.
Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by “we.” But he said on Wednesday that “we won’t need the US military” to be involved in Gaza.

The assurance was given by Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal during his address at the meeting of WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Committee.
The minister said that Pakistan was strongly aligned with the year’s theme — “Together for a Healthy Future: Action, Access and Equity” — reflecting the government’s dedication to translating commitments into tangible actions that improved people’s health and well-being.
 
 

He said the country has developed and begun implementing the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) at the primary health care and community levels under the National Health Support Programme.
These efforts, he said, have resulted in a steady rise in Pakistan’s Universal Health Coverage Index, which has improved from 40 in 2015 to 54 in 2024.
Mr Kamal further underscored Pakistan’s enhanced preparedness and response capacity through increased domestic investment and partner support, including a recent $18 million grant from the Pandemic Fund to operationalise the National Action Plan for Health Security (2024-2028).

• PM reiterates ‘respect for PPP as ruling ally’; Chan says PM amenable to using social safety net to help flood-hit people
• MQM leaders also call on PM to discuss political situation
ISLAMABAD: After weeks of acrimony between the ruling allies, the two main parties in the ruling coalition seemed to make a breakthrough on Thursday, with a PPP leader claiming the prime minister had acceded to one of their main demands.
“The prime minister has agreed to utilise BISP for helping flood victims and that the PPP will be taken on board while decision-making about flood victims and farmers,” PPP Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan told Dawn.
The understanding, he said, was reached during a meeting at the Prime Minister’s House with a PPP delegation  led by Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
It is believed that the development will finally defuse nearly a month of public confrontation between the two parties.
 
 

However, all eyes will now be on how the premier convinces the PML-N-led Punjab government, which had resisted routing assistance to flood-hit families through BISP — an issue that led to the dispute in the first place.
Mr Chan said the PM had agr­eed to all the PPP’s demands “as they were justified and logical”.
The disagreement between the ruling allies first surfaced last month, soon after heavy monsoon rains and flooding devastated parts of Punjab and other provinces. The PPP pushed for using the BISP to deliver immediate relief to flood-affected families, a demand resisted by the Punjab government.
Tensions deepened when PPP leaders publicly criticised the Punjab government, accusing it of politicising relief and sidelining the federal mechanism for assistance. On the other hand, PML-N ministers also voiced frustration, with Rana Sanaullah calling for a complete overhaul of BISP and arguing that its current structure was unfit.
The technical disagreement soon turned into a political confrontation, with both the ruling allies issuing counter-accusations almost on a daily basis.
 
 

In late September, PPP publicly walked out of Senate and National Assembly sessions to protest what it called insults from Punjab’s PML-N leadership over the controversial Cholistan canal project and criticism of the PPP’s Sindh administration.
‘Respect and appreciation’
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Thursday’s meeting between PM Shehbaz and the PPP chairman also reviewed a range of domestic and foreign issues as well as the overall political situation.
“PPP is our ally with whom we view relations with respect and appreciation,” the premier was quoted as telling Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
The PPP delegation paid tribute to the premier for Pakistan’s role in efforts towards a Gaza peace agreement.
The PPP team included Raja Pervez Ashraf, Senator Sherry Rehman, Nayyar Bukhari, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Syed Ali Qasim Gilani.
From the government side, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal, and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmed Khan attended.
Sources said Mr Bhutto-Zardari conveyed his party’s reservations regarding Punjab and urged an end to the war of words between the PPP and PML-N. He also pressed for targeted support, urging PM Shehbaz to help farmers who had been hit hard by the floods.
When asked whether the PM had agreed to use BISP for flood relief, Information Minister Ata Tarar, who was also present on the occasion, said he would check. However, he did not respond to Dawn’s query until going to print.
In a separate development, a delegation led by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement convener, Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, called on PM Shehbaz on Thursday and discussed the country’s political situation. The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, as well as MNAs Dr Muhammad Farooq Sattar, Aminul Haq, and Javed Hanif.
The prime minister stressed that the timely completion of the ongoing federal development projects was among the government’s top priorities.

• Authorities look to freeze bank accounts, hand over properties to Auqaf
LAHORE: As police plan a crackdown to round up the leadership of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakis­­tan (TLP) to scuttle its plans for protests today (Friday), the Pun­jab government has decided to ask the Centre to ban the radical outfit.
Although most TLP leaders have ‘gone underground’ following the Muridke crackdown, the authorities are apprehensive about the hardline group’s plans to take to the streets after Friday prayers to stage another protest.
These anxieties stem from a statement by TLP Balochistan president Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, who had called on protesters to converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar on Oct 17 (today), as well as intelligence reports suggesting that TLP activists may engage in violent clashes and widespread chaos after Friday prayers.
 
 

A senior police official told Dawn that the law enforcement agencies had received a list of the TLP activists and had been assigned special tasks to launch a large-scale crackdown on Thursday night to ensure a large number of arrests before Friday.
He said that the Punjab police senior command held a series of important meetings to arrest the ‘leftover’ leadership of the radical outfit that had gone into hiding following the Muridke crackdown.
The officer said that a series of meetings were held in this regard on Thursday to devise multiple strategies in this respect. Chairing a high-level meeting, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar approved a deployment of 30,000 personnel on the roads across the province, besides assigning special duties to 12,000 plainclothesmen of the Punjab Special Branch.
At least five locations in the provincial capital have been declared ‘sensitive’ since these have rem­ained the hub of violent attacks carried out by the TLP in recent demonstrations. These included the TLP head on Multan Road, Shahdara, Chungi Amar Sidhu, Baghbanpura, Thokar Niaz Baig, and the Babu Sabu interchange.
Warning against violence
During the meeting, the police officers were given instructions on how to ‘handle the mobs’ in case of violence. “We have decided to treat the violators under anti-terrorism and other heinous charges to take them to the court of law for punishment up to 10 and 14 years,” Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar said.
He said Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning all kinds of gatherings, demonstrations, processions and rallies. The Punjab Home Department has formally issued a notification enforcing Section 144 across the province, he said.
“If anyone tries to attack law enforcers, vandalise public property or take the law into their hands, we are here to deal with them with iron hands,” Dr Usman said, adding that instructions have been issued to trace and arrest the TLP violators with the help of the AI-based technology.
He said that the data of the TLP men wanted by the Punjab police had been updated in the record of the Safe City cameras and vehicles of the patrolling police to trace and arrest them.
TLP ban
In a meeting chaired by CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab government has also decided to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Without naming any party, an official handout referred to decisions taken against an “extremist party”. However, Information Minister Azma Bokhari later confirmed that the reference was to TLP.
 
 

According to the handout, the Punjab will “recommend to the federal government to impose a ban on an extremist party and the party leadership be placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act”.
Apart from these recommendations, Punjab also decided to arrest all “individuals involved in hate speech, incitement and violation of law. All leaders and workers involved in the martyrdom of police officers and damage to state property will be tried in anti-terrorism courts (ATCs)”.
“All properties and assets of the extremist party will be handed over to the Punjab Auqaf Department. There will be a complete ban on the extremist party’s posters, banners and advertisements,” the statement added.
It further said that all bank accounts of the party will be frozen and that social media accounts spreading hatred will also be taken down. The Punjab would also ensure strict action on the violation of the Loudspeaker Act.
It may be mentioned here that the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.

In its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy 2024-25, released on Thursday, the SBP noted that while there has been a partial recovery in industrial activity, macroeconomic risks remain, including pressure on inflation, fiscal accounts, and external balances.
GDP growth for FY25 was revised up to 3.02pc from 2.68pc, following a sharp rebound in the fourth quarter. Industrial output rose by 19.9pc in Q4, after growing marginally in the first three quarters — 0.3pc in Q1, 0.2pc in Q2, and 1.2pc in Q3. This late surge was driven by value addition in electricity, gas, water supply, and construction. Manufacturing, particularly small-scale manufacturing, also contributed, though mining and quarrying continued to contract for the fourth consecutive year.
The central bank emphasised the need for structural reforms to enhance economic resilience and position the economy on a sustainable path of high growth. Key areas identified include promoting savings and investment, improving resource allocation, and advancing institutional and regulatory reforms to enhance competitiveness.
Twin deficit/inflation
The report flagged that increased economic activity and expected agricultural shortages may lead to higher imports in FY26. However, lower US tariffs on Pakistani exports and sustained workers’ remittances could help mitigate the current account deficit. The SBP projects the current account deficit (CAD) to range between 0-1pc of GDP in FY26.
On the fiscal side, continued tax reforms and efforts to document the economy are expected to strengthen revenue mobilisation. Additional support is expected from the transfer of SBP profits in August 2025. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to fall within a range of 3.8-4.8pc of GDP in FY26.
Despite a relatively stable global commodity outlook and subdued domestic demand, inflationary pressures may resurface. “Headline NCPI inflation may cross the upper bound of the medium-term target range in the second half of FY26, before returning to the range in FY27,” the SBP stated. It noted upside risks from flood-related damage to agriculture and infrastructure, and warned of downside risks to growth from geopolitical and trade uncertainty.
The report also pointed to structural weaknesses in financial intermediation. Elevated government borrowing has crowded out private sector credit, with banks preferring to invest in government securities due to their high returns and low risk. This trend, the SBP noted, contributes to Pakistan’s low credit-to-GDP ratio compared to peer economies and undermines financial development, discouraging both savings and private investment.
Private construction activity remained sluggish due to rising input costs and higher property taxes, despite increased development spending supporting public sector construction.
SBP reserves rise $21m
The foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP increased by $21 million to $14.441 billion during the week ended on October 10, the central bank reported on Thursday.
The country’s total liquid foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.811bn, including $5.369bn held by commercial banks.

• Uncertainty surrounds reports of peace talks in Doha in absence of official confirmation
• Beijing, Tehran and UN mission urge restraint, ready to play constructive role for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: Back-channel diplomatic efforts were afoot on Thursday, as the Pakistan-Afghanistan border remained calm and no ceasefire violations being reported.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
 
 

“The ball is in [their] court,” he said while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, informing his colleagues that the Afghan Taliban had formally requested a ceasefire after intense clashes between the two sides earlier in the week.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
He, however, hoped that thorny issues between the two be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which uses Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan, so that the neighbouring country’s territory was no longer used by terrorists.
PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time, then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned, as per Dawn.com.
 
 

He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity.
“Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible, and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response,” the PM said.
 
 

According to PM Shehbaz, the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions.
There was no immediate response to his remarks from Kabul, with Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khowarazmi saying only that the ceasefire was holding so far.
A statement from the Afghan Taliban interior ministry said Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani met senior Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries, especially its neighbours, Reuters reported.
It may be noted that both sides reached a ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, which took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours.
Doha talks?
Though diplomatic efforts were continuing to arrange a meeting between the two sides before the truce expires, uncertainty surrounded the planned talks in the absence of any official confirmation.
In its statement announcing the ceasefire, the Foreign Office had said that both sides would hold dialogue “to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue.”
According to diplomatic sources, the talks were expected to focus on extending the ceasefire and finding ways to defuse the latest border tensions.
On Thursday, reports emerged that Qatar had invited high-level delegations from both countries for talks in Doha on Friday.
Though Doha’s invitation was not made public, but a day earlier, Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had received a message from Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. M. Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi about “the regional situation.” The timing of the message, which coincided with the announcement of the ceasefire, appeared linked to Qatar’s efforts to mediate.
 






Saudi Arabia also joined the diplomatic push on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaking by phone with FM Dar to discuss “the regional situation and recent developments,” according to the Foreign Office. While Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia on regional and international issues, the statement did not directly mention Afghanistan.
 






Diplomatic sources said the main hurdle to the planned dialogue appeared to be internal deliberations within the Taliban’s top leadership. A source in Kabul said that Taliban supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada had yet to give formal approval for his side’s participation.
Late-night reports from Kabul suggested that Mullah Haibatullah had eventually agreed to send Defense Minister Mullah Yaqub to represent the Taliban at the proposed Doha meeting.
The Pakistani side remained cautious. Officials in Islamabad declined to confirm or deny the meeting. They seemed to be waiting for Kabul’s decision.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if the talks take place,” a Pakistani diplomat said on condition of anonymity, describing the negotiations as “fluid but not off the table.”
Calls for restraint
On Thursday, Iran and China urged restraint on both sides, calling on them to settle the current conflict through talks.
China said it supports countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. A foreign ministry spokesperson, when asked about Pakistan and Afghanistan agreeing to a 48-hour ceasefire, said that Beijing stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations.
“Pakistan and Afgh­anistan are each other’s neighbours and both are China’s friends. China supports the two countries in staying cool-headed and exercising restraint, realizing a full and lasting ceasefire, properly handling differences through dialogue and consultation, returning to the track of political settlement, and together maintaining peace and stability in both countries and the wider region.”
Iran also welcomed the ceasefire, urging dialogue and diplomacy. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”.
Meanwhile, the Tasnim News Agency quoted Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as calling for Muslim unity and dialogue following the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He said the renewed tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have raised serious concern among regional nations, including Iran, which shares borders with both.
Pezeshkian reiterated that Iran would use all available resources to reduce tensions, promote dialogue, and strengthen ties between the two neighbours.
Enemies continually seek to create discord among Muslim nations to weaken them, he said, adding that the region needs peace, cohesion, and cooperation more than ever.
Meanwhile, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also called on all parties “to bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life”.
It also urged both Afghanistan and Pakistan to comply with their obligations under international law “to prevent” more civilian casualties.

After a week-long constitutional and political crisis in the province over the chief minister’s election, Afridi was sworn in as the KP CM yesterday evening, with hundreds of PTI supporters present during the ceremony at the Governor House in Peshawar.
The lead-up to the election saw criticism from government ministers against Afridi but a statement on X by state broadcaster PTV News today said the premier had a talk with the new chief minister and congratulated him.
“The federation is ready to work with the you in the interest of Pakistan,“ the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as telling CM Afridi.
 






Separately, the Peshawar High Court granted protective bail to Afridi till November 18.
A two-member bench comprising PHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar took up Afridi’s bail application today, with the chief minister appearing before the court in person.
During the hearing, Justice Ijaz asked whether there were any first information reports (FIR) registered against the KP chief minister.
“We do not know how many FIRs there are. It is possible that there might be an FIR against me as well,” KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel told the court.
Subsequently, the court approved CM Afridi’s bail plea, barring his arrest in any case till November 18.
According to the court order, available with Dawn.com, the bench directed that details regarding criminal cases, if any, registered against Afridi be provided at the next hearing on November 18.
Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Afridi said that the federal and “those individuals who are preventing the meeting [with Imran] should realise that a province’s chief minister is coming”.
Responding to a reporter’s query, Afridi said he has not met Imran since he was imprisoned. He also refuted a list of names for his new cabinet that has been circulating on social media as “fake”.
Asked whether the provincial cabinet will be finalised after his meeting with the PTI founder, CM Afridi replied in the affirmative. “No action will be taken without the approval of our lifelong [party] chairman sahib,” he asserted.
‘Peaceful protest always an option’
Yesterday, the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department had requested the secretary of its Punjab counterpart and the interior ministry secretary that “necessary arrangements” be made to facilitate Afridi’s meeting with Imran today, according to a letter shared by Niazi.
 






Shortly after today’s hearing, PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta said on social media platform X that Afridi had departed for Adiala Jail to meet party founder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases.
 






CM’s Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi also shared a video on X, saying that the chief minister was on his way to Adiala Jail.
 






Later in the afternoon, the PTI claimed that the authorities were “not letting” CM Afridi meet Imran, terming it the “real anti-Pakistan act”.
“They are isolating the very leadership that millions of Pakistanis trust. They fear the people standing together with Imran Khan,” the party said on its official X account.
 






Speaking at a checkpoint situated near Adiala jail, the chief minister assured the people gathered there that he would not disappoint them.
 






Later, he also spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, he said he had come there to meet Imran.
“Yesterday, the KP government had informed the federal and Punjab government that the [KP] chief minister would be meeting Imran today, but they did not respond,” he said, adding that he also spoke to PM Shehbaz.
“I thanked Shehbaz Sharif sahib, he called and congratulated me. I told him that […] our people should not [get affected] by our personal and political differences. I requested him to let me meet Imran, at which he said he would enquire [about the matter] and get back to me. But till now, there has been no response from him,” Afridi said.
The KP CM said they were trying to adopt all constitutional and legal means for his meeting with Imran.
But, he went on to say, “we had tried all [other] means in the past and will do so again”, highlighting that the PTI was criticised for practicing the politics of protests in that case.
“If courts don’t serve justice, if we adopted all constitutional means and still are not served justice, then peaceful protest is the only solution. We have always protested peacefully and we always have that option,” Afridi added.

According to unofficial results, Rashid won by a comfortable margin over his rival, Taufiq Asif of the Hamid Khan-led Professional group. Rashid secured 629 votes from Lahore, while Asif secured 431 votes. The nearly 200-vote lead from Lahore proved decisive in ensuring Rashid’s overall victory.
The break-up of votes at other polling stations for Rashid and Asif is 120 and 101 at Quetta, 135 and 115 at Multan, 55 and 15 at Sukkur, 27 and 23 at Swat and 25 and 5 at Bannu, respectively.
Both presidential candidates were from Islamabad/Rawalpindi since the top slot this year was reserved for the federal capital as per a rotation policy.
For the secretary’s position, Zahid Awan bagged 595 votes, defeating Mian Irfan Akram, who received 442 votes at the Lahore registry polling station.
Across the country, 13 polling stations were set up, including Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, and Hyderabad, among others.
Of these, the SCBA Lahore Registry was designated as the largest polling centre, where 20 polling booths were established. Over 1,400 lawyers were expected to cast their votes at the Lahore Registry alone.</p><small>2025-10-16 20:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16233657c7f6e4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949353/trump-says-he-will-meet-putin-again-after-making-progress-in-ukraine-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he will meet Putin again after making progress in Ukraine talks</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday agreed to another summit to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, a day before the US president was due to speak with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump said he and Putin would soon meet in Budapest after a more than two-hour-long phone call he described as productive. The Kremlin did not immediately comment.
The surprise development came as Zelensky was headed to the White House on Friday to push for more military support, including potential long-range offensive missiles.
Yet the positive tone following the US-Russia call appeared to leave in question the possibility of such support in the near term.
Energy systems targeted
Kyiv and Moscow have been escalating their war with massive attacks on energy infrastructure while Nato struggles to respond to a spate of Russian air incursions.
The Trump-Putin meeting will follow lower-level talks between Moscow and Washington next week, Trump said. No date was provided for the leaders’ meeting. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would brief Zelensky on the Russia talks in the Oval Office tomorrow.
“I believe great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation,” he added.
Ukraine wants to expand attack range
Ukraine has been seeking US Tomahawk long-range missiles, which would put Moscow and other major Russian cities within range of missile fire from Ukraine.
Trump, a Republican who has vowed to end the war that Russia started with its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, had before Thursday expressed increasing frustration with Putin over ongoing attacks.
Trump has said he could supply the long-range weapons to Ukraine if Putin fails to come to the negotiating table. In its latest barrage, Russia launched more than 300 drones and 37 missiles to target infrastructure across Ukraine in overnight attacks on Thursday, Zelensky said.
Kyiv has ramped up its own attacks on Russian targets, including an oil refinery in the Saratov region on Thursday.
Russia has been hitting Ukraine’s energy and power facilities for consecutive winters as the war drags into its fourth year.
In the latest warnings to Russia, Trump said on Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged to stop buying oil from Russia, and that the administration would push China to do the same.
India has not confirmed any such commitment, though Reuters reported some Indian refiners are preparing to cut Russian oil imports, with expectations of a gradual reduction, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that Washington would “impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression” unless the war ends.</p><small>2025-10-16 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/162218028f7721a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949349/pm-shehbaz-meets-bilawal-says-govt-values-and-respects-relationship-with-ppp' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Bilawal, says govt values and respects relationship with PPP</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday and said that the PML-N valued and respected its relationship with its coalition partner.
The parties are partners in the federation, though the PPP does not have a presence in the cabinet. Ties between the allies came under immense strain recently as they were engaged in a war of words over flood relief, as Bilawal asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by floods in the country, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
 
 

Concerted efforts were made by leading figures, such as the premier and President Asif Ali Zardari, who stepped in to defuse tensions, with the latter also calling on Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to play his role for a possible rapprochement. PM Shehbaz and Bilawal had a phone call last week in which they discussed the “country’s prevailing political situation”.
A statement issued by the PPP today said a senior delegation led by Bilawal met PM Shehbaz with federal ministers and PML-N bigwigs in attendance as well.
It said the meeting involved discussions on the overall situation and political landscape of the country.
“The PPP is our allied party, and we view our relationship with it with respect and value,” the statement quoted PM Shehbaz as telling the delegation.
It added that PPP delegation also paid tribute to the prime minister for Pakistan’s role in the Gaza peace agreement.
 






After last week’s high-level engagement between the PML-N and PPP, an eme­r­ging thaw temporarily paused the political firestorm between the two parties, along with the Afghan conflict seemingly overshadowing the issue over the weekend.
The phone call between PM Shehbaz and Bilawal sparked hopes of reconciliation, although sources suggested the truce appeared to be temporary — more like a ‘pact of silence’ rather than a complete ceasefire.
According to insiders, the tensions that ignited the dispute are still simmering beneath the surface.
Although the intensity of the growing divide between the two sides appeared to have significantly diminished following these high-level engagements, sources said the underlying disagreements remained.</p><small>2025-10-16 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/162154003a4be28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949348/sbca-launches-campaign-to-demolish-dangerous-buildings-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>SBCA launches campaign to demolish dangerous buildings in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) has started a campaign to demolish dilapidated and unsafe buildings in Karachi, according to a press release issued on Thursday.
Earlier this month, the SBCA launched a province-wide survey of dangerous buildings and ordered the immediate demolition of all illegal structures across Sindh. The operation aims to ensure public safety and bring long-overdue accountability to Sindh’s urban areas.
According to the press release, Minister for Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah ordered the demolition campaign, which is being carried out by SBCA Director General Muzamil Hussain Halepoto.
“The demolition operation has begun in Lyari’s Noabad and Agra Taj, where highly dangerous buildings are being safely dismantled by SBCA demolition teams,” the press release read, quoting an authority spokesperson.
“As per the latest SBCA report, a total of 540 buildings in Karachi have been declared dangerous, of which 59 are categorised as extremely hazardous.”
The press release noted that the buildings slated for demolition have already been vacated and the process itself is being carried out in phases with the support of the district administration.
“Our top priority is to ensure that no citizen loses their life under a collapsing building. This campaign is a crucial step toward a safer Karachi,” Halepoto said.
He added that a zero-tolerance policy is being enforced against illegal and unauthorised buildings in addition to the demolition campaign.
In July, a committee formed to address unsafe buildings and illegal construction across the province was informed that as many as 300 families had been evicted from 56 “extremely dangerous” buildings in the metropolis and were being provided monthly rental assistance of Rs30,000 for three months.
Then-local government minister Saeed Ghani said that a comprehensive survey of all 740 buildings declared “dangerous” across Sindh, including 588 in Karachi, was being conducted afresh in collaboration between the government and private institutions.
He revealed that of the 61 “extremely dangerous” buildings in Karachi, 56 had already been re-surveyed and vacated, while the remaining five — four in Garden and one in Saddar— are under judicial scrutiny and will soon be vacated as well.</p><small>2025-10-16 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16183507bbb6889.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949335/torkham-chaman-border-crossings-remain-closed-for-trade-due-to-escalating-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Torkham, Chaman border crossings remain closed for trade due to ‘escalating security situation’</strong></a><br><p>The Torkham and Chaman border crossings with Afghanistan remained closed for all trade activities last Sunday, in light of the “escalating security situation” along the Pak-Afghan border, it emerged on Thursday.
This development comes in the wake of military hostilities between Pakistan and Afghan­istan. On Wednesday, the two neighbours agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours.
According to a notification from the Directorate General of Transit Trade — dated October 15 and available with Dawn.com — transit vehicles headed to Afghanistan have arrived at the crossings but are unable to leave Pakistani territory.
“These vehicles are mounted with tracking devices and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) seals under the new tracking and monitoring system that was launched on October 1,” the notification read.
“These border terminals have limited parking spaces, leading to severe congestion,” it added. “Moreover, prolonged parking/stoppage of vehicles can encourage device theft as well as seal tampering that can lead to pilferage of bonded cargo. In addition, in the absence of return journeys, there is [a] possibility of a shortage of tracking devices at the Port terminals.”
The directorate stated that as of Wednesday, 107 vehicles arrived at Torkham, while 357 arrived at Chaman. An additional 37 vehicles are en route to Torkham and another 85 to Chaman.
“In order to avoid congestion at border stations and to ensure the security of the bonded goods, this directorate, in consultation with port terminal operators, bonded carriers, Afghan clearing agents and tracking companies, has temporarily stopped the processing of transit consignments till normalisation of border operations,” the notification concluded.
Torkham and Chama are key trade corridors between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with goods such as fresh produce moving across the border. Official data showed that Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan surged 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25, up from $558.03m in the previous fiscal year.
Trade across the border has been halted several times. Earlier this month, the disruption in internet service in Afghanistan impacted bilateral trade between Islamabad and Kabul via the Torkham border, with Pakistani customs authorities struggling to clear goods due to the non-availability of internet on the Afghan side.
In March, the cross-border movement of people via the Torkham border crossing was abruptly suspended after Pakistani and Afghan security forces were at loggerheads over construction activities on both sides of the border.</p><small>2025-10-16 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16141829f37648f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949311/security-forces-kill-34-terrorists-in-multiple-engagements-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 34 terrorists in multiple engagements across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 34 “India-backed” terrorists during multiple operations that took place across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the last three days, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “From 13-15 October 2025, thirty-four khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij were killed in multiple engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The security forces, per the ISPR, conducted intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts of the province.
The first operation, it said, was carried out in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, eighteen khawarij were sent to hell,” it said.
According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in the South Waziristan district, during which eight more terrorists were neutralised following an intense exchange of fire with the security forces.
“In [the] third encounter, [which] took place in [the] Bannu district, own troops successfully neutralised eight more khawarij.”
The ISPR added that sanitisation operations were being carried out in the said areas “to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji”.
It further said that a “relentless counterterrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam — as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan (NAP) —  by security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of Pakistan, will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement, lauded the armed forces and security agencies for successfully carrying out the counterterrorism operations, saying that the “timely actions of the security forces have improved the peace and stability situation in the country.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces for “thwarting the nefarious plans of the terrorists with their professional expertise.” In a statement, he said that all possible measures will be taken for the safety of the Pakistani people and the country’s integrity.
“The counter-terrorism campaign will continue with full vigour until the complete eradication of the menace of terrorism from the country,” he said.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.
Last week, ISPR Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as of September 15, a total of 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025. During these operations, 970 terrorists were killed, while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.
He added that in 2024, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP during which 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians lost their lives.
Lt Gen Chaudhry attributed the surge in terrorist incidents across the country to several factors, including the non-implementation of the NAP, the politicisation of counterterrorism efforts, India’s use of Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the supply of modern weapons to militants in Afghanistan, and a “terrorism-crime nexus” that he said enjoyed “complete local and political backing.”
On October 8, security forces neutralised 19 “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the ISPR. However, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred.

The idea was unveiled on Thursday by Indian sports entrepreneur Gaurav Bahirvani, the executive chairman of the One One Six Network, and boasts the patronage of the likes of former stalwarts AB de Villiers, Clive Lloyd, Matthew Hayden and Harbhajhan Singh.
According to a press release, “Test Twenty fuses the strategic depth of Test cricket with the speed and spectacle of T20”. The format will be played over 80 overs, featuring two innings of 20 overs per side, with scores carried forward across innings.
Each team bats twice, just like in a Test match, while the rules of both Test and T20 cricket will apply, with a few refined adjustments to suit the new format.
“Matches can conclude in a win, loss, tie, or draw, ensuring that every contest retains the full spectrum of cricket’s drama and unpredictability,” the statement further read.
 






The “Fourth Format” as coined by the people behind it, will, however, be tested first at the youth level, “opening the doors of opportunity to young cricketers aged 13 to 19 from every corner of the world”.
Organisers said players will be assessed on skill, data, and merit through a multi-tiered, analytics-based selection process, leading to an elite auction pool for franchise selection.
The first full season of Test Twenty debuts in January 2026, featuring six high profile global franchises — three international (Dubai, London, and a US city) and three Indian (franchise-choice cities).
 






Each franchise will be backed by a next-generation celebrity stakeholder (“star-kid”) and fuelled by talent discovered through the annual Junior Test Twenty Championship.
The top 300 players emerging from this stage will advance to the Global Auction Pool, where franchises will draw talent for the inaugural season.
“I genuinely believe this fourth format can add a new dimension to our game,” de Villiers said in a statement. “Many of us have enjoyed the T20 format over the years, but we still hold particular affection for Test cricket — and we want it to be played and enjoyed forever.”
There have been growing concerns over the fate of Test cricket over the last few years with lower-ranked sides struggling to play the format on a regular basis, in stark contrast to India, England and Australia who play five-Test series against each other every two years along with their fixtures with other sides.
The scenario has conceived the idea of a two-tier system, which suggests weaker Test sides fighting for promotion to the top tier. It is yet to e be discussed on an official level.</p><small>2025-10-16 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/162019225c63c9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949321/punjab-says-itll-recommend-a-ban-on-tlp-heres-what-that-means' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab says it’ll recommend a ban on TLP. Here’s what that means</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government announced today its intention to recommend a ban on the religiopolitical party, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), after violent clashes between the party and police in Muridke at the start of the week led to the arrest of 2,716 protesters in the province.
The party had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. However, in a massive crackdown, law enforcement agencies launched a pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the party’s protest camp, which sparked clashes, widespread chaos and arrests.
Additionally, the number of cases registered against the outfit has reached 72, with at least 39 registered in Lahore, amid arrests of second- and third-tier leaders of the TLP — said to be the biggest number of criminal cases against the TLP across Punjab during the last few years.
The decision to ban TLP is being linked to some crucial meetings, where its record of violent agitations, fatal attacks on the law enforcers, and the ransacking of Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship came under discussion.
How does banning a party work?
The National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups, under which those designated as ‘terrorists’ or associated with terrorism face severe consequences such as travel bans and sanctions.
The Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ACA) 1997, a watch list for individuals affiliated with terrorist groups or activities, is also used as a means of monitoring and restricting terrorism.
Historically, the list has included militant groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Hizbut Tahrir; banned sectarian outfits such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, extremist organisations such as Jaish-i-Mohammad; and outlawed separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).
However, authorities have widened their net in the last couple of years to include an increasing number of individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Although it is common practice for Pakistan’s ruling powers to attempt to ban political and other outfits based on conflicts of interest, the government has limited powers to seal the fate of its political rivals.
The provincial government can request a ban to be imposed on a party, as in the case of the TLP. In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court, by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court (SC), as per the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within fifteen days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says.
According to a previous analysis by Dawn of relevant constitutional and legal provisions, the government can either invoke Article 17 (2) to ban a political party or Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek its dissolution.
The latter act similarly states that the government can make a declaration in this regard, but the matter will be referred to the SC for adjudication.
As a result, most attempts to ban a political party have fizzled out.
A long history of bans
This is far from the first time in Pakistan’s history that the government has moved to impose a ban on a political party.
In October of last year, a ban was announced on the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a social movement for Pashtun rights in KP and Balochistan.
 
 

Additionally, in July 2024, the federal government declared its intention to ban former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s PTI, just as it was about to become the single largest party in the National Assembly.
Before the PTI, it was the Awami League of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In March of 1971, the Awami League was banned and 76 of its 160 elected members were disqualified for being traitors. The protest against this move was followed by a larger movement that led to the establishment of Bangladesh, with Rahman as its first prime minister.
The TLP was itself banned once before in 2021, after earlier protests resulted in the deaths of several policemen. The ban was approved by the federal cabinet and enforced under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
However, the ban was lifted after a few months, when the party filed a review petition and continued protests. The party’s detained chief, Saad Rizvi, was also released.</p><small>2025-10-16 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1611032888a389a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949293/aurangzeb-meets-saudi-finance-minister-briefs-him-on-ongoing-privatisation-of-pia-and-key-airports' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb meets Saudi finance minister, briefs him on ongoing privatisation of PIA and key airports</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met his Saudi counterpart on the third day of his ongoing US visit, the finance ministry said on Thursday, adding that the former briefed the latter about the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, D.C., where Aurangzeb arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip.
A foreign ministry statement issued today said Aurangzeb continued a series of high-level meetings in the US capital, including his engagement with Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan.
“He apprised his Saudi counterpart of the ongoing privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports, underscoring the government’s resolve to attract strategic investments through transparency and efficiency,” it added.
 






The development comes after a parliamentary committee was informed last month that the PIA Corporation Limited was expected to be privatised by November this year. The national flag carrier’s privatisation is a key condition under the $7bn IMF bailout package approved for Pakistan.
The planned sale of the PIA would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades, with divestment of loss-making state firms a central plank of last year’s bailout.
Regarding the said bailout package, Aurangzeb reaffirmed during his meeting with Al-Jadaan that Pakistan remained steadfast in pursuing economic reforms under the IMF programme to ensure long-term macroeconomic stability, the finance ministry statement said.
It added that the two finance ministers also reviewed the growing trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Moreover, the statement said, the two ministers agreed that institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) could play a vital role in mobilising private sector investments in Pakistan.
“Aurangzeb also sought Saudi support for infrastructure development projects, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a deeper economic partnership with the kingdom,” it said.
In a post on X, Al-Jadaan said, “We further explored opportunities to deepen cooperation and discussed topics of mutual interest.”
 






Pakistan working on ‘number of areas’ for export-led growth: Aurangzeb
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday said that Pakistan is working in a “number of areas” to foster export-led growth and not rely on imports.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan exported $2.5 billion worth of goods and $671 million in services in September. Imports were worth $5.9bn, however.
Speaking at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council in Washington DC for IMF-World Bank Week, Aurangzeb noted that Pakistan had an import-driven economy and there had been a deliberate attempt to prioritise exports through projects like Reko Diq.
“Previously, because it has been an import-dependent economy for the longest time … we get into a balance of payment problem and run back to the lender of the last resort,” he explained.“We are very deliberate this time around that we think through the export-led growth discussion, so we don’t get into that situation.”
Aurangzeb noted two aspects of prioritising exports: the environment and enabling factors, such as taxation, energy and financing costs and tariffs.
“We are working pretty hard, especially on the power side, to go for tariff rationalisation by bringing down circular debt, but also [through] governance and handing over the distribution companies to the privatisation side,” the minister said.
“There was a huge amount of debate (about the tariff bit) and there were two schools of thought: one was that if you start liberalising, then imports will go haywire, even industry that’s there in Pakistan will further lead to deindustrialisation.
“There was another school of thought, which says that even in Southeast Asia, all of these issues were there in the late 1990s and they did it and therefore, this can be an East Asia moment for Pakistan. Quite frankly, we have gone with that East Asia view.”
 


Aurangzeb spoke about “bold reforms” over the next four to five years in bringing customs and regulatory duties down. He mentioned starting with raw materials and intermediate goods, which would “help exporters to bring in [revenue]”.
“Of course, there is a gestation period, but it is an important enabler from that perspective,” he said. “It’s not just about all of this, it’s about opening other corridors, which we have now started with the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) … with the central Asian republics in terms of the geographical corridors, also obviously diversifying into different areas.”
Aurangzeb noted that the textile sector remains the “main base” and that IT services would play a key role.
“Going forward, when projects like Reko Diq come through … that’s going to be a real game changer,” Aurangzeb said. “The first year of Reko Diq’s commercial operations was about $2.8bn in exports — that’s 10 per cent of our export base today.
“We are working on a number of areas to actually get export-led growth, which has to be led by the private sector, no two ways about it.”
Aurangzeb invited proposals from the business community to further cement Pak-US ties
Apart from meeting his Saudi counterpart, Aurangzeb also interacted with leading Pakistani entrepreneurs over a working dinner hosted by Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at Pakistan House in Washington DC.
Aurangzeb invited proposals from the business community to further cement Pak-US ties, the ministry said. “The participants assured full support towards translating the government’s economic vision into reality.”
The minister briefed the participants about the country’s economic outlook, including macroeconomic stability and structural reforms. He highlighted streamlining of regulatory processes, improving the taxation system, and addressing issues related to energy, state-owned enterprises and privatisation.
Aurangzeb also highlighted that Pakistan’s improved credit rating by renowned global agencies has “contributed to reviving confidence of the business community”, the ministry said.
 






Other engagements
Aurangzeb also held other meetings earlier today, the finance ministry said, adding that the “engagements focused on reinforcing Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms, exploring new avenues for international investment, and strengthening bilateral financial cooperation”.
In a key meeting with US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black, he “highlighted significant investment opportunities within Pakistan’s oil and gas, mines and minerals, agriculture, IT and pharmaceutical sectors”.
 






The finance minister also underscored the consensus at the leadership level to enhance trade and investment ties, welcoming the DFC’s interest in facilitating private sector-led funding for projects in Pakistan, the finance ministry statement said.
Separately, he also met Azerbaijan’s first deputy finance minister, Anar Karimov, reaffirming strong economic and strategic ties between the two countries, the statement added.
In the meeting, “he congratulated Azerbaijan on successfully hosting COP29 and highlighted the Pakistan-Azerbaijan Preferential Trade Agreement (January 2025) and Transit Trade Agreement (December 2024) as key platforms to diversify bilateral trade beyond oil and rice into textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and agricultural products”.
 






During his meeting with MIGA Executive Vice President Hiroshi Matano, Aurangzeb expressed “appreciation for the agency’s support in ongoing arbitration matters and reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding both investor confidence and national interests”.
According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb welcomed MIGA’s proposal for a short-term trade finance facility to ensure access to “critical imports” such as food, fertiliser, energy and essential machinery, and emphasised the importance of its timely implementation.
He also acknowledged MIGA’s continued support for Pakistan’s power transmission and distribution sectors, the statement added.
 






The finance minister also attended the Borrowers’ Forum Roundtable, where he discussed the “crucial balance between servicing high debt obligations and financing essential social sector investments”, the statement said.
At the meeting, he commended the establishment of the forum as a “valuable platform for collective action, knowledge sharing, and policy coordination among debtor nations”. The statement further said that he also stressed the importance of improved debt management, enhanced technical capacity and better access to sustainable finance for climate resilience and infrastructure development.
The minister also met with members of the Pakistan Bank Fund Staff Association (PBFSA), the statement said, adding that he briefed them on recent fiscal, monetary and external sector progress and referenced the country’s upgraded sovereign credit ratings.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, energy reforms, privatisation, social protection, and inclusive green growth while responding to participant queries.”
 






Later, the statement detailed, Aurangzeb held a “productive meeting” with the senior management of Standard Chartered Bank, acknowledging the long-standing partnership between the Bank and Pakistan.
“During the discussions, the minister highlighted the external validation of the country’s ongoing economic reforms by international rating agencies. He briefed the team on Pakistan’s recent Panda Bond issuance and plans to tap international capital markets through Eurobonds and International Sukuk.
“The meeting also covered trade financing facilities, with the minister requesting the bank to share additional proposals for consideration to further strengthen collaboration.”
 






The finance minister also attended a session of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (CFMCA), held discussions with British economist Stefan Dercon and participated in a media interaction with the Wall Street Journal.
Yesterday’s address at Citi Macro Forum; ministerial meeting with IMF MD
He also addressed global investors at the Citi Macro Forum, where he, alongside the finance secretary and State Bank of Pakistan governor, presented a “comprehensive overview of the positive developments on Pakistan’s fiscal, monetary, and external fronts”.
He attributed the current economic momentum to effective stabilisation measures, structural reforms and prudent monetary management, noting the successful negotiation of a staff-level agreement with the IMF, the statement said.
 






Yesterday, Aurangzeb joined finance ministers and central bank governors from the MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) region in a meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
As a lead speaker, he underscored “Pakistan’s achievement of macroeconomic stabilisation and welcomed the staff-level agreement with the IMF. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to advancing reforms in taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, and privatisation”.
Moreover, he highlighted Pakistan’s “digital transformation and tariff policy aimed at enhancing competitiveness and exports”, while inviting international investment in key sectors including mining, digital infrastructure, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, the finance ministry statement said.

Bihar, in eastern India, is one of the country’s poorest states and its third most populous, with over 130 million people. Its chief minister, Nitish Kumar, has previously sided with both Modi and the opposition, but is currently a key partner in Modi’s National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
The state is part of a politically crucial heartland region and any cracks within the NDA in November’s assembly vote in Bihar could threaten Modi’s coalition, with elections to follow within months in the states of Assam, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu. Modi’s national alliance, which has 293 out of 543 seats in the Parliament, has a strong voter base only in Assam.
Women are a key voting bloc in tight poll
The Vote Vibe agency said its opinion poll in Bihar showed the NDA had a marginal 1.6 percentage point lead over the opposition alliance, led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress party as of October 8.
“This election could swing either way,” the agency said in its outlook, noting that the NDA’s slight edge was due to its recent programmes, such as money transfers to 12.1 million women under a self-employment subsidy that totalled more than 121 billion rupees ($1.37 billion).
Nivedita Jha, an activist based in Bihar’s state capital Patna, said women will form a strong voting bloc in the poll because men usually leave Bihar in search of jobs in economic hubs such as Mumbai and New Delhi and not all return to vote.
“Women take the decisions because the men are not here,” she said. “They talk about the opposition which has promised more money if they come to power, and my understanding is that they trust the opposition more”.
Some Bihar voters are also angry about the revision of the state voter list. In one case, 85-year-old Jitni Devi said she was removed from the list and can no longer vote or access her pension.
“They have declared me dead,” she told Reuters. “People in my village tease me as a dead woman, and bank officials shoo me away when I go there to withdraw my money.”
The state election commission did not respond to queries about Devi’s case. The federal election body has previously said that all complaints are investigated thoroughly.
Young voters angry over unemployment
Anxiety among young voters in Bihar over employment is another election issue, despite a falling unemployment rate. Government data showed that 9.9 per cent of people aged 15–29 were unemployed in Bihar in the fiscal year 2023–24, a significant drop from 30.9pc in 2018–19, but concerns persist.
“For me, I have seen my father going out of Bihar for work, so the issue of jobs matters the most,” said Babloo Kumar, 25, who plans to vote for the first time in November.
A new political party, Jan Suraaj — founded by Prashant Kishor, Modi’s former poll manager — said it aims to reset the political agenda in Bihar.
“Joblessness, migration, increasing debts, loss in agriculture revenue are the issues in Bihar,” said the party’s national president Uday Singh. “There is a big dip in Modi’s popularity here”.
The opposition has promised a law guaranteeing at least one government job per family, if desired.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, said it remains confident of victory.
“The NDA alliance is in a very solid position,” said Guru Prakash Paswan, a BJP spokesperson. “People have strong faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision”.
Voting will be held on Nov 6 and 11 for 243 state assembly seats, and results will be declared on Nov 14.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/16133503578c587.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949308/nations-welcome-pakistan-afghanistan-ceasefire-deal-for-regional-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Nations welcome Pakistan, Afghanistan ceasefire deal for regional stability</strong></a><br><p>China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran on Thursday welcomed Pakistan and  Afghanistan’s agreement to a 48-hour ceasefire after the two neighbours witnessed a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict.
China’s foreign ministry said today it supported countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire.
“China stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, told a regular press briefing.
Iran also welcomed the ceasefire between its eastern neighbours, urging dialogue and diplomacy after days of deadly clashes.
In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, and held a discussion regarding the matter.
According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO), “H.H. Prince Faisal appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and security in the region and emphasised the importance of collective efforts for stability.”
Per the statement, FM Dar “expressed gratitude for the Kingdom’s continued support” and also reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia to further strengthen cooperation on regional and international issues.
 






Following the announcement of the ceasefire, Dar also received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace.
On Wednesday, the Foreign Office (FO) said that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid recent border hostilities between the two countries.
 
 

“A temporary ceasefire has been decided between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours from 6pm today, at the request of the Taliban.
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said.
Taliban regime spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on X that Afghan forces were instructed to respect the ceasefire, “unless any aggression takes place”.
Pakistani officials on the northern and southern border with Afghanistan told AFP that “no violence was reported overnight, and the ceasefire remains in effect”.
Separately, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk welcomed the ceasefire and appealed to “both parties to prevent any further harm to civilians & commit to a lasting ceasefire,“ according to AFP.
The announcement came after the Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and capital Kabul, state media PTV reported.
Earlier in the day, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said security forces repulsed a separate attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 of their members.
It said Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
The fighting was the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following an incident in Kurram and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
Twenty-three Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 were injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border, ISPR said.
 
 

Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week.
For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself against terrorist groups such as the TTP.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries, and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/161813308a90241.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948888/crisis-vs-opportunity' target='_blank'><strong>CRISIS VS OPPORTUNITY</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN burns $130 million every single day on the health and economic consequences of breathing poisoned air. This $47.8 billion annual toll represents 5.88 per cent of GDP lost to healthcare costs, productivity losses, and 22,000 premature deaths.
Over 11 million children under five are regularly exposed to hazardous air quality, with 1.8 million people in Punjab alone suffering health consequences during smog episodes. This crisis stems from 25 years of policy drift.
While Pakistan drafted the National Environmental Policy (NEP) in 2005 and Climate Change Policy in 2012, it lacked clarity of purpose and implementation resolve. During these lost decades, all major Asian economies invested systematically in public transportation, clean technologies and inclusive propoor policies, leaving Pakistan dangerously behind.
Current approaches remain trapped in outdated administrative and punitive measures instead of systematic, integrated solutions. This reactive approach has proven ineffective against a crisis requiring comprehensive transformation. However, Pakistan can transform this economic burden into economic opportunity by monetising carbon reductions through international markets, potentially generating revenue while cleaning its air.

BEYOND THE CONVENTIONAL PARADIGMS, AN INTEGRATED APPROACH IS NEEDED TO FIGHT THE MENACE OF AIR POLLUTION WHILE TRYING TO TAKE PAKISTAN AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE WORLD ON MANY COUNTS.

The solution lies in systematic implementation of four concurrent tracks: carbon monetisation, transportation transformation, sectoral modernisation, and regional cooperation. There are no quick fixes.
Coherent, multisectoral implementation of these four tracks can hopefully set Pakistan on the right direction by 2030. Success requires treating this as an economic transformation opportunity rather than merely an environmental problem, leveraging international carbon markets while addressing the transboundary nature of air pollution through ‘smog diplomacy’ with regional powers.
The choice is clear: continue with failed administrative approaches and accept escalating health and economic costs, or embrace systematic transformation that can deliver cleaner air, economic growth, jobs, and regional leadership by 2030.
A crisis of national scale
Air pollution has emerged as Pakistan’s most pressing multifaceted challenge, transcending sectoral boundaries and posing unprecedented threats to public health, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) frequently soars to levels far exceeding WHO guidelines, contributing to a substantial burden of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases across the Indo-Gangetic Plain that affect over 900 million people regionally.
The 2024 smog crisis exemplified these impacts when pollution surges overwhelmed Pakistan’s healthcare system, with over 30,000 patients seeking treatment for respiratory ailments. Educational disruption affected 16 million children as schools and government offices were shut down, while parks, offices and markets closed across 18 districts. The World Bank estimates that one unit of PM2.5 causes $18.9 per capita in GDP wastage, making Pakistan’s economy “very air pollution intensive”. This pervasive environmental degradation is not static, but dynamic, exacerbated by climate variability and seasonal smog episodes. The crisis demands a series of actions to prevent escalating health and economic catastrophe.
The genesis
Pakistan’s air pollution crisis originated from incoherent policies implemented in the early 2000s, particularly the automobile loan liberalisation by a government that ironically also approved the NEP 2005, emphasising ambient air quality standards and vehicular emission controls.
Vehicle numbers surged from two million in 1999 to over 10 million by 2006, reaching 25 million by 2024, driving vehicular emissions to nearly half of Pakistan’s particulate and gaseous pollution. The NEP 2005’s medium-term implementation framework (2005-10) was never implemented seriously, while rapid vehicle expansion directly conflicted with environmental safeguards. All political governments from 2008 to 2024 continued with the same short-term approach.
During Pakistan’s period of policy drift, regional neighbours recognised air quality challenges and invested systematically in comprehensive metro systems, bus rapid transit (BRT), and emission standards. When environment became a provincial subject through the 18th Amendment in 2010, air quality management fell through institutional cracks. The National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) addressed air pollution as a climate challenge, but it was not until 2023 that Pakistan developed its National Clean Air Policy (NCAP). This institutional adrift cost Pakistan 25 years of potential progress, while the crisis deepened and neighbours advanced.
The current state
Pakistan’s air pollution stems from four primary interconnected sources: transportation and fuel quality, accounting for 45pc of year-round pollution through low-quality fuel and inadequate emission enforcement; industrial and energy production, contributing 40pc via coal-fired power plants and outdated processes; agricultural burning, contributing 10-20pc during post-monsoon seasons; and seasonal and structural factors, including winter inversions, deforestation, waste burning, and outdated brick kilns, compounding these sources across the regional airshed.
The economic burden includes healthcare expenditures, productivity losses, agricultural yield reductions, and premature mortality. The health crisis affects 11 million children under five in Punjab’s worsthit areas, demonstrating the urgent need for systematic transformation beyond administrative fixes.
Beyond administrative measures
Current policy responses remain trapped in reactive, command-and-control approaches with limited effectiveness and growing international implications.
The NCAP 2023 targets 38pc PM2.5 reduction by 2030, but remains constrained by relaxed standards, insufficient monitoring, and weak legal frameworks that increasingly conflict with international trade requirements. Under the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), these limitations pose trade risks as global markets demand credible environmental compliance, requiring Pakistan to strengthen clean air measures and align with stricter standards.
There are no shortcuts to decades of negligence.
Success requires implementation of four concurrent tracks, pursued simultaneously through multisectoral coordination. Only systematic implementation can set Pakistan on the right direction by 2030.
Track 1 involves monetising emissions through international carbon markets. The maturation of international carbon markets under the Paris Agreement presents Pakistan’s most transformative opportunity of reframing emissions from liability to tradable asset. Recent climate negotiations in Baku formally recognised voluntary cooperation mechanisms and regulated international carbon markets, enabling countries to convert reduced emissions into tradable credits.

When Punjab’s children breathe clean air by 2030, when Pakistani EVs get exported to global markets, and when carbon credits fund the nation’s green transition, the world will study Pakistan’s blueprint. This is not an environmental policy. This, instead, is an economic strategy disguised as climate action. The next five years will determine whether or not Pakistan will emerge as a new player in South Asia’s clean air landscape.

Pakistan has initiated this journey through the Delta Blue Carbon Project (2017) and approval of Policy Guidelines for Trading in Carbon Markets (2024). Thailand’s Bangkok E-Bus Programme demonstrates this financing model through Energy Absolute Public Company Limited’s partnership with Swiss entities. The project replaced thousands of internal combustion buses with electric vehicles through verified carbon credit sales to Switzerland’s KliK Foundation at over $30 per credit. South Pole verified avoided emissions sold as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes, while UNDP’s Carbon Payment for Development Programme enhanced credibility, targeting 500,000 tonnes of emission reductions by 2030.
Pakistan can replicate this model leveraging the Bank of Punjab’s joint venture agreements with Chinese manufacturers. Promising partners include such players as BYD, CATL, Geely, JAC Motors and Changan Automobile. These partnerships, combined with carbon credit financing under CPEC 2.0 can make Pakistan’s transition entirely self-funding, while creating domestic manufacturing ecosystems generating employment and export potential.
For Pakistan’s fleet of 25 million vehicle producing nearly half of national emissions, systematic electrification could generate billions in carbon revenues, creating self-sustaining financial models transforming pollution burdens into economic opportunities. Implementation requires establishing dedicated carbon market authority, quantifying emission reduction potential across sectors, and developing verified carbon credit pipelines for largescale projects.
Track 2 involves comprehensive transportation transformation. Urban air pollution fundamentally reflects transportation systems dominated by individual vehicles. Sustainable solutions require dual strategies: integrated mass transit development and large-scale vehicle electrification, moving beyond the administrative approach of temporary vehicle bans.
Current Pakistani mass transit projects operate in isolation when there should be a seamless network of buses, metro lines and feeder services. The transition’s scale necessitates public-private partnerships.
Likewise, Pakistan’s electric vehicle policy needs to go beyond setting symbolic targets. Pakistan should pursue state-backed acquisition of complete EV production lines through CPEC 2.0, providing investment certainty while securing technology transfer and local assembly capabilities. Large-scale EV rollout promises cascading benefits, including significantly reduced fuel import bills, creation of high-skilled manufacturing jobs, and profound public health improvements. The Bank of Punjab’s financing agreements demonstrate financial sector readiness to support this transition.
Success requires national vehicle retirement age standards, targeting highly polluting older vehicles, enforcing fuel quality standards reducing sulphur content, and introducing robust and mandatory vehicle fitness testing.
Track 3 involves sectoral modernisation of agriculture and industry. Agricultural crop residue burning and outdated industrial processes require systematic modernisation rather than punitive approaches. The Punjab Agriculture Department launched subsidised ‘happy seeder’ technology in 2020, enabling direct wheat sowing into unburnt rice stubble, complemented by satellite-based monitoring for real-time burning detection. Research has shown that farmers using this technology can generate up to 20pc higher profits compared to those who burn stubble, while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 78pc per hectare.
Scaling-up requires comprehensive farmer support, expanded subsidised residue management machinery, farming incentives, and soil health education campaigns. Converting crop residue to bioenergy could meet 14pc of Pakistan’s energy needs while creating rural employment and additional income streams for farmers. Establishing collection and processing networks would generate an estimated 100,000 agricultural sector jobs while reducing burning by 60pc by 2030.
In the industrial sector, many plants continue using highly polluting fuels and processes. Solutions require mandatory transition to clean production technologies through phased equipment mandates combined with economic incentives, like tax credits and subsidised loans, for clean technology investments. Technology transfer partnerships with countries maintaining advanced environmental standards can accelerate this transition while building domestic technical capacity.
Industrial modernisation ensures Pakistani exports meet international environmental standards, protecting market access worth billions in textile, cement and steel exports, while reducing emissions by 40pc by 2030.
Smog diplomacy
Track 4 involves regional cooperation and ‘smog diplomacy’. Research published in leading scientific journals has demonstrated that air pollution in South Asia operates as an interconnected regional system. As such, domestic policies alone cannot address pollution sources that are fundamentally transboundary in nature, requiring coordinated regional approaches that match the scale of atmospheric processes.
Under the Institutional Framework Development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked with diplomatic engagement to address cross-border pollution impacts with India through ‘smog diplomacy’ by building on the 1998 Malé Declaration framework.
This requires establishing a South Asian Air Quality Council to coordinate policies, share monitoring data, and manage joint funding mechanisms.
Punjab’s smog war room provides a model for crisis management protocols that can extend to bilateral cooperation through sister-province agreements between Pakistani and Indian Punjab. Joint technical working groups would coordinate crop burning alternatives, industrial emission standards, and emergency response during severe pollution episodes.
Regular bilateral summits between provincial governments would address shared challenges independent of broader political tensions. Regional mechanisms supported by UN agencies and multilateral development banks can facilitate knowledge exchange through the underutilised regional environmental cooperation frameworks.
A proposed South Asian Clean Air Fund, to be capitalised at $5 billion through member country contributions, international development banks, and carbon market revenues, could finance crossborder monitoring systems, technology transfer programmes and joint pollution control projects.
Implementation roadmap
Pakistan’s transformation requires a carefully sequenced three-phase approach across all four tracks simultaneously. Phase-I (2025-26) focuses on foundation building by designating dedicated carbon market authority, securing manufacturing partnerships, developing integrated transit master plans, initiating agricultural technology subsidies, structuring industrial modernisation incentives, and creating bilateral air quality dialogue mechanisms with India.
Phase-II (2027-30) emphasises scaling and consolidation by deploying 2.5 million EVs annually through carbon credit financing, construcwting integrated transit systems, achieving 30pc reduction in crop residue burning, and implementing mandatory industrial emission standards with comprehensive technology transfer support.
The metrics of interest should be to achieve 40pc reduction in PM2.5 levels compared to 2024, generate $20 billion in reduced health and productivity costs, create 500,000 green jobs, and to establish Pakistan as the recognised regional powerhouse in clean air innovation and crossborder environmental cooperation.
The path forward is unambiguous. No other developing nation has attempted carbon market financing at this scale, integrated with comprehensive sectoral transformation and regional diplomacy. The proposed framework positions Pakistan as the architect of South Asia’s environmental future. When Punjab’s children breathe clean air by 2030, when Pakistani EVs export to global markets, and when carbon credits fund the nation’s green transition, the world will study Pakistan’s blueprint. This is not environmental policy. This, instead, is an economic strategy disguised as climate action.
The next five years will determine whether Pakistan emerges as a new player in South Asia’s clean air landscape, or remains captive to the reform inertia that has squandered every previous opportunity for national renewal.

Malakand Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Shafiqa Gul said in a statement, “At least 15 members of the same family were killed and eight others sustained injuries when a truck overturned near tunnel No. 3 of the Swat Motorway on Thursday morning.”
The dead and injured include men, women and children, she said.
“The family was from the Gabral area of the Bahrain tehsil and were travelling to Punjab when the tragic incident occurred,” the statement said.
Rescue teams rushed to the site of the incident and carried out relief operations alongside the Motorway police, according to the spokesperson. She further said that the injured had been taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, Batkhela.
“Doctors at the hospital confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives,” she said, adding that four of the injured were in critical condition and had been referred to Swat.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi expressed his grief over the incident and expressed solidarity with the victims and their families.
 






KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, taking note of the incident, expressed “deep sorrow” at the loss of lives, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
He vowed to stand in solidarity with the victims’ families, saying that “loss of life is an irreparable tragedy.”
The governor also “wished a swift recovery for those injured in the accident,” APP reported.
 






Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Last month, at least 11 people were killed, and another three were injured after a truck crashed in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan due to brake failure.
On September 11, two women were killed, while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Mansehra. Two days before that, five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur.</p><small>2025-10-16 13:09</small></div><hr>
