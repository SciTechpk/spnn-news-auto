Myanmar has been mired in civil conflict since a military coup in 2021, with the junta battling a coalition of ethnic armed groups and pro-democracy resistance forces.
Saturday’s attack by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) targeted a military base in Kayin state at around 3pm local time, Thailand’s military said in a statement.
One hundred Myanmar soldiers and 467 civilians had crossed into Thailand on Saturday, where Thai military and police disarmed them and provided treatment and humanitarian aid, officials said.

Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed there had been fighting near the border and said that joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the army.
“Some (Myanmar troops) defe­c­ted to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he said.
Myanmar’s civil war has caused huge waves of population displacement, with 81,000 refugees or asylum-seekers from the country currently living in Thailand, according to United Nations figures.
Strike on Buddhist monastery
More than 20 civilians, including children, were killed after an  air strike on a monastery in central Myanmar, an anti-junta fighter and a resident said on Saturday.
Myanmar has been consumed by civil war since the military ousted a democratic government in 2021, and central Sagaing region has been particularly hard-hit, with the junta pummelling villages with air strikes targeting armed groups.
The most recent occurred around 1am on Friday in Lin Ta Lu village when “the monastery hall where internally displaced people were staying” was hit with an air strike, said an anti-junta fighter, requesting anonymity.
He said that 22 people were killed, including three children, while two were wounded and remained in critical condition at the hospital.
“They had thought it was safe to stay at a Buddhist monastery,” the anti-junta fighter said. “But they were bombed anyway.”
Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.

GILGIT: The climbing season on K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II, has been thrown into disarray, as climate change, unpredictable weather and scant snowfall combine to create perilous conditions for foreign mountaineers.
Dozens of international expeditions are currently stranded at the base camps of the Karakoram giants, anxiously awaiting a safe window to attempt their summits.
Polish mountaineer Waldemar Kow­ale­wski on Friday suffered a leg fracture in an avalanche incident.
A source at base camp said Kowalewski is in a stable condition in a tent at 6,500m, attended by a colleague. A rescue helicopter has been requested from the army.
Traditionally, the main climbing season for these peaks stretches from late June to mid-August. But this year, tour operators say, the risks are unusually high.
“This year, weather at the peaks are not normal,” Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator with five foreign expedition groups waiting at base camps, told Dawn.
“Less snowfall was received in winter, and there are risks of rockfall and snow avalanches.”
Sakhawat Hussain, another tour operator, confirmed that progress on the 8,000-metre peaks has been delayed.
“Even ropes have not been fixed at K2, owing to unstable conditions,” he said, adding that the lack of snow has contributed to the danger.
“There are threats of rockfall at K2 and other eight-thousander peaks this year.”
Experts believe shifting weather patterns, driven by climate change, have upended the climbing season.
Low winter snowfall, followed by intense heat, means snow melts rapidly rather than consolidating into stable ice.

Once struggling on the geo-economic front, Islamabad has found renewed space in the geopolitical theatre, not just as a reactive player, but as one redefining its regional and global bearings.
The conflict, while perilous, proved to be an inadvertent diplomatic windfall for Pakistan. New Delhi’s narrative on terrorism, long used to isolate Islamabad, now appears increasingly unconvincing, especially in the absence of credible evidence following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan’s measured yet forceful military response surprised many observers and signalled a new strategic confidence. At the same time, the quiet revival of security ties with Washington added another layer to Islamabad’s growing diplomatic leverage.
Amid this recalibration, several factors stand out. China remains Pakistan’s foremost strategic partner, followed closely by Turkiye. Equally critical are the country’s untapped mineral reserves, now drawing renewed international attention. Afghanistan’s evolving landscape and Pakistan’s counterterrorism gains have further enhanced its profile in regional security conversations. Pakistan’s diplomacy during the Iran-Israel conflict also added to its strengths.
These shifts are set within a rapidly transforming geopolitical environment that spans the Middle East, South Asia, and the Caucasus. Islamabad’s diplomatic overtures are now reaching deeper into Central Asia and even into South Asia’s periphery, particularly Bangladesh. With growing disenchantment toward India and Russia’s increasingly transactional regional posture, Pakistan finds itself in a position to cultivate new alliances, provided it can maintain strategic coherence.

The current geopolitical environment is shifting in Pakistan’s favour.

Yet, this emerging external opportunity is contingent on internal consolidation. To sustain its newfound geopolitical relevance, Pakistan must stabilise its domestic front economically, politically, and institutionally. Without internal strength, diplomatic gains risk becoming transient. Pakistan has come to the critical realisation that sustaining recent strategic and diplomatic gains requires a more effective and evolved counterterrorism strategy. This urgency was underscored last week when the military leadership emphasised the need for “decisive and holistic actions at all levels” against all shades of terrorist groups.
Currently, Pakistan is engaged in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in Balochistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border regions adjoining Afghanistan — efforts that international actors have acknowledged. However, what continues to be a point of vulnerability, and what India persistently exploits, is the lingering presence of banned groups that were once active in India-administered Kashmir, particularly Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). In recent years, Pakistan has taken concrete steps to dismantle these networks, mainly in response to FATF requirements and sustained diplomatic pressure, especially from Washington and European capitals.
Despite these measures, India continues to assert that elements of these groups remain active within Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. It has effectively used this narrative to shape international opinion, particularly in Western policy circles, and has shown little indication of abandoning this diplomatic tool. However, it is increasingly evident that sustaining such a posture requires not only rhetoric but also viable alternatives. If India’s narrative begins to lose traction without credible evidence or renewed justification, it may be compelled to recalibrate its approach, potentially opening space for dialogue on more equal terms.
The latest reports submitted by India and Pakistan to FATF reveal contrasting approaches toward addressing terrorism financing. While Pakistan’s submission reflects a structured and institutionally grounded effort, India’s input appears more selective and strategically framed to serve its ongoing narrative.
India’s contributions are included in sections related to in-kind methods, the misuse of e-commerce platforms, and the use of online payment services and VPNs to fund lone-actor terrorism. India provided two case studies; first, about an attempted attack on April 3, 2022, at the Gorakhnath Temple, and second, the February 2019 suicide bombing of an Indian security convoy, which resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers. Notably, the FATF report did not reference the Pahalgam incident, nor did it express any concern about Pakistan’s compliance status.
In the case studies presented by India, the sources of the findings are not transparently identified. In contrast, Pakistan’s case studies, focusing on the TTP and IS-K, detail how these groups exploit informal banking systems and engage in kidnapping-for-ransom to generate funds. Cruc­i­a­l­ly, Pakistan’s submissions cite the National Cou­nter Terrorism Authority as the source of the intelligence, lending greater credibility to its inputs.
The contrast between the two approaches is telling. While India continues to weaponise narratives for diplomatic leverage, Pakistan is slowly repositioning itself through institutional credibility and regulatory compliance. In a shifting geopolitical landscape, such measured engagement is likely to yield more sustainable dividends.
Indian media outlets have misrepresented FATF’s findings, selectively quoting from the latest report to falsely suggest that Pakistan is not in compliance. FATF has neither issued any warning against Pakistan nor expressed dissatisfaction with its current level of compliance. On the contrary, Pakistan’s counterterrorism financing efforts have been acknowledged and appreciated by FATF member states.
Interestingly, as India’s counterterrorism narrative loses its international traction, Pakistan appears to be adopting a similar approach, attributing almost every act of terrorism on its soil to Indian involvement. Rather than playing to India’s rhetorical framework, Pakistan would be better served by charting its own strategic course. The current geopolitical environment is shifting in Pakistan’s favour. To fully capitalise on this, Pakistan must remain focused on dismantling terrorism and insurgency through sustained, credible efforts. This, more than counter-narratives alone, will demonstrate a meaningful difference to the world.

To me, Zubeida was my senior, my colleague and my friend, and an incredible woman and human being. She brushed aside daunting personal and professional challenges to power ahead with everything that mattered to her and nothing mattered to her more than the education of Pakistanis. She was Dawn‘s first woman op-ed editor. She’d worked at the newspaper for over 30 years before being named to the position.
That was less a reflection of her ability and intellect and more on the patriarchal, male-dominated work culture we have had in the best of times and the best of places. Zubeida was very mindful of that and, on her elevation, bluntly said: this would not have happened in the past.
 
 

She inspired and contributed to the growth of dozens of journalists, women and men alike, and so many have written/talked about what she meant to them. One of her most remarkable achievements at the newspaper, where I was privileged enough to work alongside her, was the transformation of the op-ed pages which, despite her fast deteriorating eyesight and health, she single-mindedly pulled into the present from a distant past where they seemed trapped.

Zubeida was long associated with and espoused the causes of the marginalised, whether women or the poor or minorities.

Zubeida Mustafa had the guts to politely yet firmly inform a stable of former senior civil servants and ex-military officers who had weekly op-ed slots that their submissions would be assessed on merit alongside other contributors. The new op-ed editor introduced hugely talented writers, both men and women, with the latter being somewhat under-represented in the newspaper till then, and her pages acquired a new look, life, vibrancy and relevance. She also insisted on not waiting for days to write leaders and began, for the first time in the paper’s life, editorials on the day.
Her generation is often blamed, sometimes rightly, for discouraging youth in the name of favouring ‘experience’ but Zubeida placed her faith in young writers and editors on her team. Dawn‘s current op-ed editor Ayesha Azfar, who initially trained under the watchful eye of the paper’s legendary M.A. Majid Sahab, worked as Zubeida’s deputy and transitioned seamlessly into the role after her predecessor asked for retirement due to ill health.
It was in the tenure of Mrs Mustafa, as she was addressed by all Dawn editorial staff, that young Cyril Almeida was recruited on the team and was also given the Wednesday column slot vacated by the well-established and widely-read Ayaz Amir when he decided to run for parliament on a political party’s ticket. Those were huge shoes to fill for Cyril but Zubeida’s instinct stood her in good stead and the young columnist was soon to carve a niche for himself and developed his own large following.
 
 

This was a summary, albeit so brief that I worry if it does her justice at all, of her work as a team leader and editor. As a columnist, unlike so many of us who write more or less exclusively on politics pointlessly, she chose more substantial issues to address such as education. Like one of her correspondents who calls her a ‘literary friend’, Nasser Yousaf remarked in an email to me: Although no one could write English like her, she was a relentless advocate for education in the mother tongue.
Her volume of work on education, her passion, must be unprecedented in the country in terms of its quality too. She would talk with excitement and exuberance about a school in Karachi started by a woman in her garage for poor children and would talk long about how that was transforming lives. I know she supported every initiative for the provision of quality education in rural areas and, into her eighties, remained an intrepid traveller to interior Sindh to support and chronicle what Sadiqa Salahuddin and Naween Mangi (to name just two) are doing for girls’ education and development there.
After I left Pakistan, we continued to communicate via email. When I had the audacity to express positive thoughts about education in Pakistan, she shot back an email: “I felt puzzled when you wrote about education being taken up in earnest in Pakistan. Abbas, that is an impossible dream now. Who will teach? The teachers are as uneducated as the children they have to teach. What should we do then?” But despite her directness she also had a very big heart, as she added: “I continue to enjoy your columns nevertheless.” With nearly 26 million children out of school in her country, I can’t even begin to imagine her heartbreak.
Zubeida was long associated with and espoused the causes of the marginalised, whether women in a patriarchal society or the poor or the minorities. I can’t even begin to imagine how she must have suffered seeing a spate of ‘honour’ killings every year, particularly of young women exercising choice in marriage or hearing of a father killing a daughter for having a TikTok account or a father and family reportedly disowning a daughter for choosing a career in acting, so much so that her forlorn death nine months ago in her Karachi flat was discovered just this week. Nobody cared enough to inquire after her when she went incommunicado all those months ago. Only because she was a woman with her own will and mind.
But what more can a writer do but write? Zubeida Mustafa was a true legend and a fighter who battled impossible odds. It is beyond my intellect and ability to write a befitting tribute to her. She was a believer in the public healthcare system and breathed her last at SIUT, an institution she supported with unparalleled zeal. Her own last act, the gift of sight, a donation to two individuals, is the most eloquent tribute to her. Travel well, Zubeida. Thoughts are with your daughters Seemi and Huma you often told me about with such pride and your sister Dr Fatema Jawad who was by your side to the end.

After all, only the very credulous would have believed reports about the president resigning and being replaced by the army chief.
With things going the establishment’s way, what good reason could it have to suddenly tear down the civilian façade that it has built up so carefully? There seems to be no doubt in anyone’s mind about where the real power resides; even the country’s defence minister recently spoke glowingly about how well the hybrid system has been working. Why, then, would the establishment risk alienating one of its main partners by displacing its figurehead from the top constitutional office?
The answer is quite simple if one looks at the question from a different perspective. The government has panicked because there are good reasons for players in hybrid set-ups to fear conspiracies. Political scheming and machinations are, after all, a central feature of coalition governments and hybrid power-sharing arrangements, and when the balance of power between civilians and the military goes off kilter, things can unravel rather quickly.
The ‘reports’ may have been based on rumours, but they were backed up with just enough ‘facts’ to sow seeds of doubt in the minds of various stakeholders. So much so that they prompted PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui, a key advisor to the Sharifs, to come forth with an endorsement of President Asif Zardari. “He is performing excellently in his role as the constitutional head of state,” he said.
 
 

Then came Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. “For the first time, politicians, the government and the military establishment are on the same page, and that bothers certain individuals.”
This was followed by Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, the PPP-P secretary general, who noted that “Zardari is the duly elected president of this country and this system cannot function without him.”
This was followed by yet another round of assurances from the interior minister and even PM Shehbaz Sharif. The former accused “those involved in this narrative” of “collaboration with hostile agencies”, while the latter reportedly stated that “Field Marshal Asim Munir has never expressed any desire to become the president, nor is there any such plan in the offing.”
It is painful to see civilian leaders scrambling to assert their relevancy: not because the rumour carried real weight, but because it touched a nerve. Once elected office is reduced to theatre, useful only for maintaining appearances, it becomes a stage for managing perceptions rather than exercising power. Politicians quickly find that they have little left to offer but words. Mutual suspicion becomes a default setting, and the system grows increasingly brittle. And this, perhaps, is the real cost of ceding civilian supremacy.

• Notes investment in youth essential for Pakistan’s future success
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to achieving a complete economic turnaround through long-overdue reforms, structural changes and prioritising meritocracy.
Addressing a group of Pakistani students enrolled in leading global educational institutions and selected for the government’s internship initiative ‘Uraan Pakistan’, the prime minister said that when the current government took office in 2023, Pakistan was facing a serious threat of default and its future was hanging in the balance.
 






“The majority believed Pakistan would default, while only a few were optimistic we would avoid disaster,” he said, adding that he held marathon discussions with the IMF managing director and gave firm assurances that Pakistan would not default and would stay committed to the Fund’s programme.
He said that the economy was in a bad shape at that time, with inflation reaching 38 per cent while the policy rate was hovering at 22pc. The PM, in his remarks broadcast on national TV channels, further said that they had a huge responsibility to work together with unity and sincerity to steer the country out of the crisis.
“The joint efforts have paid off as now the policy rate has dropped to below 11pc. The Uraan Pakistan programme has also taken off,” he added.
He also referred to reforms and digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), saying the government had removed corrupt officials without yielding to pressure or favouritism.
“To root out corruption from the FBR, I had a clear vision and took unprecedented decisions, ignoring the culture of favouritism,” he said.
The prime minister noted that earlier, the digitisation process in FBR had only existed on paper, as no practical steps were taken, blaming corrupt and shrewd elements for misleading the system.
Now, he said, digitisation was the hallmark of FBR, where work had been converted from paper-based to digital, with multiple initiatives including AI and faceless interaction.
As a result of the measures, revenue collection in one sector had jumped from Rs12bn to more than Rs50bn in one year, highlighting the extent of previous tax evasion, he maintained.
“We face a long and thorny journey, with mountain-like obstacles, but I assure the nation we will not shy away from fulfilling our responsibilities.”
Underscoring the importance of the country’s youth, he said their role is key to Pakistan’s success, and any investment in them is an investment in the nation.
Responding to students’ queries, the prime minister said that due to climate change, Pakistan had suffered significantly during the 2022 floods, with the economy facing $30 billion in losses, despite the country’s minimal contribution to the global greenhouse effect.
To another question, he said that Pakistan faced India’s uncalled aggression against the backdrop of the Pahalgam incident in May. “I proposed an impartial international investigation, but India never responded,” he said.
He claimed that as a result of Indian aggression, 55 Pakistanis were killed. In self-defence, Pakistan shot down six Indian aircraft. “On May 9 and 10, following India’s attack, Pakistan responded with full might and taught the enemy a lesson,” he said.
The prime minister praised the armed forces for their professionalism and bravery, stating that Pakistan had won the conventional war. He reiterated that Pakistan’s nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and self-defence.

• Orders issued for immediate restoration of irrigation channels amid drought threat
GILGIT: Extremely high summer temperatures and erratic weather patterns continue to cause destruction in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a cloudburst-induced flood damaged 13 homes, agricultural land, crops, and other properties in Gilgit and Ghizer on Saturday.
The flood also blocked Naltar Highway, Gilgit-Ghizar road and other link roads.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Deputy Director Raja Zahooruddin Babar described the cloudburst as “unprecedented,” as such an event had never been recorded in these areas before.
He said cloudbursts have happened in GB before; however, the scale of the disaster this time was unprecedented.
The cloudburst resulted in a heavy downpour in several areas of Gilgit and Ghizer districts, resulting in flash floods. At least 13 homes were damaged by the deluge along with farmlands, crops, water and irrigation channels and other properties in Shiroot and Shakyot areas of Gilgit.
A flash flood and landslides at Bargo Pari area in Gilgit damaged a car, two motorcycles and a tractor. Falling rocks blocked the Gilgit-Ghizer Road, which disrupted traffic for many hours.
Mr Babar of GBDMA stated that the road was later cleared and reopened for traffic. The authority is assessing damages in the area. No loss of human life or injury was recorded, he said. He added the cloudburst-induced flood also damaged farmlands and infrastructure in Biarchi and Gulapur areas of Ghizer. He said the authority was working to restore link roads in the area.
The Naltar expressway has been blocked at 10 locations from Nomaal to Naltar Valley.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain, along with Nagar Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan and other officials, visited the affected sites in Nagar district, including Hamari Tokorkot and Supultar nullahs.
Earlier on Thursday, floods damaged 20 homes and crops in Babusar area of Chilas.
On Friday, light rainfall across GB brought down the temperature.
Recovery efforts
This year, record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
The GBDMA DG has issued directives to expedite the restoration of irrigation channels damaged by recent floods.
The extensive damage to farmlands and crops and the unavailability of water posed a risk of drought in the region.
Mr Hussain told Dawn that GBDMA is prepared to protect vulnerable communities and dozens of households have been relocated to safer places.
The affected families in Nagar, Gilgit, Ghizer and Diamer have been provided with food and other items.

The DPP was originally established under the International Plant Protection Convention, while AQD was tasked with preventing the entry of foreign animal diseases. Their integration into NAFSA is intended to create a modern, scientific, and data-driven body capable of ensuring compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements while also facilitating access to quality agricultural inputs to promote surplus production and national food security.
A DPP official said NAFSA reflects the ministry’s broader vision of promoting sustainable agricultural exports and enhancing Pakistan’s credibility as a reliable source of plant and animal products. The authority will replace outdated structures with a technology-driven institutional framework aligned with international best practices.
While the DPP has shown relatively better performance in plant protection, AQD faced persistent staffing constraints that hampered its efficiency. However, sources familiar with the development noted uncertainty regarding NAFSA’s future role in locust control—a responsibility previously managed by the DPP.

NAFSA to align Pakistan with global food safety and phytosanitary standards

According to a press release issued by the ministry on Saturday, the reforms are aimed at improving Pakistan’s compliance with international trade requirements and boosting its export competitiveness. On the directives of Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, the DPP has undertaken a series of transformative, corrective, and disciplinary measures over the past six months to strengthen regulatory systems and operational efficiency.
Import regulations
As part of the broader institutional overhaul, the DPP has initiated several strategic projects, including the upgrading of testing laboratories and the establishment of modern infrastructure.
One of the most significant reforms has been the revision of import regulations based on scientific assessments, leading to a substantial reduction in the use of Methyl Bromide (MB) — a pesticide often applied unnecessarily. This regulatory shift has resulted in cost savings of Rs30,000 to Rs40,000 per container, particularly benefiting imports of cotton, grains, pulses, and lentils.
The move has been welcomed by industry stakeholders as a major step toward rationalised pesticide use and environmental sustainability.
The ministry also revealed that a detailed internal audit — carried out under the minister’s instructions for stricter compliance and transparency— found that a company was importing Methyl Bromide from a suspicious source. A rigorous investigation followed, involving third-party verification and document cross-checking.
The company’s licence was promptly suspended for regulatory violations, and, in coordination with Pakistan Customs, four under-process shipments worth approximately $1 million were intercepted at the port before clearance.
These enforcement measures not only prevented the potential entry of hazardous substances but also reinforced the ministry’s zero-tolerance stance on malpractice. Disciplinary action has been initiated against officials found involved in misconduct.
The minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to structural reforms, stating that Pakistan’s agricultural and quarantine systems will be aligned with international benchmarks.
He stressed that no leniency will be shown to those who violate the law or compromise national interests.
The unearthing and disruption of this high-value scam, he said, underscores the ministry’s resolve to uphold transparency, fair competition, and institutional integrity.

A similar number of infections are also believed to have been prevented, while billions of euros have been generated in estimated economic benefit.
The Gavi vaccine alliance, which backed the study, said it collaborated with researchers at Burnet Institute in Australia to provide the world’s first look at the historical impact of emergency immunisation efforts on public health and global health security.
“For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases,” Gavi chief Sania Nishtar said in a statement. “This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective countermeasure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks.”
The study, published this week in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health, examined 210 outbreaks of five infectious diseases — cholera, Ebola, measles, meningitis and yellow fever — in 49 lower-income countries between 2000 and 2023.
Vaccine roll-outs in these settings had a dramatic impact, with the study showing they reduced both the number of infections and deaths by almost 60pc across the five diseases. For some of the diseases the effect was far more dramatic.
Vaccination was shown to decrease deaths during yellow fever outbreaks by a full 99pc, and 76pc for Ebola.
At the same time, emergency vaccination significantly reduced the threat of outbreaks expanding.
It also estimated that the immunisation efforts carried out during the 210 outbreaks generated nearly $32bn in economic benefits just from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.
That amount was however likely to be a significant underestimate of overall savings, it said, pointing out that it did not take into account outbreak response costs or the social and macro-economic impacts of disruptions created by large outbreaks.
The massive Ebola outbreak that hit West Africa in 2014, before the existence of approved vaccines, for instance saw cases pop up worldwide and is estimated to have cost the West African countries alone more than $53bn.

Over the past year, multiple attacks have been reported across KP in which remotely operated quadcopters were used to drop explosives. The military has blamed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for these attacks.
In Bannu, the quadcopter dropped ammunition at the Miryan police station building, an official told Dawn.
“The munition fell in the compound of the pol­i­­ce station and did not cau­se any damage,” he claimed.
He said policemen depl­oyed at the station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The cops opened fire at the unmanned quadcopter but failed to hit it due to its high altitude.
It was the fifth quadcopter attack on the same police station in the Miry­­an area during the last month, showing a surge in the use of advanced quadcopter technology by terrorists.
A search operation was launched to arrest the at­­t­ackers and security was be­­efed up across the district.
Attack repulsed
In Lakki Marwat, cops repelled a midnight attack on a police station in the Serai Gambila town.
A police official said around a dozen armed men attacked the police station with light and heavy weapons late Friday night in a bid to take over the building.
“It was a multi-pronged attack as assailants circled the police station and tried to strengthen their position before launching the attack,” he added.
“After an intense exch­ange of fire, the assailants managed to flee the pla­ce,” he claimed, adding that all policemen deployed at the police station remai­ned safe in the attack.
The Serai Gambila poli­­ce station is located along the Peshawar-Karachi High­way near Gambila river.
It has been attacked several times in the past.
KP Inspector General of Poli­­ce Zulfiqar Hameed and Bannu Regional Police Of­­ficer Sajjad Khan lauded cops for “bravely” repulsing the attack and thwarting the terrorists’ plan to breach the police station building.

The indirect talks over a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire are nonetheless expected to continue, the sources told Reuters.
According to AFP, which cited two Pales­tinian sour­ces with knowledge of the discussions, indirect talks are being held up by Israel’s proposals to keep troops in the territory.
Israel has meanwhile kept up its strikes on Gaza and the territory’s civil defence agency said more than 20 people were killed on Saturday, including in an air strike on an area sheltering the displaced.
“We all generally came here because we were told it was a safe area,” Bassam Hamdan told AFP after the overnight attack in an area of Gaza City. “While we were sleeping, there was an explosion… where two boys, a girl and their mother were staying. We found them torn to pieces, their remains scattered,” he added.
Medics said 17 people trying to get food aid were killed on Saturday when Israeli troops opened fire, the latest mass shooting around a US-backed aid distribution system that the UN says has resulted in 800 people killed in six weeks.
Witnesses who spoke to Reuters described people being shot in the head and torso. The news agency reported seeing several bodies of victims wrapped in white shrouds as family members wept at Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military claimed its troops had fired warning shots, but that its review of the incident had found no evidence of anyone hurt by its soldiers’ fire.
Seven UN agencies warned in a joint statement on Saturday that if fuel runs out in Gaza, it would be “an unbearable new burden on a population teetering on the edge of starvation”.
Delegations from Israel and Hamas have been in Qatar for a week in a renewed push for an agreement which envisages a phased release of hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals and discussions on ending the war.
US President Donald Trump, who hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the past week, had said he hoped for a deal soon. But the Israeli and Palestinian sources described longstanding issues that remain unresolved.
A Palestinian source said that Hamas had rejected withdrawal maps which Israel had proposed that would leave around 40 per cent of Gaza under Israeli control, including all of the southern area of Rafah and further territories in northern and eastern Gaza.
Two Israeli sources said Hamas wanted Israel to retreat to lines it held in a previous ceasefire before it renewed its offensive in March.
The Palestinian source said matters regarding aid and guarantees on an end to the war were also presenting a challenge. The crisis could be resolved with more US intervention, the source said.
Hamas has long demanded an agreement to end the war before it would free remaining hostages; Israel has insisted it would end the fighting only when all prisoners are released and Hamas is dismantled as a fighting force and administration in Gaza.
Shooting
Saturday’s reported mass shooting near an aid distribution point in Rafah was the latest in a series of such incidents that the United Nations rights office said on Friday had seen at least 798 people killed trying to get food in six weeks.
“We were sitting there, and suddenly there was shooting towards us. For five minutes we were trapped under fire. The shooting was targeted. It was not random. Some people were shot in the head, some in the torso, one guy next to me was shot directly in the heart,” eyewitness Mahmoud Makram told Reuters. “There is no mercy there, no mercy. People go because they are hungry, but they die and come back in body bags.”
After partially lifting a total blockade of all goods into Gaza in late May, Israel launched a new aid distribution system, relying on a group backed by the United States to distribute food under the protection of Israeli troops.
The United Nations has rejected the system as inherently dangerous and a violation of humanitarian neutrality principles. Israel says it is necessary to keep “militants” from diverting aid.
Since Oct 7, 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, displaced almost the entire population of more than two million people, sparked a humanitarian crisis and left much of the territory in ruins.

• Gohar says leadership will also take up suspension of 26 MPAs
LAHORE: The PTI top leadership arrived in Lahore on Saturday to devise a strategy for its nationwide protest, which will reach its crescendo on Aug 5 to seek the release of party founder Imran Khan, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur describing the Lahore visit as the formal launch of the movement.
Before their departure, the party leaders held a meeting in Islamabad  to discuss several issues, including the potential disqualification of  the party’s Punjab Assembly lawmakers who had been suspended by the  speaker.
In the evening, a caravan of KP lawmakers led by CM Gandapur, as well as Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar reached Lahore via G.T. Road. During a layover in Jhelum, the KP CM said that the protest had been launched, and the parliamentary meeting in Lahore would mull the final protest strategy to step up the campaign ahead of the two-year anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment on Aug 5.
PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s parliamentarians were going to Lahore for a meeting and added they would discuss the issue of 26 MPAs, suspended by the Punjab Assembly speaker. “The Punjab government has been unleashing fascism for the past two years, and now it is time that common sense should prevail,” he stressed.
Though there were reports that the Punjab police could block PTI parliamentarians’ entry into Lahore, the leaders had said they would stage a sit-in at the blocked point. However, the parliamentarians, led by CM Gandapur, made a smooth entry and camped at a farmhouse in Raiwind, Lahore.
The police, however, did raid party leaders and workers’ homes throughout the day and even went to the Shahdra Morr – Lahore’s entry point on G.T. Road – and took into custody five leaders, including Yasir Gillani from among those gathered to welcome the PTI caravan.
At a late-night party meeting in Raiwand, CM Gandapur told parliamentarians that they had reached the ‘political hub of the country’ to launch their protest campaign. “Any campaign launched from Lahore earns success and this too will be successful across the country,” he asserted.
Asserting that party leader Imran Khan is in jail for no valid reason, CM Gandapur advised party leaders to move forward through consultations and plans in respective jurisdictions to step up the protest campaign. “All the provinces should prepare their protest plans and implement them in line with their local issues and take the protest campaign to its peak by Aug 5,” he asserted.
He said the establishment had been ruling the country for decades and imposed multiple martial laws as part of different experiments, destroying the country. “The establishment this time has imposed a new kind of martial law, which is not official, but wielding every kind of power and pressure,” he observed and added that it destroyed the country but the perpetrators were not even showing any remorse.
At the meeting, Mr Bhachar said Punjab could not warmly welcome CM Gandapur because a “fascist government” was ruling Punjab that even lacked parliamentary as well as social norms. Mr Bhachar said the party’s 11 MPAs were suspended after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came to the assembly and her second visit led to the suspension of 26 members. “This clearly shows the level of fear the Punjab government is facing from PTI’s 107 tigers in the Punjab Assembly,” he asserted.
“Though the PTI leaders and workers are facing thousands of FIRs, the party is all set to launch a massive protest campaign aimed at the release of Imran Khan, his wife and all political leaders,” he added.
While the PTI parliamentarians have camped in Lahore, the party’s Punjab chapter, led by Aliya Hamza Malik, had already mobilised party workers across the province and assigned duties to step up the protest campaign and take to its pinnacle on August 5.
Before leaving for Lahore, the party’s interim chairman Barrister Gohar Khan, while talking to media persons, said that the party had already sent a letter to the provincial government stating that it would hold a meeting in Lahore. However, he made it clear that the party was not planning to hold any rally or public meeting in the provincial capital.

The new air service will help facilitate commerce, reduce travel time and costs for traders, and strengthen bilateral ties, said Ali Reza Rajai, Iran’s acting consul general in Quetta.
The announcement was made at a ceremony organised by the Pak-Iran Joint Chamber of Commerce.
The flights are intended “to facilitate trade and travel between Pakistan and Iran,” Rajai said, stressing the need for stronger cooperation.
Top officials from the airline, including Iran Air Chief Agha Karimi and Deputy Chief Agha Ismail, were also in attendance.
Mr Rajai said the new service would be critical for enhancing port-to-port cooperation between Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and Iran’s Chabahar Port. 
He called for bureaucratic hurdles to be removed to improve bilateral business, including streamlined visa processes and affordable fares.

The KPCIP, funded jointly by the Asian De­­velopment Bank (ADB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the KP government, is aimed at improving urban infrastructure and municipal services in key cities, including Peshawar, Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan and Mingora. 
Concerns regarding serious procurement violations, non-compliance with engineering and tax laws, and suspected corruption were formally brought to the PAC chairman by some members of the provincial assembly, including Sajjad Ullah of JUI-F, Taj Muhammad, Muhammad Riaz and Munir Hussain Lughmani (independents), and Muhammad Arif of the ruling PTI.
According to a formal complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the joint venture awarded multiple contracts under the KPCIP — comprising Zahir Khan and Brothers and Turkish firm T.T. Sh-Insaat LLC — was allegedly not registered with the FBR, KP Revenue Authority, or Pakistan Engineering Council at the time of bidding. 

Payments allegedly made despite negligible on-ground work

The complaint alleges that not only was the awarding of contracts unlawful, but undue financial favour was extended to the firm, resulting in the disbursement of Rs32bn, despite minimal on-ground physical progress. 
The complainants suggest that false progress certifications, weak oversight, and collusion among consultants and project staff may have enabled the payments.
Taking notice of the allegations, the PAC chairman and KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati has convened a special meeting on July 17.
‘Replies to all allegations’
Kashif Jan, Project Director of Zahir Khan and Brothers, while speaking to Dawn said that he was aware of the allegations made by the MPAs.
“We have been preparing a detailed presentation, for the PAC, in which there will be replies and clarifications to all the allegations. It is not correct that Turkish firm T.T.Sh-Insaat LLC is not registered or contract has been awarded against the rules. 
“Moreover, we have been working transparently and have ensured quality of work in all projects. Zahir Khan and Brothers is a well-reputed firm and we never compromise on quality,” he said. 
Replying to a question, Mr Jan hoped that the PAC will reject the allegations as he has all the relevant documentation.

“On the instructions of (PML-N President) Nawaz Sharif and (Punjab Chief Minister) Mar­­yam Nawaz, a budget of Rs35bn has been allocated for my constituency NA-120,” said Mr Sadiq while addressing party workers at his constituency here on Saturday.
“Currently, development work worth Rs19bn is underway in my constituency. There were no roads or sewerage systems here before. Now sewerage will be installed, clean drinking water available, and roads built. No street in any area will be left behind, I assure. All streets will be paved,” he said while praising Maryam Nawaz.
“The Maryam administration has allocated Rs70bn development budget for Lahore or all constituencies of the city in the first phase. In the second phase, a sum of another Rs70bn will be spent,” a senior official of the Punjab government disclosed while talking to Dawn on Saturday.

Federal ministers Tarar and Aleem also using their good offices to secure funds from CM, party source says

“Besides Mr Sadiq, federal minister Atta Tarar (who won from NA-127), Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) head and federal minister Aleem Khan (who secured NA-117), PML-N financers Khokhar brothers — Saiful Maluk (also PML-N Lahore president) and Afzal Khokhar who bagged NA-126 and NA-125 seats, respectively, — are using their good offices to secure maximum funds from the CM for their constituencies,” a party source said. 
Mr Tarar, who won the seat against PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and PTI’s Zaheer Abbas Khokhar, is keen to contest future elections from the same NA-127 constituency, which previously belonged to late Pervaiz Malik, former PML-N Lahore president.
The ruling party MNAs are not only seeking funds from the provincial government but also from the Shehbaz Sharif administration.
When the PML-N lawmakers met the prime minister and asked for more funds for their constituencies, the latter advised them to increase interaction with their constituents and resolve their problems on a priority basis.
While Nawaz, Shehbaz, Maryam and Hamza, all from the Sharif family, contested the 2024 elections from Lahore, the source said, this time around neither Nawaz nor Hamza was pressing the Punjab government for spending on their constituencies, considering the allocation of an equal amount of uplift fund to all Lahore constituencies happens to be pain in the neck of the provincial administration.

It is the sixth Grand Slam singles title for Swiatek, 24, and her first tournament victory since Roland Garros in 2024. She has never lost a Grand Slam final.
The lopsided 57-minute result was the first “double bagel” in a major final since Steffi Graff routed Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 to win the 1988 French Open. It was the first 6-0, 6-0 women’s final at Wimbledon since 1911.
 






“It seems super surreal,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. “First, I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks. You should be proud of the work you are doing, and I hope we will play more finals here.”
Anisimova, 23, was appearing in her first major final. She committed five double faults and finished with only eight winners and 28 unforced errors.
Swiatek never faced a break point to become Poland’s first Wimbledon singles champion. She converted six of nine break chances and finished with 10 winners and 11 unforced errors.
With Swiatek’s win on the grass courts of the All England Club, the former World No 1 has won Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces: four French Opens on clay (2020, 2022-24) and the US Open hardcourt in 2022.
“I didn’t even dream, for me it was way too far. I feel like I am already an experienced player after winning the Slams before, but I never expected this one,” Swiatek said. “This year I really, really enjoyed it and feel I improved my form here. It’s amazing and I’m going to enjoy this moment.”
Despite the disappointing finish, Anisimova’s performance in London, including a win over World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals, will vault her into the Top 10 for the first time on Monday.
“Congratulations Iga. Thank you to everyone who’s supported me,” Anisimova said at the trophy presentation.
“It’s been an incredible fortnight for me and even though I ran out of gas today and I wish I could have put in a better performance for you today, you guys still lifted me up, so thank you so much.”
It was the 100th career Grand Slam match win for Swiatek, who improved to 100-20 since making her main draw debut in 2019.
She is the eighth consecutive first-time women’s champion at Wimbledon since Serena Williams won her seventh title in 2016.</p><small>2025-07-12 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12220919e90860d.jpg?r=221127' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923742/wwii-memorial-shields-other-items-stolen-from-karachis-frere-hall' target='_blank'><strong>WWII memorial shields, other items stolen from Karachi’s Frere Hall</strong></a><br><p>World War II memorial shields and other high-value items were stolen from an office of the director general of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Parks Department in the city’s iconic Frere Hall, it emerged on Saturday.
The building, one of the most iconic in the metropolis, was completed in 1865 and a US-funded restoration project was completed last year.
A first information report (FIR), available with Dawn.com, was filed under Section 380 (theft in dwelling) of the Pakistan Penal Code by the deputy director of the KMC Parks Department at Artillery Maidan police station on July 7.
“The suspects have stolen a DVD player, one speaker, five World War II memorial shields and a cable of precious shield copper,” the FIR read.
It claimed that the items were stolen by unidentified burglars, who broke the windows and entered Frere Hall during the Ashura holidays.
The complainant said that the DG Parks office had been closed on July 4 at 10pm for the Ashura holidays. When the office re-opened on July 7 at around 9am, employees found that the office’s rear window was broken.
“During a search, we found that a DVD player, one speaker, five World War II memorials and one precious shield cable copper were stolen by unidentified person(s),” the complainant alleged.
Later, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that a suspect was identified in connection with the burglary and police were trying to bring him in for questioning.
“A contractor, under whose supervision the stolen items were kept in the room, has also been called for investigation,” he added.
DIG Raza said that the DG Parks has yet to provide further information, though the complainant stated that he would visit the police on Monday.
“Concerted efforts are underway to arrest the suspect and recover the antiques,” said the DIG, adding that the police are checking CCTV footage for possible identification of the burglars.
“Additionally, the local scrap market within Frere police jurisdiction has been checked and informants have been tasked accordingly,” DIG Raza added. “A breakthrough in the case is expected very soon.”
Robberies are very common in Karachi.
In May, a suspected thief was shot by security guards in the Keamari locale while trying to steal a pole-mounted transformer.
The Jackson police said that around five to six thieves attempted to steal the transformer at the Pak Shaheen Yard near Ziauddin Hospital. The PMT fell on the floor, which created a loud noise and drew attention.
The yard’s manager and guards came out, prompting the suspects to start shooting. The guards returned fire, after which one suspect was killed at the scene while another was injured. The other suspects managed to escape.</p><small>2025-07-12 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12181440c05eb6d.png?r=183916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923729/jui-f-chief-fazl-advises-change-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-administration' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F chief Fazl advises ‘change’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday suggested that there should be a “change” in the PTI-led Khyber Pakht­un­khwa government, adding that it would be better if the change came from within the ruling party amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a “regime change” in the province.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has warned against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.
Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, “My advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.”
Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.
He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was “fake” and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.
 


Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, “The common citizen’s life is insecure today.
“If the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.”
Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, “We strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.”
Fazl said that the committee formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.
“From all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven’t given our representatives,” he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow’s grand tribal jirga.
“Is this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?” he asked.
The JUI-F chief said that if he was content with the federal government’s decisions, then he would have joined them. “Both the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,” Fazl said.
JUI-F senator says reservations with KP CM Gandapur
Later, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza said, “We have had reservations against KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.”
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, Murtaza said that he had personal reservations with Gandapur and his party did as well.
“The reason is his inappropriate behaviour and language; he is not a well-liked personality for us,” the senator said.
“However, we don’t want the government to fall.  So if PTI itself takes that decision that a certain individual will not continue and will be replaced by another, JUI-F would certainly welcome that decision,” Murtaza said.
He added that Gandapur being from Dera Ismail Khan, the same district Fazl hailed from, was not a a factor in the decision.
KP Governor Kundi says ex-Fata committee not about reversing merger
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the ex-Fata committee was not “about reversing the merger of Fata and the province”.
Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, he said, “The committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a jirga was held.
“The provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.”</p><small>2025-07-12 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/122037484121f34.jpg?r=213440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923736/islamabad-court-halts-banning-of-5-more-youtube-channels' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court halts banning of 5 more YouTube channels</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Saturday suspended a lower court’s order to block 27 YouTube channels to the effect of five more channels, a day after a similar halt on channels of two journalists.
It emerged on Tuesday that an Islamabad court had ordered YouTube last month to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces. The sanctioned accounts were being run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas.
On Friday, an Islamabad district and sessions court admitted two revision petitions — submitted by journalists Matiuallah Jan and Asad Ali Toor — against the judicial magistrate’s order blocking 27 YouTube channels, suspending the ban for the two petitioners. Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the two revision appeals and ordered the suspension in a one-page written order for each petition.
Six more of those affected had appealed against the lower court’s order today. ADSJ Majoka heard the case and granted similar relief to the following five individuals: Makhdoom Shahabuddin, Orya Maqbool Jan, Abdul Qadir, Uzair Anwar and Umair Rafique.
The court adjourned proceedings on Habib Akram’s application till July 14 due to the unavailability of the petitioner. As per the short orders, seen by Dawn.com, the petitioners contended that they were not even given a prior notice and that the ban violated Article 10-A of the Constitution. The judge agreed that no notices were issued to the petitioners before the blocking order was passed and the point needed further consideration.
The ban order sparked criticism from various legal and digital rights groups.
On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the owners of these channels would face criminal action.
The Forum for Di­­gital Rights and Democracy (FDRD) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Wed­n­esday condemned the decision, calling it a “bla­­tant violation” of fundamental rig­hts and an assault on press freedom.
 
 

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has also expressed concern over the ban, stating, “The wholesale blocking of entire channels — rather than addressing specific instances of unlawful or hateful speech in accordance with due process — conflates dissent with criminal activity.”
“The constitutional right to freedom of expression is fundamental not only for individual liberty but also for ensuring government accountability, fostering debate and enabling the public to access a diversity of viewpoints,” the HRCP said, urging “precise and proportionate” interventions against hate speech.
On March 20, Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.
In May, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lifted the ban on X after the platform was inaccessible to users for more than a year. The social media platform was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections, while the caretaker government was still in power.</p><small>2025-07-12 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1218253985de82e.jpg?r=183103' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923731/trump-intensifies-trade-war-with-30pc-tariffs-on-eu-and-mexico' target='_blank'><strong>Trump intensifies trade war with 30pc tariffs on EU and Mexico</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Saturday imposed a 30 per cent tariff on imports from Mexico and the European Union beginning on August 1 after weeks of negotiations with the key trading allies failed to reach a more comprehensive trade deal.
The fresh tariffs were announced in separate letters posted on Truth Social on Saturday.
Earlier this week, Trump issued new tariff announcements for a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, Canada and Brazil, as well as a 50pc tariff on copper.
The EU had hoped to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the US for the 27-country bloc.
It had been bracing for the letter from Trump outlining his planned duties on the United States’ largest trade and investment partner after a broadening of his tariff war in recent days.
The EU initially hoped to strike a comprehensive trade agreement, including zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods, but months of difficult talks have led to the realisation that it will probably have to settle for an interim agreement and hope something better can still be negotiated.
The 27-country bloc is under conflicting pressures as powerhouse Germany urged a quick deal to safeguard its industry, while other EU members, such as France, have said EU negotiators should not cave into a one-sided deal on US terms.
Trump’s cascade of tariff orders since returning to the White House has begun generating tens of billions of dollars a month in new revenue for the US government. US customs duties revenue shot past $100 billion in the federal fiscal year through to June, according to US Treasury data on Friday.
EU warns of ‘countermeasures’, Italy to remain focused on trade talks
The EU is prepared to take the necessary steps to safeguard its interests if the US proceeds with the 30pc tariff on European goods, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.
Von der Leyen, who heads the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement that the bloc remained ready “to continue working towards an agreement by Aug 1”.
“Few economies in the world match the European Union’s level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices,” she continued. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.”
 






Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said in a statement from her office that it is crucial to remain focused on trade negotiations with the United States and avoid further polarisation.
Meloni was confident that a “fair deal” could be reached on tariffs between the European Union and the United States, the statement added.
“Rome fully supports the efforts of the European Commission,” the PM’s office said.
Mexico slams tariffs as ‘unfair deal’
Mexico slammed the 30pc tariffs as an “unfair deal,” according to a government statement.
“We mentioned at the table that it was an unfair deal and that we did not agree,” the Mexican economy and foreign ministries said in a joint statement.
Mexico is already in negotiations seeking an alternative to tariffs that would protect businesses and jobs on both sides of the border, the ministries added, saying they hope to avoid the duties.
Mexico is one of the countries most vulnerable to the Republican leader’s tariffs, with 80pc of its exports destined for the United States, its largest trading partner.</p><small>2025-07-12 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12204020c7c8bc0.jpg?r=204959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923739/syrian-israeli-officials-to-meet-in-baku-diplomatic-source-in-damascus' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian, Israeli officials to meet in Baku: diplomatic source in Damascus</strong></a><br><p>A Syrian and an Israeli official are expected to meet in Baku later on Saturday on the sidelines of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to Azerbaijan, a diplomatic source in Damascus with knowledge of the issue said.
“There will be a meeting between a Syrian official and an Israeli official on the sidelines of the visit being conducted by Sharaa in Baku,” said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Israel is a major arms supplier to Azerbaijan and has a significant diplomatic presence in the Caucasus nation, which neighbours its arch foe Iran.
The diplomatic source stressed that Sharaa himself would not attend the Baku meeting, which would focus on “the recent Israeli military presence in Syria”.
After the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria to prevent key military assets from falling into the hands of the interim administration headed by Sharaa.
It also sent troops into the UN-patrolled buffer zone that used to separate the opposing forces on the strategic Golan Heights, from which it has conducted forays deeper into southern Syria.
Sharaa has said repeatedly that Syria does not seek conflict with its neighbours and has instead asked the international community to put pressure on Israel to halt its attacks.
His government recently confirmed that it had held indirect contacts with Israel seeking a return to the 1974 disengagement agreement, which created the buffer zone.
Israel has views Sharaa’s government in the context of his past links with Al-Qaeda.
But late last month, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was interested in striking a peace and normalisation agreement with Syria. A Syrian government source quoted by state media responded that such talk was “premature”.
But during a visit to Lebanon this week, US special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said: “The dialogue has started between Syria and Israel.”
After meeting Sharaa in Riyadh in May, US President Donald Trump told reporters he had expressed hope that Syria would join other Arab states which normalised their relations with Israel.
“[Sharaa] said yes. But they have a lot of work to do,” Trump said.
The Syrian president arrived in Baku earlier today for talks with his counterpart, Ilham Aliyev.
Azerbaijan announced it would begin exporting gas to Syria via Turkiye, according to a statement from the Azerbaijani presidency.</p><small>2025-07-12 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1218003641d7ce6.jpg?r=201301' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923730/man-killed-by-wifes-relatives-over-allegedly-murdering-her-in-hyderabad-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man killed by wife’s relatives over allegedly murdering her in Hyderabad: police</strong></a><br><p>A 50-year-old woman was allegedly murdered by her husband over a domestic dispute in Sindh’s Hyderabad with the man himself beaten to death by the wife’s family in retaliation, according to the police.
Husri Station House Officer (SHO) Juman Khoso told Dawn.com that a man killed his wife over “some domestic issue” in the village of Khuda Dino Panhwar. He added that the victim’s family members beat the suspect to death as well after the alleged murder.
“The suspect used an axe and sticks in beating his wife to death and was also mercilessly beaten,” he said.
Khoso said that neighbours of the couple claimed the suspect often used to beat his wife over petty issues and such incidents had become a matter of daily routine. “Even neighbours had given up intervening to resolve the issue,” he added.
The SHO said that as per the woman’s relatives, the suspect had previously served a jail term for the murder of two people.
The bodies were taken to the local branch of Liaquat University Hospital and the police were reported to have detained some suspects. No first information report has been lodged so far.
Incidents of violence against women are common across the country. In December 2023, a study by the Asian Development Bank reported that domestic violence was emerging as a silent pandemic in Pakistan, posing a serious challenge to society and the state.
In April, a man was arrested for the murder of his wife over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal neighbourhood.
The same month, another woman was alleged to have been murdered in a so-called honour killing near the Superhighway in Karachi, while a man was arrested on charges of killing his pregnant wife after he misled the police as to her cause of death.</p><small>2025-07-12 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/122005177a62f2e.jpg?r=200616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923735/javelin-aces-arshad-nadeem-neeraj-chopra-to-clash-in-poland-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>Javelin aces Arshad Nadeem, Neeraj Chopra to clash in Poland next month</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s Olympic javelin champion Arshad Nadeem and India’s Neeraj Chopra are set to lock horns next month at the Diamond League event in Silesia, Poland, in their first head-to-head contest since the Paris Olympics, it emerged on Saturday.
The match-up comes amid heightened political tensions between Pakistan and India, which have spilt over into the world of sports.
A press release from the Diamond League, issued on July 9, announced the athletes taking part in the upcoming competition in Poland, including Kenyan middle-distance runner Faith Kipyegon.
The contest between Nadeem and Chopra was described as “the first opportunity for revenge after the Paris Olympics”.
“The Pakistani’s form remains something of a mystery, as he rarely appears on the European circuit,” the press release read. “The exception he will make on August 16 results from his desire to face Chopra.”
The press release noted that Chopra threw 90 metres this spring, adding that he is “yearning for more”. Last week, Chopra headlined the ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ — billed as India’s inaugural world-class field competition — and walked away with another gold medal.
In May, Nadeem threw a massive 86.4m to win gold in the men’s javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea.
A day before an April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir, Chopra had announced that the world’s top throwers, including Nadeem, had been invited to the first Neeraj Chopra Classic. However, the attack in Kashmir prompted heavy criticism of Chopra’s decision to invite Nadeem.
Nadeem ultimately did not attend the event.</p><small>2025-07-12 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12164900175d90a.jpg?r=165153' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923722/mqm-founder-altaf-hussains-condition-has-greatly-improved-party-official' target='_blank'><strong>MQM founder Altaf Hussain’s condition has ‘greatly improved’: party official</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain’s health has been on the mend after he was admitted to the hospital, according to a video by a party official posted on Saturday.
Hussain was recently hospitalised in London due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests. London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi told Dawn.com that the MQM founder’s treatment was ongoing and “hopefully it’s not something serious”.
In a video message posted early on X today, Azizabadi stated that the MQM founder’s health had improved since yesterday.
“Altaf Hussain bhai (brother) has undergone some tests and blood transfusion has been given. The tests show that Altaf bhai’s health … has greatly improved,” Azizabadi said. “Doctors are treating him according to the test results.”
He highlighted that misinformation had spread about Hussain’s condition, calling it “upsetting”.
 






An update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors conducted a detailed medical examination and agreed to continue treatment in light of the test reports from a day ago.
“Doctors have advised continuing blood transfusions for Altaf Hussain today as well due to a decrease in blood count.”
 






Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.
 
 

Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.
The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p><small>2025-07-12 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12145507f45b97c.jpg?r=154731' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923713/supreme-judicial-council-dismisses-19-complaints-against-judges-for-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Judicial Council dismisses 19 complaints against judges for hearing</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Saturday reviewed complaints against different judges of the superior judiciary, “unanimously” dismissing 19 of them.
Earlier this week, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi called the SJC meeting to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and to ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.
According to a press release dated today, seen by Dawn.com, the council examined 24 complaints under Article 209 of the Constitution. It said, “19 complaints were unanimously decided to be filed while five others were deferred for the time being.”
The meeting was chaired by CJP Afridi and attended by senior puisine judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice  Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.
The press release also said, “The proposed draft of SJC Secretariat Service Rules, 2025 was approved by the council,” adding that the Procedure of Enquiry, 2005 and amendments in the Code of Conduct “needed to be examined from legal and drafting point of view” which required further deliberation.
The SJC had appointed Justice Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.
In February, the SJC examined as many as 46 complaints against constitutional office-holders, disposed of 40 of them, sou­ght comments on five complaints and as­­ked for further information in one case.</p><small>2025-07-12 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12154315935069d.png?r=154352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923718/japan-police-arrest-indian-national-accused-of-raping-teenage-girl-in-shiga-region-report' target='_blank'><strong>Japan police arrest Indian national accused of raping teenage girl in Shiga region: report</strong></a><br><p>Police in Japan’s Shiga prefecture have arrested an Indian man for allegedly raping a teenage girl last month, local news outlet Kyoto Shimbun reported.
Shiga’s Otsu police arrested the man, identified as a 24-year-old temporary worker, on Thursday on suspicion of assaulting and raping a teenage high school girl.
The man allegedly assaulted the “girl living in the prefecture, including by choking her, and then having sexual intercourse with her at a hotel in Otsu city”.
The incident took place in the early hours of June 21, according to the report, which was also carried by Tokyo Reporter.
It quoted the Otsu police as saying that the suspect and the girl did not know each other. The man had gone with her to the front of a hotel under the pretence of asking for directions, then forced her into a room, the police said.
The suspect denied the charges and was quoted as saying, “I did not force her.”
 
 

In May, Japanese police said they arrested a former taxi driver on suspicion of drugging and raping a female passenger, with media reports saying police found about 3,000 videos and images of him sexually assaulting around 50 women in his taxi or his home.
In India, a court jailed a 31-year-old man for life in February following the rape and murder of a young Irish woman in the tourist resort state of Goa, nearly eight years after the crime.
The month prior, a Kolkata court handed a life sentence to a police volunteer convicted of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
In March 2024, police in Dumka district of India’s Jharkhand state arrested eight men in connection with the gang rape of a Spanish tourist.

Pakistan and Bahrain share close fraternal ties based on shared culture and religion, with both countries having cooperation in security and economy.
Naqvi met with Gen Rashid in Manama on Thursday, according to the Bahrain News Agency (BNA). Both officials emphasised the need to “further strengthen their security collaboration”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported today.
 






The two sides held discussions on bilateral cooperation in counterterrorism, combating human trafficking and anti-narcotics efforts. They also mulled making the Pakistan-Bahrain Joint Security Committee more effective.
The Bahraini interior minister expressed his appreciation for cooperation and coordination between the two countries in various fields, including security, according to Radio Pakistan.
“We value the security cooperation with Pakistan,” he was quoted as saying.
On his part, Naqvi highlighted that enhancing cooperation in counter-narcotics and anti-human trafficking efforts was the “need of the hour”.
 
 

Naqvi was received by Gen Rashid upon his arrival at the Bahrain International Airport and was presented with a guard of honour at the Ministry of Interior headquarters, BNA reported.
Deputy Interior Minister Lt Gen Adel bin Khalifa Al-Fadhel, the chief of Public Security Forces, and senior ministry officials were also present during the meeting.
In February, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed a desire to increase the trade volume between the two countries in a meeting with a parliamentary delegation from Bahrain.
Speaking to the same delegation days before, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said Pakistan and Bahrain have vast opportunities to explore collaboration in investment, trade, information technology and tourism.
