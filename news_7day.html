Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is chairing the meeting, which is being attended by top civil and military leadership and is deliberating “upon [the] internal and external situation arising after the Pahalgam false flag operation”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Yesterday, India shut borders, downgraded diplomatic ties and, in an unprecedented move, unilaterally announced the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty over what the BJP government and media claimed — without offering any evidence — was Islamabad’s alleged support for cross-border terrorism. Pakistan has denied any role in the attack and offered condolences for the loss of lives.
Today, Indian media reported that the government has blocked the Pakistani government’s X account in the country and summoned the Pakistani charge d’affaires in New Delhi.
Among the Indian measures it announced yesterday, the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
India further downgraded diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.
 
 

The attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000.
“The meeting of the national security committee has started,” AFP quoted a statement from the information ministry.
The NSC meeting is set to “discuss in detail India’s irresponsible actions after Pahalgam false flag operation”, Radio Pakistan said in a report.
It will review the response to “India’s hastily taken, impulsive and impractical water measures”, the report said, referring to the IWT.
Ahead of the meeting, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, and some other ministers had reached the PM House in Islamabad, a Dawn.com correspondent said.
 


On the other hand, India has summoned Saad Ahmad Warraich, the top Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi, the Hindustan Times reported on Thursday, citing sources.
Amid rising tensions, India has withheld access to the official X account of the Government of Pakistan, NDTV reported.
India’s PM Narendra Modi has also called for a multi-party meeting with opposition parties to brief them on the government’s response to the attack.

Deputy PM Dar, appearing on Dunya TV late last night, had lashed out at India’s approach, calling it “immature” and “hasty”.
“India has not given any evidence. They have not shown any maturity in their response,” Dar said. “This is a non-serious approach. They started creating hype immediately after the incident.”
Diplomatic observers warn that the Indian response and Pakistan’s counter-messaging could push bilateral relations to new lows, further widening a rift that has persisted since the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot crisis. The treaty suspension, in particular, risks sparking long-term water disputes, while the downgrading of diplomatic ties could hinder any future de-escalation efforts.
Analyst Michael Kugelman said the attack posed a “very serious risk of a new crisis between India and Pakistan, and probably the most serious risk of a crisis since the brief military conflict that happened in 2019”.
Kugelman called India’s actions “highly consequential retaliations”, highlighting that “in 2019, India threatened to suspend IWT but didn’t follow through”.
 
 

Pakistan’s Foreign Office had yesterday expressed concern and condolences over the loss of tourists’ lives. The Indian government had vowed that a “loud and clear” response would be delivered to the attack.
Tuesday’s attack is seen as a setback to what Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have projected as a major achievement in revoking the special status occupied Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed and bringing peace and development to the long-troubled Muslim-majority region.
Ministers criticise ‘water warfare’ by India
Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari said suspending the water treaty “in haste and without regard for its consequences amounts to water warfare”.
In a statement issued by the Ministry of Power Division, the minister said: “India’s reckless suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is an act of water warfare; a cowardly, illegal move. Every drop is ours by right and we will defend it with full force — legally, politically and globally”.
Federal Minister for Water Resources Mian Moeen Wattoo said India could not take a unilateral decision on the IWT because it had the endorsement of international organisations.
Wattoo asserted that Pakistan would not succumb to “external pressure and any aggression from the Indian side would be responded to in a befitting manner”, according to a statement carried by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
Former railways minister Khawaja Saad Rafique noted that India took the measures “without proof or evidence”, terming the move “sad and unwise”.
“The Indus Water Treaty is not just an agreement between Pakistan and India, it was arbitrated by the World Bank and it has international guarantees,” he said in a televised statement.
He added: “It would have been better if they (India) had any evidence, they should have brought it forward or taken it to an international forum, but levelling allegations like this does not suit any government.”
Rafique highlighted that either of the two sides cannot unilaterally suspend the pact. “For a long time, Indian leaders were trying to break free from the treaty but this could not be possible,” he said.
“By disrupting the treaty, India has fanned the flames of tensions in the region,” the former minister noted.
 


Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, also highlighted that the move was not in accordance with the treaty.
“This is always the stance India takes whenever such incidents happen. Without any investigation or evidence, they single out Pakistan as the culprit,” she told Geo News.
She stressed that the defence minister had clarified that Pakistan had “nothing to do with the attack”.
“Indian media is calling for revenge and military action, which in my opinion will be extremely dangerous,” she warned.
Aggressive measures by India
The announcement of punitive measures came after Tuesday’s meeting of India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), chaired by PM Narendra Modi.
Among the measures, the CCS said the Attari border check post was closed; Pakistanis in India under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) had 48 hours to leave the country, while others could return by May 1; defence personnel at the Pakistani High Commission in India had a week to leave the country and staff at the high commissions would be reduced as well.
“The CCS was briefed in detail on the terrorist attack on 22 April 2025 in Pahalgam, in which 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen were killed. A number of others sustained injuries. The CCS condemned the attack in the strongest terms and expressed its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and hoped for the early recovery of the injured,” Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told a press conference after the CCS meeting.
The statement said: “Recognising the seriousness of this terrorist attack, the CCS decided upon the following measures,” detailing how the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 will be held in abeyance “with immediate effect, until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
“The Integrated Check Post Attari will be closed with immediate effect. Those who have crossed over with valid endorsements may return through that route before May 1, 2025,” it said.
Additionally, Pakistani nationals will not be permitted to travel to India under the Saarc visa scheme. “Any SVES visas issued in the past to Pakistani nationals are deemed cancelled. Any Pakistani national currently in India under SVES visa has 48 hours to leave India.”
 
 

Furthermore, defence attaches and advisers at the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi had been declared ‘Persona Non Grata’ and given a week to leave India.
“India will be withdrawing its own Defence/Navy/Air Advisers from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad… The overall strength of the High Commissions will be brought down to 30 from the present 55 through further reductions,” Misri said.
The statement also said that security forces had been put on high alert. “As with the recent extradition of Tahawwur Rana, India will be unrelenting in the pursuit of those who have committed acts of terror, or conspired to make them possible,” the foreign ministry statement said, referring to a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
Kashmiri students report harassment, attacks
In the wake of a search operation launched by India yesterday, students from occupied Kashmir have reported harassment and intimidation in other cities, AFP quoted a student association as saying.
Kashmiri students in states including Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were allegedly asked to leave their rented apartments or university hostels yesterday, Jammu and Kashmir Students Association convenor Nasir Khuehami said.
At a university in Himachal Pradesh, students were harassed and physically attacked after hostel doors were broken, Khuehami said.
The students were allegedly called “terrorists”, he added.
“This is not just a security issue”, he said. “It is a deliberate and targeted campaign of hate and vilification against students from a particular region and identity”.
In Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun, around 20 students fled to the airport yesterday following warnings from Hindu Raksha Dal, a fringe right-wing group.
The students said that the group threatened Kashmiri Muslim students with dire consequences if they did not leave town at the earliest.
‘Loud and clear’ response
Meanwhile, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh vowed a swift response to those who carried out and planned the Pahalgam attack.
“Those responsible and behind such an act will very soon hear our response, loud and clear,” Singh said in a speech in New Delhi, a day after the attack.
“We won’t just reach those people who carried out the attack. We will also reach out to those who planned this from behind the scenes on our land.” Singh did not identify those he believes are responsible for the killings, but said that “India’s government will take every step that may be necessary and appropriate”.
A hospital list verified by police recorded 26 men who were killed on Tuesday afternoon, when gunmen burst out of forests at a popular tourist spot in Pahalgam, and raked crowds of visitors with automatic weapons. All those killed were listed as residents of India, except one man from Nepal.
Separately, an encounter was reportedly underway bet­ween Indian security forces and suspected militants in the Tan­gmarg area abutting Pah­algam, at the time of going to press.
In a separate incident in Baramulla on Wednesday, the army killed two people after a “heavy exchange of fire”, saying the gunmen were part of an “infiltration bid”, AFP reported.

The benchmark KSE-100 index declined by 1,086.51, or 0.93 per cent, to stand at 116,139.63  from the previous close at 11:13am.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said, “The market opened lower amid fears of escalating tensions between Pakistan and India.
“However, positive corporate earnings have supported a partial recovery,” he noted.
“Going forward, investor sentiment will hinge on the trajectory of India-Pakistan relations, upcoming corporate results, and the monetary policy decision expected in early May.”
On macroeconomic indicators, he highlighted that inflation was at a record low — with the the monthly current account at a record surplus, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) stood “at a stable 101”.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, attributed the negative momentum primarily to tensions between India and Pakistan.
In other factors, she noted that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had also lowered the country’s economic growth target.
 
 

“However, the major reason behind the momentum remains tensions between India and Pakistan — although, on the economic front, our inflation numbers are expected to be low,” she said, adding that Fitch had also  highlighted concern that the rupee may slide to Rs285 against the US dollar by June and likely fall further to Rs295 by the next fiscal year’s end.
“However, it was more or less expected — we expect it to reach Rs283,” she stated.
In a major escalation of regional geopolitical tensions, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan with immediate effect in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam a day ago. Pakistan, in response, has convened a meeting of the National Security Committee to deliberate the resulting situation.
The attack took place in Pahalgam — a tourist hotspot in the scenic Muslim-majority territory that draws thousands of visitors every summer — and at least 26 people were killed, all men, while police said another 17 people were injured, when gunmen opened fire on visitors in the popular destination.
Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at FRIM ventures, noted that the market had recovered slightly from the early drop of 2pc “amid heightened tensions” following the Pahalgam attack.
“Investors remain cautious, weighing potential additional responses from India and Pakistan,” he highlighted.
However, he observed that the macroeconomic context was “far more resilient” now than in 2019 during the Pulwama attack, which had led to a sharp 5pc decline.
“Back in FY2019, Pakistan faced high inflation, a widening current account deficit, and fiscal stress,” he stated. “In contrast, FY2025 is marked by relative stability and stronger fundamentals.”
Given this backdrop, he said that any short-term dip of 2pc to 4pc could actually “offer a compelling buying opportunity”.
“In my view, such pullbacks should be seen as accumulation windows for long-term investors,” he said.
Earlier, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also lowered Pakistan’s economic growth forecast to 2.6pc, raising concerns over its economic outlook.
In its latest update, the IMF slashed the growth estimate to 2.6pc for the current fiscal year and 3.6 for the next fiscal year. It also put the inflation estimate at 5.1pc and 7.7pc for the current and next fiscal years.
The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serves as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
Yesterday, the index fell below the 118,000 barriers on renewed concerns about Pakistan’s economic outlook and rising geopolitical tensions caused a wave of panic selling by cautious investors.
India’s forex, interest rate traders turn cautious after attack
India’s foreign exchange and interest rate traders have turned cautious on fears of a possible escalation in tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad following the attack.
A day after the attack, the Indian rupee recorded its worst performance in two weeks. The currency continued to weaken on Thursday, falling to 85.6625 against the US dollar.
Worries about New Delhi’s response to the attack are leading to some unease, according to three bankers.
The attack has played a role in the rupee’s weakness, coupled with the recovery in the dollar index, a senior treasury official at a bank said.
However, it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of each factor on the rupee’s decline, said the banker, who asked not to be identified as he is not permitted to speak to media.
Dollar/Indian rupee forward premiums rose alongside the Indian rupees decline. Indian bonds fell and interest rate swaps hardened.
While the size of the moves “is not big by any measure”, it reflects the uncertainty on what could unfold next, a forex and swap trader at a bank said.
India’s 5-year overnight index swap rate has risen 12 basis points from Wednesday’s low, while the 1-year OIS is up by about half that amount.
Meanwhile, the 10-year India benchmark bond yield climbed to 6.36pc on Wednesday and held near that level on Thursday.
Alok Sharma, head of treasury at ICBC, anticipates the 10-year yield will stay above 6.30pc because of the caution following the attack. This sentiment is driving “more paying interest” in OIS and forward premiums, he said.
The market was “reacting to uncertainty, not fundamentals,” Manish Bhargava, CEO of Straits Investment Management, said.
“The path forward depends on how the situation unfolds.”

“[US President Donald Trump]’s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless — it is illegal,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement.
The southwestern state is joined by Democratic-led Minnesota, New York, Oregon and others in the filing. Separately, California filed a similar suit a week ago.
Trump has sent markets into tumult in his second term, turning decades of free trade policy on its head with his “Liberation Day” announcements of new tariffs against numerous countries.
 
 

Trump has imposed an additional 145 per cent import duties on China, and Beijing responded with its own 125pc tariffs on US goods. On Wednesday, Trump told reporters he’s working on a “fair deal with China”.
Meanwhile, he has imposed 10pc tariffs on other trade partners — and he is threatening more punishing levies.
In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, the states argue that the 1977 law invoked by Trump does not allow him to use emergency measures to impose tariffs, a power constitutionally reserved for Congress.
“By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the president has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,” the lawsuit alleges.
Trump has said his protectionist policy will return manufacturing jobs to the United States.
“No matter what the White House claims, tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to Arizona consumers,” Mayes said.
On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Trump’s approval rating has fallen steadily during his first three months in office, hitting a low of 44pc this week.
Democrats are seizing the opportunity to illustrate how his policies are hurting pocketbooks.
Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom called Trump’s tariff policy “the worst own-goal in the history of this country”.</p><small>2025-04-24 08:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/24112004750443b.png?r=112806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906180/multan-sultans-likely-to-opt-for-fresh-bidding' target='_blank'><strong>Multan Sultans likely to opt for fresh bidding</strong></a><br><p> 

ISLAMABAD United opener Andries Gous hits out during the Pakistan Super League match against Multan Sultans at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.—APP

LAHORE: HBL Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans is expected to opt for fresh bidding instead of retaining the franchise under the existing policy of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which requires a 25 per cent increase on the original purchase price.
Sultans, who joined the league in 2018 — two years after the PSL’s inception — were sold for $6.5 million annually on an eight-year agreement, the highest among all franchises. In contrast, the original five franchises were sold at comparatively lower annual prices and for a 10-year term.
Under the current PCB policy, franchise owners can retain their teams by paying a 25 per cent increment on the original annual fee. This would mean Multan Sultans’ ownership would require an annual payment exceeding $7.9 million, while franchises like Karachi Kings would pay roughly $3.25 million annually — based on their original $2.6 million valuation over 10 years.
Given the substantial financial implications, Sultans’ management appears inc­lined towards rebidding, though the move carries the risk of losing the franchise to a higher bidder.
A spokesperson for the franchise told Dawn that owner Ali Tareen remained committed to the team and dismissed reports suggesting he intended to part ways following the ongoing PSL season.
“Ali Tareen has not said he is walking away from Multan Sultans,” the spokesperson stated. “We do have the option to renew at a 25 per cent increase, but that would mean operating at a financial loss.”
Ali, through the spokesperson, indicated his preference to re-enter the bidding process in the hope of securing a valuation more in line with that of the Karachi Kings.
“My strategy is to exercise our right to exit the current agreement and bid again—ideally at a more realistic valuation,” Ali said.

Speaking at the conference on ‘Nuclear Deterrence in the Age of Emerging Technologies’, hosted by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS), Gen Hayat described India as “the only nuclear-armed state governed by an extremist ideology”.
He noted the ideological alignment of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), saying the government actively promotes Hindu nationalism.
 






“Yet, the world chooses silence. Why? Because India is a large country, and the West’s focus is fixated on containing China,” Gen Hayat said, adding that “these are the double standards, and they are dangerous for global peace and stability.”
He also criticised India’s official use of the name “Bharat” at international platforms, calling it a signal of a deeper ideological transition from a secular democracy to a “Hindu Rashtra”.
“India is no longer ‘India.’ It is now ‘Bharat,’ and this is not just a name change — it is a signal,” he said.
Gen Hayat warned that India now possessed the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal and had remained the largest arms importer for over a decade. He highlighted India’s expanding missile development programme, calling it a reflection of growing military ambitions.
India’s strategic behaviour is unfolding across three dangerous dimensions: ideological extremism, technological militarisation, and political assertiveness, he said.
“With the fastest-growing nuclear programme, long-range missile development, and a decade as the top arms importer, this trifecta is destabilising South Asia,” he added.
Gen Hayat also addressed the challenges posed by “multi-domain deterrence” — a strategic concept that integrates capabilities across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Previously absent from traditional deterrence frameworks, multi-domain deterrence introduces a more complex and layered challenge to the global security architecture.
The two-day conference drew experts from Australia, Canada, China, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States to discuss the military implications of emerging technologies.

This is a potentially historic moment.
For over 60 years, through wars, near-conflict, and complete diplomatic breakdowns, the treaty endured. Water, unlike so much else in the India-Pakistan relationship, had remained predictable. That predictability is now in question more than it has ever been.
The decision potentially marks a turning point in how the two countries manage the most essential shared resource between them. There will be many other discussions in the days ahead that dwell on geopolitics. The goal for this article is simpler: to understand the implications for Pakistan’s rivers, crops, people, and policymakers.
What matters most in the days and months ahead is not the threat of a sudden cutoff, but the erosion of reliability of a water system that millions depend on every single day.
How the treaty works
Before we get into what India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty might mean, it’s worth recalling what the treaty actually did. Signed in 1960 after years of negotiation, with the World Bank as broker, the Indus Waters Treaty has been one of the most durable transboundary water agreements in the world.
It divided the six rivers of the Indus Basin between the two countries. India received the three eastern rivers (the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej). Pakistan received the three western rivers (the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) which account for the majority (almost 80 per cent) of the shared basin’s water.
As part of the agreement, India retains the right to use the western rivers for non-consumptive purposes like hydropower, and for limited irrigation, but is not allowed to store or divert their flows in ways that harm downstream access. These constraints are deliberately specific and enforceable and include engineering design features and notification procedures. For Pakistan, this structure provides more than water. It provides the predictability needed to build an entire irrigation and water management system around.
 
 

The treaty also provides a standing mechanism for cooperation and conflict resolution. A Permanent Indus Commission exists, with one commissioner from each country, tasked with exchanging data, reviewing new projects, and meeting regularly.
Disagreements are resolved using a tiered process: technical questions go first to the commission, unresolved differences may be referred to a neutral expert, and legal disputes may be sent to an international Court of Arbitration, with the World Bank playing a role in both forums. This process has been used before to resolve disagreements over India’s Baglihar and Kishanganga dams — it is designed to prevent unilateral action. The treaty has no expiry date, and it includes no provision for suspension. Article XII makes clear that it can only be modified by mutual agreement. That has never happened.
The hydrologic reality
One common question that arises in moments like this is whether India can simply “stop the flow” of water into Pakistan. In the immediate term, the short answer is no. Certainly not at the scale that would make a meaningful dent in flows during the high flow season.
The Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab are enormous rivers. Between May and September, as snow melts, these rivers carry tens of billions of cubic meters of water. India has some upstream infrastructure on these rivers, including the Baglihar and Kishanganga dams, but none of it is designed to hold back these kinds of volumes. These are run-of-the-river hydropower projects with very limited live storage. Even if India were to coordinate releases across all its existing dams, all it may be able to do is slightly shift the timing of flows.
The overall volumes in the western rivers during this high-flow period are far too large to meaningfully disrupt without flooding its own upstream regions. India already utilises most of the flow from the eastern rivers allocated to it under the treaty, so any new actions on those rivers would have a more limited downstream impact.
A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical. That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.
Over the medium to longer term, the picture becomes more complicated. If India chooses to act outside the treaty framework, it opens the door to developing new infrastructure that would give it greater control over the timing and volume of flows into Pakistan. But even then, the path is far from straightforward. Any large-scale dam or diversion project would take years to build. The sites available in Indian-occupied Kashmir for significant water storage are limited and geologically challenging. The financial cost would be enormous. And the political risk would be even greater.
Pakistan has long said that any attempt by India to construct major new storage on the western rivers would be viewed as an act of war. In today’s age of satellites, these structures would not be invisible. They would be contested politically and possibly militarily.
There are also hydrological constraints. Holding back high flows on rivers like the Chenab or Jhelum risks flooding upstream regions in India itself. And the idea of diverting water out of the Indus Basin entirely, into other parts of India would require enormous infrastructure and energy costs that would be hard to justify, even in peacetime.
 
 

Beyond the basin, there are reputational and strategic risks. India is itself a downstream riparian on the Brahmaputra and other rivers that originate in China. This (often overlooked) reality has historically shaped India’s approach to respecting downstream rights. By suspending the treaty and acting unilaterally, it sets a precedent that could one day be used against it. This is not a cost-free move and could complicate its efforts to frame itself as a reliable partner in other international negotiations.
Possible Implications for Pakistan
While the physical and political limits on disruptions by India are real, the erosion of treaty protections still matters. This is not because water will stop tomorrow, but because the system it supports was never built for uncertainty. The flows of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab are the backbone of our agriculture, our cities, our energy system. At this moment, we simply do not have a substitute for these waters.
For Pakistan, the impact of India’s disruption (if manifested) could be far-reaching. Pakistan’s irrigation system is one of the largest in the world, and it depends almost entirely on the predictable timing of flows from the western rivers. Farmers plan their sowing around those flows. Canal schedules are designed based on assumptions that have held for decades. If that rhythm is even slightly disrupted, the water system will begin to fray.
 
 

The most immediate risk is to predictability. Even if the total volume of water coming into Pakistan does not change immediately, small changes in when that water arrives can cause real problems. A late-season delay during the wheat planting cycle, or an unexpected dip in flow during the dry winter months, can mean missed sowing windows, lower yields, and higher costs. The Indus Delta is already shrinking due to reduced freshwater outflows. Further uncertainty in upstream flows could accelerate that degradation, with consequences for coastal livelihoods and fisheries.
Any shortfall or shift in river timing will force the state to make hard choices about water allocation. This risks intensifying inter-provincial tensions, especially between Punjab and Sindh, where water-sharing debates are already politically charged.
Then there’s energy. A third of Pakistan’s electricity comes from hydropower, generated by water flowing through Tarbela, Mangla, and other reservoirs. If upstream flows are reduced or poorly timed, it could cut into generation capacity. None of this is speculative. Pakistan is already a water-scarce country, living close to the edge. A system that has long been run on thin margins now faces a new layer of uncertainty.
Historical context
This week’s announcement did not come out of nowhere. While the Indus Waters Treaty has long been praised for its durability, the last decade tells a story of mounting strain.
In 2013, a Court of Arbitration ruled in Pakistan’s favour by requiring India to release minimum environmental flows downstream of the Kishanganga project (upstream on Jhelum), and reinforced limits on reservoir drawdown. This successful resolution was a continuation of the treaty’s ability to manage complex engineering disagreements.
But that pattern began to shift after the 2016 Uri attack. India suspended routine cooperation, began fast-tracking dam projects it had long delayed, and started linking water to broader security narratives. Even then, India said it would work “within the pact.”
 


That too began to change in 2023, when India formally invoked Article XII(3) (the provision that allows for treaty modification only by mutual consent) and requested renegotiation, citing climate change, national development needs, and Pakistani obstruction. Pakistan refused to renegotiate.
In the months that followed, both countries doubled down on competing legal strategies. India pursued a neutral expert to review technical dam design questions; Pakistan pushed ahead with a Court of Arbitration. By early 2025, both mechanisms were active in parallel; this is something the treaty never envisioned.
This most recent announcement that India would “suspend” its obligations under the treaty marks the culmination of a long, escalating trajectory. For the first time since 1960, one country has effectively stepped outside the treaty’s procedural and cooperative framework. Whether this is a negotiating tactic or a permanent break remains to be seen. What comes next will test not just bilateral diplomacy, but the resilience of Pakistan’s water system in a world where guarantees no longer hold.
The Indus Waters Treaty is not perfect. But it does something few agreements between adversaries manage to do. It keeps the rivers flowing and gives both countries a reason to keep talking, even when everything else has broken down. That framework is now under strain. Whether the treaty is reinstated in full, renegotiated, or left to fade in practice, what follows will be harder.
Without clear rules, even small projects can provoke mistrust. Every monsoon, every reservoir, every dry spell becomes a potential source of tension. At a time when climate change is already intensifying droughts and floods, and when both countries face rising domestic water stress, the last thing the region needs is another layer of uncertainty. Yet that is where we now find ourselves.
The western rivers are not just shared rivers. They are Pakistan’s primary source of water. In the long run, there may be reforms or alternatives. But in the here and now, there is no substitute. These rivers sustain lives, livelihoods, and landscapes across the country. Pakistan can simply not afford to let it become collateral in a political fight. Thus, the flows must continue. Not out of goodwill, but because the consequences of stopping them are too great for either country to bear.
The Indus and its tributaries that have sustained civilisations for thousands of years, now test the capacity of two modern nuclear-armed nations to cooperate. The coming months and years will reveal whether wiser heads prevail, or if the subcontinent will enter a new, uncertain era of unilateralism on its most precious resource: water.</p><small>2025-04-24 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/241027567f3a46e.jpg?r=102841' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906247/sharp-rise-in-dg-khan-suicide-bids-through-wheat-pills-calls-for-regulation' target='_blank'><strong>Sharp rise in DG Khan suicide bids through wheat pills calls for regulation</strong></a><br><p>DERA GHAZI KHAN: The intensive care unit at the Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital has witnessed a sharp rise in cases of suicide attempts through consumption of wheat pills, with doctors calling for an immediate ban or strict regulation on the sale of these toxic preservatives.
As per hospital records, 215 patients were admitted last year (2024) after ingesting these toxic substances, resulting in 55 fatalities.
In the current year alone, 81 cases have already been reported, with a mortality rate of 45 per cent.
 
 

Medical experts attribute this alarming trend to the easy accessibility of the pills, which are commonly used as pesticides and preservatives.
Doctors are urging immediate government intervention.
“Wheat-preserving pills are proving deadly, and their unrestricted sale must be stopped,” said Dr Ibrar Hussain Khosa of the ICU.
 
 

“The government should intervene before more lives are lost.”
In response to the crisis, the deputy commissioner acknowledged the gravity of the situation and assured that the matter would be referred to the food department and other relevant authorities for immediate action.

BAHAWALPUR: Locals allegedly killed a rare Indian grey wolf in the desert of Cholistan near Derawar Fort, about 70kms from here, the other day.
Bahawalpur division Wildlife Deputy Director Muhammad Usman Bokhari confirmed to Dawn that an Indian grey wolf, a rare species, was spotted by some locals, who allegedly chased and killed the animal near Derawar Fort.
He claimed that one of the alleged killers has been arrested. He was identified as Makhan, son of Khadim, a resident of Azeemwala toba (pond) in the limits of Derawar police station in Yazman tehsil of Bahawalpur district.
He said Makhan was in police custody for further legal action, while the search for his fleeing accomplices was on.

One of the suspects arrested

He said a case under the Punjab Protected Areas’ Act was instituted against the suspects who allegedly killed the rare animal.
 
 

According to some local wildlife experts, the Indian grey wolf is an endangered species facing an extinction threat. It is rarely found in the dry and semi-desert areas of Pakistan, India and Iran. The animal is short in height and likes to live away from human population, they say.
They say that the sighting of Indian grey wolf had never been reported in Bahawalpur’s desert region, adding that it may have crossed into Pakistani territory from the Indian Rajasthan.
They say that these animals only visit populated areas in search of food and shepherds kill them to protect their goats and sheep from their attack.
The experts regretted the killing of such a precious and rare animal at the hands of villagers, saying the wildlife field staff, who have vehicles equipped with wireless sets and other gadgets, besides medical equipment, should have acted promptly to save the rare wolf.
They added that the wildlife security and field staff concerned should be vigilant around the clock and check illegal hunting and poaching in the desert area.

The officer said that the accident occurred apparently due to speeding. However, the police were further investigating the case.
 
 

The SHO claimed that the driver responsible for the incident was arrested and the tanker seized.
The body and injured were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the condition of two women was critical as they had sustained serious injuries.
Meanwhile, police on Wednesday claimed to have arrested a man and his daughter for their alleged involvement in a robbery case.
Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said the New Karachi police arrested a suspect who used his daughter to snatch a motorcycle at gunpoint. He added that they were arrested with the help of CCTV footage.
The suspect was identified as Bilal Siraj and his daughter as Shumaila.

Some hints to watch for</strong></a><br><p>VATICAN CITY: No one knows who the world’s Catholic cardinals will choose to succeed Pope Francis as the new leader of the global Catholic Church. But for those watching attentively, there are sometimes hints about who might emerge as the next pontiff.
The process to choose a new pope is long and secretive. Most of the world’s 252 cardinals are coming to Rome to take part. Those under the age of 80, about 135 prelates, are preparing to enter into a conclave to elect the next pontiff.
Once it starts, which by Church law should be no earlier than May 6, the cardinals will be completely shut off from the modern world until a new pope is named.
In the meantime, they can attend public events and give interviews about what they are looking for in the next leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.

Vatican declares nine days of mourning

“Reading the pre-conclave signs to identify papal candidates is tricky, because the signs are usually very subtle,” said John Thavis, a Vatican correspondent who covered three papacies.
Pope Francis died on Monday aged 88. There is no clear frontrunner to succeed him.
As the pope was recovering from pneumonia over the Easter weekend, he asked retired cardinals over the age of 80 to preside in his place at the Vatican’s various celebrations of the holiday, possibly because he did not want to signal any favourite successor.
The pope’s funeral, on Saturday, April 26, will be the first big moment to watch for signs of who might be next.
Tens of thousands, including dozens of world leaders such as US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, are expected in St. Peter’s Square for the ceremony. Millions more will be watching across the globe.
The cardinals attending will listen closely to the sermon given by Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the ceremonial leader of the College of Cardinals and a retired Vatican official.
At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, the sermon was delivered by German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who offered what many thought was a stirring elocution on the late pope’s life and legacy. Eleven days later, Ratzinger would be elected as Pope Benedict XVI.
Re is 91 years old, cannot enter the conclave and is not a papal contender. But insiders expect he might still try to offer a guide for his confreres to follow in the way he chooses to describe Pope Francis’ papacy, or in any words he uses to describe the needs of the Catholic Church today.
Hints emerging slowly
The papal funeral marks the first of nine days of mourning for the global Church. Another Mass of mourning will be held in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday. That will be led by Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, often cited as a leading papal contender.
“The cliche is he who enters the conclave a pope leaves a cardinal,” said Christopher Bellitto, an historian at Kean University in New Jersey who specialises on the Church.  “Only prophets know what is going to happen.”  Other hints for possible successors to Pope Francis will likely come out more slowly.
In 2013, as the cardinals gathered in Rome after Benedict’s surprise resignation, some of the US prelates preparing to take part in the conclave started giving press conferences. The wider group of the world’s cardinals later asked them to stop doing the briefings.
Even if there are no press conferences this time, cardinals spending time in Rome often celebrate Masses at churches across the city. The sermons they offer on those occasions could give indications of what they are thinking.
“Any signs will come in bits and pieces, or phrases used to describe what cardinals are looking for in the next pope,” said Thavis.
“Words like ‘openness’ and ‘reform’ may fit certain cardinals, while ‘administrative skills’ and ‘solid theology’ may describe others,” he said.
Behind closed doors
The biggest hints will come in the daily meetings the cardinals have in the week leading up to the conclave. In these meetings, known as  “general congregations”, the cardinals have an opportunity to speak freely and even, perhaps, to offer a vision for a future papacy under their own leadership.
In 2013, Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio offered a short reflection at one of those meetings. He said the Church, beset by sexual abuse and financial scandals, had become  “sick” and too  “self-referential”, according to a text that was later published. He said the Church needed to do a better job of trying to open itself up to the modern world. A few days later, Bergoglio would be elected as Pope Francis.
Nine days of mourning
The Vatican on Wednesday announced that nine days of mourning for Pope Francis will start on Saturday, the day of his funeral.
There will be prayer events every day at St Peter’s Basilica for the so-called  “novemdiales”, which will last until May 4. The announcement came as Catholic cardinals met to discuss the next steps following the death of the Argentine pontiff on Monday aged 88.
No date has yet been set for the conclave, the secret meeting of cardinals aged under 80 to elect a new pope. But it has to take place between 15 and 20 days after the pontiff’s death.

A Nov 27 ceasefire sought to end more than a year of hostilities between the two sides that began with Iran-backed Hezbollah’s cross-border fire at Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas.
More than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon, most of them during two months of all-out war that erupted in September, according to Lebanese authorities.
Among the dead were hundreds of Hezbollah fighters and a slew of senior commanders. HRW said “two unlawful Israeli strikes” on the town of Yunin in the eastern Bekaa Valley that killed more than 30 people “were apparent indiscriminate attacks on civilians”.
“At least one of the attacks used an air-dropped bomb equipped with a United States-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit,” it said. “The attacks should be investigated as war crimes.”
On Sept 25, a strike “killed a family of 23 people, all Syrians, including 13 children”, HRW said, while another on Nov 1 on a two-storey house “killed 10 people, including two children, one of them a year old”. HRW said it “did not find any evidence of military activity or targets at either site” and that the Israeli army did not issue evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. The rights watchdog said it had contacted the Israeli military about its findings but had “not received a response”. Agency has also contacted the military for comment on the report.
HRW’s Ramzi Kaiss said in the statement that “more and more evidence is emerging that Israeli forces repeatedly failed to protect civilians or adequately distinguish civilians from military targets during its strikes across Lebanon”.
Washington’s supply of weapons to Israel “has made the US complicit in their unlawful use”, HRW added. It urged the Lebanese government to give “the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes” and provide “a path for justice for grieving families”.

“Widows, like all citizens, are entitled to employment, dignity, equality, and autonomy without discrimination or reprisal,” observed Acting Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah while heading a two-judge SC bench that had taken up an appeal by the chief commissioner of Regional Tax Office, Bahawalpur, against the Dec 21, 2022 judgement issued by the Lahore High Court’s Bahawalpur bench.
Petitioner Shaheen Yousaf’s husband, who was an employee of the Income Tax Department, had passed away while in service on Feb 14, 2006. Under the Prime Minister’s Assistance Package for the Families of Deceased Government Employees, the widow was appointed as a lower division clerk (LDC) on a two-year contract on May 26, 2010.
The contract was extended multiple times, but on January 4, 2016, her servi­ces were terminated via an office memorandum (OM) dated December 15, 2015. The memorandum stated that upon rema­r­riage, a widow becomes ineligible for co­m­passionate employment under the PM’s assistance package and is, therefore, to be terminated from the date of remarriage.

Justice Shah observes widows, like all citizens, deserve equal rights to jobs, dignity, non-discrimination

The widow challenged the OM the LHC, which disposed of the matter with a directive for the member (administration), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), to treat it as a representation and address her grievances through a speaking order.
 
 

In compliance with the court’s directive, the FBR reviewed the matter and rejected her representation on May 11, 2017. The respondent then filed a second writ petition in the LHC, challenging the departmental order. The petition was allowed on Dec 21, 2022, and the widow was reinstated in service.
In a five-page order, ACJ Mansoor Ali Shah observed that any policy that makes public employment contingent upon a woman’s marital status not only entrenches dependency but also effectively penalises her for exercising a fundamental liberty. The law must serve as a shield against exclusion, not a tool for reinforcing outdated social hierarchies, he emphasised, adding that it was critical to consider the social context in which such executive decisions operate.
“Widowhood, in its simplest sense, refers to the status of a woman whose spouse has died. However, in many societies it carries a layered social identity often accompanied by stigma, isolation, and a diminished sense of social worth. Widows are too often viewed through the prism of loss and dependence, rather than as individuals with agency and resilience,” Justice Shah regretted, adding that this perception restricts their choices, particularly when it comes to remarriage or economic independence.
“The law must reject these harmful cultural narratives and affirm that widowhood is not a diminution of identity but a life circumstance deserving of dignity, protection, and equal opportunity. It is incumbent upon courts to ensure that public policy reflects this understanding and shields widows from both overt and covert forms of systemic discrimination,” the ACJ emphasised.
The judgement declared the OM manifestly discriminatory as it singles out widows, the female spouses of deceased government employees for disqualification from compassionate employment upon remarriage, without imposing a corresponding restriction on widowers, notwithstanding the assistance package which offers compassionate employment to both a widow and a widower.

Moscow has taken steps to normalise relations with the Taliban administration since the group seized power in Afghanistan in 2021 after the withdrawal of US troops. The Russian foreign ministry said Russian officials had held talks with Afghanistan’s foreign and internal ministers.
“The representatives of the Afghan leadership were informed that, following the decision announced by the Supreme Court of Russia to suspend the ban on the Taliban movement, the Russian side has decided to upgrade the diplomatic mission of Afghanistan in Moscow to the level of ambassador,” it said in a statement. It added the Afghan side  “expressed their deep gratitude for this step”. Russia sees a potential economic partner in the Taliban authorities, who praised Moscow for scrapping the  “terrorism” label last week.
Taliban officials have visited Russia for high-profile events in recent years. Russia’s decision to suspend the ban on the group does not equal a formal recognition for the Taliban authorities, which are seeking international legitimacy.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that  “the new authorities in Kabul are a reality”. “We need to take this into account in order to carry out pragmatic, not ideologised policy,” the minister told journalists. The Afghan government is not officially recognised by any country or world body and the United Nations refers to the administration as the  “Taliban de facto authorities”.

• Appeals of five militants sentenced to death by military court in 2016 still pending before high court over jurisdiction issue
KARACHI: Ten years after the murder of prominent social activist Sabeen Mahmud, there seems to be little hope for justice as her family has shifted focus towards carrying forward her legacy instead of seeking accountability.
On April 24, 2015, Sabeen Mahmud was shot dead in a targeted attack as she left The Second Floor (T2F), a literary and cultural space she had founded, after hosting a seminar on the disappearance of political activists in Balochistan.
The Counter-Terrorism Department had arrested five militants after a couple of weeks to the murder and in 2016, a military court handed down death sentence to them. However, even after nine years, the military court’s verdict is yet to be implemented.
Mahenaz Mahmud, mother of the slain activist who accompanied her daughter on the fateful day and suffered bullet wounds, told Dawn when the attack took place, several rights activists and senior lawyers visited her and urged her to pursue the case.
“I asked them, will my efforts fix the justice system of this country? If the answer is yes, I am ready to dedicate 10 to 20 years of my life to it. I want justice for Pakistan, not just for Sabeen,” she said.
She recalled being told that pursuing the case would bring her closure, but she questioned, “Can any mother truly find closure in her lifetime?”
“I felt it was better to devote these years to serving people instead. I have been working on mental health, parenting, and have also worked with women prisoners, conducting sessions where many of them promised me they would show more love and understanding towards the emotions of their own and other prisoners’ children,” she added.
Remembering her bond with her daughter, 74-year-old Mahenaz said it was more like a friendship, adding that Sabeen was a bright young woman whose value system was rooted in honesty and justice.
 
 

She dedicated much of her 40 years to working on social issues, and during that time, she would often receive threats, her mother said.
Talking about that fateful day, she recalled: “I hadn’t been to T2F for some time, but that day I felt a strange unease, as if I must go.” Mahenaz, who was in the car when the attack took place, said as their vehicle stopped at a traffic signal near Defence Library, a man got off a motorbike and approached their vehicle driven by Sabeen.
“At first, I thought they intended to mug us,” she said. “But moments later, the shooter pulled out a weapon and fired five shots,” she added.
Sabeen suffered multiple bullet wounds and died on way to the hospital. Her mother also suffered a single bullet wound.
Five months later, Constable Ghulam Abbas, a key witness in the murder case, was gunned down in the Korangi area.
‘Killed for being a liberal voice’
CTD official Raja Umar Khattab, who arrested the killers and interrogated them, told Dawn that the militant group held extremist views, while Sabeen was a liberal voice.
He said that the held militants were involved in several terrorist activities, including Safoora bus carnage, attack on an American educationist as well as Bohra community, and they selected their targets to send a broader message to a specific community.
“Sabeen’s assassination aimed at sending a warning to all NGOs,” he said.
Quoting their statements, the CTD official said that the militants told him that they targeted Sabeen because she had organised a Valentine’s Day rally and had once delivered a speech in front of a poster belonging to a religio-political party.
Convicts’ pleas pending adjudication at SHC for years
Following 21st Amendment to the Constitution, the five militants were tried by a special military tribunal that handed down death sentence to them in 2016.
However, they filed appeals in the military court in Rawalpindi and then approached the Lahore High Court which declined to hear the matter due to lack of jurisdiction, according to their counsel Hashmat Habib.
He told Dawn when the Supreme Court was approached, it too refused to entertain the matter. Later, five identical constitutional petitions were moved before the Sindh High Court, which are still pending adjudication on the matter of jurisdiction, he added.
Speaking about an inordinate delay in deciding the petitions, the senior counsel said the petitions remained pending in the SHC as the Supreme Court was hearing an identical case. “The outcome of that case will determine the jurisdiction of appeal,” he explained.

Pakistan Kisan Ittehad president says the situation is no different in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as the provincial governments were also not procuring wheat from farmers during the ongoing harvesting season.—PPI

• Accuse provincial rulers of ruining agriculture, reject incentive package
• Ministers highlight initiatives to support farmers
LAHORE: The agricultural sector in Punjab has become a battle­ground for conflict­ing narratives, with farmers expressing deep distress while the pro­vincial government touts its efforts to support them.
Khalid Khokhar, President of the Pakistan Kisan Ittehad, held a press conference in Lahore, vehemently criticising the government’s handling of the agricultural crisis. “The throat of farmers and cultivators has been strangled,” he declared, emphasising the farmers’ love for their country and questioning their ability to meet basic needs like their children’s education.
He announced a protest measure, stating, “Next year we will cultivate less wheat in protest,” and rejecting the Punjab government’s aid package, asserted, “We do not want the package, you have ruined agriculture.”
 
 

Mr Khokhar also urged political parties to refrain from politicising the wheat issue, lamenting the lack of focus on national interests within the assemblies.
He regretted that while the PPP and PTI were criticising the PMLN government in Punjab, the situation was no different in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the PPP and PTI were in power, and the provincial governments, too, were not procuring wheat from the farmers during the ongoing harvesting season.
In a counter-response, Punjab Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Syed Ashiq Hussain Kirmani, alongside Information Minister Azma Bukhari, addressed a press conference. Mr Kirmani defended the government’s actions, stating, “Politics is being played in the name of wheat,” but insisted that the government is committed to supporting farmers.
He criticised the opposition, questioning their record in provinces where they hold power and highlighting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s personal involve­ment in monitoring the wheat market in Punjab.
Mr Kirmani detailed the government’s initiatives, including a record budget allocation for farmers, substantial subsidies on fertilisers, seeds, and tractors, and the disbursement of Rs52 billion in interest-free agricultural loans through the “Kissan Card.”
He highlighted the increased urea usage and a record wheat sowing as evidence of the government’s success. He also criticised the previous government, referring to it as “Waseem Akram Plus,” for neglecting the farmers’ welfare.
A key focus of the government’s strategy is empowering the private sector, Mr Kirmani said, announcing Rs110bn in interest-free loans to the private sector and flour mills, mandating them to purchase 25pc of the wheat stock.
He also highlighted the implementation of Electronic Warehouse Receipts (EWR), enabling farmers to store wheat for up to four months and access immediate cash through bank loans using warehouse receipts.
The Punjab cabinet has further solidified its commitment by approving an amendment to the Food Grains Licensing Control Order 1957, mandating 25pc wheat procurement by flour mills, with the threat of license cancellation for non-compliance.
The cabinet also approved the implement­ation of EWR, with the government bearing storage costs, to provide farmers with greater flexibility and financial security.
Minister Kirmani concluded by stating that wheat procurement will commence from all locations to help stabilise prices and ensure farmers receive their due compensation.

ISLAMABAD / MUZAFFARABAD: As the Indian government severed diplomatic and other links with Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan’s mainstream political parties on Wednesday branded the attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir a “false flag operation” desig­ned to malign Islamabad internationally.
They also believed that India’s aggression and illegal occupation of Kashmir had resulted in the Pahalgam attack.
The armed attack on tourists in the Pahalgam town left 26 people dead. The incident occurred amid a high-level visit by US Vice President J.D. Vance to India.
Senator Irfan Siddiqui, parliamentary leader of the PML-N in the Senate, termed the incident a “well-planned conspiracy” aimed at defaming Pakistan.
Speaking to the media, he said India had a history of staging such incidents whenever a foreign dignitary visits the country. “The Pahalgam drama was orchestrated deliberately during the US Vice President’s visit to India to serve their propaganda objectives against Pakistan,” he added.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the Indian government should first thorou­ghly investigate the incident before levelling false allegations against Pakistan.
He noted India’s decades-long military presence in held Kashmir and its rights violations were fuelling unrest. He also alleged Indian involvement in terrorism inside Pakistan, including the recent Jaffar Express attack in Balochistan.
As it is feared that India could attack Pakistan against the backdrop of the Pahalgam incident, Mr Asif said: “Pak­istan is capable of responding to any In­­dian aggression in a befitting manner.”
Talking to a private TV channel, the minister said that India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — that allows for sharing the waters of the Indus River system between the two countries — is a violation of international laws. “India cannot take unilateral decisions regarding the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said. “We will give a comprehensive re­­sponse to India after holding the Nat­ional Security Committee’s meeting, which is being called on Thursday (today).”
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari also warned in a video statement that any “misadventure by India under the pretext of a false-flag operation will have dire consequences”.
Condemning the “shocking terror attack”, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said, “Unfortunately, the reflexive finger-pointing already at play against Pakistan has become the boilerplate response for a New Delhi that was unable to contain its own spectacular failures amidst a fundamentalist meltdown.”
Regarding India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, she said India could not suspend the treaty unilaterally.
“Stridency-on-steroids is not a foreign policy,” she said, adding that all indications of the Pahalgam attacks go towards a “false flag operation” of India.
 


JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also strongly criticised attempts to link Pakistan with unrest in Indian-occupied Kashmir, calling such accusations “baseless” and asking India to introspect on its internal failures instead of blaming its neighbour. “It’s convenient for India to blame Pakistan, but that doesn’t change the ground realities,” he said.
PTI also denounced the attack, describing terrorism as a “shared enemy of the civilised world”. In its statement, the PTI warned that any adventurism against Pakistan would be met with a united national response, reaffirming support for the armed forces. “Founding Chairman Imran Khan and PTI firmly stand with the armed forces and the people in their inalienable resolve to blunt any such aggression by the Indian government against Pakistan,” it added.
 


Former minister Saad Rafique condemned Indian media’s atte­mpt to blame Pakistan for the attack “without any evidence”. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen chief Alla­­ma Raja Nasir expressed condolences, called for dialogue for regional peace and warned that escalating tensions could endanger South Asia’s stability.
 


‘Sinister ploy’
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), political and resistance leaders unanimously condemned the Pahalgam attack, terming it a sinister ploy by Indian agencies to discredit the Kashmir freedom struggle and falsely implicate Pakistan.
Extending condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims, they called for international accountability to bring the real culprits to justice, while making it clear that no amount of violence could shake the Kashmiri people’s resolve for their right to self-determination.
In his statement, AJK President Bar­rister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry called the massacre “condemnable,” accusing the Narendra Modi-led regime of staging another false flag operation, especially timed with the visit of US Vice President J.D. Vance to India, and likened it to India’s habitual blaming of Pakistan, as seen after the 2019 Pulwama incident.
AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed maintained the “Pahalgam false flag operation had flopped even before the script could unfold.”
The AJK chapter of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) echoed similar concerns. “We firmly believe Indian agencies are involved in this heinous act… to destabilise the region and malign the peaceful freedom movement,” said APHC convener Ghulam Muhammad Safi.

• Warns slow growth will make it difficult to create jobs, reduce poverty
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank on Wednesday slightly lowered its growth forecast for Pakistan to 2.7 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing continued economic stabilisation but persistent constraints from tight monetary and fiscal policies.
The World Bank had earlier predicted Pakistan’s economy to grow by 2.8pc during the current fiscal year in its Pakistan Development Update (PDU) released in October last year.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the World Bank said that growth would remain subject to many downside risks but forecast that the economic growth rate would improve to 3.1pc in the next fiscal year (FY26) and 3.4pc in FY27.
In a rare move, the bank did not officially release its usual biannual PDU that was officially scheduled for launch on April 8 and postponed it at the last moment without any explanation.
 
 

When approached for comment, a World Bank spokesperson said the bank’s management was at the spring meetings in Washington and hence the PDU was not released as usual, and instead a statement was issued.
According to the statement, real GDP growth is expected to be supported by recovering private consumption and investment driven by subdued inflation, lower interest rates and recovering business confidence.
It said Pakistan’s economy was stabilising with easing inflation and improving financial conditions, as well as current accounts and primary fiscal surpluses. Amid continued tight macroeconomic policy, economic growth has been weak during the first half of the fiscal year.
Agriculture saw limited growth, in part due to adverse weather and pest infestations. Industrial activity declined, impacted by higher input costs and taxes, and reduced government spending.
Similarly, the growth of the services sector was muted, given limited spillovers from weak agriculture and industrial activity. While expected to strengthen, economic growth will remain tepid, making job creation and poverty reduction amid high population growth challenging, the World Bank said.
“Pakistan’s key challenge is to transform recent gains from stabilisation into economic growth that is sustainable and adequate for poverty reduction,” said Najy Benhassine, World Bank’s Country Director for Pakistan.
“High-impact reforms to prioritise an efficient and progressive tax system, support a market-determined exchange rate, reduce import tariffs to boost exports, improve the business environment and streamline the public sector would signal strong reform commitment, build confidence, and attract investment,” he said.
The bank said the growth would likely remain constrained amid tight monetary and fiscal policies aimed at rebuilding buffers and containing risks of imbalances. In addition, significant downside risks persist. It said the economic outlook remained fragile and any implementation delays in structural reforms or shifts in economic stabilisation could dampen the nascent recovery and intensify external pressure.
“Risks remain high due to elevated debt levels, policy and global trade uncertainties, and exposure to climatic shocks,” said Anna Twum, lead author of the report.
The bank called for structural reforms to unlock opportunities for private capital mobilisation to improve Pakistan’s digital infrastructure and enable the environment for the digital economy.
“Connectivity quality varies widely across provinces, while high costs make fixed broadband less accessible,” the bank said, adding that Pakistan had opportunities to improve its capability to digitally deliver services to its citizens and businesses through the ongoing development of its Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).
However, the dividends from the DPI depend on several regulatory and institutional enablers and require ownership by the leadership and a strong coordination framework among the federal, provincial and local governments.

A source in the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that a notification has been issued regarding the formation of the committee.
The committee would implement a formula of “performance-based revi­­ew”, the source said, adding that the policy already introduced in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would also be implemented in other state institutions and federal ministries.
The committee would devise short- and long-term performance plans for the state institutions and ministries and prepare its report for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif within 30 days, according to the source.
The committee to be headed by the finance minister would have other members including federal ministers for energy, climate change, chairman FBR and others.
PM returns from Turkiye
On Wednesday, PM Shehbaz returned to the country after completing his two-day official visit to Turkiye.
Soon after his return, the premier expressed deep concerns over the news of an earthquake in Turkiye. He said he was praying for the safety of Turkish brothers and sisters.
“Pakistan stands ready to offer all possible assistance to help in this natural calamity,” the PM said in a statement.
On the other hand, PM Shehbaz strongly condemned the terrorist attack on polio vaccination team in Mastung.
In a statement, the PM expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of Levies personnel deployed for the security of the polio vaccinators.
He said the terrorists who harm the lives and properties of innocent people were enemies of humanity and would be brought to justice. He said such incidents could not deter the government’s unwavering commitment to eradicating polio from the country.

The development follows a bilateral agreement signed in late February between China and Pakistan. CMSA said the selection process for the Pakistani astronauts has already begun.
“Consistent with the stringent criteria used for Chinese astronaut selection, a three-stage process (preliminary, secon­dary, and final) will govern candidate selection,” CMSA spokesperson Lin Xiqiang said at a press conference.
Lin added that a Pakistani astronaut will join the mission as a payload specialist and conduct scientific experiments for Pakistan, in addition to standard crew duties.

Space agency says selection process for payload specialist has begun

The announcement came alongside China’s confirmation of its latest crewed spaceflight. The Shenzhou-20 mission is scheduled to launch at 5:17pm on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, Lin said.
Leading the mission will be Chen Dong, a 46-year-old veteran astronaut and former fighter pilot who, in 2022, became the first Chinese astronaut to spend more than 200 cumulative days in orbit.
“Every space journey is very unique, so I look forward to bringing in more experience and breakthroughs in the flight,” said Chen, who is embarking on his third spaceflight.
Joining Chen are first-time fliers Chen Zhongrui, 40, a former air force pilot, and Wang Jie, 35, a former space technology engineer.
The current crew aboard Tiangong is expected to return to Earth on April 29 after completing handover procedures with the Shenzhou-20 team, according to Mr Lin.
The Shenzhou-20 crew will carry out scientific experiments in physics and life sciences and install protective equipment against space debris.
China has been barred from particip­ating in the International Space Station since 2011, when the US prohibited NASA from collaborating with Chinese space agencies. Since then, Beijing has sought to build partnerships with other countries — including Pakistan — in its expanding space programme.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health confirmed the poliovirus case from Torghar district of KP. It was this year’s second case from the province and seventh case from across Pakistan.
An official of polio programme said, “The second nationwide polio campaign of the year is currently in progress in the country from April 21 to 27, aiming to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five across the country. This will be followed by another nationwide campaign from May 26 to June 1.
“District Torghar is included in both these vaccination campaigns, along with all other districts of the country.”

Official says Torghar district will be covered in ongoing and next vaccination drive

The official appealed to parents to ensure their children aged five years and less must receive repeated doses of the polio vaccine to protect them from the crippling disease.
“The ongoing polio campaign is a critical opportunity to safeguard children against this viral disease,” he said.
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the virus that invades the nervous system, and can cause paralysis or even death.
While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio free.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries which are reporting polio cases.

• UN watchdog asks Tehran to ‘clarify tunnels near N-site’
• Beijing backs Tehran-Washington talks
WASHINGTON: Iran is ringing two deeply buried tunnel complexes with a massive security perimeter linked to its main nuclear complex, a report said on Wednesday, amid US and Israeli threats of attack.
The Institute for Science and International Security released its report based on recent satellite imagery as the US and Iran prepare to hold a third round of talks this weekend on a possible deal to reimpose restraints on Tehran’s uranium enrichment programme.
US President Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of a 2015 pact designed to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, has threatened to bomb Iran unless a deal is quickly reached that would ensure that same goal. Trump’s withdrawal prompted Iran to breach many of the pact’s restraints. Western powers suspect it is pursuing the capability to assemble a nuclear weapon through enrichment of uranium to high fissile purity, which Tehran denies.
David Albright, the institute president, said the new perimeter suggested that the tunnel complexes, under construction beneath Mount Kolang Gaz La for several years, could become operational relatively soon. 
Tehran has barred access to the tunnels to inspectors of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who are monitoring its nuclear programme. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency called on Wednesday on Iran to explain tunnels built around its Natanz nuclear site, while voicing hope over ongoing US-Iran talks. 
“I’ve been raising this issue repeatedly, and I will continue to do so,” Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told reporters on a visit to Washington. 
Grossi, who visited Tehran last week, said that all countries need to inform the IAEA of intentions for facilities around nuclear sites but that Iran has a stance “unique in the world” that it does not need to inform the agency ahead of time. “We’re asking them, what is this for? They are telling us, it’s none of your business,” Grossi said.
Grossi said it “cannot be excluded” that the tunnels would store undeclared material but said he did not want to speculate on intentions. “Iran does not have nuclear weapons. This is very clear. We cannot confuse people. Iran has conducted in the past certain activities that were relevant — could be relevant — in the process of developing nuclear weapons,” he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, the chief negotiator with the US, said in a post on X in apparent response to the new report that Israel and unnamed “Special Interest groups” were looking to “derail diplomacy.” Iran has said that advanced centrifuges would be assembled in one complex in place of a facility at the nearby Natanz plant, the centrepiece of its nuclear programme, destroyed by sabotage in 2020.
The complexes, Albright said, are being built at depths much greater than Iran’s deeply buried uranium enrichment facility at Fordow, near the holy city of Qom. Iran’s nuclear energy chief Mohammad Eslami, referring to concerns about the vulnerability of its nuclear programme, on Tuesday appeared to refer to projects such as the construction of the new security perimeter around the tunnel complexes.
Meeting with Chinese FM
China supports Iran holding talks on its nuclear program with the United States and opposes the use of force and “illegal” unilateral sanctions to try to resolve the issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Iran’s foreign minister on Wednesday.
Beijing is willing to deepen coordination and cooperation with Tehran on international and regional affairs, Wang told Iran’s Abbas Araqchi during talks in the Chinese capital, according to a ministry statement. “The Chinese side commends Iran’s promise not to develop nuclear weapons and respects Iran’s right to utilise nuclear energy peacefully,” Wang said.
The meeting came ahead of further US-Iran nuclear talks this Saturday and after Washington imposed sanctions on some Chinese refiners for buying Iranian oil in recent weeks. The Iranian foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Araqchi had informed his Chinese counterpart of the latest situation of the “indirect talks between Iran and the US” and thanked China for its productive stance on Iran’s nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions.
China buys some 90 per cent of Iran’s oil exports, traders and analysts have said. The two countries have built a trading system that uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar and exposure to US regulators.
Wang and Araqchi also discussed US tariffs during Wednesday’s meeting. “The US’s abuse of tariffs has completely lost popularity and isolated itself from the international community,” Wang said.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, officials said, but the quake was followed by at least eight others, Turkiye’s AFAD disaster management agency said. The initial quake struck at 12:49pm at a depth of 6.92km under the sea, which lies to the south of the city, AFAD added.
“An earthquake of 6.2 magnitude occurred in Silivri, Sea of Marmara, Istanbul,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X, adding that it was felt in the surrounding provinces.
It was followed by eight others with magnitudes of 3.5 to 5.9.
As buildings shook, people rushed onto the streets where crowds of worried-looking people stared at their mobile phones for information or made calls.
“I just felt earthquake, I’ve got to get out,” a shaken-looking decorator said while rushing out of a fourth-storey apartment where he was working near the city’s Galata Tower, who did not want to give his name.
Footage posted by the state news agency Anadolu showed the minaret of a mosque in the Beylikduzu district just west of the historic peninsula swaying during the initial quake. But there were no reports of any buildings collapsing in the sprawling city of 16 million people, Yerlikaya told TRT.
“Until now, nobody’s called the emergency line to report their house collapsing,” he said, though the Istanbul governor’s office warned people to avoid any structures that looked like they might have been damaged.
Footage on Turkiye’s NTV television showed one three-storey building collapsed in the Fatih district, also near the historic peninsula, with the broadcaster saying the building was empty and had been abandoned decade ago.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was “following the developments closely”.
The tremors could be felt as far away as Bulgaria, according to AFP journalists in the capital Sofia.
Around 20,000 people were killed in two quakes that devastated Tur­kiye’s densely populated northwest in 1999 as the eastern strand of the fault line ruptured.

• Israeli attacks claim 18 more lives; European powers call for end to aid blockade
GAZA CITY: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called upon Hamas on Wednesday to lay down arms and hand the running of Gaza to his Palestinian Authority (PA) in order to answer international doubts over the PA’s role at a key moment for the region.
Abbas also urged Hamas to free all Israeli prisoners in Gaza, saying their captivity provided Israel with excuses to attack the territory. Hamas gave “the criminal occupation excuses to commit its crimes in the Gaza Strip”, he said, adding that he was the one paying the price, not Israel.
“Hamas must hand over (its) Gaza responsibilities and hand over its arms to the responsibility of the Palestinian Authority and transform into a political party,” the PA chief said while addressing the central council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) at Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority in Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Ties between Abbas’s Fatah party and Hamas have been tense. While he had previously called upon Hamas to put its forces under the PA’s control, he has not done so since the start of the Gaza conflict in October 2023.
 
 

The PA chief is expected this week to name a successor amid pressure from Western and Arab powers concerned about the PA’s ability to play a viable-long term role in peace efforts.
Hamas has often criticised Abbas for “collaborating with Israel”.
Diplomatic efforts to craft a plan for Gaza’s future have focused on pushing aside Hamas, but Israel said it would not accept any role for the PA, which exercises limited autonomy in the occupied West Bank.
Pressure to name a successor
Abbas, 89, took over the Palestinian leadership after the death of veteran PLO leader Yasser Arafat in 2004. He has for years resisted naming a deputy or successor, but the conflict in Gaza has intensified pressure for him to do so.
Last month, Arab states proposed a plan for Gaza to be temporarily run by a committee before being returned to the PA’s control.
The US, European Union and Gulf monarchies expected to play a role in financing any reconstruction of Gaza have repeatedly urged PA reform.
Talks aimed at reaching a new ceasefire have so far failed to produce any breakthroughs, though a Hamas delegation is currently in Cairo for renewed negotiations with Egyptian and Qatari mediators.
Attack on shelter for displaced
On Wednesday, Israel continued to pound Gaza, with rescuers saying 18 people had been killed since dawn, including 11 in a strike on a school-turned-shelter for displaced people.
“The school was housing displaced people. The bombing sparked a massive blaze, and several charred bodies have since been recovered,” an eyewitness said, describing the attack on Yaffa school, in Al Tuffa area of Gaza City.
Aid agencies estimate that the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents have been displaced due to the bombardment and 51,305 killed by Israeli forces in less than two years.
UK, France and Germany’s appeal
Britain, France and Germany called on Israel on Wednesday to stop blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza, warning of “an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death”.
“We urge Israel to immediately restart a rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to meet the needs of all civilians,” their foreign ministers said in a joint statement. “The Israeli decision to block aid from entering Gaza is intolerable.”
They also criticised Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz for politicising humanitarian aid and described Israeli plans to remain in Gaza as unacceptable. Katz said earlier Israel would continue preventing aid from entering Gaza.
The UN also warned many community kitchens providing food for displaced people were also shutting due to depleting stocks.

“Punjab does not need any external dictation regarding the use of river floodwater. Punjab is fully sovereign in utilising its own resources and that Sindh has no right to object to Punjab’s development projects,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari told a presser here on Wednesday.
Flanked by Punjab Agriculture Minister Ashiq Hussain Kermani, Azma Bokhari said that the proposed canal project was still under consideration and only excess floodwater would be utilised for the purpose.
“This initiative aims to benefit farmers and promote agricultural development,” she claimed. Earlier this week, the Sindh chief minister also claimed that work on the six canals project had been halted since July 2024.
According to the minister, canals had not been constructed yet and serious efforts were underway to build consensus. “Differences cannot be resolved through threats — dialogue is the way forward,” she said.
 
 

Ms Bokhari further said the PPP had ruled Sindh for the past 16 years, and farmers there still faced fundamental issues. “If PPP resorts to misleading statements, we will not remain silent. Every allegation will receive a befitting response,” she warned.
On the other hand, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui said the alliance between PML-N and PPP, particularly on key national issues of water resources, would remain unaffected.
“Differences on national matters are natural and can only be resolved through dialogue and mutual understanding. Negotiation and constructive conversation are the only ways forward,” he added.

• Industry stakeholders urge govt to resolve issue as soon as possible
LAHORE / KARACHI: The national fertiliser supply chain is facing severe disruptions as ongoing sit-ins and road blockades in Sindh have choked critical transport routes, stranding thousands of trucks and halting industrial operations.
The blockades have been holding up traffic for a week now, particularly in the Sukkur-Larkana division, leading to alarm among government officials and stakeholders in the business community.
The disruption comes at a critical moment in the agricultural calendar. The Kharif season, which includes crops like cotton, sugarcane, and rice, depends heavily on timely access to urea.
Delays in distribution may cause lower yields, higher food prices, and added financial pressure on farmers, whose economics have already deteriorated over the past year.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) has also raised the issue with the Sindh government, saying that with Kharif season in full swing across the country, the non-availability of urea and DAP at this juncture may affect production and impact national food security.
 
 

The MNFSR letter to Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, seen by Dawn, notes that fertiliser makers apprehend that the persistence of this situation may lead to forced shutdown of fertiliser plants, compromising its availability for Kharif crops.
Both inbound and outbound logistics for the fertiliser industry have slowed dramatically.
Among the hardest hit are the country’s two major fertiliser producers — Fauji Fertiliser in Mirpur Mathelo and Engro Fertilisers in Daharki — whose operations are now under significant strain.
According to retired Brig Sher Shah Malik, executive director of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC), over 600 fertiliser-laden trucks are currently stranded at plant sites, including Daharki, Mirpur Mathelo, and Port Qasim.
Around 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of compost is produced daily at these units, but the blockades have stranded around half a million tonnes at the factories, or on various roads.
Since these factories have limited warehousing capacity, they cannot store any more fertiliser, an official from a compost plant told Dawn.
He said that it would take three days to bring production to a halt, and just as many days to restart production, as these factories work round the clock.
“This isn’t just a Sindh issue — it’s becoming a problem with national-level effects,” the official said.
The FMPAC, too, has requested the Sindh government’s support in mobilising the relevant administrative and law enforcement authorities to ensure the safe and unimpeded movement of fertiliser across Sindh.
Goods unable to reach destinations
Beyond fertiliser, the bro­ader economic fallout is also mounting. Over 3,500 trucks — many loaded with export consignments, perishable goods, and critical industrial materials — remain stranded across northern Sindh, especially near Sukkur. With containers piling up and goods unable to reach their destinations, the supply chain is rapidly becoming gridlocked.
Raw materials are also being held up at Karachi Port, resulting in many manufacturers facing the possibility of production delays. Exporters are missing delivery deadlines, potentially weakening confidence among international partners and affecting future trade prospects.
According to M. Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce Industry (OICCI), the nearly week-long blockade of the National Highway in Sindh has brought local trade and industrial activity to a grinding halt, paralysing supply chains and sending shockwaves through the national economy.
“Over 3,500 vehicles remain stranded near Sukkur, many carrying export consignments, perishable items, and critical industrial inputs. The complete halt in goods movement is already affecting market supplies, with shortages looming,” he said.
Meanwhile, Khalid Tawab, regional chairman of the United Business Group (UBG), has also appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take immediate action to resolve the ongoing protests and end the road blockades in Sindh, which have brought economic activities to a grinding halt.
He claimed that approximately 800 tank lorries were currently stranded en route, severely hampering the industry’s ability to ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies.
