<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24141259b47c243.png?r=142019' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913040/x-says-working-to-resolve-issues-from-yesterdays-data-centre-outage' target='_blank'><strong>X says working to resolve issues from yesterday’s data centre outage</strong></a><br><p>Social media platform X said on Saturday that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
“Our team is working 24/7 to resolve this. Thanks for your patience — updates soon,” it said at 5am PKT.
 






In the early hours of Friday, the platform had said: “X is aware some of our users are experiencing performance issues on the platform today. We are experiencing a data centre outage and the team is actively working to remediate the issue.”
 






With X stating a “data centre outage” as a reason for the service disruption, users speculated that a fire at the platform’s data centre in the US state of Oregon’s Hillsboro city was the cause of the issues.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources. The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.
Downdetector, which tracks outages, did not show problems reported by users at 1pm. However, outages had spiked to 76 at around 8:30pm last night.

While updates by X did not mention issues with messaging services, many users reported not being able to access their direct messages (DMs), with an error reading: “Cannot retrieve messages at this time. Please try again later.”
Some users also reported being logged out of their accounts, with an error stating “something went wrong”.
 






X had remained blocked in Pakistan since Feb 17, 2024 — when allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections gained momentum — but was restored on May 7 amid the recent conflict with India.
Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, bought the platform (formerly Twitter) for $44 billion in late 2022. He rebranded it to X in July 2023, with the domain fully migrating to X.com in May 2024.
In March this year, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired X in a deal that valued the social media network at $33 billion.
Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, is also a close ally of US President Donald Trump and heads the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><small>2025-05-24 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241228265419a97.jpg?r=124132' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913039/ppp-leader-supports-inclusion-of-all-stakeholders-including-pti-in-diplomatic-delegation' target='_blank'><strong>PPP leader supports inclusion of all stakeholders including PTI in diplomatic delegation</strong></a><br><p>PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan on Friday supported the inclusion of all stakeholders including the PTI in the diplomatic delegation set to represent the country in important world capitals following the rise in hostilities with India.
Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Speaking in the DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, when asked if PTI should also be included in the delegation, Khan said: “All stakeholders are welcome to get this country out of this crisis.”
“We need to be on one page and fight the country’s case. Prime Minister [Shehbaz] sahib has made the right choice by choosing Bilawal [Bhutto-Zardari] sahib to continue fighting Pakistan’s case in international forums,” Khan added.
The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India — without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.
When the formation of the delegation was announced, “In a telephonic conversation with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report had added.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-24 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24091630fc2b8c6.jpg?r=092021' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913028/imf-says-will-continue-budget-discussions-in-coming-days-as-mission-wraps-up-visit' target='_blank'><strong>IMF says will continue budget discussions in ‘coming days’ as mission wraps up visit</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Saturday said it would continue discussions over the next fiscal year’s federal budget in the upcoming days as its mission concluded.
Pakistan and the Fund had opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has postponed the budget announcement till June 10.
In a statement issued today, the IMF’s Pakistan mission chief Nathan Porter termed the recent discussions “constructive” and said: “We will continue discussions towards agreeing over the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days.”
“Discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure,” Porter added.
 
 

“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY2026 budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF),” Porter said, referring to the $7 billion loan programme and the climate fund deal, respectively.
“The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in FY2026,” the IMF official added.
The Fund noted that the staff visit “focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation, and the budget strategy” for FY2025-26.
Shedding light on other matters reviewed, Porter said: “Discussions also covered ongoing energy sector reforms aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector as well as other structural reforms which will help foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.”
The government emphasised its commitment to “ensuring sound macroeconomic policy making and building buffers”, according to the statement.
“In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to ensure inflation is anchored within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5–7 per cent,” Porter stressed.
“At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange (FX) reserve buffers, preserving a fully functioning FX market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are critical to strengthening resilience to external shocks.”
The IMF mission appreciated the federal and provincial authorities for their “hospitality, constructive discussions, and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies”.
Affirming that it will continue its close dialogue with the authorities, the IMF said its next mission associated with the next EFF and RSF reviews was expected in the second half of 2025.
Imran seeks meeting with finance minister
As the federal government gears up for the budget, incarcerated ex-prime minister Imran Khan, whose PTI rules Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has called on Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to meet him before the budget announcment.
A post on Imran’s X account quoted Imran’s purported conversation with lawyers at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he is imprisoned. The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of the social media handler.
The post read: “As party chairman, it is necessary for the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to seek my guidance on budgetary and policy matters.
“The people have elected PTI to govern, and therefore, the responsibility for policymaking also rests with us. Consequently, it is essential that [KP Chief Minister] Ali Amin Gandapur and the finance minister meet with me before the budget is presented,” it added.
 






In his post, Imran again stressed the importance of national unity. “The economy is in shambles; investors and the youth are steadily leaving the country,” he claimed, stating it as one of his reasons to call for a dialogue.
The KP government has called upon its federal counterpart to immediately convene a meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) and ensure the transfer of the constitutional share of funds allocated for the merged districts to the provincial government before the budget announcement.
Considerations for budget
During the staff visit, the IMF mission had multiple rounds of discussion yesterday, including a wrap-up session with Aurangzeb, informed sources said.
An IMF delegation led by the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department, Jihad Azour, met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday and with President Asif Ali Zardari the next day.
 
 

The defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the meeting with Aurangzeb, although discussions between the Federal Board of Revenue’s top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.
Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr.
Sources said there is no plan to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of carbon levy on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in the second year to meet a requirement of the RSF.
 
 

The sources said the relief measures for the salaried class, real estate, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year’s budget.
The budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24115526b65a6c8.jpg?r=122506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913036/hong-kong-to-open-universities-to-more-foreign-students-after-us-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong to open universities to more foreign students after US ban</strong></a><br><p>Hong Kong has said it will open its universities to more international students, highlighting those affected by the US government’s move this week to block Harvard from enrolling foreign nationals.
The sharp escalation in US President Donald Trump’s longstanding feud with the prestigious university came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues.
The Trump administration’s decision on Thursday — which was temporarily halted by a US judge after Harvard sued — has thrown the future of thousands of foreign students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
On Friday, Hong Kong Education Secretary Christine Choi called on universities in the Chinese city to welcome “outstanding students from all over the world”.
“For international students affected by the United States’ student admission policy, the Education Bureau (EDB) has appealed to all universities in Hong Kong to provide facilitation measures for eligible students,” Choi said in a statement, noting the ban on Harvard’s admission of international students.
She said local universities were making use of government measures, including relaxing the maximum limits on foreign students to attract more to Hong Kong.
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Friday invited international students enrolled at Harvard, as well as anyone with offers to attend the elite school, to continue their studies at HKUST.
“HKUST is extending this opportunity to ensure talented students can pursue their educational goals without disruption,” it said in a statement.
The university “will provide unconditional offers, streamlined admission procedures, and academic support to facilitate a seamless transition for interested students”, it added.
Harvard is ranked number one in US News and World Report’s most recent list of the world’s top universities, while HKUST is 105 out of more than 2,000 ranked.
President Trump is furious at Harvard for rejecting his administration’s push for oversight on admissions and hiring amid his claims the school is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.
A US judge on Friday halted the administration’s move to prevent Harvard from admitting foreign students after the university sued, calling the government’s action unlawful.
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday that the administration’s decision would hold Harvard “accountable for fostering violence, anti-Semitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus”.
Beijing condemned the “politicisation of educational cooperation”, adding that the move by Washington would “only harm the image and international standing of the United States”.
Around 1,300 Chinese students are enrolled at Harvard, around a fifth of its international student body, according to university data.
Hundreds of thousands more attend other US colleges and universities, long viewed by many in China as beacons of academic freedom and rigour.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23143057fdaa0b3.jpg?r=120348' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912827/in-new-attack-trump-spending-bill-will-hike-taxes-on-elite-colleges' target='_blank'><strong>In new attack, Trump spending bill will hike taxes on elite colleges</strong></a><br><p>The spending bill passed by the US House increases a tax the richest private universities pay on their endowment investment gains, a move proponents say reins in “woke” schools but that critics say will wind up hurting the poorest students the most.
Tucked within US President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill the House narrowly passed on Thursday is a proposal to increase a tax that some universities pay on the investment returns of their endowments from 1.4 per cent to as high as 21pc for some of the most elite colleges in the country.
The measure, part of the bill headed to the Republican-controlled Senate, is considered another front in Trump’s attack on elite colleges that he says are overrun by left-wing extremist thought and are cradles of anti-American and antisemitic movements. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University’s ability to enroll foreign students, a move the university said was illegal.
Representative Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said shortly after his committee passed the bill that “for too long, universities have received beneficial treatment from our tax code while disregarding the interest of taxpayers.” A fact sheet Smith put out states that the tax “holds woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations and other tax-exempt entities accountable.”
Premier universities say the bulk of most endowments is attached to specific projects as mandated by donors. So if they are spending more money on taxes, they will not be able to make up for it from their endowments. Instead, they will spend less elsewhere.
 
 

Luisa Rapport, a spokesperson for Stanford University, said the proposed tax hike “will directly reduce financial aid for undergraduates, support for faculty and graduate students, and funding for research programs.”
Kimberly Allen, a spokesperson for MIT, said the proposal is “basically a tax on national research and student aid, and at MIT alone it would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from our budget each year.”
Excellence, access at risk
During Trump’s first term in office, the current 1.4pc tax was levied on schools whose per student endowment was $500,000 or more — that is, the size of the endowment divided by the number of full-time students.
In 2023, 56 private schools paid that tax, and total receipts were about $380 million, according to the IRS.
Under the new proposal, schools with a per student endowment of $2 million or more would pay 21pc. International students would not count in that denominator under the bill, meaning schools with large populations of foreign students, like many of the elite universities Trump has targeted, would be punished.
Schools with a per student endowment of $1.25m to $2m would be taxed 14pc; schools with a per student endowment between $750,000 and $1.25m would be taxed 7pc; and those with endowments of $500,000 to $750,000 per student would be taxed 1.4pc.
The American Council on Education, a higher education lobbying and advocacy organization with 1,600 members, has fought the endowment tax since it was first created. Steven Bloom, who specializes in tax issues and endowments at the council, said the new proposal “takes very bad tax policy passed in 2017 and makes it more expensive and more complicated”.
Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College, estimates the new tax would cost elite universities like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Princeton, between $400m and $850m a year each.
Levine said that despite having some of the highest tuition prices, elite Ivy League schools with large endowments are able to offer massive financial aid packages for kids from poorer backgrounds.
“These are institutions that can offer excellence and access for lower-income students,” Levine said. “Both of those are at risk in the presence of a large endowment tax.”
Laura Wirick, a managing principal at Meketa Investments, a consultancy firm that advises endowments on how to allocate money, said if the highest proposed tax rate of 21pc goes through, it may push money away from elite schools as donors “might not donate funds because they might be best put to work with a tax-exempt institution”.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24113802ca13e1b.jpg?r=113821' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912950/woman-in-karachi-killed-as-husband-claims-gun-went-off-accidentally' target='_blank'><strong>Woman in Karachi killed as husband claims gun went off ‘accidentally’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A married woman was shot dead in Gulshan-i-Maymar on Friday, police said.
Area SHO Abdul Ghaffar Korai said that Aqsa, 22, was killed in her home in Esa Goth. 
He said that the police questioned her husband, Ismail, about the incident and he told investigators that he was ‘cleaning’ his pistol when it went off accidently and a bullet hit his wife. 
She suffered critical bullet wounds and was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead on arrival. 
The officer said the police were investigating the case to ascertain husband’s claim.
Man kills wife in Mominabad
In another incident, a woman was gunned down allegedly by her husband in Orangi Town on Friday.
Mominabad police officer Mohammed Shoaib said that Rukhsana, 56, was shot and killed by her husband Gul Sher, 58, inside their home in Fareed Colony, Sector-10. 
The suspect managed to escape, he said, adding that the couple often quarrelled with each other over some family issues. 
He said that Gul Sher shot at and wounded his wife in the morning and fled. 
She sustained critical injuries and was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where she died during treatment.

The game to decide which side faces Quetta Gladiators in Sunday’s final of the HBL Pakistan Super League turned out to be a show of Qalandar’s potency as they swept past United with unenviable ease — it was a no-contest in the end.
Now-deposed champions United had started the season with a bang, only to be left limping in the end. The Qalandars had a see-saw campaign but turned when it mattered most — in the clutch moments. A day after they sank Karachi Kings in the Eliminator, they thrashed United by 95 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.
They wrapped up United’s response to an imposing 203-run target with 4.5 overs to spare; skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi leading from the front with incredible figures of 3-3 and ending the proceedings with his new-ball partner Salman Mirza, who took 3-16, taking a superb catch to dismiss Haider Ali.
 


Half centuries earlier by Kusal Perera (61) and Mohammad Naeem (50) had laid the platform for the Qalandars and with pacers Shaheen and Salman on fire, United folded for a paltry 107. Spinner Rishad Hossain also worked his magic for the Qalandars with 3-34.
Shaheen and Mirza sent the respective stumps of United openers Mohammad Shahzad and Sahibzada Farhan flying in the first two overs as the new ball seamed sharply off the surface.
Mirza returned to find the edge of Rassie van der Dussen’s bat for the South African to get caught behind by a diving Perera. The left-armer got another wicket in form of Imad Wasim, who failed to clear mid-on, where Fakhar Zaman took an easy catch as United reeled at 33-4 by the end of the powerplay.
Salman Ali Agha initiated a fightback of sorts, cutting for four and pulling for six off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain in the eighth over. Another attempt to go big did not fare well for Agha, who holed Rishad out to Naeem at long-on as the scorecard read 72-5 by the 10th over.
United captain Shadab Khan, who too had tried to get his team out of trouble with his 26 off 14 (three sixes), also fell to Rishad, miscuing to find Asif Ali at long-off before the spinner caught the incoming James Neesham off his own bowling as United crumbled.
Naseem Shah’s run out pushed United further into doom before Shaheen cleaned up Tymal Mills and dismissed Haider to end the proceedings.
Earlier,  Naeem unleashed an onslaught over United right from the word go, especially taking on Naseem for three boundaries and a six in the fifth over as Qalandars posted 58-1 in the powerplay.
The emerging right-hander swept Shadab for a four before launching the leg-spinner over long-on for six, but another attempt to go for a big shot in the next over saw Naeem get stumped off Imad’s left-arm spin.
Abdullah Shafique and Perera — who had combined to win the first Eliminator a day earlier — hit a boundary each off Shadab as Qalandars reached 93-2 at halfway stage.
However, Abdullah, who had shown immense form in the previous match, became prey to Shadab’s acrobatic dive to his right for a catch at mid-off off Neesham’s medium pace in the 12th over.
But Perera, still at the crease, continued to show his prowess, especially through the off-side, gloriously driving Neesham for four before finding the gap through backward point off Salman Irshad.
Qalandars crossed the 150-run mark after Perera’s compatriot at the other end, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, lifted Tymal Mills over extra cover for six before driving through mid-off for four. The left-hander, however, fell victim to a perfect yorker by Salman after adding 22 off 13 (two fours and a six).
Perera brought up half half-century in 31 balls, pulling over fine leg and slashing over third man for sixes off Naseem in the 18th over, in which the pacer conceded a total of 21 runs.
Asif’s ramp and drive for sixes off Salman before getting dismissed and boundaries each by Perera and Rishad then took Qalandars to a total that was more than enough for the side to seal a place in the decider.

He was addressing a press conference at Gurdwara Panja Sahib Hassanabdal on Friday. Chairman of the Evacuee Trust Property Board Dr Muhammad Sajid Chau­han, Additional Secretary Shrines Saifullah Khokhar, Rawalpindi Zone Administrator Tanveer Hus­sain, Deputy Administrator Yasir Asghar Monga, and other leaders of the Sikh community were also present on this occasion.
He strongly condemned the Indian government’s move to not allow Indian Sikh pilgrims to offer religious rituals in June on the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev Ji and the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.
The minister stated that the Modi-led government is rattled by Pakistan’s diplomatic success and is now resorting to religious restrictions in clear violation of international laws.

Minister says Modi-led govt rattled by Pakistan’s diplomatic success

“By denying pilgrims the right to perform their religious duties, India is undermining religious freedom,” he said.
 
 

He condemned what he called the “misleading and false narrative” regarding a recent attack on the Golden Temple, calling it a deliberate distortion aimed at fuelling tensions, adding that the respect and protection provided to religious sites of minorities in Pakistan is exemplary to the world.
The minister also lauded the unwavering support shown by religious minorities in Pakistan, especially Sikhs, for the government and armed forces, especially in times of regional tension.
“Any restrictions imposed by India on pilgrims wishing to undertake the pilgrimage would be a blatant violation of religious freedom and fundamental hum­an rights,” he said.
Urging the Indian government to abandon religious discrimination, he cal­led for the immediate issuance of visas to Sikh pilgrims.
“Reli­gious freedom must be upheld, not restricted,” he asserted.
Private Haj operators slammed
While responding to a question, the minister blamed private operators as thousands missed Haj under private schemes.
He was of the opinion that private tour operators were responsible for the losses faced by pilgrims, explaining that no new quota was being granted and that only 25,698 pilgrims would be able to travel to the holy land under the private Haj scheme.
He said the current Haj policy was approved in November, and its implementation began thereafter. He said that Pakistan’s total Haj quota is 179,210.
The government successfully utilised its share according to Saudi regulations, but the private sector failed to use its full 50 per cent share. He said that Pakistan’s Haj quota was divided equally between the government and the private sector.
 
 

The government fulfilled its res­ponsibility in a timely manner, com­­pleting the process and getting approvals for pilgrims without del­ay.
He blamed the private sector for failing to act on time, working against Saudi guidelines, and ultimately causing harm to the pilgrims.
He said the private operators are to blame for the disruption. He revealed that the Saudi government had set a deadline of Feb­ru­ary 14 for private operators to de­­posit 25pc of the required amount.
Even after an extension, they managed to collect payments for only an additional 10,000 pilgrims.
He revealed that the prime minister’s inquiry committee is investigating the matter. Its findings will determine responsibility.
He said that the ministry had repeatedly reminded private operators.
Pilgrims under the government scheme are staying in Aziziyah, and the companies responsible for their services have been instructed to ensure proper arrangements.
Earlier, he reviewed the renovation and facelift work being carried out at Gurdwara Panja Sahib by ETPB.

Former prime minister Imran Khan is one of the accused in the case. The protests, triggered by Mr Khan’s arrest in a corruption case from the Islam­abad High Court, turned violent as protesters torched and vandalised government buildings and military installations.
Following the violence, the government launched a crackdown on PTI leaders and supporters, making several arrests.
Mr Khan was indicted in the case on Dec 5, 2024.
The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the protest case in January 2024.
He, however, filed an application seeking acquittal, which was also rejected by the ATC earlier this year.
Special Prosecutor Raja Ikram Ameen Minhas produced the IO before the trial court.
The investigating officer informed the court about the incident, police action, arrests and recoveries made from the PTI workers.
The prosecution has produced only 26 out of a total of 102 witnesses before the ATC so far. Most of the prosecution witnesses who have testified before the court till date were police officials and witnesses to the vandalism.
The next hearing will be held on June 29.

Both countries were far higher on the ‘escalation ladder’ in the recent episode than many people realise, with previously established red lines and thresholds having been crossed by both sides in a matter of hours. To make matters worse, the Indian political leadership, having boxed itself in a narrowing space self-created by electoral expediency and hyper-nationalism, has lowered the threshold of all-out war in the face of its perceived humiliation.
The events that have led us to this ‘new normal’ of living under an even darker shadow of nuclear war mirror the march of folly witnessed so many times in history, and captured by Pulitzer Prize-winning American historian Barbara W. Tuchman in her book of the same name. Her bottom-line? On too many occasions, states have acted contrary to their long-run self-interest. India’s current government is pushing the country in that direction.
 
 

How did we get here? In the most recent iteration, that is. The terror attack committed in Pahalgam by a shadowy, previously unheard of ‘resistance’ group had all the markings of an atrocity meant to inflame sectarian passions and provoke conflict.
Pakistan’s response was both reasoned as well as reasonable. It called for an independent international investigation into the incident. The Indian political leadership under BJP, on the other hand, had already primed itself for upping the ante, including launching a military strike on its nuclear-armed neighbour.
As part of a wider political strategy, Prime Minister Modi’s default mode with regards to attribution for any terror attack is the presumption of Pakistan’s guilt, without the need for an impartial investigation or evidence. In stark contrast to Pakistan, where India-centred jingoism has no traction as an election strategy of mainstream political parties, an appeal to hyper-nationalism and religious fanaticism provides a winning platform in India, and has been cynically exploited by BJP.

South Asia needs peace, not another doctrine that further lowers the threshold of all-out war.

It is important to note that creating a bogeyman, an imaginary external threat or the fear of ‘the other’, has been a widely used tactic by demagogues throughout history to justify undermining democracy at home and solidify a slide into authoritarianism.
 
 

India’s response to Pahalgam is fraught with strategic miscalculation borne out of hubris. It mistakenly thought a fragile economy and frayed internal cohesion would limit Pakistan’s ability to effectively strike back. It also overestimated its own operational capabilities on the military side, as also its diplomatic standing and ability to rally the international community to ‘punish’ Pakistan.
In doing so, Mr Modi has unleashed a dangerous escalatory dynamic, leading to an unstable equilibrium between the two countries: neither fully a cold war nor a hot peace, but a strategic pregnant pause between intensifying conflicts.
Ironically, India stands to lose much more than Pakistan from its bizarre strategic calculus. The first casualty is India’s carefully crafted narrative with regards to Pakistan and the disputed Kashmir region. Over the years, India had managed with varying success to ‘de-hyphenate’ itself from Pakistan, project Kashmir as a bilateral dispute, paint Pakistan as a sponsor of non-state proxies involved in cross-border terrorist activities, and isolate Pakistan diplomatically.
By providing Pakistan with a permanent casus belli via suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and working aggressively to dam the Indus basin waters that flow into the lower riparian, as well as by lowering the threshold of all-out war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, India has all but ensured abiding international attention to, and eventual mediation in, the Kashmir dispute.
 
 

Expecting that the rest of the world will ignore the danger of nuclear war caused by India’s escalatory and irresponsible actions is evidence of how disconnected its political leadership has become from ground realities.
Apart from the diplomatic setback, equally damaging for India, or perhaps even more so, is the permanent harm Mr Modi’s political strategy is likely to inflict on India’s economy. While the Indian economy has not been exactly shining under Mr Modi, in large part causing the electoral setback BJP faced in the 2024 general elections and leading to the desperate beating of war drums witnessed recently, it is still well-positioned to gain substantially from the partial decoupling underway between the US and China.
Along with Southeast Asia’s economic powerhouses such as Vietnam and Indonesia, India can potentially host supply chains for many of the advanced economies’ manufacturers that have been uprooted from China, or are planning to migrate. This opportunity to attract foreign investment is potentially worth anywhere between $500 billion to $1 trillion in the medium term in my estimate, and is there either for the taking, or for squandering.
While India has begun to attract significant inflows of foreign direct investment over the past few years, inward FDI into India is still almost one-sixth of the foreign investment flows into mainland China — at $28bn in 2023 versus $163bn. The stock of FDI in India is an even lower fraction in comparison to mainland China.
 
 

Before India fashions an even more reflexive strategy that brings the two quarrelling South Asian neighbours closer to the edge, it should draw lessons from 2002. Months of full-scale mobilisation of the two armies and a tense stand-off along the border led to foreign nationals, many working in India’s IT hubs of Bangalore and Chennai, fleeing in droves on specially chartered flights. With the lengthening shadow of nuclear Armageddon on the subcontinent, it will be moot if many choose to return in the next round.
With so much at stake, India stands to lose big if it pursues its current path of confrontation. Instead of striving to become an economic growth node for the subcontinent, peacefully coexisting and trading with its neighbours, cooperating regionally to lift millions of South Asians out of poverty and illiteracy, and by becoming a beacon of a genuine inclusive democracy, the current Indian political leadership has chosen a very different path. History will not be kind.

While half of this portfolio was legacy rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, fresh loans and grant inflows amounted to $6.086bn in July-April, almost 15 per cent lower than the comparable period of last fiscal year.
In its monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Friday, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) said that against its annual target of $19.4bn, FEA in July-April amounted to $6.086bn compared to $7.142bn in the same period last year with an annual target of $17.6bn.
This does not include about $1bn disbursed by the IMF in October as an upfront payment under the $7bn ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that is accounted for separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This also does not include the subsequent $1bn IMF inflow last week.
 
 

With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in 10MFY25 amounted to $16.08bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by the UAE, and $3bn by China. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the country’s net international reserves (NIR) at around $3.3bn.
The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 15pc to about $6.086bn in July-April, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows, including IMF, amounted to $8.2bn during 10MFY24.
In April, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $576 million, compared to $555m in March, $237m in February and $830m in January.
The EAD said that out of $6.086bn, about $3.45bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.6bn for project financing. During the same period last year, the EAD secured about $2.3bn as project aid and $4.8bn as programme loans.
Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.98bn in 10MFY25 compared to $2.86bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $372m against $878m last year, down 58pc.
The EAD reported receiving about $706m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in 10MFY25, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks that had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor outcome, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella and economic conditions.
The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn China’s SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.
In addition, Pakistan also received $1.61bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $8861m in the same period last year. The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.253bn in 10MFY25 compared to $708m a year ago, and $1.07bn was received from the World Bank.

The assurance was giv­en by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) and Minister-in-Charge for Industries and Production Haroon Akh­t­­ar Khan in a meeting with Lucky Motor Corporation (LMC) Chairman Muham­mad Ali Tabba on Friday.
Mr Tabba shared his concerns about the proposed Tariff Rationali­sa­tion Plan, particularly re­­duction of duties on completely built units (CBUs) to 15pc over a period of five years.
Mr Tabba emphasised that while the intent behind tariff rationalisation might be to make cars more affordable for customers, the proposal currently under consideration could have an adverse impact on the local auto industry and undermine in­­­vestor confidence.
He po­­­i­­nted out the Auto De­­velopment Policy (ADP) 2016-21 under which the Korean, European and Chinese automakers ent­e­red the Pakistani automotive market with a cumulative investment of ap­­p­r­oximately $1.2bn to establish local manufacturing plants.
 
 

He said the initiative achieved key objectives, including offering more choices to consumers, fostering competition and creating employment opportunities both in ve­­hicle assembly and the auto parts manufacturing sector.

But now and then, Indian alt-cinema breaks through the noise and delivers razor-sharp content. Paatal Lok, a crime thriller on Amazon Prime Video, is one example. It isn’t just a thriller but a masterclass in decoding the machinery of power, propaganda, and manufactured enemies.
In Paatal Lok, the assassination plot isn’t really about murder. It’s about getting rid of four petty criminals the political elite want out of the way. So they invent a fake plan to kill a journalist who was never in danger, just useful as a name on paper.
The police are tipped off before anything happens, swoop in for a dramatic arrest, and the headlines write themselves: ‘Delhi Police foils plot to kill journalist’. The criminals disappear into the system. The government walks away looking brave. And no one asks why any of it happened in the first place.
The plan falls apart when a low-ranking Delhi cop starts asking the wrong questions and uncovering links that go too close to those in power. The case is quickly taken from him and handed to the CBI, which makes sure it leads nowhere. Their fix is simple: plant some evidence, change the story, and suddenly those four petty criminals are no longer small-time thugs but dangerous Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists backed by Pakistan’s ISI. Just like that, the truth is buried, and the headlines are taken care of.
But the real twist? The journalist in question, whose career, otherwise, was in a downward spiral towards irrelevance, is now draped in the tricolour. Thumping his chest on primetime, telling tales of bravery and how he ‘survived’ an assassination attempt by the intel agency, he becomes the “voice of India” and the new wheeler-and-dealer of the media industry.
If all of this sounds eerily familiar, you aren’t alone.
 
 

The media circus around the Pahalgam attack felt like a clumsy sequel to Paatal Lok, except this time, it wasn’t fiction. What the show satirised, Indian news channels turned into a strategy. Instead of grief and accountability, the tragedy became fuel for a nationalist spectacle.
Reckless anchors took centre stage, repackaging loss as war, while social media algorithms did the rest by amplifying outrage over truth. It unfolded like a script we’d already seen, only louder, uglier, and real.

When war sells and rage trends, the loudest lie often outperforms the quiet truth.

As someone who studies the political economy of disinformation, I was repeatedly asked the same question by various news outlets covering the story: ‘Why were the Indian news channels broadcasting obviously false news? Weren’t they worried about their credibility?’ It’s a fair question for media outlets that still rank credibility over clicks.
But sadly, for a large section of news media on either side of the border, especially on the Indian side, credibility isn’t the currency anymore; attention is. In the age of algorithmic amplification, virality, not verification, is rewarded by the business models. When war sells and rage trends, the loudest lie often outperforms the quiet truth.
You’re probably wondering, what’s this new ‘business model’? Let me break it down.
 
 

Broadcast news outlets in India, much like everywhere else, aren’t speaking to TV audiences anymore; they’re feeding the beast that lives online, the trolls, the echo chambers, the meme pages that turn warmongering into viral gold.
In India, the sheer scale of its news and entertainment industry has made this transformation especially brutal, where competition has become a fight for survival. And what better place to cash upon the currency of hate than the social media platforms infested with incel networks, political trolls, hate-mongers, disinformation peddlers, and religious bigots.
According to a recent joint publication by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Ernst & Young (the FICCI-EY report), digital media now accounts for 32 per cent of India’s entertainment sector, making it the single largest revenue stream. In other words, the clicks, shares, and rage-fuelled engagement online aren’t just noise, they’re profit.
Thus, in a media market where digital platforms now drive the biggest chunk of revenue, ethics and credibility have long become irrelevant. So, the media outlets invent, distort and dramatise, not because they’re misinformed, but because they know exactly what their audience wants: rage, revenge, and a constant supply of enemies. Contrary to the belief that credibility is essential for journalism, this audience doesn’t care. The more sensational the content, the more they come back for it.
But that’s only the tip of the figurative iceberg. As the brilliant Dr King Schultz put it in Tarantino’s Django Unchained, “I see the puppet, but I don’t see the master.” We see the anchors screaming, spinning hateful narratives, and cashing in on the rage. But we never think about where we see them, do we? The real money is in the shadows. It’s the social media platforms pulling the strings. Their algorithms are pumping this poison into billions of timelines and feeds across the world, making billions from rage; profiting on a scale the puppets can only dream of.
But the trail doesn’t end here. Behind the platforms lurk the political demagogues who are less the audience and more the directors of this spectacle. They aren’t just reaping the benefits of hate and polarisation; they’re scripting the very narratives that fuel it. The TV anchors echo them, the platforms amplify them, but the blueprint, the raw hate, the manufactured threat, the nationalistic hysteria starts in the halls of power. This isn’t accidental, it’s the design.
Prima facie, this playbook seems to benefit all parties involved, but in the long run, the cost is monumental. Outrage feeds demand, and demand feeds more outrage, until citizens become fanatics and viewers become war-mongers.
Night after night, this cycle breeds mass psychosis: a public so agitated that calm feels unnatural. While this may serve Modi’s political machine by fuelling pride and silencing dissent, it can’t be controlled forever. The media and platforms may think they’re directing the rage, but eventually, the spectacle turns, and the anger finds new targets, sometimes close to home.

• IMF spokesperson rejects Indian claims regarding misuse of funds by Pakistan
• President meets IMF delegation, praises it for supporting Islamabad’s economic stability
ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday postponed the announcement of the federal budget 2025-26 by more than a week to June 10 amid inconclusive discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on some of the critical fiscal measures and to avoid the Eid break during the budget session.
Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion on Friday, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The minister’s adviser, Khurram Schehzad, confirmed that the federal budget for the next year will be presented on June 10, and the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 will be released on June 9. Earlier, the budget announcement was set for June 2.
 






Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Dawn that discussions with the IMF had just concluded, and it was thought that the budget announcement should be made soon after Eid holidays to ensure continuity of the budget session.
Sources said there was also a view that it would be difficult for the government to recollect a sufficient number of members of parliament from their hometowns for the budget debate if the budget was announced before Eid which is likely to fall on June 7.
Therefore, the budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.
Also, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was leaving for a whirlwind visit to Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Iran, and some other friendly countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, and would be unable to personally indulge in budgetary settings. He would be back from abroad on May 29.
As a consequence, the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) for finalisation of federal and provincial development plans set for Monday (May 26) has also been postponed to a fresh date to be set later.
 
 

Sources said the recent sudden announcement of national tariff policy envisaging a drastic cut in customs tariffs from 19 to 9.5 per cent on raw materials and semi-finished items for a few industries, besides the removal of additional customs duties, had also created a lot of concern among the relevant industrial sector.
The five-year tariff policy approved for inclusion in budget inclusion in the budget this year by the prime minister himself compelled the powerful industries to launch a counter campaign.
Coupled with this, the defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the wrap-up meeting with the finance minister, although discussions between FBR’s top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.
Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr. Staff-level discussions on the next budget began on May 14.
 
 

Sources said there is no plan the to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of carbon levy on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in second year to meet a requirement of Climate Resilience Support Fund (RSF).
The sources said the relief measures for the salaried class, real estate, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year’s budget.
India’s objections
As the talks with IMF staff concluded, the Fund’s spokesperson at its headquarters in Washington rubbished Indian concerns about recent approval by its executive board of $1.4bn in additional RSF support besides disbursement of $1bn second tranche of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
“The [IMF executive] board approved the disbursement after finding that Pakistan had met all performance targets and made progress on structural reforms”, said IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack at a regular news briefing, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.
 
 

An Indian journalist asked the spokesperson about the recent bailout package by the IMF to Pakistan, saying “the Indian government has expressed a lot of displeasure with Pakistan planning to use this package to build — rebuild — areas that allegedly support cross-border terrorism.”
Another journalist asked about the implications of the escalation between Pakistan and India on both economies, while another questioned what “safeguards the IMF has that its funds won’t be used for military or in support of military actions.”.
In response to the questions, Ms Kozack said the IMF’s Executive Board approved Pakistan’s EFF programme in September of 2024.
“The first review at that time was planned for the first quarter of 2025. And consistent with that timeline, on March 25, 2025, the IMF Staff and the Pakistani authorities reached a staff-level agreement on the first review for the EFF,” she said.
She added that the agreement was then presented to the IMF’s executive board, which completed the review on May 9. “As a result of the completion of that review, Pakistan received the disbursement at that time,” she said.
Ms Kozack explained that the global money lender had a standard procedure in place under its programmes, which allowed its executive board to conduct periodic reviews of lending programs to assess countries’ progress. The board, she said, particularly looked at whether the programme was on track, whether the conditions under the programme were met, and whether any policy changes were needed to bring the programme back on track.
She then said that Pakistan’s programme was approved after the country successfully met all of the required targets. Regarding the question on safeguards, she clarified that IMF financing was provided to members for the purpose of resolving balance of payments problems, therefore, in the case of Pakistan, all the disbursements received under the EFF were allocated to the reserves of the central bank.
“So, those disbursements are at the central bank, and under the programme, those resources are not part of budget financing. They are not transferred to the government to support the budget,” she said.
Zardari meets IMF delegation
President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday said that the IMF programme had played a supportive role in stabilising Pakistan’s economy, according to the APP.

The president, in a meeting with an IMF delegation led by the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department, Jihad Azour, highlighted the lender’s positive role in promoting economic development in developing nations.
He also acknowledged and appreciated the IMF’s contribution to Pakistan’s economic progress.
The delegation expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s efforts for economic reforms and implementation of the IMF programme, which they observed was progressing in the right direction.
Mr Zardari thanked the IMF for its support and cooperation with Pakistan and also appreciated the finance ministry for its efforts to improve the national economy.

The investigation was launched after the FIA received a report that an Afghan national, Agha Khan, had departed from Sialkot Airport to Saudi Arabia in May 2023 on a Pakistani passport and had not returned.
The inquiry team extended the scope of the probe following revelations that at least 41 Afghan nationals had left for Saudi Arabia via Sialkot Airport during the same period, allegedly with the connivance of FIA personnel posted there.
The FIA also sought the record of the 41 passengers in question from the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra), which said they were not registered with it.
The Director General of Immigration and Passports also confirmed that his office also did not have their record.
 
 

Though their passports bore scanned protector registration numbers at the immigration counter, the numbers were later confirmed to be fake.
The inquiry identified 10 FIA officials allegedly involved in facilitating the travel: Sub-Inspectors Asad Zameer, Suleman Liaquat Virk and Imran Shaukat Virk; ASI Saqib Ameer; and Head Constables Muhammad Shahzad, Shahzada Latif, Fayaz Ahmad, Muhammad Idrees, Muhammad Nawaz and Haider Ali.
All 41 Afghan nationals were also found culpable for travelling abroad on fraudulent documents.
However, the inquiry said that the role of the FIA’s supervisory officer in this matter will be determined later.
“How come the inquiry team could absolve the supervisory officer(s) in this matter as no junior staff could allow any suspected traveller to leave the country without the approval of their boss,” an official privy to the development told Dawn. “And in case of obliging the suspected travellers after receiving a bribe, the subordinate staff could not do it in isolation.”
“A deputy director has a supervisory role, and human smuggling is not possible without his nexus with the junior staff. The inquiry team seems to have given a clean chit to him, being a senior officer, and made junior staff a scapegoat,” he said.
The FIA also booked the 41 Afghans and six travel agents, including Mikael Bangia, Khalid Khan, Muhammad Daanish, Aslam Gulfam, Salah Shah and Zahoor Khan.
All those involved have been booked under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, the Emigration Ordinance, 1979, the Foreigners Act, 1946, the Passport Act, 1974, and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.

• Zafar says ‘ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off’
• Caution advised when ministers discuss water issue
• Shibli decries ‘tyranny of majority’ in Senate
ISLAMABAD: Senators on Friday made it clear that India would not be allowed to suspend or amend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) warning that any unilateral move to this effect would be treated as an act of war.
They said the treaty was a settled matter and international law would justify Pakistan’s military response if India blocked the water.
Speaking on a motion on the unilateral suspension of IWT by India, PTI parliamentary leader Ali Zafar said the impending water crisis was as serious a threat as terrorism.
“This is also a war thrust on us. The ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off,” he remarked.
 


The PTI lawmaker said international law and UN resolutions have called water a fundamental human right for the lower riparian regions.
Noting that India was violating international law by holding the IWT in abeyance, Mr Zafar said the UN Charter and resolutions and international conventions would permit any action taken by Pakistan in self-defence, including military action if India stops its share of water.
“If India stops a drop of our water, the [international] law, UN resolutions and international conventions say that Pakistan can destroy the structure through missiles, planes and soldiers”.
Calling the matter highly sensitive, he advised the government to be cautious while speaking about the issue because it may damage Pakistan’s case.
Senator Zafar stressed that Pakistan was fast moving towards a water-scarcity crisis due to climate change and increasing population.
The Indus basin is a “lifeline” for 90 per cent of people and crops that depend on its water.
He stressed the need to rise above party lines to tackle the water issue with India.
The opposition leader, Shibli Faraz, said IWT was a settled matter and Pakistan “should not even talk to India over the treaty”.
“It is a treaty and can only be changed with both parties’ consent. Otherwise, it stands as it.”
No government in Pakistan even has the mandate to change the treaty, he said, adding the government should not give a knee-jerk reaction and build up its case carefully.
He said water was a serious crisis for Pakistan and called for a “well-thought-out plan” to address it technically and internationally.
PTI Senator Humayun Mohmand also said talks shouldn’t be held on IWT.
The officials “should not be apologetic on the issue”.
 
 

JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza took a more cautious tone, saying it would be difficult for Pakistan to give a military response to a country that has an economy of $700 billion.
He said Pakistan had already lost its case over water with India at the international forums.
The JUI-F lawmaker said that a house committee comprising legal experts from all parties should be formed to examine all agreements with India, including the Shimla Agreement and IWT.
‘Tyranny of majority’
Earlier, at the outset of the proceedings, Mr Faraz deplored the way the Senate had been run for the past year.
He observed that democracy does not mean the tyranny of the majority.
“The house has been turned into a mere post office. We have to make ourselves relevant”, he remarked.

He regretted the frequent suspension of rules and hasty legislation, saying the role of the upper house of parliament must not be compromised.
Mr Faraz said the house “should be run in a democratic manner” and lamented that bills were tabled in the upper house without even sharing their copies with lawmakers.
He said the culture of debate in the upper house had vanished and stressed that it was a dangerous tradition.
Mr Faraz said it was the opposition’s responsibility to keep an oversight on the government’s affairs.
But the ruling coalition kept key committees, including the Finance Committee, with it to “willingly and wilfully destroy this spirit”.
He asked the members to play their role in restoring the dignity of the Senate and earn respect for themselves.
The PML-N parliamentary leader, Irfan Siddiqui, who was presiding over the sitting, agreed to most points raised by the leader of the opposition.
However, he recalled when he became senator in 2021 — with PTI in power — the situation in the house was no different.
He said only one minister used to respond to questions for all ministries back then too.
Mr Siddiqui agreed the question hour should be held. He said it may be taken as his ruling that any decision on the question hour in the future should be taken after mutual consultation between the government and the opposition leadership instead of taking a unilateral decision.
“I also agree that we should all try to enhance the dignity of the House and ensure good presence and representation. Details about legislation should also be provided to the members well in time,” he maintained.
Former deputy chairman and PPP lawmaker Saleem Mandviwala also said the question hour should be held regularly.

“For nearly 80 days, Israel blocked the entry of life-saving international aid,” he said in a statement. “The entire population of Gaza is facing the risk of famine.
“The Israeli military offensive is intensifying with atrocious levels of death and destruction.
“Today, 80 per cent of Gaza has been either designated an Israeli-militarised zone or an area where people have been ordered to leave.”

More than 50 Palestinians dead or missing in Israeli strike on Jabalia

Aid also began trickling into the Gaza Strip on Monday for the first time in more than two months, amid condemnation of the Israeli blockade that sparked severe shortages of food and medicine.
“Israel has clear obligations under international humanitarian law,” Guterres said. “As the occupying power, it must agree to allow and facilitate the aid that is needed,” he said.
More than 50 Palestinians were killed or went missing after an Israeli air strike on a residential building in the Jabalia al-Balad area of northern Gaza, Palestinian Civil Defence sources say.
Israeli drones targeted more than five locations near the entrance to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on Friday morning, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
When people rushed to help the victims, Israeli forces attacked them again, injuring several more Palestinians.
Separately, three people, including a young girl, lost their lives in an Israeli airstrike on an apartment near Abdel Aal junction on al-Jalaa Street in Gaza City.
 
 

Two siblings were killed, and their father suffered critical injuries when an Israeli strike hit a home in the western camp area of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.
In eastern Khan Yunis, several casualties are reported after Israeli forces struck a home in the town of Abasan al-Kabira.
Israeli air strikes also killed at least six Palestinians guarding aid trucks against looters, Hamas officials said, underlining the problems hindering supplies from reaching hungry people in Gaza following Israel’s 11-week-long blockade.
The Israeli military claimed 107 trucks carrying flour and other foodstuffs as well as medical supplies, entered the Gaza Strip from the Kerem Shalom crossing point on Thursday. But getting the supplies to people sheltering in tents and other makeshift accommodations has been fitful.
So far, an umbrella network of Palestinian aid groups said, 119 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Israel eased its blockade on Monday in the face of an international outcry.
But distribution has been hampered by looting by groups of men, some of them armed, near the city of Khan Yunis, the network said.
A Hamas official said six members of a security team tasked with guarding the shipments were killed. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
The aid groups network also said the amount of aid coming into Gaza was still inadequate and only included a narrow range of supplies. It said Israel’s agreement to allow trucks to enter the war-shattered enclave was a “deceptive manoeuvre” to avoid international pressure calling for the lifting of the blockade.

• FO slams Modi’s allegations
• UNSC condemns school bus attack
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani authorities on Friday said they would continue with intelligence-based operations (IBOs) to combat terrorism in Balochistan, instead of launching a large-scale kinetic military campaign at this stage.
“The intelligence-based operations would continue,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), during a joint press briefing with Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha near the military headquarters in neighbouring garrison city of Rawalpindi.
The joint appearance of military and civilian officials underscored the government’s unified approach to counterterrorism, especially in the wake of escalating regional tensions with India and aggravating security situation in Balochistan.
Their remarks come days after a suicide attack in Khuzdar targeted a school bus carrying children of military personnel, in which eight people, including six children, were martyred and dozens others were injured. Two more students Haider, 13, and Malika, 12, succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to eight.
 






Pakistan’s military had accused India of “planning and orchestrating” the att­ack using its terrorism proxies in the restive province.
Condemning the attack, Interior Secretary Agha said, “The attack on school bus in Khuzdar was an attack on our values, our education system and the very fabric of our society.” He added that initial investigations indicated the assault was orchestrated by India-backed terrorist operating as “Fitna al Hindustan” (Indian mischief).
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that terrorism in Balochistan was being tackled “rationally”, noting that Pakistan had developed advanced counterterrorism techniques through decades of experience.
 


“Intelligence-based operations are very effective way of dealing with terrorists. We are hunting them down and eliminating them,” he said. “The number of terrorists killed in these intelligence-based operations are much higher as compared to the large-scale operations.”
This emphasis on intelligence-based operations highlights the government’s preference for targeted strikes to minimise collateral damage, possibly in response to past criticisms of heavy-handed military campaigns.
Soft targets
The military spokesman said the military is currently conducting nearly 150 IBOs on a daily basis without disrupting civilian life. “The terrorist groups after suffering heavily at the hands of law-enforcement agencies are now attacking soft targets. This shows the effectiveness of our operations,” he added.
Interior Secretary Agha echoed the approach, noting that a broader military campaign akin to Operation Zarb-i-Azb could be launched if necessary, but only after all preparatory steps are completed. “If need be, there can be a major operation like Zarb-i-Azb but that would be at a later stage. Currently, all operations are continuing,” Agha said.
 
 

The reference to Zarb-i-Azb, a 2014-17 operation that significantly reduced militancy in the country, signals the government’s readiness to escalate if IBOs do not bring the problem of terrorism under control, but also its caution to avoid destabilising Balochistan further.
He added that the National Action Plan (NAP) was being “reinvigorated” to support future counterterrorism efforts. “All facets of the national action plan are being reinvigorated so that all domains including social, economic, legal, counterterrorism, information and political are fully functional,” he stated. “So that when we go into a big operation… all facets are in place.”
The NAP, introduced in 2014 after the Peshawar Army Public School attack, is a comprehensive counterterrorism framework. Its reinvigoration suggests a holistic approach to address not just security but also socio-economic drivers of unrest in Balochistan.
Proxies activated
Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted how synchronised attacks during the night of May 9 and 10 — involving 33 terrorist incidents in Balochistan — demonstrated collaboration between India and proxy groups in Balochistan.
“At a time when India was firing projectiles and missiles into Pakistan, it had also activated these proxies,” he said. “This synchronisation of attacks proved the collaboration between Fitna al Hindustan and India.”
 
 

He attributed India’s alleged targeting of Balochistan to Pakistan’s recent economic advancements in the province. “Balochistan has reached its take-off phase with improvements in the socio-economic sector… the inauguration of the airport in Gwadar and expansion of road network,” he said.
“Balochistan’s terrorism issue is being addressed rationally where military approach is one aspect. The problem is being addressed synergetically by all elements of national power.”
This holistic approach reflects the recognition that military solutions alone cannot resolve Balochistan’s complex issues
Agha reiterated the government’s readiness and resolve: “The state has the wherewithal and will to dismantle these networks and bring their handlers and perpetrators of these acts of terrorism to justice. Such actions will have consequences… Our resolve is firm and response will be decisive.”
Touching on recent tensions with India, the DG ISPR warned of dire consequences if provocations continue. “India is using terrorism as a tool against Pakistan through Fitna al Hindustan and Fitna al Khawarij,” he said. “Pakistan is on the other hand maintaining peace as a rational actor through the resolve of the people and the capabilities of the armed forces.”
He further condemned India’s “arrogant political mindset,” citing its refusal to address the Kashmir dispute and alleged suppression of minorities as the reasons behind India becoming a source of instability in the region.
FO rejects allegations
Earlier on Friday, Pakistan categorically rejected the “baseless, provocative, and irresponsible” allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan, asserting that such statements clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains, APP adds.
“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains. Such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms of responsible statecraft,” Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said.
 
 

He said that resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation was a grave breach of the UN Charter and established principles of international law and that this dangerous approach also undermined regional peace and stability.
The spokesperson said that Pakistan remained a consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism and any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism was factually incorrect and patently misleading. He said it was a tactic often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges, as well as its repressive policies in India-held Kashmir.
“India’s attempts to mask its serious human rights violations are well-documented and well-recognised by the international community. The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection,” he remarked.
He urged the Indian leadership to exercise responsibility and restraint as escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.
UNSC condemns Khuzdar attack
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, calling it a heinous and cowardly act that claimed the lives of at least six people, including four children, and left more than 50 others injured.
 
 

In an official press statement, the Council members expressed profound sorrow over the attack, which occurred on May 21, and extended heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families and to the government.
The UNSC members expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan, and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured, the statement read.

GILGIT: Babusar Road, which connects the picturesque town of Naran in the Kaghan Valley with Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan, was reopened to traffic on Friday after remaining closed for seven months.
The scenic Babusar Top and Babusar Pass usually remain closed from November to June every year owing to heavy snow. Through Babusar Pass, the journey from Diamer to Mansehra takes seven hours, while the same distance is covered in 14 hours through the Karakoram Highway. The reopening  of this high-altitude pass is likely to increase tourist influx in GB  and also tourism activity across the Naran and Kaghan Valley and  adjoining areas.
Situated at an altitude of 13,700 feet above sea level, Babusar Top is a famous tourist spot. Tourists visiting Gilgit-Baltistan prefer to travel through Babusar Pass to enjoy the weather and breathtaking sights.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) has completed the road clearance operation two days ago after removing snow. Officials of Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan confirmed to Dawn that the Babusar road has been cleared for traffic and allowed traffic on both sides.
An official of district administration said that traffic on both sides was allowed on Thursday. The NHA crew cleared over 21 glaciers between Naran and Babusar Top in phases and Diamer district administration cleared snow avalanches on the Diamer side.
The Diamer district administration has suggested travellers to follow SOPs for travelling on the road as the traffic accidents report from Babusar top to Chilas of Diamer section annually. Diamer Police have established check posts at Babusar top and mobile towers have made functional to provide Internet facility.
A local hotel association said there has been a noticeable increase in the number of tourists from various parts of the country, with hundreds of visitors now arriving daily in Naran. Hotels, restaurants, and tour operators are reporting a sharp rise in bookings and activity, signalling a strong start to the summer tourism season, reports APP.
It added that the local stakeholders, including hoteliers and tour guides, have welcomed the reopening and are hopeful for a prosperous season, provided that authorities continue to ensure road safety and timely communication regarding weather conditions and travel advisories.

A Notam (notice to airmen) issued by the Pakistan Airports Autho­rity (PAA) said the ban on Indian aircraft using its airspace will remain in place till June 24.
“The ban on Indian aircraft flying through Pakis­tani airspace has been extended until 4:59am on June 24, 2025,” the PAA said.
The airspace will not be available for Indian-regis­tered, operated or owned aircraft or those leased by Indian airlines, including military flights with no exceptions, the Notam stated. The restriction will apply to airspace starting from the ground to unlimited airspace height, it added.
Under the directive, no flight operated by Indian airlines or operators will be allowed to enter or transit through Pakistani airspace. However, other inte­r­national airlines would not be affected by the ban.
 
 

India’s Civil Aviation Ministry issued a corresponding Notam, saying Pakistani-registered, operated, owned, or leased aircraft, including military flights, would be barred from Indian airspace through June 23.
India and Pakistan first imposed the airspace restrictions last month after the shooting in India-occupied Kashmir.
On April 24, Pakistan had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.

Four bodies have been pulled from vast tides of floodwater engulfing parts of northern New South Wales, a fertile region of rivers and valleys some 400kms up the coast from Sydney.
Salvage crews launched a major clean-up operation as waters receded a bit on Friday, surveying the damage from half a year’s worth of rain dumped in just three days.
Kinne Ring, mayor of the flood-stricken farming town of Kempsey, said dozens of businesses had been swamped.
State Emergency Serv­ice boss Dallas Burnes said more than 2,000 workers had been deployed on rescue and recovery missions.
“A real focus for us at the moment will be resupplying the isolated communities,” he said, adding that 50,000 people were still stranded.
People clambered atop cars, houses and highway bridges before helicopters winched them away.
The storms have dumped more than six months’ worth of rain over three days, the government weather bureau has said, smashing flood-height records in some areas.
“These are horrific circumstances,” Prime Min­ister Anthony Albanese said Friday as he travelled into the disaster zone.
“There’s been massive damage to infrastructure and we’re going to have to all really pitch in.”

Around 6:30pm (1600 GMT), Hamburg police said on X they were carrying out a major operation at the main train station in Germany’s second-largest city.
“A person injured several people with a knife at the main train station” and a suspect had been arrested, they said. The suspect, police subsequently said, was a 39-year-old woman who was thought to have “acted alone”.
Investigations into the incident were “running at full speed”, police said, without giving an indication of a possible motive.
 






A spokesman for the Hamburg fire department told AFP that 12 people had been injured in the knife attack. Among them were “six people with life-threatening injuries”, the spokesman said.
German media, however, reported that the number of people with very severe injuries was lower.
Security concerns
The attack took place around 6:00 pm in the middle of rush hour at the end of the working week, according to German media.
The suspect was thought to have carried out the attack “against passengers” at the station, a spokeswoman for the Hanover federal police directorate, which also covers Hamburg, told AFP.
Images of the scene showed access to the platforms at one end of the station blocked off by police and people being loaded into waiting ambulances.
Some of the victims in the attack were being treated on board waiting trains in the station, Bild reported.
German rail operator Deutsche Bahn said on X that four platforms at the station had been closed.
The incident would lead to “delays and diversions in long-distance services”, Deutsche Bahn said in a post on X.
 






Germany has been rocked in recent months by a series of violent attacks with extremist motivations that have put security at the top of the agenda.
The most recent, on Sunday, saw four people injured in a stabbing at a bar in the city of Bielefeld.
The investigation into the attack had been handed over to federal prosecutors after the Syrian suspect in the attack told the police officers who arrested him that he had extremist beliefs.
The question of security, and the immigrant origin of many of the attackers, was a major topic during Germany’s recent election campaign.
The vote at the end of February saw the conservative CDU/CSU top the polls and a record score of over 20 per cent for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p><small>2025-05-23 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2322284663552eb.jpg?r=223043' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912867/federal-budget-to-be-presented-on-june-10-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Federal budget to be presented on June 10: Finance Ministry</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister, Khurram Schehzad, on Friday announced that the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 will be presented on June 10.
Earlier, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal announced that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
The adviser published a post on X today, which read, “The Federal Budget for FY 2025–26 of Pakistan will be presented on June 10, 2025.
“The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024–25 will be released a day before the Federal Budget, on June 9, 2025,” he added.
 






Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.
 
 

Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.
The government also set an ambitious tax collection target for the Federal Board of Revenue at Rs12,970bn, a 38pc increase from last year’s goal.
Earlier on Friday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “met all the targets” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.
During a press briefing in Washington DC, IMF Director of the Communications Department, Julie Kozack, said, “Our Board found that Pakistan had indeed met all of the targets. It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”</p><small>2025-05-23 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23150002e7ab7a5.jpg?r=224729' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912830/khuzdar-attack-driven-by-indian-provocation-had-nothing-to-do-with-baloch-identity-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Khuzdar attack driven by Indian provocation, had nothing to do with Baloch identity: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that “Indian state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan” — which he said had been ongoing since the inception of the country — was also responsible for the recent attack in Balochistan’s Khuzdar.
On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
On Thursday, the army’s top brass, during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC), had also pointed out India’s involvement in the incident, vowing that the armed forces will prevent the country’s peace from being compromised by “externally-sponsored terrorism.”

Key points

Initial findings confirm that Khuzdar attack fits pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan
“Pakistan has irrefutable evidence of Indian involvement in terrorism,“says DG ISPR
DG ISPR, interior secretary reiterate that Pakistan will not let India succeed
Says BLA has expressed willingness to be Delhi’s “practical and military arm”
DG ISPR vehemently criticises BYC, says media needs to “unmask” the group
Says attacks have no relation to Baloch identity


Lt Gen Chaudhry was addressing a press conference in Islamabad today alongside the Interior Secretary, Captain (retd) Khurram Muhammad Agha.
“India was planning and instructing terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, the funding for which is also provided by India,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India’s provocation.”
The DG ISPR highlighted that the attack on the Chinese envoy in Karachi in Oct 2024 also had Indian backing. “The Indian social media accounts affiliated with the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) posted about the attack beforehand.”
 
 

He added that the same thing happened during the hijacking of the Jaffar Express train in March when more than 400 passengers were taken hostage by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists.
“Before the Jaffer Express incident occurred, they [the social media accounts] were asking followers to ‘keep an eye on Pakistan today and tomorrow’.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry pointed out that the Indian media was “celebrating” the attack in Khuzdar.
“These are all Indian accounts, affiliated with RAW [and] posting for BLA and Fitnah al Hindustan, he said, referring to the government-designated term for all terror outfits in Balochistan. “What kind of a country celebrates acts of terrorism?”

Indian involvement in terrorism ‘since inception of Pakistan’
The DG ISPR also maintained that New Delhi had been involved in perpetrating terrorism across the country “since the inception of Pakistan.”
“In 2009, the Pakistani government handed a dossier containing irrefutable evidence [of India’s involvement in terror attacks across Pakistan] to the Indian prime minister,” he said. “The publicly disclosed documents released in 2010 are part of history. In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the form of [Indian spy] Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,” he said.
Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016, in a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan’s Mashkel area for his involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.
“Then in [2020], a dossier full of evidence was presented to the United Nations. Very recently, the international media has seen confessions and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this Fitnah al Hindustan,” he said.
Interior Secretary Agha also said that India was behind the terrorist incident in Khuzdar on May 21.
“In the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in the early morning of May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children, our future, resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.
“Let me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, our education, and the very fabric of our society,” Capt (retd) Agha said.

“On behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior, in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies, is looking into all [aspects] of this dastardly attack.”
Capt (retd) Agha said initial findings confirmed that this attack was a continuation of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan, operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing].
“Having miserably failed in the so-called Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed.
“Pakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan, reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the perpetrators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.”
He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, Fitnah al Hindustan has resorted to hitting soft targets, wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.
“Much against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted. I assure you that the State, in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus, will defeat them.
“These Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have … commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decisive. They will not succeed.”
‘Will we be deterred? Absolutely not’
Lt Gen Chaudhry then spoke about the Indian attacks on Pakistan on May 6 and 7, which were carried out by New Delhi after blaming Islamabad for April’s Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir and led to civilian deaths.
“Never in modern history have you seen any nation, any media celebrating the killing of children and women the way [India] is celebrating.
“This is the low moral fibre and level that the current Indian political elite has brought the society to.”
 
 

He said that one of the proxies of the Fitnah al Hindustan on May 11 issued a press release displaying a post from BLA.
In the post, he said that the BLA had assured India that if it received “political, diplomatic and defence support” from New Delhi, “We, along with the entire nation, is ready to attack from the western border and we will become its [India’s] practical and military arm”.
He said that RAW made BLA issue this press release “because they are unable to deter the state of Pakistan … They attack but the resolve of Pakistani people has not diminished.”
“Will we be deterred by the Fitnah al Hindustan with such press releases and cowardly actions? Absolutely not. Never,” he said.

He further said, “Instead of refraining from their oppression of minorities or finding a solution, India is carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan and the region.”
“They are externalising internal issues and when anyone asks for evidence, they do not have evidence. Who is the state sponsor of terrorism and the epicentre of destabilisation in this region?” he questioned.
The DG ISPR also called out the Indian media for spreading propaganda and said: “The Indian media is not free but controlled by the state,” he said, adding that those who were questioning media freedom in Pakistan were now aware of how free it was, compared to the “conditions of media in a so-called democracy [India].”
‘Terrorists who surrendered confessed to having links with India’
Speaking about terrorists who had surrendered before the State, the DG ISPR said: “There were some brave ones who stood up and surrendered because they realised that they were not there to fight India’s war. They [surrendered terrorists] come and tell us how India was involved.”
He highlighted the case of Adeela Baloch, a former militant who had surrendered herself to the authorities.
“She was exploited and blackmailed by the Fitnah al Hindustan to become a suicide bomber,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, adding that India was “exploiting young women from Balochistan.”
In response to a question about a policy to counter Fitnah al Hindustan, the DG ISPR replied: “I would say that our one-liner policy is that the nation, this iron wall, we fought in a gallant and exemplary manner against the Indian military aggression on the night of [May] 6 and 7, and you saw it again on May 10.
“This steel wall needs to be in unison and turned against the forces of terrorism.”
The DGR ISPR further said: “We need to understand certain facts. Why did the Indians feel the need to resort to this military escalation? One of the very important reasons was that all elements of national power over the last two years have gelled together.”
He went on to say that Pakistan had begun “squeezing the space for terrorists to operate” and that in the first five months of this year, 203 terrorists had been killed in Balochistan alone.
“Illegal Afghans are being pushed out and actions are being taken against the crime-terror nexus. In Balochistan, illegal trade routes are being shut down to stop funding for these terrorists,” DG ISPR added.
Answering another question, the DG ISPR vehemently criticised the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and its leader Dr Mahrang Baloch, saying that the media needed to “unmask” the group and its membership.
“The state has taken action against the BYC [and] their space has been squeezed,” he said.
He said that India’s military escalation was a necessity to create space for their proxy groups in the region, but stated that Pakistan did not disengage a single soldier from its counterterrorism force.
“Did we take even one soldier out? No. Because we knew they would operate in unison.”
He added that India was growing frustrated and desperate, stating that the country’s media was “howling” about Balochistan.
“It is clear that this is not a war of the Baloch, it is a war against Indian terror proxies who are killing children for money. Once they know it, then they get worried,” DG ISPR said.
‘A rational player’
DG ISPR reiterated that Pakistan was the “rational player” in the scenario with India and stated that the Pahalgam attack took place due to “India’s own oppression in Kashmir”.
“Their response was totally irrational, illogical and unilateral,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “Pakistan is approaching the issue of terrorism in Balochistan rationally because we are resolving it in unison and with the synergetic application of all elements of national power.
“[The] military is one part, where we have carried out more than 93,000 operations across Pakistan in one and a half years,” he added. Another part is socioeconomic, another is diplomacy, while the other part is us sitting here telling the people and the international community that this has nothing to do with Balochistan.
“This is state-sponsored terrorism by India.”
DG ISPR added that Pakistan “striking Indian cities and temples” would not resolve the problem, adding that “that is not how a rational state acts.
“We are going to tell the world … that this is the epicentre of destabilisation in this region, India,” he added. “[They have] a history that starts from 1971 with the Mukti Bahini, and even before. And in multiple countries of this region. I will not name it now but there is proof, the world knows it.”</p><small>2025-05-23 16:09</small></div><hr>
