In an interview to The Wire, Yashwant Shinde alleged the plot was a calculated bid to inflame communal violence and kill thousands, only for the sake of political power.
“This was a conspiracy by some people in the RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP with extremely vile and perverse mindsets, solely for the sake of power,” Mr Shinde said. “They wanted to set the country on fire so that power would always remain with them.”
“Politically in coma, they exp­loited Ayodhya for 82-84 seats in 1989, their eyes lit up and then Kashmir to repeatedly boost Atal Bihari Vajpayee to prime minister,” he said.

Says Hindu-Muslims riots, attacks in Pakistan, and Kashmir were part of a plan to gain political power

Mr Shinde accused RSS leader Indresh Kumar of spearheading the plan, introducing him around 2000 to a group from Nanded and that group also underwent weapons training from the army, and there were plans to send them to Pakistan to attack civilians.
He claimed this group was training to build time bombs, with inst­ructions to target public gatherings like Muslim weddings and they went and committed these acts.
Mr Shinde recalled a bomb they were preparing accidentally exploded in Nanded in 2006, killing an RSS member. He alleged that those involved in the conspiracy included Rakesh Dhawde and Ravi Dev. Mr Shinde claimed operatives such as Pragya and Purohit were “pawns” who could be sacrificed to protect the real masterminds.
Mr Shinde, who joined the RSS in 1994, claimed he tried to derail the conspiracy from within but could not oppose it openly for fear of being killed.
After the Supreme Court dismis­sed his petition seeking a new investigation, he decided to speak publicly.

“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”
Field Marshal Munir, who visited two US cities over the weekend, flew to Brussels, Belgium, on Sunday after completing his second high-profile trip to the United States in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country.
Attends Centcom ceremony
In Tampa, the army chief attended US Central Command (Centcom) change of command ceremony. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), his engagements included the retirement ceremony of General Michael E. Kurilla, Commander of CENTCOM, and the Change of Command in which Admiral Brad Cooper assumed charge.

His visit to US highlights military cooperation, diaspora outreach

The ISPR said FM Munir praised Gen Kurilla’s “exemplary leadership and invaluable contributions in strengthening Pakistan-US military relations” and expressed confidence that Admiral Cooper “would take this partnership forward to address shared security challenges”.
 
 

On the sidelines, FM Munir met US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine and chiefs of defence from other friendly countries, inviting Gen Caine to visit Pakistan and reaffirming Islamabad’s role as a key regional security stakeholder.
Meets Pakistani-Americans
The army chief’s most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa, attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.
The army chief described overseas Pakistanis as “a source of dignity and pride” and “a brain gain, not a brain drain,” crediting them with unwavering commitment to the homeland and quick mobilisation in national emergencies. He urged them to “remain confident in Pakistan’s bright future” and actively attract investment, highlighting untapped potential in mineral resources, energy, and emerging technologies.
He cautioned that social media, while powerful, was often exploited by anti-state actors to spread “manufactured chaos”. With 64pc of Pakistan’s population under 30, he said, the youth’s talent and energy would shape the country’s future.
Addressing the broader regional context, the COAS accused India of projecting itself as a “Vishwa Guru” while its intelligence agency RAW was involved in transnational terrorism — citing incidents in Canada, Qatar, and the arrest of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.
He condemned India’s “unprovoked aggression” across the Line of Control. Referring to the recent four-day war, he mocked New Delhi’s reluctance to admit battlefield losses. He thanked former US President Trump for his “strategic leadership” in preventing an India-Pakistan war and other global conflicts. He said held Kashmir was “not India’s internal matter but an unfinished international agenda”, vowing support for UN resolutions.
He told the Tampa audience that his second US visit marked “a new chapter” in bilateral ties, aimed at building a constructive, long-term partnership. He highlighted prospects for major investments from the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and China.
His trip came six weeks after his unprecedented lunch with President Trump at the White House — a privilege usually reserved for heads of state or government — which Bloomberg repo­rted may have influenced Indian PM Narendra Modi’s decision to skip a meeting with Trump during that period.

• Palestine envoy says over 2m victims enduring ‘unbearable agony’
• British diplomat terms plan ‘path to more bloodshed’; Algeria seeks sanctions on Tel Aviv
• Pakistan, Turkiye foreign ministers share concern over dire situation in besieged enclave
• Netanyahu insists to go ahead with the Gaza plan despite protests
UNITED NATIONS: A UN official on Sunday warned the Security Council that Israel’s plans to control Gaza City risked “another calamity” with far-reaching consequences, as criticism against Tel Aviv both at home and abroad intensified amid a famine risk in the besieged enclave.
The United Nations Security Council held a rare emergency weekend meeting after Israel said its military would “take control” of Gaza City in a plan approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet that sparked a wave of global criticism.
“If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction,” UN Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenca told the Security Council. The UN’s humanitarian office OCHA said 98 children had died from acute malnutrition since the start of the conflict in October 2023, with 37 of those deaths since July, according to Gaza’s authorities. “This is no longer a looming hunger crisis—this is starvation, pure and simple,” said OCHA’s coordination director Ramesh Rajasingham.
Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said “over two million victims are enduring unbearable agony,” calling Israel’s plans for Gaza City “illegal and immoral,” and for foreign journalists to be allowed into Gaza.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 61,430 Palestinians. According to Gaza’s civil defence agency, at least 27 people were killed by Israeli fire across the territory Sunday, including 11 who were waiting near aid distribution centres.

Sanctions calls
Britain, a close ally of Israel which nonetheless pushed for an emergency meeting on the crisis, warned the Israeli plan risked prolonging the conflict. “It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This is not a path to resolution. It is a path to more bloodshed,” said British deputy ambassador to the UN James Kariuki.
Outside the meeting at UN headquarters in New York, a small but noisy protest calling for an end to the conflict was met by a large police presence.
The United States, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, accused those nations who supported Sunday’s meeting of “actively prolonging the war by spreading lies about Israel”. “Israel has a right to decide what is necessary for its security and what measure measures are appropriate to end the threat posed by Hamas,” said US envoy to the UN Dorothy Shea.
Israel’s deputy ambassador to the UN Jonathan Miller said “pressure should not be placed on Israel…but on Hamas”. Algeria’s ambassador Amar Bendjama called for sanctions on Israel in response to its Gaza City plan. “The hour has come to impose sanctions on the enemy of humanity,” he said. “If it was another country, you would have been imposing sanctions a long time ago,” Palestinian envoy Mansour said.
‘Dire humanitarian situation’
Meanwhile, Pakistan expressed concern over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Turkiye Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Sunday, as both sides expressed grave concerns regarding the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.
FM Dar condemned the Israeli plan for a complete military takeover, calling it a flagrant violation of international law and UNSC resolutions, the Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement. He also stressed the urgent need for providing unimpeded humanitarian assistance and an end to Israeli impunity, state-run APP reported.
Polarised Israel
More than 22 months into the war, Israel is gripped by a yawning divide pitting those demanding an end to the conflict and a deal for the release of the prisoners against others who want to see Hamas vanquished once and for all.
But PM Netanyahu told journalists gathered for a rare press conference that “this is the best way to end the war, and the best way to end it speedily”. “I don’t want to talk about exact timetables, but we’re talking in terms of a fairly short timetable because we want to bring the war to an end,” he added.
The press conference came ahead of the UN Security Council meeting called to discuss the situation in Gaza and the new Israeli plan. It also came a day after thousands of people took to the streets in Tel Aviv to protest the security cabinet’s decision.
“The new plan is just another plan that is gonna fail, and it could very well be the end of our prisoners, and of course, it will take probably more lives of our soldiers,” protester Joel Obodov told AFP.
The Israeli government has faced regular protests over the course of the war, with many rallies calling for a ceasefire and prisoner-release deal after past truces saw captives exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.

During negotiations of the Pakistani team with the US authorities on reciprocal tariffs, the US side has showed interest to invest in the mines and minerals, including copper, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan revealed in the latest report placed before the National Assembly.
As the US administration had imposed 50pc tariffs on import of copper, iron, steel and aluminum but subsequently refined copper was exempted from the 50pc tariff, “it will be more advantageous to export value-added copper (refined) to the US market”, the minister claimed.
Pakistan was endowed with substantial mineral resources, ranked fifth globally in terms of copper reserves, which had the potential to significantly reduce the country’s trade imbalance with the world, the minister said. He stated copper, a critical component in global technological advancements, especially in renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, was in high demand worldwide. But despite these vast reserves, the country has not fully capitalised on its mineral wealth due to a lack of investment in modern mining infrastructure and processing capabilities.

Geological Survey of Pakistan has been tasked with detailed geological mapping to identify untapped reserves, commerce minister says

At present, Pakistan exports raw copper ores primarily to China, while missing out on lucrative markets like the US, Europe, and the Middle East. “This underutilisation of its copper resources highlights the need for strategic development in the mining sector,” the commerce minister said, adding that Pakistan could enhance production efficiency and product quality by investing in advanced technologies for exploration and extraction, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the international market.
Mr Kamal reported that the government would play a crucial role in facilitating this transformation with the US investment and support. In this regard, the Geological Survey of Pakistan has been tasked with a detailed geological mapping to identify untapped reserves. The government would also be swiftly streamlining regulatory frameworks and addressing infrastructural gaps, such as mine access roads and dedicated power supply to attract private sector involvement and technological innovation.
The commerce minister said market reports suggested that global demand for copper would surge in the coming years, driven by its indispensable role in clean energy technologies. “Pakistan’s strategic development of its copper sector could not only meet domestic economic goals but also contribute to alleviating global shortages,” he said, adding that by focusing on value-added exports, such as refined copper, bars, rods, and alloys, rather than raw ores, Pakistan could capture greater economic benefits from its mineral resources.
 
 

“Through strategic investments and the adoption of modern technologies, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its mineral resources. This would not only boost its export earnings but also position the country as a responsible and reliable supplier in the international minerals market, contributing to both national development and global sustainability efforts,” he said.
In response to the United States’ announcement of reciprocal tariffs on all countries, the government engaged with the relevant US authorities for reaching an understanding and reversing and changing the decision of reciprocal tariffs on Pakistan’s exports to US market, he said.
“After hectic negotiations with US authorities, the US has agreed to a tariff rate of 19pc, instead of earlier 29pc, on Pakistan’s exports to the US, which is lowest amongst Pakistan’s competitors in the US market” which now had the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market.

Officials described the event as the most severe in the area since 2018. “The volume of today’s flood was the highest in the Nullah since 2018,” said Zubair Ahmed Khan, assistant director of the Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (GBDMA) for Hunza and Nagar.
The flood severed the main road link for much of Hunza’s population, with traffic diverted via the Sas Valley Road from Murtazabad, he said.
 
 

The torrent, fuelled by accelerated glacier melt, ripped through agricultural land, uprooted trees and damaged public and private property.
Houses damaged in Hassanabad
In Hassanabad, residents were left counting the cost. “The flood eroded land near multiple homes and put more than 50 houses near Hassanabad Nullah at risk,” Saleem Bercha, a local resident, told Dawn.
“Several homes have developed cracks. Ten houses were dismantled recently to try to save them from the water,” he added.
This latest destruction follows a similar Glof last month that damaged four homes and swathes of farmland.
Authorities said Sunday’s disaster struck after the Shishper Glacier’s water discharge was blocked for around an hour before bursting through, obliterating protective walls and damaging irrigation and drinking-water channels to Aliabad and nearby villages.
 
 

Elsewhere in GB, flash floods triggered by heavy glacier melt surged through Supultar Nullah in Nagar Khas, blocking the Hoper Valley road and cutting off a popular tourist destination.
The flood damaged irrigation systems, destroyed a bridge and severed the Hisper Valley road in Tokorkot village, where several homes are now under threat.
In Hunza’s Shimshal Valley, rising river levels damaged the only access road and the protective walls safeguarding it.
Across the region, restoration work on irrigation and water supply systems wrecked by recent cloudbursts, flash floods and Glofs remains stalled. Communities are facing acute shortages of drinking and irrigation water.
In Danyor, residents said the destruction of main water channels had left thousands without water.
“Crops and trees have dried up,” a resident said.
Volunteers are now working to repair the damage, as communities here depend almost entirely on glacier-fed water for survival.
Experts warn that unprecedented high temperatures and repeated heatwaves this year have accelerated glacier melt, making Glofs and extreme flooding more frequent.

The quake was felt across several cities in the west of the country, including Istanbul and the tourist hotspot of Izmir, said officials, who are yet to comment on any potential damages or deaths.
Several buildings collapsed in the Balikesir province after the quake, according to images broadcast by Turkish media.
 






The quake hit at 7:53 pm (9:53pm PKT), with a 4.6-magnitude aftershock following several minutes later, according to AFAD.
The quake was also registered by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which recorded the quake and the aftershock at a depth of 10 kilometres.

“All AFAD teams and the relevant institutions have immediately begun searches on the ground. No undesirable event has been flagged up till now,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X.
 






Turkey is crisscrossed by several geological fault lines, which have previously caused catastrophes in the country.
A quake in February 2023 in the southwest killed at least 53,000 people and devastated Antakya, the site of the ancient city of Antioch.
More recently, a 5.8-magnitude tremor in the same region resulted in one death and injured 69 people at the beginning of July.</p><small>2025-08-10 18:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102305420f6109a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930012/muneeba-heroics-propel-pakistan-to-consolation-win-over-ireland-in-final-t20i' target='_blank'><strong>Muneeba heroics propel Pakistan to consolation win over Ireland in final T20I</strong></a><br><p>Player of the match Muneeba Ali’s hundred helped propel Pakistan women to a consolation win over Ireland on Sunday in the final Twenty20 International of the series that was won 2-1 by the Irish team.
Coming into this encounter, the Green Shirts were 2-0 down in the series, with Ireland winning the first T20I by 11 runs on Wednesday and four wickets on Friday.
Batting first at Clontarf Cricket Club Ground in Dublin, the Irish side got to a respectable 155-4 before centurion Muneeba and Aliya Riaz combined for an unbeaten 101 run partnership to make easy work of the Irish total — chasing it down with 14 balls to spare.
In the first innings, Irish allrounder Orla Prendergast continued with her good form in the series, scoring 64 runs not out of 46 balls.
 






Wicketkeeper Amy Hunter and Irish captain Gaby Lewis scored 29 and 36, respectively.
Muneeba started the Pakistani chase with three back-to-back boundaries off the bowling of Prendergast, the player of the match of the first encounter and winner of the player of the series award today.
One of the biggest hits of the series was hit by Muneeba over square-leg off Arlene Kelly in the fifth over of the innings.
The southpaw opener kept the momentum going, with the Green Shirts reaching the 50-run mark in just 5.1 overs — bringing up her half-century off just 29 balls.
The left-handed opener brought up her second century of the format with a single that got Pakistan over the line in the 18th over, reaching the milestone in just 68 deliveries.
She was adjudicated player of the match for the match-winning effort with the bat.
The series followed a productive month of preparation for Pakistan, who held a 17-day skills camp and a five-day pre-tour camp at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre in Karachi before arriving in Dublin on August 3.
Ireland, meanwhile, entered the series high on confidence after a dominant showing against Zimbabwe women last month, where they swept both the T20I and ODI series at home.
Before participating in the 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup in September, Pakistan will play one series consisting of three matches against South Africa in Lahore from Sept 16 to 22.
The World Cup is scheduled to be held in India from Sept 30 to Nov 2, but Pakistan will play their matches of the global event in Sri Lanka under the hybrid model, according to which neither India nor Pakistan will visit each other’s venues due to political strains between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.</p><small>2025-08-10 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102106125ff3a77.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930003/rana-sanaullah-urges-pti-not-to-launch-protest-drive-on-independence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah urges PTI not to launch protest drive on Independence Day</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Sunday urged the PTI to stage their upcoming nationwide protest movement on any day other than August 14, as it is Independence Day and should be celebrated with the nation united as one.
On August 6, a message was posted on PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan’s X account, calling for the PTI to “take to the streets in full force against the ongoing fascism in our beloved homeland”. That message came in the wake of the PTI’s failed protests on August 5.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal’, Sanaullah said that he had no issue with the protest going ahead but raised concerns about the timing.
“Protesting is their right, but to do it on August 14 would be upsetting and against our traditions,” he stated.
“On August 14, the nation will celebrate [Independence Day] with zeal, but the opposition has planned something on that day. They should not have their movement or protest on August 14; do it on the 15th, 16th, or 13th.”
The PM’s adviser lauded the opposition parties for “standing united” and “having coordination”, but raised an issue with them launching protests on national holidays.
“August 5 was the Day of Exploitation,” Sanaullah said, referring to the day observed by Pakistan to mark the Indian government’s move to strip occupied Kashmir of its autonomy.
“The nation was standing with their Kashmiri brethren and paying tribute to Kashmiri martyrs that day. They (the PTI) announced a big movement, and nothing ended up happening,” he said.
 


On August 5, police detained PTI protesters across the country after party activists took to the streets to officially kick off a nationwide movement for the release of Imran, who has been in jail for two years now.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told Dawn.com: “More than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.” He denied reports of the police arresting hundreds of activists.
Meanwhile, PTI Balochistan President Dawood Shah Kakar claimed “several” PTI workers, including five leaders, were arrested after they gathered at a place in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest.
The Rawalpindi administration banned all assemblies and gatherings until August 10 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, citing an “imminent threat”.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai, MNA Shandana Gulzar and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned but they were stopped by the Punjab police, with the TTAP sharing a video of Achakzai’s exchange with the personnel.
 






PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser announced that the second phase of the PTI’s efforts would take place on August 14, after which the party planned to head to Sindh. “We will unite the entire country to rid ourselves of this oppressive government,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-10 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102213011368711.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930008/one-child-drowns-in-kps-swat-river-two-others-missing-officials' target='_blank'><strong>One child drowns in KP’s Swat River, two others missing: officials</strong></a><br><p>A child drowned on Sunday while her two siblings were missing in the Swat River in the Butkhela area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, according to officials.
Malakand Assistant Commissioner Waheedullah Khan told Dawn.com that three siblings were bathing in the river when the incident occurred.
“A 12-year-old girl’s body was recovered from the river, while the search for her two brothers is continuing,” Waheedullah said.
Meanwhile, Nasir Khan, district emergency officer for the Rescue 1122 Malakand, said in a statement that the incident occurred near the Japan bridge in Butkhela, over the river.
“The three siblings drowned in the river and their ages were between 10 to 13,” Nasir was quoted as saying. “The search for the remaining two bodies will continue and civil defence teams are also taking part.
The Rescue 1122 official identified the recovered girl as 12-year-old Azra and her missing brothers as 10-year-old Bilal and 13-year-old Muhammad Sadiq.
“The search operation in the river has now paused and will resume early tomorrow morning,” Nasir added.

Azerbaijan and Armenia signed an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of conflict, the White House said.
The PM on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal, congratulating both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region” and stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”
In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said that he had a phone call with Aliyev, where he conveyed warm felicitations to him and the people of Azerbaijan on the peace deal.
“Lauded him for his vision and statesmanship, and deeply appreciated President Donald Trump, who played the role of peace maker in facilitating this landmark agreement,” the prime minister wrote.
 






During today’s phone call, PM Shehbaz offered his warm felicitations to Aliyev and the people of Azerbaijan on the historic peace agreement and hailed Trump’s role in the peace process.
“During their warm and cordial telephone conversation, the prime minister lauded the visionary role of President Ilham Aliyev in bringing the three-decades-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia to a peaceful and mutually beneficial end, especially as it would usher in a new era of prosperity for the Caucasus,” the statement read.
 


“The prime minister particularly appreciated the role played by US President Donald Trump in facilitating this historic deal that would now bring peace and prosperity to the region.
“President Aliyev expressed deep appreciation for Pakistan’s longstanding and consistent support for Azerbaijan on the Karabakh issue,” the statement added.
“The prime minister responded that it has always been a matter of duty for the people of Pakistan to extend their support to their Azerbaijani brothers and sisters on this core issue and it was heartening to note that, under President Aliyev’s bold leadership and statesmanship, peace had finally been established in this region.”
 
 

Aliyev told PM Shehbaz that peaceful development in the region would create new opportunities for enhanced connectivity between Pakistan and Central Asia. The statement said that both leaders also expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of their bilateral cooperation.
“While recalling their recent interactions in Lachin and Khankendi, the prime minister reiterated his invitation to President Aliyev to undertake an official visit to Pakistan soon,” the statement added. “Both leaders are also expected to meet in Tianjin on the margins of the upcoming SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) summit.”
Armenia and Azerbaijan had been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh — a mountainous Azerbaijani region that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population — broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.
Baku and Yerevan fought two wars for control of Azerbaijan’s Armenian-populated region of Nagorno Karabakh, at the end of the Soviet Union and again in 2020, before Azerbaijan seized the entire area in a 24-hour offensive in September 2023.</p><small>2025-08-10 17:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102142403247630.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930005/us-vp-vance-says-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-unlikely-to-satisfy-either-side' target='_blank'><strong>US VP Vance says Ukraine-Russia peace deal unlikely to satisfy either side</strong></a><br><p>United States Vice President JD Vance said a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine was unlikely to satisfy either side, and that any peace deal would likely leave both Moscow and Kyiv “unhappy”, adding that the US is aiming for a settlement both countries can accept.
“It’s not going to make anybody super happy. Both the Russians and the Ukrainians, probably, at the end of the day, are going to be unhappy with it,” he said on Fox News programme ‘Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo’.
US President Donald Trump said on Friday he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.
Trump said Russia and Ukraine were close to a ceasefire deal that could end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict, possibly requiring Ukraine to surrender significant territory.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, said on Saturday that Ukraine cannot violate its constitution on territorial issues, adding, “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupiers.”
 


In the Fox News interview recorded on Friday, Vance said the US was working to schedule talks between Putin, Zelensky and Trump, but he did not think it would be productive for Putin to meet with Zelensky before speaking with Trump.
“We’re at a point now where we’re trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that, around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict,” he said.
A White House official said late on Saturday that Trump was open to a summit with both leaders, but that right now the White House was planning for the bilateral meeting requested by Putin.</p><small>2025-08-10 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10100209215fd30.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929938/coas-munir-terms-his-2nd-us-visit-a-new-era-in-islamabad-washington-ties' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir terms his 2nd US visit ‘a new era’ in Islamabad-Washington ties</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir termed his second visit to the United States in just 1.5 months a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad, state-run PTV News reported on Sunday.
Field Marshal Munir is undertaking an official visit to the United States and has engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military’s media wing said earlier in the day.
The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
Addressing members of the Pakistani diaspora in the US in Tampa city of Florida, Field Marshal Munir was quoted as having said: “My second visit after a gap of just one and a half months marks a new dimension in Pak-US relations.”
He added that the aim of these visits was to take the relations on a constructive, sustainable and positive path.
“It is an honour for me to address Pakistanis living in the US,” he said, adding, “Overseas Pakistanis are a source of pride and dignity and are as enthusiastic as other Pakistanis.”
Speaking on regional issues, the army chief said: “India wants to present itself as a ‘Vishva Guru’ (global teacher), but in practice, it is nothing like that.”
“The involvement of India’s intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] in transnational terrorist activities is a cause of serious concern at the global level,” he added.
He cited the example of the killing of a Sikh leader in Canada, the case of eight Indian naval officers in Qatar, and incidents like Kulbhushan Jadhav.
“Pakistan has fought a successful diplomatic war against India’s discriminatory and duplicitous policies,” Field Marshal Munir added.
Commenting on the recent conflict with India, he said: “This Indian aggression has brought the region to the brink of a dangerously flaming war, where any mistake would lead to a bilateral conflict.”
He also said that Pakistan was extremely grateful to US President Donald Trump, “whose strategic leadership has not only stopped the Pakistan-India war but also prevented many wars in the world.”
Speaking on the issue of Kashmir, He said: “Occupied Kashmir is not an internal matter of India but an unfinished international agenda. As the Quaid-e-Azam had said, Kashmir is the ‘jugular vein’ of Pakistan.”
He added that there were also UN Security Council resolutions on occupied Kashmir, and Pakistan fully supports these resolutions.
He also spoke on the topic of terrorism, saying: “Many terrorist organisations from Afghanistan, including Fitna-al-Khawarij, are active against Pakistan.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He added that Pakistan’s progress and prosperity are linked to Pakistanis living around the world, saying, “Pakistan is currently the last bulwark against terrorism.”
“There is no sympathy for terrorists, and they will have to face justice with all their might,” he continued. “Pakistan is the last stronghold against terrorism at this time.”
The army chief said a potential trade deal with the United States is expected to bring significant investment.
“Pakistan has achieved remarkable successes on the international diplomatic front,” he added.
“Implementation is underway on several MoUs [memorandums of understanding] with the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and China, which will enhance economic cooperation and investment.”
He said Pakistanis living abroad are a source of dignity and pride, and they are as passionate and committed as those in Pakistan.
“Overseas Pakistanis are not a case of “brain drain” but rather a “brain gain.”
The COAS also said that social media today is a powerful platform, but “anti-state elements are using it to create engineered chaos”.
During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir had stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.
Today’s press release by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on the visit said: “In Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.
 






“COAS lauded General Kurilla’s exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.
In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.
The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.
The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.</p><small>2025-08-10 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10171239f90f084.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929988/pti-will-approach-lawyers-over-rumoured-27th-amendment-asad-qaiser' target='_blank'><strong>PTI will approach lawyers over ‘rumoured’ 27th Amendment: Asad Qaiser</strong></a><br><p>PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser on Sunday addressed rumours of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, stating that the party would approach the legal fraternity regarding the potential legislation.
After passing the 26th Constitutional Amendment last year, the government had been planning to table another amendment, colloquially known as the 27th Amendment, aimed at reforming local governments and “addressing issues skipped in previous legislation”.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, the PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker stated that there is “new drama” surrounding the legislation.
“In this case, we will approach the lawyers’ community regarding this legislation,” Qaiser said. “We will begin by meeting with the Islamabad Bar this month.”
Referring to a “schedule of activities” for this month, Qaiser said that the PTI will also arrange an engagement with foreign diplomats and embassies, as well as a seminar.
The PTI leader also assailed the manner in which the country is being governed, branding it “illegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic”.
“The country is practically under martial law and decisions are being made based on personal preferences,” Qaiser stated. “The country cannot be run under this hybrid system we have right now.
“We have decided that we will use all available forums — parliament, the courts, the public — to take our struggle against injustice and oppression forward.”
 






Qaiser claimed that courts made decisions not based on merit, but due to institutional pressure.
“We believe that the cases of political prisoners, including [PTI founder] Imran Khan, should be judged on merit, not due to pressure from the authorities,” he emphasised. “If the trials are decided on merit and there is live coverage in the media, the nation will see what a drama this is.”
Qaiser continued: “Then there’s also a show in the assembly. The way it’s being controlled and the way its system is being run, as well as the way parliamentarians are being humiliated in front of Adiala Jail, is concerning. I have conducted some research into this matter and will bring it up before the National Assembly.
“According to our own rules, it is written that any MNA can inspect prisons. Is it just written down or can it actually be enforced?” he asked.
Details about the proposed constitutional amendment were divulged by sources following a meeting bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairperson Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari in Lahore, atten­ded by key leaders from both parties on October 27 last year.
In contradicting statements, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had declared that the government was not considering any such legislation. At the same time, then-adviser to the PM on Law and Justice Barr­ister Aqeel Malik had hinted that the government could not only table “an amendment” in parliament, but would also be able to pass it.
In June this year, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.
In a post on X in July, PTI founder Imran wrote that rather than bringing in the amendment “through a sham parliament, it would be better to openly declare a monarchy, because what exists today is outright dictatorship, forcibly imposed on the country”.</p><small>2025-08-10 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/689780bf39702.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929774/essay-the-bureaucracy-of-belonging' target='_blank'><strong>ESSAY: THE BUREAUCRACY OF BELONGING</strong></a><br><p>What is a man to do if he fails to find a home in the land he migrated to with all the hope of finding one?
Muhammad, 62, who closed his eyes for the last time on May 6, 2025, still held on to the hope of ‘belonging’ somewhere. Born and raised in the heart of Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), he was not even 10 when he migrated to Pakistan with his elder brother post-1971. Later, his entire family joined him in the refugee camps, where his mother and six siblings spent seven precious years of their life, struggling to survive.
As a child, Muhammad accepted his fate, believing this was the course his life would take and that he would have to live it as long as he remained alive. But that was not the end for him.
After seven brutal years of labour and violence — all kinds of violence he would later recount to his children — he did make it out of the camps. Not only did he escape but, within five years, he also earned a diploma in sketching from the Karachi School of Arts and landed a job at one of the city’s leading advertising agencies of the time.
However, there was a spanner in the works: the struggle for identity, or the computerised national identity card (CNIC), as it is known.

Her father spent a lifetime trying to prove he belonged to Pakistan. Even after his death, the state refuses to acknowledge him. Now, his daughter tells the story he couldn’t finish…

This is the story of my late father, who took his last breath while struggling to regain the right to be a Pakistani citizen. Until the very day he died, everything was done using his expired NIC. He couldn’t renew it after 2013, because the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) kept asking for documents to prove that his parents had resided in West Pakistan before the secession of Bangladesh in 1971.
ECHOES OF STATELESSNESS
In Karachi, there is an area called Machhaira [Fishermen’s] Colony, also known as Machhar Colony. It is one of the largest and also one of the most neglected slums in the city.
 
 

Bordered by a railway track and Mauripur Road to the north and the Arabian Sea to the south, it has an approximate population of 850,000, according to the Pakistani Bengalis Action Committee, a community mobilisation group. The committee estimates that around 75 percent of the colony’s residents are of Bengali origin.
Of these, more than half are either ‘stateless’ or caught in a lengthy, uncertain struggle to secure citizenship, says lawyer Tahera Hasan, who also runs the Imkaan Welfare Organisation that works with marginalised and stateless communities.
The Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 outlines various ways a person can become a citizen. One is by birth: anyone born in Pakistan after the law came into effect is entitled to citizenship. Another way is through descent, which applies to those born to at least one Pakistani parent.
This law also grants citizenship to individuals who migrated to Pakistan before January 1, 1952, with the intention of settling permanently, provided they obtained a domicile certificate. Additionally, the government can grant citizenship through naturalisation to people who meet certain conditions.
After the separation of East and West Pakistan in 1971, the law was updated to address the situation of those affected by the split. Initially, it allowed people to claim citizenship if they could prove they had been living in Pakistan from 1971. Later, this requirement became stricter, demanding proof of residence between 1971 and 1978. These shifting policies have made it difficult for many to complete the documentation process and gain recognition as citizens.
A PERSONAL ORDEAL
I belong to one of the few Bengali families in the city, perhaps even the country, who were privileged enough not to pass on the trauma of statelessness to the next generation. As my mother is a citizen of this country, my siblings and I received birthright citizenship.
 
 

This birthright citizenship was also applied in the case of my late father and his siblings, who were initially issued identity cards in the late eighties on the basis of my grandmother’s West Pakistan citizenship. But what should have been a routine renewal in 2013 — having been considered Pakistan citizens for a quarter of a century — turned into a nightmare for the family.
It was also an election year, with the CNIC a prerequisite for voter registration. Nadra had been given the role to digitise and reconcile several databases to create a clean electoral register. In one fell swoop, Nadra rendered nearly 37.1 million voters as ‘unverified’, deciding only to include those in the 2013 voter roll who had registered with Nadra after 2008.
When my father went for his CNIC renewal, he was asked — once again — for proof of Pakistani residence before 1978, as per rules, or proof of his mother’s Pakistani citizenship. He no longer had his mother’s document, misplaced over the years, while there was no documented record of the family’s time at refugee camps before 1978.
This sudden change of requirement upended way too many lives, including that of my father and his siblings. This was despite how privileged he was compared to the majority of people of Bengali origin in Pakistan. The organisation that he had been employed with for many years decided to stick with him regardless of his expired CNIC.
Losing access to his bank account and phone SIM were relatively minor irritants in the larger scheme of things. What really hurt him was that he was unable to apply for visas or renew his passport, putting an end to his travel plans.
It’s painfully heartbreaking to reveal that my father longed to perform Umrah for as long as he lived but, by the time he became capable of organising the trip, he was no longer allowed to go. It was because, according to the state, he didn’t truly belong here.
STATELESS EVEN IN DEATH
The fact that my father was not going to feel at home in this country has been made clearer after his death. It has been three months since he passed and we are still unable to obtain his death certificate.
My father spent his entire life trying to make a home in this country while silently battling post-traumatic stress disorder, a burden he had carried since his days at art school, and one that was eventually passed down to his children. Despite his talent, capability and immense potential, he was repeatedly denied the opportunities he deserved.
But what’s even sadder, through the lens of my own experience, is the realisation that my father was still more fortunate than many others. Although he was deprived of his rights, he wasn’t starving for basic necessities. Throughout my life, from childhood to now, I have heard countless stories of people young and old — ambitious, driven, and deserving of education and careers — who are held back simply because they are not recognised as citizens of this country.
I don’t know what to write as an ending to this story. I had thought of penning down this experience since the first day I stepped into journalism. Finally, after losing my father, I have gathered the courage to write it down… because this story deserves to be told, as a reminder that belonging isn’t just about land or paperwork; it’s about dignity, memory and the silent battles people fight to be seen.
My father may not have been given the papers to prove he belonged, but his life, his work, his art and his love for this place made him more rooted than many who never had to prove a thing. The same goes for all the Bengalis residing in Karachi, trying to make a home in this country.

With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told Dawn.com: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”
The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.
“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.
 
 

“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.
A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.
In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.
The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.
Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.
 
 

In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, damaging a bogie of the Bolan Mail.
A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a technical fault was the cause.
In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to derail in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident.
In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.
Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10111545d25ea6d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929946/2-killed-in-accident-as-mob-torches-7-dumper-trucks-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>2 killed in accident as mob torches 7 dumper trucks in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Two siblings were killed and their father injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall early Sunday, sparking mob violence and protests that disrupted traffic on key city routes, officials said.
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that around 3:15am, a dumper truck hit a motorcycle carrying a family, killing Mahnoor, 22, and her 14-year-old brother Ahmed Raza, and injuring their 48-year-old father, Shakir.
Following the incident, transporters staged a protest by blocking Rashid Minhas Road and the Superhighway near Sohrab Goth, causing traffic jams.
Both inbound and outbound roads on Rashid Minhas Road from Sohrab Goth towards Gulshan-i-Iqbal were closed, while traffic on Al-Asif Square towards the city and towards Hyderabad was also halted in both directions.
“A mob gathered and set fire to a total of seven dumpers on both sides of the road within the limits of Yusuf Plaza and Federal B Area police stations,” the SSP told Dawn.com.
“The police reached the spot to apprehend the driver and took the dumper in custody.”
The police cordoned off the area, set up diversions, and called fire tenders to put off the fire, Siddiqi said.
“Furthermore, police have arrested 14 suspects on charges of torching the dumpers, and more arrests are being made with the help of videos and technical evidence.”
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com the siblings were brought dead to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, while their father was injured. Quoting relatives, she said the deceased girl was to get married soon.
Dr Summaiya said police brought in two drivers with critical injuries after they were beaten by the mob. She said the alleged errant driver was critically injured but stable, while a driver of another burnt dumper was also in critical condition with head injuries.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan confirmed that seven dumpers were torched near Lucky One Mall in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, adding that the fire tenders controlled the fire. “The heavy vehicles were badly damaged in arson acts,” he said.
Later, a statement from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon’s office stated that negotiations between the transporters and the provincial government were successful, with the former agreeing to end their demonstration.
A delegation of transporters led by Haji Yousaf and Jam Alam met Memon at the Karachi Commissioner House.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin and the city’s police chief, Javed Alam Odho, were also present on the occasion.
The statement added that Memon expressed condolences for those killed in the accident and condemned the “violent acts” that took place afterwards.
 






“The Sindh government will prioritise resolving their (the transporters’) legitimate issues,” Memon was quoted as saying.
“Violence and vandalism are not the solution to these problems. We will work with all parties to solve the problems of the transport sector and ensure that these incidents do not happen again.”
Memon added that those who committed acts of vandalism and “took the law into their own hands” will be charged under anti-terrorism laws.
“Dumper owners will ensure that their trucks are fitted with cameras and trackers, while they will have insurance and truck drivers’ licences,” Memon was quoted as saying. “A committee will be formed to assess the losses incurred by transporters.”
Earlier this month, a high-speed trailer truck crashed in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA), injuring two people.
In July, a 59-year-old milk supplier was killed when a dumper ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101704336925d73.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929987/sindh-govt-to-extend-e-bike-scheme-to-minority-workers' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt to extend e-bike scheme to minority workers</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Workers Welfare Board (WWB) on Sunday decided to extend its upcoming electric bikes scheme beyond women to industrial workers from minority communities.
The move coincides with the National Minorities Day, which is celebrated on August 11 every year. It commemorates the historic speech by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, made on Aug 11, 1947, where he emphasised equal rights for all citizens regardless of religion.
According to a statement, Sindh Labour Secretary Rafique Qureshi underscored the symbolic significance of this step, noting that “the white stripe in Pakistan’s flag represented minorities and their equal rights”.
Religious freedom remains a challenge in Pakistan, with recurring incidents of mob attacks, forced conversions and blasphemy cases, as noted by the European Union’s Sebastien Lorion.
Just last month, State Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das acknowledged that religious minorities in the country face administrative and governance issues.
 
 

According to Kheal Das, the law for the establishment of the National Commission for Minority Rights has been approved by both houses of the parliament and awaits presidential assent.
An EU-funded project for strengthening minority rights is being implemented in Punjab and Sindh by the Parliamentarians Commission for Human Rights in partnership with the Centre for Social Justice.
In July, a group of non-Muslim senators wrote to Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani, calling for the formation of a minority caucus in the House to represent their rights.
Last year, the founding chairman of the Pakistan Minorities Movement Peter Charles Sahotra had said minority communities face insecurity and discrimination in Pakistan and called upon the government to ensure their rights as provided in the Constitution.
Health insurance ramped up, solar-powered homes
The WWB also announced various other steps for the welfare of workers.
“The Workers’ Accidental Health Insurance Scheme will now provide annual health coverage worth Rs0.7 million, along with access to treatment in 270 hospitals nationwide,” it said.
The WWB also announced a major housing shift, replacing workers’ flats with fully solar-powered homes. Schools under the board will be solarised as well, with students receiving two sets of uniforms each year.
In line with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah’s directives, the death grant will be increased to Rs1m, while the marriage grant will be raised from Rs0.3m to Rs0.5m, the Sindh labour secretary said.
“The board is digitising all its operations to ensure fair and transparent service delivery to workers,” Qureshi noted.
The WWB, following its formal approval, will invest Rs3 billion in the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and approved Shariah-compliant Sukuk bonds to further strengthen the institution’s financial standing and expand facilities for workers.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10132212e7b38e9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929959/paa-rejects-rumours-of-islamabad-airport-being-closed-for-8-days' target='_blank'><strong>PAA rejects rumours of Islamabad airport being closed for 8 days</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Sunday dismissed “incorrect and misleading” media reports about an eight-day closure of Islamabad International Airport, clarifying the exact date and time of the planned shutdown.
A statement by PAA Spokesperson Saifullah Khan said, “According to the Notams issued, due to air activities ahead of Independence Day on August 14, arrival and departure flights will be suspended for only two hours on specific days and times.”
From August 6-9 and August 11-14, the airport will be shut from 11am-1pm PST.
On August 9 and 11, the airport will also be shut from 8-10pm.
“Apart from these brief interruptions, all flights at the airport will continue as usual,” the statement said, advising passengers to contact their airline for the latest information on their schedule.
The government has said that this year’s Independence Day would be celebrated under the banner of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth) — the period of conflict with India in May — to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress and pride.
 
 

While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.
During the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India, flight disruptions left hundreds of passengers stranded at the country’s major airports, including Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports.
The Ministry of Defence informed the National Assembly on Friday that the PAA lost Rs4.1 billion from April 24 to June 30 due to the closure.
PAA also issued a schedule for temporary runway closure at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International airport owing to bird activity. The closure will be in effect daily from 5am to 8am, starting July 1 until September 15.</p><small>2025-08-10 11:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101607512ffa03b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929973/over-600-pilgrims-briefly-hospitalised-due-to-chlorine-gas-leak-in-iraqs-karbala' target='_blank'><strong>Over 600 pilgrims briefly hospitalised due to chlorine gas leak in Iraq’s Karbala</strong></a><br><p>More than 600 pilgrims in Iraq were briefly hospitalised with respiratory problems after inhaling chlorine as a result of a leak at a water treatment station, authorities said on Sunday.
The incident took place overnight on the route between the two Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, located in the centre and south of Iraq, respectively.
This year, several million Shia Muslim pilgrims are expected to make their way to Karbala, which houses the shrines of the revered Imam Husain and his brother Abbas.
There, they will mark the Arbaeen — the 40-day period of mourning during which the community commemorate the death of Husain, grandson of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
In a brief statement, Iraq’s health ministry said that “621 cases of asphyxia have been recorded following a chlorine gas leak in Karbala”.
“All have received the necessary care and left the hospital in good health,” it said.
Security forces charged with protecting pilgrims meanwhile said the incident had been caused by “a chlorine leak from a water station on the Karbala-Najaf road”.
Much of Iraq’s infrastructure is in disrepair due to decades of conflict and corruption, with adherence to safety standards often lax.
In July, a massive fire at a shopping mall in the eastern city of Kut killed more than 60 people, many of whom suffocated in the toilets, according to authorities.</p><small>2025-08-10 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/10145658ba35b18.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929966/self-amusement-chinese-expert-spurns-indias-claims-on-downing-pakistani-jets' target='_blank'><strong>‘Self-amusement’: Chinese expert spurns India’s claims on downing Pakistani jets</strong></a><br><p>China’s former defence attache in South Asia Cheng Xizhong on Sunday spurned India’s much-delayed claim that it had shot down six Pakistani aircraft during the May conflict, terming it “self-amusement”.
Having faced international coverage of its own craft being downed by Pakistan and scathing criticism from the opposition, India’s Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh — three months after the conflict — claimed yesterday that his country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during those clashes.
While Pakistan had already denied that India downed any of its aircraft, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif swiftly rubbished Singh’s “belated assertions” yesterday.
Commenting on the matter today, Cheng said India’s allegations lacked strong evidence and have been “widely questioned by the international community, being considered groundless”, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Singh’s remarks were “comical, implausible and unconvincing”. “We may call it self-amusement,” he said in a statement.
 
 

Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes during the conflict. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
“The Indian side has not presented any evidence, such as photos of the wreckage of the fighter jets, radar monitoring data, etc, while the Pakistani side had previously presented a large amount of relevant evidence of shooting down the Indian fighter jets,” Cheng noted.
The defence expert believed that everything should be based on sufficient evidence.
He highlighted that now, more than three months have passed since the India-Pakistan clash. New Delhi has never produced any evidence to prove that it had shot down Pakistani fighter jets, Cheng highlighted.
“In contrast, the Pakistan side immediately provided a detailed technical report to international media after the clash ended,” he added.
The Chinese expert also cited “confirmations from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, and foreign intelligence assessments that India suffered heavy losses of multiple aircraft”.
“It is thus evident that no Pakistani fighter jet was hit or destroyed by the Indian side. On the contrary, the Pakistani side shot down six Indian fighter jets and destroyed S-400 air defence positions, among other achievements, which is an indisputable fact,” he added.
Professor Cheng is currently a senior research fellow at the Chinese think tank Charhar Institute and has also served as a former United Nations senior military observer, according to CGTN.
In his claims yesterday, the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief did not mention the type of Pakistan’s fighter jets that he insisted were taken down.
Asif, responding to Singh, stated that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India. He declared that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S-400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
Former envoy to the United States Dr Maleeha Lodhi also termed Singh’s claim “laughable”, quipping that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”
Criticism also echoed from within India. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera cast his doubts, saying: “The question we have after today’s information … when we had such a strong army and we were advancing, then under whose pressure did you stop Operation Sindoor?”
New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “a few planes”, refusing to go into the specifics of it. US President Donald Trump has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.
India’s loss of jets affirmed globally
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The IAF has not commented on those claims.
 
 

Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).
India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, acknowledged in June that the PAF downed Indian fighters, according to The Wire.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle with Pakistan, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the PAF’s J-10 fighters using PL-15 missiles, according to a Reuters report.
In a press briefing two days after the May 7 air combat, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Aura­n­g­zeb Ahmed, the deputy chief of operations of Pakistan Air Force (PAF), shared the locations where five Indian jets were downed — four along the Line of Control and one near Bathinda in northwest India. He also disclosed that one of the Indian jets was downed by Pakistani air defence systems.
According to a Dawn report, which cited PAF officials, India’s three Rafales, one Su-30MKI and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not a single Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
 
 

Describing the engagement as a textbook case of modern aerial warfare, AVM Aurangzeb had said Pakistan had tracked over 70 Indian aircraft — including 14 Rafales — using its Electro­mag­netic Operational Environ­ment and responded with a concentrated and pre-planned defensive counter-air strategy.
“Our side deployed 42 high-tech aircraft,” the PAF officer said. He noted that while India remained on its side of the border and launched air-to-ground we­a­pons, Pakistani defe­nces detected and enga­ged the threats instantly.</p><small>2025-08-10 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101313374b9df21.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929957/china-wants-us-to-relax-ai-chip-export-controls-for-trade-deal-report' target='_blank'><strong>China wants US to relax AI chip-export controls for trade deal: report</strong></a><br><p>China wants the United States to ease export controls on chips critical for artificial intelligence as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Chinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.
The White House, State Department, and China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.
HBM chips, which help perform data-intensive AI tasks quickly, are closely watched by investors due to their use alongside AI graphic processors, particularly Nvidia’s NVDA.O.
The FT said China is concerned because the US HBM controls hamper the ability of Chinese companies such as Huawei to develop their own AI chips.
 
 

Successive US administrations have curbed exports of advanced chips to China, looking to stymie Beijing’s AI and defence development.
While this has impacted US firms’ ability to fully address booming demand from China, one of the world’s largest semiconductor markets, it still remains an important revenue driver for American chipmakers.</p><small>2025-08-10 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101348275812608.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929964/3-terrorists-eliminated-as-cop-killed-in-southeast-iran-media' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists eliminated as cop killed in southeast Iran: media</strong></a><br><p>Extremists killed one policeman in Iran’s restive southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, Iranian media reported on Sunday, adding that three assailants also died.
“A policeman from Saravan was killed while terrorists were trying to enter the police station” in that area of Sistan-Baluchistan, the Tasnim news agency said.
The attackers were members of the militant group Jaish al-Adl ( “Army of Justice” in Arabic) active in Iran’s southeast, the agency said.
“Three terrorists were killed and two were arrested,” Tasnim said.
Sistan-Baluchistan, which shares a long border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been the site of frequent clashes between security forces and insurgents or smugglers, including militants who say they are fighting for greater rights and autonomy.
 
 

On July 26, gunmen stormed a courthouse in the province’s capital Zahedan, killing at least six people, in an attack that was later claimed by Jaish al-Adl.
In one of the deadliest attacks in the province, 10 police officers were killed in October.
At least three policemen were killed in separate attacks by militants and gunmen in Sistan-Baluchistan in September 2024. Five cops were shot dead in April that year as well.</p><small>2025-08-10 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101253098cd0e05.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929955/trump-nominates-state-dept-spokeswoman-bruce-as-us-deputy-representative-to-un' target='_blank'><strong>Trump nominates State Dept spokeswoman Bruce as US deputy representative to UN</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was nominating State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce as the next US deputy representative to the United Nations.
Bruce has been the State Department spokesperson since Trump took office in January.
In a post on social media in which Trump announced her nomination, the president said she did a “fantastic job” as State Department spokesperson. Bruce will need to be confirmed for the role by the US Senate, where Trump’s Republican Party holds a majority.
During press briefings, she has defended the Trump administration’s foreign policy decisions ranging from an immigration crackdown and visa revocations to US responses to the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel’s military onslaught on Gaza, including a widely condemned armed private aid operation in the Palestinian territory.
 
 

Bruce was previously a political contributor and commentator on Fox News for over 20 years.
She has also authored books like Fear Itself: Exposing the Left’s Mind-Killing Agenda, which criticised liberals and left-leaning viewpoints.
In a post after Trump’s announcement, Bruce thanked him and suggested that the role was a “few weeks” away. Neither Trump nor Bruce mentioned an exact timeline in their online posts.
“Now I’m blessed that in the next few weeks my commitment to advancing America First leadership and values continues on the global stage in this new post,” Bruce wrote on X.
 






Trump has picked former White House national security adviser Mike Waltz to be his UN envoy. Waltz’s Senate confirmation for that role, wherein he will be Bruce’s boss, is still due.
Waltz was Trump’s national security adviser until he was ousted on May 1 after he was caught up in a March scandal involving a Signal chat among top Trump national security aides on military strikes in Yemen. Trump then nominated Waltz as his UN ambassador.
Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who had served as the US deputy ambassador to the UN in 2024, is the acting US envoy currently.</p><small>2025-08-10 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1011390280b3f53.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929829/nearly-50pc-of-heart-attack-patients-in-pakistan-are-under-49-moot-told' target='_blank'><strong>Nearly 50pc of heart attack patients in Pakistan are under 49, moot told</strong></a><br><p>• Experts reveal heart attack patients often report no chest pain
• If you feel heaviness while walking or climbing stairs, get an ECG done immediately, cardiologists advise
KARACHI: Senior cardiologists on Saturday shared the shocking findings of a study according to which nearly 50 per cent of heart attack patients in the country are younger than 49 years, and 12 to 15pc of them are under 40 years of age.
The health experts representing the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) were speaking at a symposium held at a local hotel here.
The experts warned that this trend — fueled by diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, and unhealthy lifestyles — is making Pakistan one of the world’s worst-hit countries for early-age heart attacks.
The trial was designed and conducted independently by NICVD’s cardiology team and ran from June 7, 2021, to December 31, 2023. It enrolled 261 post-heart attack patients for testing effects of two anticoagulants for treating a blood clot that can form in the heart after an attack and cause stroke or other complications.
The findings have been published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances.
 
 

According to principal investigator Dr Jehangir Ali Shah, the new drug achieved faster clot resolution in the early phase — 20 per cent at four weeks versus 8.3 per cent (with the old medicine), while both drugs had similar high success rates at 12 weeks.
“This is the largest randomised trial to date in acute left ventricular thrombus, and the results show that the new drug is safe and effective alternative,” he said, adding that 15 per cent of participants were under 40 years.
NICVD Director of Cath Lab Dr Abdul Hakeem called for public health urgency. “Pakistan has the highest rate of young heart attack patients globally. Every third adult has diabetes, 40 per cent have high blood pressure, obesity is common, and smoking rates remain high. Many patients don’t know they’re at risk. After the age of 30, everyone should get a cardiac check-up,” he said.
He added that common misconceptions — such as assuming a heart attack always causes severe chest pain — can delay treatment.
“Nine out of 10 patients have no pain, only heaviness in the chest or acidity-like discomfort. If you feel chest heaviness while walking or climbing stairs, get an ECG done immediately,” he advised.
Dr Hakeem warned that the most dangerous anterior heart attack can damage up to 60 per cent of the heart muscle and often causes a clot that appears four to eight weeks later, increasing stroke risk.
NICVD Executive Director Dr Tahir Saghir said the institute was now moving into further advanced research, including trials on drug-coated balloons that do not require stents — a development that could reduce future artery blockages. “We already have international funding for this work, and the direct beneficiaries will be our patients,” he said.
Senior cardiologist Dr Nadeem Rizvi emphasised the importance of locally conducted clinical research, saying that results based on Pakistan’s environment and healthcare system were more practical and applicable.
Dow Institute of Cardiology Director Dr Tariq Farman said genetic, socioeconomic, and physical differences between Pakistani and western populations required tailored treatment guidelines.
“We need our own data. Sometimes the recommended high doses aren’t suitable for our patients,” he said, adding that early diagnosis and treatment could prevent thousands of strokes in Pakistan’s heart patients every year.

Talking to Dawn, Mr Gondal confirmed his appointment and said he would assume the post next month, upon the completion of the current auditor general’s term.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had moved the summary, which included senior officials of the Pakistan Audit and Accounts Group, and the president appointed Mr Gondal as the new AGP.
Mr Gondal is a public fi­­nance executive with over three decades of leadership experience in financial governance, audit and public procurement.
As controller general of accounts, he is credited with leading initiatives that included the digitisation of public financial ma­­nage­m­ent and the reco­very of more than Rs460 billion through audit enforcement.
His previous roles also include managing director of the Public Procure­ment Regulatory Autho­rity from November 2021 to April 2024, deputy auditor general for federal au­­dit operations, and accou­ntant general for Punjab and Sindh.

The United Nations and its partners will roll out the dedicated hub for climate investments, creating a pathway for debt-distressed nations to foster sustainable development.
“An early engagement by Pakistan will allow the co­­u­ntry to be among the first to get access to this mechanism for converting debt into investment in climate resilience, education or healthcare,” UN Assistant Secretary-Gen­eral for Economic Development Navid Hanif told Dawn.
Mr Hanif, who just completed a visit to Pakistan, said the recent Fourth International Conference on Financing for Develo­pment in Seville, Spain, opened a window for the country to mobilise new public and private capital if it takes a proactive and coordinated approach.

Urges early engagement, advises country to enhance capacity and prepare projects to benefit first

UN Member States adopted the “Seville Commitment” at the conference, a global roadmap for mobilising funds for sustainable development.
The conference also launched 130 high impact initiatives through the Sevilla Platform for Action. “From joining multilateral borrower platforms to pitching investment-ready projects, from preparing for climate debt swap to organising donors around national priorities – the tools are on the table,” Mr Hanif said.
As a country dealing with both debt stress and climate vulnerability, Pakis­tan stands to benefit from a new “Seville Debtors’ Forum,” a multilateral platform for borrower countries to share expertise on debt management.
“The participation will give Pakistan a collective voi­ce in discussions on debt sustainability, financing terms, and conditionalities — matters that directly affect its fiscal outlook and development options,” he maintained.
He suggested Pakistan establish a country-led platform to convene development partners aro­und national priorities like energy transition, digital transfor­ma­tion or human capital development.
Climate change poses a major threat to Pakistan’s economic progress, as evidenced by the devastating floods of 2022. He urged a comprehensive strategy centred on resilience, adaptation and disaster risk reduction.
 
 

He recommended that Pakistan upgrade infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, reinforcing dams, levees, and drainage systems while climate-proofing roads, bridges and housing.
“Every dollar spent on resilient infrastructure can greatly reduce future economic losses,” he said, adding that rebuilding infrastructure to higher standards after disasters is essential.
To protect the country’s vital agriculture sector, Mr Hanif said investing in climate-smart practices is critical.
This includes developing flood-resistant crop varieties, improving farm drainage, and expanding crop insurance.
Stressing the need for global support under the principle of climate justice, the UN official said Pakistan must actively pursue funds from mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund, adaptation funds and the newly agreed loss-and-damage fund.

While the rate cut is seen as a step towards easing the cost of doing business, many in the sector argue that it remains uncompetitive compared to regional rates and does little to address the core challenges hindering economic growth.
Industry leaders point to the high cost of production and the rising influx of smuggled goods from countries such as Iran, China, and Bangladesh, which continue to undermine the competitiveness of Pakistani products in both domestic and international markets.
“The market is flooded with smuggled goods — everything from high-quality shoes and garments to food products. New shopping centres popping up around Karachi are full of these imports, and shop owners openly advertise their smuggled stock,” said one frustrated currency dealer. He attributed the failure of anti-smuggling efforts to the foreign exchange used to fund the illegal imports, making it difficult for authorities to crack down effectively.

Despite a sharp rate cut, industry remains sceptical about unresolved policy issues as barriers to economic growth

State Bank data reflects a concerning trend: private sector borrowing remains sluggish, with banks receiving more debt repayments than new loans. This lack of borrowing underscores the reluctance of businesses to invest in a climate where the cost of doing business remains prohibitively high.
“How can we borrow from banks when the cost of doing business here is still far higher than in neighbouring countries?” questioned Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Electricity and gas prices are exorbitant, taxes are stifling trade and industry, and policymakers are focused on extracting more revenue while the economy stagnates.”
Mr Bilwani expressed doubt that Pakistan could achieve even 3.5pc economic growth this year, predicting a further decline in exports due to high production costs and the lack of an active Export Financing Scheme. He also criticised the 19pc tariff imposed by the United States on Pakistani goods, which, he believes, will push Pakistan further out of the international market. “Our regional competitors — except India, which faces a 50pc tariff — are in a better position to compete,” he added.
The industrial sector also expressed disappointment over the government’s failure to provide gas to captive power plants, a move that could have alleviated some of the high energy costs for manufacturers.
Instead, a 2pc levy has been imposed. Pakistan continues to rely heavily on expensive imported Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) for electricity generation, while local gas resources remain untapped. The Energy Authority has reported declining electricity consumption, a sign that industry has yet to experience any significant recovery.
“The falling consumption is a clear indication that the industrial sector is not improving. The prospects for growth in FY26 look increasingly bleak,” said another industrialist. He further highlighted the growing shift towards solar energy, particularly among residential users who are turning to alternative sources to mitigate the burden of costly electricity and frequent overbilling.
Former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail recently noted that solar power production in Pakistan has reached 23,000MW, with the sector expanding rapidly as more people opt for cheaper and more reliable energy sources.
Despite the drop in interest rates, some exporters remain disillusioned. Amir Aziz, an exporter of finished textile products, noted that while the 11% rate is half of what it was last year, it has failed to stimulate business activity. “The trade and industry are bogged down by issues like the expanded powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to arrest businessmen, excessive taxation, overbilling, and political uncertainty.

They said that the Iranian government will extend all facilities and incentives for starting joint ventures with Iranian entrepreneurs and investors.
They extended the offer during a meeting with business leaders and representatives of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Small Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries and the Pak-Iran Chamber of Commerce in Quetta on Saturday.
The Iranian officials emphasised that achieving the $10 billion bilateral trade target between Pakistan and Iran depends on cooperation. They also congratulated Balochistan’s business community on the resumption of Quetta-Zahedan flight services via Mashhad.
The Iranian envoy and members of the delegation expressed satisfaction over recent agreements signed between Pakistani and Iranian officials in Islamabad, including plans to expand bilateral trade to $10bn.
They noted that while official agreements are encouraging, their implementation will not be possible without the cooperation of chambers of commerce and the business community. They stressed that Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan may have different geographies but share common economic interests and trade barriers must be removed collectively.
The delegation agreed to the proposal for forming a transport issue resolution committee and encouraged private-sector initiatives to further enhance bilateral trade.
Earlier, Quetta Chamber President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and Vice President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar highlighted the chamber’s long-standing efforts to promote and strengthen brotherly trade ties with neighbouring countries.
They stressed the need to resolve transport issues and reduce tariffs on imports from each other to boost bilateral trade. They also proposed forming a joint committee — comprising chamber representatives, NLC officials and transport ministry authorities from both countries — to address cross-border goods transport problems. According to them, resolving these issues would create dignified employment opportunities and improve living standards for people in both nations.
