“Pakistan is losing fertile land at an alarming rate due to desertification, droughts, and mismanaged water resources, threatening food security, livelihoods, and the very fabric of rural economies,” she said in a statement issued on Monday on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought.
 
 

“This is not just an environmental issue, it is a national emergency,” she added.
Climate Risk Index 2025 ranks Pakistan 1st among top 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2022, with over 68 per cent of its land area now classified as arid or semi-arid.

Calls for accelerated investment in land restoration, regional climate cooperation, end to weaponisation of water resources

The country loses nearly 27,000 hectares of forest and productive land annually, while prolonged droughts in Balochistan, Sindh and south Punjab continue to push vulnerable communities deeper into poverty. The per capita availability of water had plu­m­­meted from 5,000 cubic metres in 1947 to less than 900 today, crossing the threshold of water scarcity.
This year’s theme — “Restore the Land. Unlock the Oppo­r­t­u­nities” — could not be more relevant for Pakistan. Healthy land underpinned food systems, climate resilience, and economic stability.
But as the UNCCD warned, over one million km² of productive land — about 113pc of Pakistan’s total land area — was lost worldwide to degradation every year, requiring $1 billion in daily investments for restoration between 2025 and 2030. Yet current global investments stand at just $66bn annually, with private sector contributions standing at a paltry 6pc.

Senator Rehman emphasised that land restoration in Pakistan must be prioritised as a climate adaptation strategy with multiple co-benefits. “Every dollar invested in land restoration yields $7-30 in economic returns. We cannot afford to ignore these numbers any longer.”
She also called on the international community to ramp up support for South Asia, urging multilateral financing mechanisms and debt relief to unlock restoration investments. “The Global South is drowning in climate losses. We need urgent support to revive our ecosystems and protect our people.”
Senator Rehman underscored the need for projects and initiatives that aimed to restore degraded ecosystems and riverine health, but warned that piecemeal projects are not enough. “We need a full-spectrum, national strategy that integrates land restoration into agricultural reform, climate adaptation, and rural development.”
She urged the government to legislate stronger protection for rangelands, invest in drought-re­silient infrastructure, and create incentives for regenerative farming and reforestation, particular­­ly in climate-vulnerable districts.
Published in Dawn, June 17th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-17 05:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/6850be4e745e4.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917646/unimportant-matters' target='_blank'><strong>Unimportant matters</strong></a><br><p>IT was a happening week, with the PML-N government’s second budget, a war in the neighbourhood and a diplomatic delegation in Europe following a visit to the US.
But alongside these earth-shaking events, Pakistan struggled with another issue which barely got any attention in terms of debate or discussion: the searing heat.
Since the recent Eid holidays, the country has been in the middle of a heatwave, with little respite. Temperatures are averaging 40 degrees Celsius in Islamabad, while Punjab and Sindh have seen far worse. And frankly, in homes across the country, the discussion about the possible break from these temperatures dominated conversations as much as the budget or the nearby conflict did.
 
 

And while there is good news that the rains are not too far away, the bad news is that experts have warned that these high temperatures are only going to grow with each passing year as is the duration of the summer months.
But in a world and a country struggling with conflict, inflation and economic crises, there is little bandwidth to spare for this issue; the focus this entire past week has remained on how the government is going to collect more tax so it can spend more money on building roads, preparations for a conflict and diplomatic ventures.
It is perhaps a sign of our priorities that the climate minister was sent off to foreign shores to talk about India. And yes, I am aware that part of the conversation with the rest of the world is about water, the Indus Waters Treaty and India.
However, to be fair, the real powers, we keep getting told, lie with the provincial governments as far as the climate is concerned and they have been busy at work according to news bulletins. Nearly every day, news channels inform us about the advisories issued, telling people to stay away from the sun, stay indoors, drink water, etc.

Experts have warned that these high temperatures are only going to grow with each passing year.

Would it be unfair to suggest the advice is a bit Marie Antoinette-ish?
In a country where poverty levels hover around 40 per cent and a significant portion of the workforce comprises daily wage workers, how practical is it to tell people to avoid stepping out when summers grow longer and temperatures more intense? Can work, say, by construction workers or food riders, be put on hold for the evening or till the weather is less punishing? How is this supposed to be handled?
But more tone deaf is the advice about staying at home. Crowded into small homes where people in most cases far outnumber the rooms and space, how practical is it for individuals to stay indoors? Overcrowding rooms and a scratchy electricity supply is hardly a recipe for respite.
Indeed, the advisories at times remind one of the debate over ‘strict lockdowns’ during Covid, a solution that works only if the ones able to follow it are privileged so that staying at home comfortably is a possibility and not a luxury. Because there are savings in the bank and a home that allows for space to sit, walk around, watch TV and browse the net.
Ask government officials some questions along these lines and chances are the response will be about how Pakistan contributes little to emissions and yet suffers the harsh consequences of climate change. It has become our favourite argument since the 2022 floods; not because it is correct but because we see it as an opportunity for foreign inflows rather than really wanting to work on the environment. Consider yesterday’s story in Dawn which reported on the budget cuts of the climate ministry.
 
 

But more than all of these specialised details on plans and funding, which are beyond the brain of a lowly hack, the lack of the governments’ seriousness on climate change is most evident in their development model, which is not even being debated.
We continue to turn our cities into concrete jungles with impractically broad avenues which can be traversed only by car. Lahore’s transformation along these lines has been more or less 50 years in the making and now Islamabad is well on its way. Achievement and governance continue to be measured in roads that are built quickly and are only meant for cars which ideally shouldn’t cross the speed of 70 but frequently do.
Others in the world may be discussing ways to pedestrianise city centres but we want to build Dubai-like cities in areas which were once known for their greenery. And where ordinary, underprivileged people have to walk in the blazing sun with little public transport and amid concrete that emits heat at 10 o’clock at night.
If only the prime minister and his cabinet would walk down Constitution Avenue after sunset; they might experience for themselves the heat traps they are building for those who cannot afford to travel in air-conditioned cars or do not have the luxury of access to swimming pools.
 
 

The relief to the real estate sector is also a recipe for disaster. No one is willing to consider what such policies will do to a country which does little to control its population and then also encourages the growth of horizontal housing. Or perhaps the plan is to squeeze the middle class and the underprivileged so much that they will not be able to spend much on housing.
I descend into inane sarcasm but at times it’s the only way to analyse policymaking in Pakistan, especially on issues that are not really on the priority list. For when the wars are over, the economy has been fixed, the governments are popular and real estate not essential, will we turn to the environment.
Perhaps then the governments will figure out if they can do more than tell the people to stay indoors and drink lots of water.
In the meantime, can someone convince security companies and food delivery apps to not dress their employees working daytime hours during the summers in clothes made of synthetic fabric?

The contact was established following speeches by PPP leaders in parliament claiming that the budget offers nothing for the poor. “PPP leader Abdul Qadir Patel, in his speech, said that the PPP will not support the money bill. So later, I contacted PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and sought support to block the bill,” former National Assembly speaker and PTI leader Asad Qaiser told Dawn.
It is worth noting that if a government fails to pass the money bill, it becomes its moral responsibility to resign.
Mr Qaiser said Raja Pervaiz Ashraf informed him that he would discuss the matter with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari once he returns to Pakistan. When asked whether the PTI had anything to offer the PPP in return, Mr Qaiser said, “If PPP gives a positive response, it can be discussed what and how the future situation will be dealt with, and what should be the modalities.

“Iran should have signed the ‘deal’ I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again!
“Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” he said on his Truth Social platform.

Separately, French President Emmanuel Macron called for strikes against civilians in Iran and Israel to end, as he warned against forcing regime change in Tehran, AFP reported.
“If the United States can achieve a ceasefire, that’s a very good thing,” Macron told reporters at a G7 summit in Canada, just as the White House announced President Donald Trump would leave the event early due to the escalating crisis in the Middle East. Fox News reported he would convene his National Security Council.
Macron called on both Israel and Iran to “end” strikes against civilians and warned that aiming to overthrow Tehran’s clerical state would be a “strategic error.”
“All who have thought that by bombing from the outside you can save a country in spite of itself have always been mistaken,” he said.
After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and starving a besieged population — Israel expanded its assault across borders, launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
 
 

Tensions have escalated since Friday, with more than 224 Iranians killed and over 1000 injured, most of them civilians. Israel says 24 people have been killed, mostly civilians.
Iran is a party to the NPT, whereas Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons.
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
Iranian media soon reported explosions and heavy air defence fire in Tehran early on Tuesday. Air defences were also activated in Natanz, home to key nuclear installations 320km (200 miles) away, the Asriran news website reported. A White House aide said it was not true that the US was attacking Iran.
In Israel, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv after midnight, and an explosion was heard as Iranian missiles targeted the country again.
According to AFP, Israel’s army warned early on Tuesday that it had detected new missiles launched from Iran, but swiftly dropped an alert and said people no longer needed to take cover.
“It is now permitted to leave protected spaces in northern Israel,” the Israeli army said on Telegram.
Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to urge Trump to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, according to two Iranian and three regional sources.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News on Tuesday that President Donald Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran even as hostilities have escalated between Israel and Tehran, while a White House aide said separately that Washington was not attacking Iran.
“Of course,” Hegseth said on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters Primetime” show when asked if Trump was still aiming for a nuclear deal with Iran.
“We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that’s what happens here,” Hegseth said.
“If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X. “Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue.”
 






Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that Israel was committed to eliminating threats posed by Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, adding, “If this can be achieved in another way—fine. But we gave it a 60-day chance.”
FMs from 20 Muslim states call for ending Israeli hostilities
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared a joint statement by Pakistan and 19 other countries’ foreign ministers that strongly condemned Israel’s recent military attacks against Iran, calling for de-escalation and swift return to negotiations for a sustainable agreement on the Iranian nuclear program.)
 






The leaders of 20 nations called for the urgent necessity of establishing a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction, which should apply to all States in the region without exception in line with relevant international resolutions. There is also an urgent need for all countries of the Middle East to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), they emphasised.
The foreign ministers highlighted the paramount importance of refraining from targeting nuclear facilities that were under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, in accordance with relevant IAEA resolutions and United Nations Security Council decisions, as such acts constituted a violation of international law and international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
Chinese urged to leave Israel
With security concerns growing and Israeli airspace closed because of the war, the Chinese embassy in Israel urged Chinese citizens to leave the country via land border crossings as soon as possible.
The Iran-Israel air war — the biggest battle ever between the two longtime enemies — escalated on Monday with Israel targeting Iran’s state broadcaster and uranium enrichment facilities.
Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC that the Natanz plant sustained extensive damage, likely destroying 15,000 centrifuges, while Iran’s Fordow plant remained largely intact.
Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for June 15 but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack.
Israel launched its air war with a surprise attack that has killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran’s military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.
Trump has consistently said the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agreed to US demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear programme.
“As I’ve been saying, I think a deal will be signed, or something will happen, but a deal will be signed, and I think Iran is foolish not to sign,” Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Monday.
A US official said Trump would not sign a draft statement from G7 leaders calling for a de-escalation of the conflict. The draft statement says Iran must never have a nuclear weapon and that Israel has the right to defend itself.
On Monday, Iran state TV resumed live coverage after Israel’s attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) building.
“The Zionist regime, the enemy of the Iranian nation, minutes ago conducted a military operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran news network”, part of IRIB, said Hassan Abedini, a senior official at the broadcasting service. “The regime (Israel) was unaware of the fact that the voice of the Islamic revolution and the great Iran will not be silenced with a military operation.”
The blast occurred as the presenter was live on TV, lambasting Israel before she was seen leaving the live broadcast, Iranian media reported, sharing a video of the incident. The attack was confirmed by the Israeli defence minister as well.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly condemned Israel’s strike on an Iranian state broadcaster and called for an end to the “bloodshed”, Al Jazeera reported.
“CPJ is appalled by Israel’s bombing of Iran’s state TV channel while live on air,” CPJ Regional Director for the Middle East Sara Qudah said. “Israel’s killing, with impunity, of almost 200 journalists in Gaza has emboldened it to target media elsewhere in the region. This bloodshed must end now.”
Earlier, Israel’s Haifa-based Bazan Group said all refinery facilities have been shut down after a power station used to produce steam and electricity were significantly damaged in an attack by Iran, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.
The group said the Iranian attack resulted in the death of three company employees.
The refinery is located in Haifa Bay, according to Israeli media.

The observation came when senior counsel Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, on behalf of five IHC judges, highlighted changes in the IHC Administrative Committee. At this, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan raised an objection, stating that the issue raised by the counsel was not challenged by anyone before the CB, nor can it be discussed in rebuttal arguments.
Headed by Justice Mazhar, a five-judge CB had taken up a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz – pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
During the hearing, Barrister Ahmed on a rebuttal argued that Article 200 applies only to sub section 3 of the Constitution, stating that when a judge was transferred to another high court, he loses his seniority, similar to the process in the civil service.

No concept of ‘deputation’ in the judiciary, Justice Mazhar observes while hearing IHC judges’ seniority case

Justice Mazhar observed that there was no principle of deputation or merging a judge in another court in the judiciary, as was done in the civil service, where an employee can be absorbed to another department on deputation.
The counsel explained that if the question of service was examined, it would be found that if the cadre was the same, the seniority may not be affected. But if the cadre was different, seniority will be affected.
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar asked the Punjab government’s lawyer whether the Advocate General of Punjab had filed any application in this regard. In response, Advocate Amjad Pervez said he had presented a complete history of judges’ transfers from 1947 to 1976, adding that the Punjab government was not a party to the present case.
Justice Mazhar, however, observed that Punjab’s lawyer should have given arguments after AGP. “Don’t you know how important a 27A notice is,” Justice Mazhar observed, adding that when the Lahore High Court registrar had submitted his comments, he became the main party in this case.
Justice Panhwar observed that the court would like to hear him after Barrister Ahmed completes his arguments.
Barrister Ahmed recalled that it had been declared in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa reference that the president should always apply his independent mind before taking any important decision.
Justice Mazhar, however, observed we should keep in mind the difference between Article 200 and Article 209, adding that at the time of transfer of judges, the judiciary was consulted in four stages, but no such procedure was adopted before filing a reference against a judge under Article 209 of the Constitution.
When the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommends removal of a judge, could the President then apply his independent mind, Justice Mazhar observed, adding that in the judges transfer case, if the chief justice of the high court refuses to release the judge, the transfer can be stopped.

• Minimum pay raised to Rs40,000  • 50,000 families to get house loans
• Lahore remains priority for development schemes
• Credible plan to boost tax revenues missing
LAHORE: The PML-N government in Punjab on Monday proposed a Rs5.33 trillion annual budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, focusing primarily on large infrastructure schemes and freebies for the urban middle classes, especially the youth, as well as small industries and farmers to regain the political ground it had lost in its stronghold in the 2024 election.
The budget features a record Rs1.24tr Annual Dev­elop­ment Programme (ADP), which is Rs240 billion or 25pc greater than the federal Public Sector Development Progr­amme (PSDP), and commits to produce Rs740bn in estimated provincial surplus to meet a key IMF goal to hold down consolidated federal budget deficit. The Provincial Consoli­dated Fund also includes a one-time income of Rs160bn under the head of ‘supernume­rary resource’ from an undisclosed source. This kind of irregular income is normally used to bridge the budget deficit. In this case, it is speculated to have been added to meet the provincial surplus condition of the IMF programme.
Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman presented the budget in Punjab Assembly.
The budget focuses the social sector with whopping allocations for health, education, infrastructure, local government, public safety and agriculture. Cumulatively, Rs2.61tr has been allocated, including Rs630.5bn, Rs811.8bn and Rs129.8bn for health, education and agriculture, respectively.
The budget, however, does not lay out a credible plan to boost tax revenues, except an incremental increase of 11.4pc to Rs525bn. The budget documents show the government had failed to collect the targeted tax of Rs471bn for the outgoing year as the collection is estimated to face a shortfall of around 10pc due to lower collection of GST on services and immovable urban property tax. On the other hand, it reveals allocation of a considerable subsidy amounting to Rs165bn in total for various sectors, including Rs10bn, Rs40.8bn, Rs79.5bn and Rs35bn for agriculture, transport, free medicines and Ram­azan Package, respectively.
Development plan
The total layout of the budget includes ADP of Rs1.24tr—Rs398bn or 47pc more than the ongoing ADP and Rs240bn more than the PSDP for 2025-26.
Punjab has proposed a 10pc raise in the salary of all government employees (BPS 1-22) and 5pc incre­ase in the pension of the retired employees, which is 2pc less than 7pc incre­ase in pensions as annou­nced in the federal budget. The budget also proposes an increase in the minimum wage from Rs37,000 to Rs40,000 per month.
“We have allocated Rs148bn for education in the wake of development and Rs661bn for the non-development expenditures, which are 127pc and 24.4pc higher than the FY 2024-25,” the finance minister told the lawmakers in the House.
“I am feeling proud to say that, like FY 2024-25, the health sector would also be our priority. For next fiscal year, we have allocated a record Rs128bn, which is 131pc higher than the FY 2024-25. For non-development expenditures, Rs450bn have been allocated, 16pc higher than the FY 2024-25,” he said.
The province expects to receive Rs4tr under the Federal Divisible Pool (FDP). It estimates to collect own-source taxes amounting to Rs524bn, and own-source non-tax receipts of Rs303bn, Rs102bn in capital receipts and recovery of loans, and Rs128bn in foreign project assistance.
On expenditure side, Punjab estimates to spend Rs2.03tr (current expenditures), Rs679bn on service delivery, Rs590bn as capital expenditures, Rs58bn (Food A/C-II), Rs1.2tr (ADP) and Rs740bn as estimated surplus.
Initiatives
The government plans to introduce various initiatives, including continuation of laptop scheme for which over Rs15bn have been allocated.
The major initiatives to be launched in FY 2025-26 in various sectors include Rs101bn in education sector, over Rs72bn for health sector, Rs44.2bn for Social Welfare & PESSI, Rs4.8bn for irrigation, Rs84.5bn for transport and roads, over Rs43bn for agriculture, Rs13bn for forest; wildlife & fisheries and over Rs12bn for energy.
“In 2025-26 FY, Rs15bn will be provided as scholarships to deserving students under the Honhaar Scholarship Programme. Similarly, Rs15bn have been allocated for provision of laptops to the eligible students under CM Punjab laptop scheme during FY 2024-25,” the minister explained.
Talking about the surplus budget amounting to Rs740bn, the minister said: “To maintain the financial discipline under the agreement between the IMF and the federal government, Rs740bn EPS (estimated provincial surplus) has also been included in the budget. However, the provincial surplus’ implementation is subject to the achieving the federal revenue target by the FBR.”
During FY 2025-26, the government plans to continue the “Apni Chat Apna Ghar Programme” under which it has provided houses to 50,000 families by providing Rs48bn interest-free loans payable in 15 years. For next fiscal year, the government has proposed to earmark Rs150bn for this scheme in a bid to provide loans to 50,000 more families for construction of houses.
Another scheme titled “Apni Zameen Apna Ghar” is also under consideration to be launched in the FY 2025-26 to provide plots to deserving people free of cost in 19 districts through balloting.
The government has also increased budget for the solid waste management under Suthra Punjab Programme from Rs120bn to Rs150bn while Rs10bn have been earmarked for the parks and horticulture authorities and ex­­­pansion of water and sa­­nitation agencies to more districts.
Lahore, like the last year, would remain on priority as it would have Rs85bn for several development schemes under Lahore Development Pro­gramme. Following the LDP model, a Rs25bn special programme namely CM Punjab Development Programme has been proposed to be initiated in other cities.

In a written order, ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill noted that the prosecution’s case heavily relied on digital evidence, which will be presented during the trial.
The written order was issued after the judge dismissed the prosecution’s plea for more time to conduct forensic tests on Mr Khan.
The judge remarked that Mr Khan’s decision to decline these polygraph and photogrammetric (fac­ial and voice analysis) tests appeared to be a deliberate tactic to shield himself from the implications of the prosecution’s evidence.
The accused will likely challenge the digital evidence during the trial by simply saying it was not analysed or verified through forensic means.
“Ultimately, this refusal of the accused may go against him,” the judge remarked.
The police had visited Adiala Jail twice to conduct tests on Mr Khan, but he refused.
The prosecution sought more time from the court, but it was denied.
The order stated that in normal cases, an investigating officer (IO) has the custody of the accused during the period of physical remand and investigation.
In that scenario, the accused has no chance to refuse these tests or participate in the investigation. Calling Mr Khan’s “unique”, the judge said he was not in the IO’s custody but confined in another case at the Adiala Jail.
He noted Mr Khan not only refused in writing to cooperate with the investigation, but he also did not meet with IO who had gone to jail to conduct the tests.
“So in this scenario this court is unable to understand how the investigation could be finalised?”
The judge concluded that these tests couldn’t be conducted without physical custody of the accused, the judge noted, and dismissed the prosecution’s request for more time.
However, he directed the IO to adopt all other legal processes to conclude the investigation.

CAIRO: Israeli fire killed at least 40 people, half of them near an aid distribution site operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Monday, the territory’s health ministry said, as UN officials denounced Israeli-backed aid delivery methods.
Medics said at least 20 people were killed and 200 others wounded near an aid distribution site in Rafah, the latest in daily mass shootings that have killed hundreds of Palestinians trying to reach food since Israel imposed a new distribution system after partly lifting a near three-month total blockade.
Israel has put responsibility for distributing much of the aid it allows into Gaza into the hands of a new US-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which operates three sites in areas guarded by Israeli troops.
The United Nations has rejected the plan, saying GHF distribution is inadequate, dangerous and violates humanitarian impartiality principles.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about Monday’s reports of shootings. In previous incidents it has occasionally acknowledged troops opening fire near aid sites, while blaming fighters for provoking the violence.
Relatives arrived at Nasser Hospital to mourn the dead. Women and children wept beside bodies wrapped in white shrouds.
“We went there thinking we would get aid to feed our children, but it turned out to be a trap, a killing. I advise everyone: don’t go there,” said Ahmed Fayad, one of those who tried to reach aid on Monday.
‘Lethal distribution system’
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Palestinian refugees’ agency UNRWA, said in a post on X: “Scores of people have been killed & injured in the past days, including of starving people trying to get some food from a lethal distribution system.”
 






Before the new system was set up, aid had been distributed to Gaza’s 2.3 million residents mainly by UN agencies such as UNRWA, which employ thousands of staff inside Gaza and operate hundreds of sites across the breadth of the enclave.
Israel says it has had to crack down on distribution because Hamas fighters were diverting food aid. The fighters deny this and say Israel is using hunger as a weapon.
Lazzarini said Israel had not lifted restrictions on UN agencies including UNRWA bringing in aid, despite an abundance of assistance ready to be moved into the enclave.
On Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military aid coordination agency, said that this week it had facilitated the entry of 292 trucks with humanitarian aid from the United Nations and the international community, including food and flour, into Gaza.
It said the Israeli military would continue to permit the entry of humanitarian aid while ensuring it did not reach Hamas.
Before Monday’s incident, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said that at least 300 people had so far been killed, and more than 2,600 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations.
In Geneva, Volker Turk, UN rights chief, told the UN Human Rights Council on Monday that Israel had “weaponised” food in Gaza. He repeated a call for investigations into deadly attacks near the GHF distribution sites.
“Israel’s means and methods of warfare are inflicting horrifying, unconscionable suffering on Palestinians in Gaza,” said Turk.
“Disturbing, dehumanising rhetoric from senior Israeli government officials is reminiscent of the gravest of crimes,” he added.
On Sunday, at least five people were killed as thousands of Palestinians approached two GHF distribution sites in the central and southern the enclave.
The GHF said in a statement that it resumed food deliveries on Sunday, distributing more than two million meals from its three distribution sites without incident.
Israel’s military campaign since October 7, 2023 has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip. Most of the population is displaced, and widespread malnutrition is a significant concern.

• SIPRI data says Pakistan continues development of new delivery systems, accumulation of fissile material
ISLAMABAD: India is adding to its nuclear stockpile, while Pakistan continues the development of new delivery systems, according to an annual report by a Swedish armament watchdog.
The arms race in South Asia is a microcosm of the “dangerous new nuclear arms race” that is emerging across the globe, as nearly all nuclear-armed states continued to modernise their arsenals in 2024, the Stockholm International  Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said.
In its annual yearbook, SIPRI warned that the nine nuclear powers — the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — are not only upgrading existing stockpiles, but also developing new nuclear weapons, amid the steady erosion of international arms control agreements.
The report highlights the continuing deterioration of global security, exacerbated by wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
“It is critical to remember that nuclear weapons do not guarantee security,” said Matt Korda, an Associate Senior Researcher with SIPRI’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Programme.
“As the recent flare-up of hostilities in India and Pakistan amply demonstrated, nuclear weapons do not prevent conflict. They also come with immense risks of escalation and catastrophic miscalculation — particularly when disinformation is rife — and may end up making a country’s population less safe, not more.”
India-Pakistan tensions
The yearbook notes that tensions between India and Pakistan briefly spilled over into armed conflict in early 2025. Both nations continued to develop new types of nuclear delivery systems in 2024.
India is believed to have slightly expanded its arsenal, increasing its stored warheads from 172 in 2024 to 180 in 2025.
Pakistan’s stockpile of 170 stored warheads remained unchanged, but the report notes its continued development of new delivery systems and accumulation of fissile material suggest its arsenal might expand over the coming decade.
 
 

India has been developing new “canisterised” missiles, which allow warheads to be transported while mated to the missile. This, along with sea-based patrols, suggests a strategic shift toward keeping some nuclear weapons deployed with their launchers during peacetime.
“These weapons are assigned to a maturing nuclear triad of aircraft, land-based missiles and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines”, the report said.
Both India and Pakistan are pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles.
While Pakistan remains the focus of India’s nuclear deterrent, the report states that India appears to be placing growing emphasis on longer-range weapons capable of reaching targets throughout China.
 
 

Big powers
Of the total global inventory of about 12,241 warheads in January 2025, about 9,614 were in military stockpiles for potential use.
An estimated 3,912 of those were deployed with missiles and aircraft, with around 2,100 kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles, all but a few belonging to Russia or the U.S.
According to the report, China’s nuclear arsenal has grown faster than that of any other country, reaching an estimated 600 warheads by early 2025.
Beijing has advanced work on about 350 new missile silos, and the report suggests China could have as many intercontinental ballistic missiles as either Russia or the US by the turn of the decade.
Russia and the US, together, still possess around 90 per cent of all nuclear weapons in the world. While their military stockpiles remained stable in 2024, both are implementing extensive modernisation programs.
The report warns of a likely increase in the number of warheads deployed on strategic missiles after the bilateral New START treaty expires in February 2026, unless a new agreement is reached.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday formed a committee to reexamine the matter and recommend stringent safeguards to prevent the misuse of powers by tax officers.
FBR Chairman Mah­mood Langrial told Dawn that the provisions could be revised to mandate the permission of multiple senior officers before any arrest.
In the Finance Bill introduced last week, the government proposed amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, to allow FBR officers to investigate tax fraud and make arrests.
As per the proposed amendments, assistant or deputy commissioners could arrest tax defaulters after seeking approval from the commissioner.
The proposed Section 37AA reads: “The officer of Inland Revenue, during the investigation, having reason to believe on the basis of evidence that actions of any person may have caused or attempted to cause tax fraud or any other offence warranting prosecution under this Act, may cause arrest of such person with prior approval of the Commissioner.”
The provision made the business community apprehensive about the potential abuse of power.
Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik, in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, said the powers were “draconian” and “will most likely be misused to harass” taxpayers.
But FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial told Dawn that the authority to arrest would remain intact.
However, the committee headed by the finance minister will examine various options to introduce additional safeguards to prevent potential misuse of the power.
According to Mr Langrial, existing laws empower low-ranking officers to lodge FIRs against tax defaulters.
He noted that the proposed amendments mandate prior approval from the income tax commissioner before an arrest.
Further safeguards be­ing considered include a provision for approval from three senior officers inst­ead of just the commissioner.
According to the FBR chairman, this provision would significantly reduce the potential for misuse of powers. Moreover, the officers would be empowered to arrest individuals for a limited set of violations and not for every offence of fraud, Mr Langrial explained.
He added the powers could be exercised in three circumstances: when a tax defaulter fails to appear before authorities thrice, when there is a risk of evidence being tampered with, or when there is a possibility that the suspect may flee the country.
PM’s directives
An official announcement issued by the Prime Minister Secretariat said PM Shehbaz formed the committee following a meeting to review the FBR’s performance.
According to the state-run news agency, APP, the prime minister took notice of media reports and warned the proposed powers must not be used to harass the business community or taxpayers.
Mr Langrial informed the prime minister that the authority to arrest tax defaulters has been embedded in taxation law since the 1990s.
However, in light of rec­ent rulings by superior courts, amendments are being introduced to further streamline the process.
The prime minister ordered officials to devise an effective external review system regarding the arrest matter and arrests should only be made in cases where the quantum of fraud was “exceptionally high”.
The premier said provisions for protection against misuse of these laws should be made part of the Finance Act. He called for consultations with all coalition parties on this issue.
NA committee
On Monday, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue also raised alarm over the proposed amendments.
The meeting, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, was also attended by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, who assured members that the matter would be reviewed in line with the prime minister’s directives.
The finance minister informed the committee that Senator Farooq H. Naik had proposed amendments aimed at safeguarding against the misuse of powers. He described Mr Naik’s suggestions as highly appropriate.
The prime minister has been briefed on the matter and the committee will be updated on any progress in this matter, Mr Aurangzeb said.
He assured the members that appropriate changes would be introduced following due consultation.

• Massive chunk of money spent on debt servicing and related payments
ISLAMABAD: At least 39 government departments – notably the power and defence divisions – spent more money than they were allocated for the outgoing fiscal year, while around three dozen departments’ funds remained ‘under-utilised’ for various reasons.
Much like last year, the power and defence sectors remained among the biggest spenders, as the former overshot its allocations by Rs129.5bn and the latter by over Rs61bn, under multiple heads.
The defence ministry’s Defence Services Division overspent by nearly Rs59.5bn and the Defence Division spent Rs1.8bn more than the amount set aside for it in the previous budget.
According to budget documents, specifically the voluminous ‘Details of Demands for Grants and Appropriations 2025-26 (Current Expenditure)’ the Defence Division exceeded its allocation under the ‘operating expenses’ and ‘physical assets’ heads. The revised estimate for the ‘physical assets’ rose from Rs730 million to Rs2.5bn.
The Power Division, meanwhile, spent Rs159bn under the ‘investments’ head, even though the budget had not allocated any amount for this purpose. In addition, its operational spending also doubled from Rs215m to Rs466m.
Similarly, the National Health Services division (the secretariat of the federal health ministry) doubled its expenditure in the outgoing year, spending Rs51.9bn against a sanctioned amount of Rs27.8bn – an overrun of over Rs24bn.
One of the main reasons for overshooting its allocated amount were ‘operating expenses’ that rose from Rs13.3bn to Rs35.8bn.
Even though it has failed to meet the revenue target set in the budget, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) spent Rs6.57bn more than allocated. Similarly, Pakistan Post also exceeded its allocation by Rs6bn.
Debt servicing
Though the government managed to save Rs1.77 trillion in terms of foreign debt payments, payments under the head of domestic debt rose by almost Rs2.6tr. Around Rs829bn was also saved in interest payments for domestic debt.
In total, the government spent Rs33.85tr to pay off foreign and domestic debts, and their interest, against an allocation of Rs33.84tr, overrunning by a little over Rs4bn. The government had allocated Rs4.98tr for foreign loans, but spent only Rs3.2tr, saving Rs1.7tr under this head. For debt servicing of foreign loans, it spent Rs1tr.
Similarly, Rs29.5bn was paid under the head of short-term foreign credit payment. On the domestic front, the government exceeded its allocation and paid Rs2.6tr more than the sanctioned amount of Rs19tr to pay off domestic lenders. However, Rs829bn was saved on domestic debt servicing, probably on account of a substantial cut in the policy rate.
Under-utilisation of funds
Besides foreign debt payments, where a substantial chunk of money was saved, the Finance Division ‘saved’ Rs216bn under the category of ‘Grants, Subsidies, and Miscellaneous’. The economic affairs ministry also did not spend Rs7.7bn allocated under the ‘miscellaneous’ head.
This inability to spend also affected welfare initiatives, such as poverty alleviation and the housing sector. The Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division failed to spend over Rs1.64bn from its allocated amount, despite poverty levels rising as the cost of living grew.
The housing sector did not fare much better: the Naya Pakistan Housing Authority left Rs1.1bn untouched, while the Housing and Works Division of the housing ministry could not spend Rs1bn, even though there is a housing crisis in the federal capital.
In total, the amount saved by the government, including the amount saved on foreign debt payment, was approximately Rs2tr, whereas the departments that exceeded their allocations overspent about Rs2.85tr, including the additional Rs2.6tr used to pay off domestic debt.
Cover for ‘overspending’
It is important to note that these numbers do not include the development expenditure of these departments, and the data is based on information available in the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues’ (AGPR) system as of May 16, 2025.
For departments who have overspent, demands for grants will be tabled before the National Assembly under Article 82 for approval during the budget approvals process.
Article 82(1) refers to expenditure, which is charged upon the Federal Consolidated Fund and may be discussed but not put to a vote. All other grants will be decided by the house under Article 82(2).

Nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while civilians were among over 300 wounded in Iran as a result of Israeli strikes on military sites and private residences on June 13. Iran subsequently launched its own retaliation with ballistic missiles fired at Israel and the two countries continued to exchange a volley over the weekend.
Posts from multiple Indian and others users on social media platforms and Indian media outlets since Sunday shared a video of Iranian National Security Council member Mohsen Rezaei, claiming that he said Pakistan told Iran that if Israel drops a nuclear bomb on Tehran, Pakistan would retaliate in kind amid current tensions. However, fact-checking platform iVerify Pakistan concluded that the video was doctored, and the Iranian official had not made any such statement.
Addressing the matter during today’s Senate session, FM Dar said, “There is a video on social media where an Iranian general was quoted as saying: ‘If Israel nuke attacks Iran, then Pakistan will attack [Israel] with nuclear weapons.’”
“This is irresponsible and false news,” he said, adding that the claims had become viral on the internet, and that even UK news outlet Daily Mail picked it up.
He said, “From our side, there has been no such statement. It was fabricated.”
 
 

He also addressed an alleged video of US President Donald Trump allegedly urging Pakistan to stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. Similarly, he said that a widely circulated interview of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, purported to be recent, was in fact from 2011. Such deceptive content is causing confusion and is being monitored closely by the Foreign Office, he told the Senate.
Dar said, “We have checked that it was an AI-generated clip and it was fake.”
He cautioned that everyone must be careful, saying, “This is not a children’s matter. This is a serious war like ours with India.”
 






Speaking on the Iran-Israel conflict, the foreign minister said, “We wanted the Iran-US [nuclear] talks to be successful. I must appreciate the foreign minister of Oman and Iran, who kept me in the loop throughout the process of the four rounds of talks in Muscat and Rome.”
Dar said that the Senate’s statement on the conflict was widely circulated around the world, stating, “[The] House of Federation took a strong stance. We fulfilled our responsibility with clarity.”
He further said that Pakistan facilitated the UN Security Council meeting within 24 hours of the attacks. He added that the Iranian ambassador at the meeting acknowledged four countries by name, including Pakistan.
Dar also said that he spoke to the Iranian foreign minister on the night of June 13/14, quoting him as saying, “We [Iran] are ready for diplomatic dialogue if Israel does not attack again.”
“We have conveyed the matter through different channels that Iran is ready if the other side can stop,” he added.
He highlighted some of the consequences for Pakistani students and zaireen (pilgrims) in Iran.
“On June 13, the crisis management unit of the foreign ministry was activated.
“We have so far evacuated 251 students. By tonight, they will reach Quetta. There are over 500 zaireen there. Three hundred of them travelled by air to go there while 209 went there by road,” he said, adding that Pakistan was in contact with other countries as well.
“Iran approached us on June 14 to help bring back 20,000 Haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. We gave a positive response to this. Pakistan will give them a visa on arrival, and welcome them at Karachi airport … So we are fulfilling our responsibility.”
Dar also spoke on Pakistan’s nuclear programme, saying that Pakistan’s policy had not changed since 1998.
“Even at that time, we said that it is Pakistan’s stated policy. It is for the purpose of self-defence. It is our deterrence. It was important for parity, peace and security in this region,” he said, adding that India’s “spectacle of having hegemony and supremacy over us [Pakistan]” was buried on May 10, following the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
Dar further said, “We are not signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since 1998, our condition has been that we will sign it only when India does. So neither India nor Pakistan have signed it. Neither has Israel. But it is a serious crime to attack nuclear installations, whether you are a member or not.
“It is a major violation of international law due to the unimaginable consequences of attacking nuclear facilities.
The foreign minister reiterated that Pakistan’s “nuclear power is for our security and stability as well as regional stability.
“Israel dare not look at Pakistan. Pakistan has enough power to respond to any malafide [action]. Our armed forces are fully alert,” he added.
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the global community to be “wary and apprehensive” of Israel’s nuclear arsenal, amidst Tel Aviv’s aggression against its neighbours in the region.
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93, which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
After months of attacking Gaza — flattening homes, targeting hospitals and aid workers, and starving a besieged population — Israel has now expanded its assault across borders, launching wide-scale air strikes against Iran last week. Israeli officials have claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
 






“(The) world should be wary and apprehensive about Israel’s nuclear prowess, a country not bound by any international nuclear discipline, nor signatory to NPT or any other binding arrangement,” he said in a post on X.
“We do not pursue hegemonic policies against our neighbours, which are being amply demonstrated by Israel these days,” Asif continued, referring to Israel’s aggression in the region,.
The defence minister added that Pakistan was a signatory to all international nuclear disciplines.
“Our nuclear capability is for the benefit of our people and defence of our country against the hostile designs of our enemies,” Asif said.
Asif said that the Western world must worry about conflicts being generated by Israel, adding that it would engulf the whole region and beyond.
“Their patronage of Israel, a rogue state, can have catastrophic consequences,” Asif warned.
Israel was able to produce nuclear weapons by the end of the 1960s. It is estimated that there are about 90 plutonium-based nuclear warheads in this country and that Israel has produced enough plutonium for 100-200 weapons.
Tel Aviv is not a party to the NPT — a 1970 accord aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting disarmament, and ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
 
 

“Although Israel refrains from informing the international community about whether it possesses nuclear weapons, it is the only country in the Middle East that has not accepted the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which allows the IAEA to inspect all kinds of civilian and military nuclear facilities and to carry out verification activities for the work carried out,” Heinz Gartner, a professor from the University of the Vienna told Anadolu Agency.
Pakistan is also not a signatory to the NPT but frequently reiterates its commitment to nuclear safety and non-proliferation principles through other international frameworks.</p><small>2025-06-17 00:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16234820d05453a.jpg?r=000705' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917514/in-pictures-death-destruction-debris-in-iran-and-israel-amid-war' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Death, destruction, debris in Iran and Israel amid war</strong></a><br><p>Israel and Iran have been trading missile strikes since the former launched an air offensive on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon.

West Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tariq Illahi Mastoi told Dawn.com that “two suspects on a motorcycle resorted to an indiscriminate firing on a restaurant,” killing a rickshaw driver and injuring five others.
He added that the police registered a first information report (FIR) under Sections 34 (common intention), 302 (intentional murder), 324  (attempted murder), 384 (punishment for extortion) and 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown suspects and launched an investigation.
According to the FIR, the complainant, the restaurant operator, said that he had received a phone call on the restaurant’s cell number on May 30 during which the caller demanded extortion, adding that he had informed the police but did not lodge an FIR.
He said that two armed suspects on a bike resorted to firing near the restaurant today, killing one passerby and injuring five others.
After 20 minutes of the incident, the complainant said he received the cell phone call at the restaurant and the caller claimed that they had attacked the restaurant. The complainant added that the caller also threatened him with “dire consequences if the Rs3 million extortion was not paid.”
The dead body and the injured were moved to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the condition of the injured people was out of danger.
Surjani Station House Officer Mohammed Ali Shah said that the police had some clues about the identity of the attackers, adding they were working on arresting them.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16233358c689d92.jpg?r=233623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917518/harvard-wins-extension-of-court-order-blocking-trumps-international-student-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Harvard wins extension of court order blocking Trump’s international student ban</strong></a><br><p>A federal judge said on Monday that she would issue a brief extension of an order temporarily blocking United States President Donald Trump’s plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the US to study at Harvard University while she decides whether to issue a longer-term injunction.
US District Judge Allison Burroughs, at the end of a hearing in Boston in Harvard’s legal challenge to the restrictions, extended to June 23 a temporary restraining order that had been set to expire on Thursday. She said she wanted to give herself more time to prepare a ruling.
“We’ll kick out an opinion as soon as we can,” she said.
Ian Gershengorn, a lawyer for Harvard, told her that an injunction was necessary to ensure Trump’s administration could not implement his latest bid to curtail the school’s ability to host international students.
The judge scheduled the hearing after issuing a temporary restraining order on June 6, preventing the administration from implementing a proclamation that Trump had signed a day earlier. A preliminary injunction would provide longer-term relief to Harvard.
Gershengorn argued that Trump signed the proclamation to retaliate against Harvard in violation of its free speech rights under the US Constitution’s First Amendment for refusing to accede to his administration’s demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.
“The proclamation is a plain violation of the First Amendment,” Gershengorn said.
Almost 6,800 international students attended Harvard in its most recent school year, making up about 27 per cent of the student population of the prestigious school located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. China and India are among the top countries of origin for these students.
The Trump administration has launched a multifront attack on the oldest and wealthiest US university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.
Harvard has filed two separate lawsuits before Burroughs seeking to unfreeze $2.5 billion in funding and to prevent Trump’s administration from blocking the ability of international students to attend the university.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on May 22 announced that her department was immediately revoking Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Programme certification, the governmental mechanism that allows it to enrol foreign students.
Her action was almost immediately blocked by Burroughs. While the Department of Homeland Security has since shifted to challenging Harvard’s certification through a lengthier administrative process, Burroughs at a May 29 hearing said she planned to issue a “broad” injunction to maintain the status quo.
A week later, though, Trump signed his proclamation, which cited national security concerns to contend that Harvard is “no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programmes”.
The proclamation suspended the entry of foreign nationals to study at Harvard or participate in exchange visitor programmes for an initial period of six months and directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether to revoke visas of international students already enrolled at Harvard.
Harvard has asked Burroughs, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, to block Trump’s directive.
In court papers, the US Justice Department urged Burroughs not to lump Trump’s proclamation in with the judge’s consideration of Noem’s actions, as it did not ban existing students and Trump relied on different legal authority for his order.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16225854cfc0cb1.jpg?r=225947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917511/618-more-pakistanis-repatriated-from-iran-iraq-amid-middle-east-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>618 more Pakistanis repatriated from Iran, Iraq amid Middle East crisis</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday repatriated another 618 nationals from both Iran and Iraq amid Tehran’s ongoing conflict with Israel, according to the Foreign Office (FO) and a district official in Balochistan.
A day ago, the government was able to repatriate 450 zaireen (pilgrims) from Iran, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq. Arrangements were made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.
The move came after Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran from building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Around 350 Pakistani pilgrims stranded in Iran returned to their homeland on Monday after crossing the border at Taftan, according to a district official in Balochistan.
Chagai Deputy Commissioner Attaul Muneem told Dawn.com that 350 Pakistanis, including 45 students and 305 pilgrims, crossed the border and that arrangements have been made to house them at Pakistan House in Taftan.
“The pilgrims and students who have arrived are being sent to Quetta,” he added.
In a statement from his office, Muneem said that Pakistanis stranded in Iran are attempting to cross the land border due to the conflict.
“The district administration is arranging medical care, food, accommodation and travel facilities in Taftan so that Pakistanis returning from Iran do not face any difficulties,” the DC was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, the FO successfully repatriated 268 Pakistani zaireen through two special flights from the Iraqi city of Basra to Karachi and Islamabad, according to a statement.
The ministry said it is working closely with Iraqi Airways and Iraqi authorities to repatriate the zaireen and ensure their “safe and timely return”.
“All Pakistani zaireen currently in Iraq are advised to remain in close contact with the Pakistan Embassy in Baghdad, designated mandoobs (representatives) and their respective airlines for timely updates regarding their travel arrangements,” the statement read.
The FO said that Iraqi Airways is operating daily flights on the Basra–Dubai route, which the zaireen used to return to Pakistan.
“Those interested in travelling via this route are encouraged to contact the nearest Iraqi Airways office for booking and assistance,” the statement read.
“All zaireen are further advised to remain prepared for travel at short notice,” the FO said, adding that it is monitoring the situation closely and “remains fully committed to facilitating the safe and orderly return of all Pakistani zaireen”.
On the day of the Israeli strikes, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani zaireen in Iran following Israel’s deadly strikes.
In light of the PM’s directives, a Crisis Management Cell was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.
The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been instructed to remain vigilant and actively assist the pilgrims. Earlier today, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy’s hotline number: (0098)-2166941388.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16221503376cd2c.jpg?r=222540' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917510/peshawar-court-sentences-serial-killer-rapist-to-death-life-imprisonment-police' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar court sentences ‘serial killer, rapist’ to death, life imprisonment: police</strong></a><br><p>A Peshawar child protection court on Monday sentenced a suspect to death and life imprisonment over charges of rape and serial killing carried out in July 2022.
In 2022, police had arrested a man in Peshawar on charges of sexually assaulting three minor girls and killing two of them.
Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general of police (IG) Moazzam Jah Ansari had told reporters that the 20-year-old embroiderer had confessed to sexual assaults and murders. The suspect was declared a serial killer by the police, who also said that he sexually assaulted the girls before killing them and dumping the bodies.
In a press release today, KP police said that the province’s “first serial killer and rapist was sentenced to death and life imprisonment through an excellent police investigation”.
“The suspect — involved in the July 2022 rape and serial killing cases — was sentenced to death five times by the child protection court,” the statement added.
 
 

KP IG Zulfiqar Hameed congratulated the joint investigation and operations team for conducting an excellent and coordinated investigation, preparing a case based on digital, forensic and other evidence and getting the accused convicted by the court, the statement said.
He also announced cash prizes and commendation certificates to the team, it added.
The statement detailed the suspect’s crimes and said that the “tragic incidents of rape and murder of three innocent girls” in 2022, had created fear and panic in the area, adding the case had remained unsolved for the police.
Former senior superintendent of police (SSP) Operations Kashif Aftab Abbasi and SSP Investigation Shahzada Kokab Farooq had formed special operations and investigation teams comprising police, scientific experts and forensic experts, it said.
The statement added that the team had examined all aspects of the cases, including call data records, geo-fencing, forensics, and digital material such as 3,000 minutes of camera recordings, using traditional and non-traditional methods.
The team arrested the suspect based on the data, the statement said, adding that the suspect’s semen sample matched with the samples found on the bodies of the victims, revealing that he was the “heinous person who committed the atrocities”.
“The police presented the accused in court after building a strong case containing all the evidence, where the suspect confessed to his heinous crime before the court,” it said, adding that the case was prosecuted by Deputy Public Prosecutor Arif Bilal.
“Police investigation plays a key role in delivering justice through the courts. In the face of indelible evidence, no accused can escape punishment,” IG Hameed was quoted as saying in the statement.
This case was a testament to the investigative skills of the officers of the KP Police, he added.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Earlier this month, a prayer leader was booked for allegedly sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy inside a mosque in KP’s Charsadda district.</p><small>2025-06-16 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16220329c98a396.jpg?r=220343' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917515/un-slashes-global-aid-plan-over-deepest-funding-cuts-ever' target='_blank'><strong>UN slashes global aid plan over ‘deepest funding cuts ever’</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations said on Monday that it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the “deepest funding cuts ever” — leaving tens of millions of people facing dire straits.
The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was seeking $29 billion in funding for 2025 compared to the $44bn originally requested in December, in a “hyper-prioritised” appeal.
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said later on Monday that it would have to terminate 3,500 jobs, cutting 30 per cent of its workforce costs, as aid funding evaporates.
Since US President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the United States — the world’s top donor — has heavily slashed foreign aid, causing havoc in the humanitarian sector across the globe.
Drastic US funding cuts have had dramatic consequences for emergency aid, vaccination campaigns and the distribution of drugs to fight AIDS.
Other major donor countries have also cut back their contributions in the face of an uncertain economic outlook.
“Brutal funding cuts leave us with brutal choices,” OCHA chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement.
“All we ask is one per cent of what you chose to spend last year on war.”
‘Cruel’, ‘heartbreaking’
In late April, while visiting a hospital in Kandahar in Afghanistan, Fletcher warned: “The impact of aid cuts is that millions die.”
Almost halfway through 2025, the UN has received only $5.6bn out of the $44bn originally sought for this year — a mere 13pc.
In total, the original plan covered more than 70 countries and aimed to assist nearly 190 million vulnerable people.
Even so, that plan acknowledged that there were 115 million people the UN would not be able to reach.
“We have been forced into a triage of human survival,” Fletcher said on Monday.
The mathematics “is cruel, and the consequences are heartbreaking”.
“Too many people will not get the support they need, but we will save as many lives as we can with the resources we are given,” he said.
Aid will now be directed so that it can “reach the people and places facing the most urgent needs”, with those in “extreme or catastrophic conditions” as the starting point, said Fletcher.
‘Red alert’
Fletcher’s call came as the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) issued a joint early warning report identifying worsening hunger in 13 hotspots.
Sudan, the Palestinian territories, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali have communities “already facing famine, at risk of famine or confronted with catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity”, said the report.
“The devastating crises are being exacerbated by growing access constraints and critical funding shortfalls,” it said.
Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria are now considered of very high concern and requiring urgent attention to save lives, it added, with Burkina Faso, Chad, Somalia and Syria the other hotspots.
“This report is a red alert,” said WFP chief Cindy McCain. “Without funding and access, we cannot save lives. Urgent, sustained investment in food assistance and recovery support is crucial as the window to avert yet more devastating hunger is closing fast.”
Refugee agency slashes jobs
Washington previously made up more than 40pc of the UNHCR refugee agency’s budget — $2bn per year, the agency’s chief Filippo Grandi told the UN Security Council in April.
“In light of difficult financial realities, UNHCR is compelled to reduce the overall scale of its operations,” Grandi said in Monday’s statement.
UNHCR estimates that it will end 2025 with available funding at about the same level as a decade ago — despite the number of people forced to flee their homes having nearly doubled over the same period to more than 122 million.
“In total, approximately 3,500 staff positions will be discontinued,” the statement said, while hundreds of temporary workers have gone already.
“Overall, UNHCR estimates a global reduction in staffing costs of around 30pc,” the agency said.</p><small>2025-06-16 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1616442706b98e5.png?r=164516' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917497/blast-kills-2-injures-11-in-balochistans-barkhan' target='_blank'><strong>Blast kills 2, injures 11 in Balochistan’s Barkhan</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and 11 others injured on Monday when a bomb planted in a motorcycle exploded in Balochistan’s Barkhan district, officials said.
Barkhan Deputy Commissioner Abdullah Khosa told Dawn.com, “The explosive material was planted in a motorcycle parked in the main market of Rakhni, Barkhan district. It resulted in the death of two people and injured 11 others.”
Four of the injured were in critical condition and were immediately taken to a hospital Dera Ghazi Khan for treatment, Khosa said.
He added that nearby shops, buildings, and one car were also damaged by the blast.
“An emergency has been imposed in all hospitals across Barkhan following the blast, while police, Levies and Frontier Corps (FC) personnel reached the site of the incident and began collecting evidence,” he said, adding that law enforcement agencies have also cordoned off the area and begun a search for the suspects
A similar incident occurred in March when four people were killed and five others were injured when an improvised explosive device (IED) attached to a motorbike went off in a market in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district.
Police said the explosive was attached to a motorcycle and detonated remotely after the bike was parked beside a car.
Meanwhile, the DC visited the injured in Rakhni hospital and chaired an emergency meeting with doctors and medical staff, according to a statement from his office.
Khosa also inspected the Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies personnel and received a briefing. He instructed the relevant agencies to further tighten security and complete the investigation promptly.</p><small>2025-06-16 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/161530343615729.png?r=153419' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917484/ppps-senator-marri-laments-development-projects-not-being-given-to-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Senator Marri laments development projects not being given to Sindh</strong></a><br><p>After the unveiling of Sindh’s budget last week was met with protests by opposition lawmakers, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri on Monday lamented that Sindh was “being treated like a colony of the federation”.
Last week, Sindh Chief Minister Shah Murad had also warned that the PPP — a coalition partner of the PML-N-led federal government —  would not support the passage of the federal budget in parliament if Islamabad continued to manage development schemes in Sindh instead of transferring them to the provincial government.
“The federal government has wronged us. They have dissolved the Public Works Department (PWD), which was responsible for overseeing development projects across provinces,” Murad had said, adding that while the other three provinces received funding for development projects accompanied by their budgets, Sindh was completely overlooked.
Senator Marri, chairing a meeting of the Senate Planning and Development Committee today, questioned why Sindh was “being treated like a colony of the federation,” as the committee protested the exclusion of PWD from development projects.
Her comments came after Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said during the last meeting of the committee that “federal execution agencies for each project decide who they are more comfortable working with — federal government or provincial. And we have distributed projects based on only that.”
“It was decided that PWD projects would be given to Sindh,” Marri said. “The same was decided in the National Economic Council, that PWD projects will be given to provinces.”
“Now, these projects are being given to every province except Sindh,” Marri lamented, adding that the Sindh government was “very concerned about this move from the federation”.
Senator Marri highlighted that Sindh was being treated unfairly despite being promised its rights.
“All provinces should be treated equally and be given control of projects,” she added.</p><small>2025-06-16 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1620500055f04cd.png?r=205344' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917513/pakistan-beat-japan-3-2-in-fih-hockey-nations-cup-in-kuala-lumpur' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan beat Japan 3-2 in FIH Hockey Nations Cup in Kuala Lumpur</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan beat Japan 3-2 in their second match of the FIH Hockey Nations Cup at Kuala Lumpur’s National Stadium on Monday.

Less than a minute later, Japan’s Kazumasa Matsumoto scored to level the field 1-1. Koji Yamasaki scored Japan’s second goal of the match within two minutes, bringing the score to 2-1.
The second quarter saw the score remain steady, but vice-captain Waheed Ashraf Rana scored for Pakistan in the third quarter to tie the score at 2-2 once more.
Sufyan Khan scored a decisive goal in the final quarter to take the score to 3-2 and give the Green Shirts their first win of the eight-team tournament.
 






A day earlier, Pakistan and Malaysia played out a pulsating 3-3 draw in their opening fixture of the Nations Cup, with the Green Shirts relinquishing a lead late in the match.
Pakistan will now face New Zealand on Wednesday, June 18 at 3pm PKT.
The 20-member national squad was announced earlier this month, with Imad Butt being appointed captain and Waheed as vice captain.

Hasina, 77, fled Dhaka by helicopter to India in August 2024 at the culmination of a student-led mass uprising. She has defied an extradition order to return to Bangladesh.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a crackdown in a failed bid to cling to power, according to the United Nations.
Hasina and former senior figures connected to her ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League, are being prosecuted in
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).
Prosecutors have filed five charges against Hasina, including abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder — charges that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.
“The court directed the prosecution team to issue a notice as soon as possible summoning them to appear before the court,” chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said on Monday.
The trial will resume on June 24 without her if she fails to return.
The prosecution argues that Hasina ordered security forces, through directives from the interior ministry and police, to crush the protests.
Hasina is on trial with two other officials.
One of them, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who faces similar charges, is also a fugitive.
The second, ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, is in custody and was in court on Monday.
The prosecution of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power.
The interim government has said it will hold elections in April 2026, although some parties are pushing for an earlier vote.</p><small>2025-06-16 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16183648b29f826.png?r=183722' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917507/icc-unveils-2025-womens-cricket-world-cup-schedule' target='_blank'><strong>ICC unveils 2025 Womens cricket World Cup schedule</strong></a><br><p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday announced the schedule for the Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 set to be held in India and Sri Lanka in September.
Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo when India hosts this year’s tournament. Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
Hosts India will get the tournament underway against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru on September 30 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, with action starting at 3pm local time, according to the schedule.
 






Defending champions Australia then get their campaign up and running against neighbours New Zealand at Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore on October 1, while Pakistan will face Bangladesh a day later in Colombo.
The highly anticipated India-Pakistan clash is set for October 5, after which Pakistan will play Australia on the 8th, England on the 15th, New Zealand on the 18th, South Africa on the 21st and Sri Lanka on the 24th.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.
ICC Chairman Jay Shah said: “The confirmation of the schedule only builds further excitement and anticipation” for the world cup.
“With the eight best teams in the women’s game descending on India, alongside incredible venues and what promises to be record-breaking crowds, we are all looking forward to an unforgettable tournament.”

“On 15-16 June 2025, five Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna-al-Khwarij, were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement.
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan
“An intelligence-based operation was conducted by the security forces in Peshawar district on the reported presence of Indian-sponsored khwarij”,
it said.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops skillfully surrounded and effectively engaged the Indian-sponsored khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored khwarij, including kharji Haris and kharji Baseer, were sent to hell.
Another IBO was conducted in North Waziristan district, the ISPR said, with security forces killing another terrorist.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were actively involved in terrorist activities.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the ISPR said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to security forces in a post on X, lauding them for carrying out the operations against Indian-sponsored terrorists.
“Security forces carried out timely operations and killed five Indian-sponsored terrorists,” he wrote. “We salute the brave personnel of the security forces. We appreciate the successful operations of the security forces against Indian-sponsored terrorists and their backers.”
Stating that every Pakistani stands against terrorism, Naqvi wrote, “With the support of the nation, we will completely wipe out Indian-sponsored terrorism.”
 






Earlier this month, 14 “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in North Waziristan, the military’s media wing said.
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-06-16 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/161817263ddb4b3.jpg?r=181751' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917504/arshad-nadeem-named-in-forbes-30-under-30-asia-list' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem named in Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list</strong></a><br><p>Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia list following his historic Olympic performance at the Paris 2024 Olympics, it emerged on Monday.
The entertainment and sports list, which was originally published last month, aims to “[spotlight] the next generation of talent — on court and the screen.”
Nadeem, 28, changed Pakistan’s sporting trajectory when he won gold and broke the Olympic record with a massive 92.97m throw in Paris — which Forbes called a “stunning show” — winning Pakistan’s first individual gold medal and the first of any colour in more than 30 years.
His Olympic feat got him more than Rs153 million in cash prize from Punjab and Sindh, in addition to several other rewards handed out by various government entities and companies.
The government also named a road in Islamabad in Nadeem’s honour, while Pakistan Post issued a commemorative stamp on Independence Day to pay tribute.
 
 

Nadeem retained his javelin supremacy when he took home gold at last month’s Asian Athletic Championships with a 86.40m throw, narrowly missing out on the meet record of 86.72m.
His triumph marked the first time Pakistan won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in more than 50 years.
Nadeem rose to prominence after he bagged gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, followed by a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest.

In a town hall held at the headquarters of the Tata Group-owned airline near New Delhi and attended by 700 staff, Chandrasekaran said the crash was the “most heartbreaking” crisis of his career, a spokesperson told Reuters.
“I’ve seen a reasonable number of crises in my career, but this is the most heartbreaking one,” he said, according to a transcript provided by a Tata Group spokesperson.
“We need to use this incident as an act of force to build a safer airline,” Chandrasekaran said.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Gatwick Airport south of London began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday, and erupted in a huge fireball as it hit buildings below.
All but one on board were declared dead in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade, and around 30 people died on the ground.
The airline and the Indian government are looking at several aspects of the crash, including the plane’s engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down.
“We need to wait for the investigation … It’s a complex machine, so a lot of redundancies, checks and balances, certifications, which have been perfected over years and years. Yet this happens, so we will figure out why it happens after the investigation,” Chandrasekaran, 62, said during the staff meeting.
He is also the chairman of the Tata Group conglomerate.
The crash poses a new challenge for both Air India, which has for years been trying to revamp its ageing fleet, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.
After taking the carrier over from the government in 2022, the Tata Group unveiled its investment plans to create a “world-class airline” after years of financial losses, persistent flight delays and poor maintenance under government ownership.
On Monday, an Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane bound for New Delhi returned to its origin of Hong Kong shortly after takeoff on Monday following a technical issue.
“It’s not easy to face criticisms,” Chandrasekaran said. “We are going to get through this. We need to show resilience.”</p><small>2025-06-16 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/16154347f79d94f.png?r=154414' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917488/sbp-maintains-11pc-interest-rate-amid-mideast-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>SBP maintains 11pc interest rate amid Mideast conflict</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate on Monday at 11 per cent, after many analysts cited inflation risks from rising global commodity prices amid Iran-Israel tensions.
The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was cut to 11pc last month.
“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent,” the SBP said in a statement.
Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict.
 
 

The MPC observed that global oil prices had “rebounded sharply, reflecting the evolving geopolitical situation in the Middle East and some ease in US-China trade tensions”.
“Taking stock of these developments and potential risks, the committee assessed that the real interest rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5–7pc,” the MPC stressed.
The escalating hostilities after Israel’s attacks on Iran on Friday had triggered a sharp spike in oil prices — a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.
Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll by Reuters expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12pc. Two forecast a 100 basis-point (bps) cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.
Inflation expected to ‘trend up and stablise’ in 5-7pc target range
On inflation, the MPC noted that the recent uptick in May to 3.5pc year-on-year was in line with its expectation, whereas core inflation declined “marginally”.
The headline inflation had hit an all-time low of 0.3pc YoY after declining for several months from around 40pc in May 2023.
 
 

The MPC said inflation was expected to “trend up and stabilise” in the target range. The SBP expects average inflation to range between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the current fiscal year, which ends this month.
“This outlook, however, remains subject to multiple risks emanating from potential supply-chain disruptions from regional geopolitical conflicts, volatility in oil and other commodity prices, and the timing and magnitude of domestic energy price adjustments,” the committee added.
It noted that economic growth was picking up gradually and was projected to gain further traction next year on the back of earlier rate cuts. However, the MPC cautioned about “some potential risks to the external sector amidst the sustained widening in the trade deficit and weak financial inflows”.
It observed that some of the proposed FY26 budgetary measures may further widen the trade deficit by increasing imports, adding that the decision to maintain the interest rate was “appropriate to sustain the macroeconomic and price stability”.
The MPC termed the “timely realisation of planned foreign inflows, achievement of the targeted fiscal consolidation and the implementation of structural reforms as essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable economic growth”.
 
 

“The decision to hold rates was not surprising given the uncertain geopolitical outlook with oil prices spiking around 15pc,” said Mustafa Pasha, executive director at Karachi-based Lakson Investments.
“Additionally, it gives the SBP time to assess the impact of the budget and upcoming gas/electricity tariff revisions on inflation and the external account.”
Noting the key developments since its last meeting in May, the MPC said the real GDP growth for FY25 was provisionally reported at 2.7pc.
“Despite a substantial widening in the trade deficit, the current account remained broadly balanced in April,” it highlighted, also mentioning the increase in the SBP foreign exchange reserves to $11.7 billion as of June 6, owing to the $1 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“Third, the revised budget estimates indicate the primary balance surplus at 2.2pc of GDP in FY25, up from 0.9pc last year,” the MPC said, adding that the government was targeting a primary surplus of 2.4pc of the GDP for next year.
The SBP decision also comes on the heels of Pakistan’s contractionary budget, in which it cut total spending by 7pc and set a GDP target of 4.2pc for fiscal year 2025-26.
The government said the $350 billion economy is stabilising under a $7bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, though analysts remain wary of external and fiscal pressures.</p><small>2025-06-16 12:20</small></div><hr>
