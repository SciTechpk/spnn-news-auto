Rescue 1122 spokesperson Jawad Afridi said the blast took place at a tube well near a house in Akhorwal village. Two people died on the spot in the explosion.
Rescue medical and disaster teams reached the scene after receiving information about the incident. The house was completely destroyed in the explosion, the rescue official said.
In another incident, an under-construction building was heavily damaged when an improvised explosive device (IED), reportedly planted by unidentified terrorists, exploded in Bannu district.
Muhammad Usama, spokesperson for Rescue 1122, Bannu told Dawn.com that the explosion occurred around at 1am today when unidentified attackers reportedly detonated an IED that severely damaged the building.
He said the targeted structure, located in the Kaki tehsil of Bannu district, belonged to the Rescue 1122 emergency services. However, no casualties were reported.
Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, confirmed the incident and said that a police team responded promptly and launched an investigation.
He said the perpetrators fled the scene after detonating the explosion. However, he said a search operation is underway to apprehend the culprits.
This marks the second blast on a Rescue 1122 building in recent times. In April, a building was damaged in an explosion in Tank district.</p><small>2025-06-01 08:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01123105e70a996.jpg?r=130947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914725/wild-celebrations-in-paris-after-psgs-champions-league-win' target='_blank'><strong>Wild celebrations in Paris after PSG’s Champions League win</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of Paris Saint-Germain supporters took to the streets of the French capital on Saturday to celebrate their club’s victory in the Champions League final, but clashes with the police led to the arrest of over 500 people, while two people lost their lives amid the celebrations in separate instances.
As per the French interior ministry, a woman riding a scooter died after she was hit by a car in the southwest of Paris, while a 17-year-old in the southwestern town of Dax was stabbed to death during the celebrations. In total, 559 people were arrested, including 491 in Paris.
The majority of fans celebrated peacefully, but Paris police said scuffles broke out near the city’s Champs-Elysees avenue and PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium, where 48,000 had watched the 5-0 win against Inter Milan in Munich on big screens.
Most of the people detained were suspected of possessing fireworks and causing disorder, Paris police said.
AFP journalists saw police use a water cannon to stop a crowd reaching the Arc de Triomphe.
“Troublemakers on the Champs-Elysees were looking to create incidents and repeatedly came into contact with police by throwing large fireworks and other objects,” police said in a statement.
In a video posted by a user on X, police can be seen dispersing the fans.
 






Videos circulating on social media, posted by a French press agency CLPRESS show burning vehicles as the celebrations turned into riots.
 






 






Outside Paris, police said a car careered into fans celebrating PSG’s win in Grenoble in southeastern France, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously.
All of those hurt were from the same family, police said.
The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest.
A source close to the investigation said it was believed the driver had not acted intentionally.
In Paris, most fans showed their joy by singing and dancing in the streets, with cars sounding their horns, after their team won the biggest prize in European club football for the first time in their history.
 






One 20-year-old PSG supporter, Clement, said: “It’s so good and so deserved! We have a song that talks about our struggles and it hasn’t always been easy.
“But we got our faith back this year with a team without stars. They’re 11 guys who play for each other.”
French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he would host the victorious players on Sunday to congratulate them.
In a separate message on X, Macron hailed a “day of glory for PSG”.
“Bravo, we are all proud,” he wrote. “Paris is the capital of Europe tonight.”
Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo hailed it as a “historic” win.
The PSG team will hold a victory parade on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday when tens of thousands of supporters are expected to gather to get a glimpse of their returning heroes.
Doue dazzles as PSG humble Inter 5-0 to win first European Cup
Teenager Desire Doue scored twice to inspire Paris St Germain to their first European Cup triumph with a crushing victory over Inter Milan.
PSG’s young team achieved what the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could not do in their colours as they became only the second French side to win the trophy after Olympique de Marseille in 1993.
“Making history was a goal from the start of last season,” the club’s manager, Luis Enrique, said.
“I really felt a connection with the players and the fans, a very strong connection that we saw throughout the season. We were able to handle the tension and excitement in the best possible way.”
Luis Enrique, visibly emotional after the final whistle and wearing a T-shirt with a tribute to his daughter Xana who died in 2019, has turned PSG from a side of superstars into a group of humble players finally playing as a team.</p><small>2025-06-01 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01114637098f9df.jpg?r=114733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914721/bangladesh-top-court-restores-jamaat-i-islami' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh top court restores Jamaat-i-Islami</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of the Jamaat-i-Islami party, allowing it to take part in elections, more than a decade after it was removed under the now-overthrown government.
The country’s supreme court overturned a cancellation of Jamaat-e-Islami’s registration, allowing it to be formally listed as a political party with the Election Commission.
“The election commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,” commission lawyer Towhidul Islam told AFP.
Jamaat-i-Islami party lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the supreme court’s decision would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multi-party system” in the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
“We hope that Bangladeshis, regardless of their ethnicity or religious identity, will vote for Jamaat, and that the parliament will be vibrant with constructive debates,” Monir told journalists.
After Sheikh Hasina was ousted as prime minister in August, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 high court order banning it.
Sunday’s decision comes after Bangladesh’s top court on May 27 overturned a conviction against a key leader of Jamaat-i-Islami, A.T.M. Azharul Islam.
He had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during Bangladesh’s 1971 war with Pakistan.
Jamaat-i-Islami supported Islamabad during the war, a role that still sparks anger among many Bangladeshis today.
They were rivals of Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League, who would become Bangladesh’s founding figure.
Hasina banned Jamaat-i-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
In May, Bangladesh’s interim government banned the Awami League, pending the outcome of a trial over its crackdown on mass protests that prompted her ouster last year.
Bangladesh to open trial of fugitive ex-PM
Meanwhile, Bangladesh will open the trial on Sunday of fugitive former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on charges of crimes against humanity related to the killings of protesters by police, prosecutors said.
ICT chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said on May 12 that Hasina faces at least five charges, including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising”.
“The prosecution team … is set to submit charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina,” said Gazi MH Tamim, one of the prosecutors.
The hearing is expected to be broadcast live on state-owned Bangladesh Television.</p><small>2025-06-01 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01105358e1f64b1.jpg?r=105416' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914553/larkana-judge-escapes-unhurt-police-guard-killed-in-dacoits-firing-on-convoy' target='_blank'><strong>Larkana judge escapes unhurt, police guard killed in dacoits’ firing on convoy</strong></a><br><p>SUKKUR: Larkana sessions judge and in-charge of Anti-Terrorism Court survived attack by a gang of highwaymen who opened fire on his car and his security detail following him in police mobile van on Khairpur-Larkana road late on Friday night.
A police constable, Maqbool Sheikh, died and his colleagues, Iqbal Baloch and Safeer Ahmed Kehar, suffered gunshot wounds in the attack that took place within the jurisdiction of Tando Masti police station in Khairpur district.
Police officials said the judge, Samkan Ahmed Mughal, and his security squad came under fire from the armed dacoits but the judge remained unharmed in the attack. The judge was on his way to Larkana last night after attending an event at the Sindh High Court’s Sukkur bench, they said.
They said that the armed highwaymen were standing by the road within the limits of Tando Masti police station when they signaled the judge’s convoy to stop.
In reply to media persons’ questions if it was a targeted attack on the judge and linked to some cases he was hearing or if it was only an act of highway robbery, the officials said they had just started investigation into the incident and it was premature to say whether it was pre-planned attack or merely a random act of highway robbery.
They said that police teams had cordoned off all routes leading into riverine area from where the criminals came out to commit the crime on the highway.
Martyred cop’s funeral held in Larkana
The funeral for the martyr Maqbool Ahmed Sheikh was held with full police honours at the Police Headquarters in Larkana, according to a press release issued by Sukkur DIG’s office.
It said the martyr had sacrificed his life fighting valiantly against dacoits. The funeral prayer was attended by the martyr’s family and a large number of police officers, Rangers personnel, the judge, DIGs of Sukkur and Larkana, commissioner and deputy commissioner of Larkana, SSPs and officials of other law enforcement agencies, leaders of various schools of thought, civil society members and general public.
It said that the Sukkur DIG and other officers laid wreaths on the martyr’s coffin.
The DIG said in his message that no stone would be left unturned in the treatment of the injured police officials. All officers and personnel of Sindh Police stood like a solid wall for the restoration of law and order, he said.
“We are proud of our martyrs, our spirits are high, and we will not shy away from any sacrifice for the establishment of peace. Insha Allah, the gang of dacoits who martyred our official will be found and eliminated soon,” he said.
People react angrily to attack
People of Khairpur district complained to journalists that the district had been left at the mercy of dacoits and outlaws who came out of the riverine areas and committed crimes at their whim and disappeared with utmost ease while police acted as silent spectators.
They said that due to constant political interference in the district police, no honest SSP was allowed to work and restore peace in the area.
They recalled that former SSP, Dr Samiullah Soomro, had cracked down on dacoits and criminals and forced them to flee the district, but he was soon transferred as he was deemed disobedient by some political figures.
As a result, Khairpur district had once again fallen into the hands of criminals, they lamented and demanded that SSP Dr Samiullah or an honest officer like him be posted in the crime-infested district to restore peace on the roads.

The Salman Ali Agha-led side will certainly be looking to sweep the series, something the Green-shirts last achieved in back-to-back series against Bangladesh and West Indies in Dhaka and Karachi, respectively during November-December 2021.
The home team won the series opener by 37 runs and clinched the second game by 57 runs, both at the Gaddafi Stadium, to take an unassailable lead in the series.
It is pertinent to mention here that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in the past couple of years or so made many changes in captaincy of the national squad as well as the team management.
Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf on Friday acknowledged that frequent changes in captaincy and team management adversely affected the team.
“No doubt the team management and captain have been changing [in the past two, years]. It definitely disturbs the team which subsequently impacts results. The team management should always be [appointed] on long-term and it is also the aim (of the PCB],” Haris told reporters after Pakistan won the second T20 against Bangladesh in front of a large crowd at the Gaddafi Stadium.
The pacer said that recently-appointed T20 captain Salman was backing the youngsters.
“Salman is also supporting several youngsters in the [present] team. [In this way] he can develop a strong squad that will play with a bonding,” Haris insisted.
On whether the Pakistan pacers, like their batting colleagues, were being asked to adapt to modern demands of the game, Haris said fast bowlers in the present-day cricket always faced challenges.
“Fast bowlers are always under pressure because of the [batting-friendly] pitches and [short] boundaries. Modern-day cricket is fast and we always try to give minimum runs but still a total of 200 has become a par score in T20s,” he underlined.
When asked whether he was missing old partners like Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam in T20 Internationals, Haris in a subtle response said that the players who were competing alongside any team-mate in any game were their partners.
“I bowled alongside Shaheen and Naseem [Shah] in many matches and learnt a lot in their company. And I also played with Hasan Ali, who always motivates youngsters and we always enjoy that,” right-armer Haris said.
He was agreed that due to lot of cricket there should be a rotation programme for the cricketers, keeping in mind the workload on them.  He said now Pakistan had a good back-bench strength in the bowling department and rotation policy would be on the card.
Haris said as many as eight bowlers were tested by Pakistan in the second T20 International against Bangladesh because the match condition was conducive for that move.
He praised young dashing opener Sahibzada Farhan, who hit a swashbuckling 74 off 41 balls, his first T20I half-century, in the second T20 after being given a chance in place of experienced Fakhar Zaman.
“Farhan has done well at domestic level and then emerged as the leading scorer of [this year’s] PSL. So, it is good that he grabbed the chance,” Haris said.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh pacer Tanzim Hasan Sakib, who batting at ninth position smashed a 31-ball 50 with five sixes and one four in a rearguard action in the second T20, said quick dismissals after a good start, dented his team’s chances in the game.
Young Bangladesh opener Tanzid Hasan contributed a 19-ball 33 in a brisk 44-run opening stand alongside opening partner Parvez Hossain Emon. However, once Emon departed, only Tanzim and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (23) could reach double figures.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the billionaire adviser to United States President Donald Trump used so much ketamine, a powerful anaesthetic, that he developed bladder problems.
The newspaper said the world’s richest person also took ecstasy and mushrooms and travelled with a pill box last year, adding that it was not known whether Musk also took drugs while heading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump took power in January.
In a post on Saturday on X, Musk said: “To be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.”
He added: “I tried ‘prescription’ ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven’t taken it since then.”
 






Musk first dodged a question about his drug use at a bizarre farewell appearance on Friday with Trump in the Oval Office in which the Tesla and SpaceX boss sported a noticeable black eye as he formally ended his role as Trump’s main cost-cutter at DOGE, which fired tens of thousands of civil servants.

News of the injury drew substantial attention as it came right after the Times report on his alleged drug use.
The daily recalled erratic behaviour such as Musk giving an enthusiastic Nazi-style salute in January of this year at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration.
Musk said he got the injury while horsing around with his young son, named X, when he told the child to hit him in the face.

“And he did. Turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face actually is…” he added, before tailing off.
Later on Friday, when a reporter asked Trump if he was aware of Musk’s “regular drug use”, Trump responded: “I wasn’t.”
“I think Elon is a fantastic guy,” he added.
Musk has previously admitted to taking ketamine, saying he was prescribed it to treat a “negative frame of mind” and suggesting his use of drugs benefited his work.</p><small>2025-06-01 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011039052a236b1.jpg?r=103915' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914616/trump-gets-key-wins-at-supreme-court-on-immigration' target='_blank'><strong>Trump gets key wins at Supreme Court on immigration</strong></a><br><p>WAHINGTON: The US Supreme Court swept away this week another obstacle to one of President Donald Trump’s most aggressively pursued policies — mass deportation — again showing its willingness to back his hardline approach to immigration.
The justices, though, have signalled some reservations with how he is carrying it out. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the court already has been called upon to intervene on an emergency basis in seven legal fights over his crackdown on immigration.
It most recently let Trump’s administration end temporary legal status provided to hundreds of thousands of migrants for humanitarian reasons by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden while legal challenges in two cases play out in lower courts.
The Supreme Court on Friday lifted a judge’s order that had halted the revocation of immigration “parole” for more than 500,000 Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian and Nicaraguan migrants. On May 19, it lifted another judge’s order preventing the termination of “temporary protected status” for more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants.
In some other cases, however, the justices have ruled that the administration must treat migrants fairly, as required under the US Constitution’s guarantee of due process.
“This president has been more aggressive than any in modern US history to quickly remove non-citizens from the country,” said Kevin Johnson, an immigration and public interest law expert at the University of California, Davis.
No president in modern history “has been as willing to deport non-citizens without due process,” Johnson added.
That dynamic has forced the Supreme Court to police the contours of the administration’s actions, if less so the legality of Trump’s underlying policies.  The court’s 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump during his first term as president.
“President Trump is acting within his lawful authority to deport illegal aliens and protect the American people. While the Supreme Court has rightfully acknowledged the president’s authority in some cases, in others they have invented new due process rights for illegal aliens that will make America less safe. We are confident in the legality of our actions and will continue fighting to keep President Trump’s promises,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Reuters.
The justices twice — on April 7 and on May 16 — have placed limits on the administration’s attempt to implement Trump’s invocation of a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act, which historically has been employed only in wartime, to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who it has accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.
Lawyers and family members of some of the migrants have disputed the gang membership allegation. On May 16, the justices also said a bid by the administration to deport migrants from a detention centre in Texas failed basic constitutional requirements. Giving migrants “notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” the court stated.
Due process generally requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking certain adverse actions.
The court has not outright barred the administration from pursuing these deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, as the justices have yet to decide the legality of using the law for this purpose.
The US government last invoked the Alien Enemies Act during World War Two to intern and deport people of Japanese, German and Italian descent.
“The Supreme Court has in several cases reaffirmed some basic principles of constitutional law (including that) the due process clause applies to all people on US soil,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School’s immigrants’ rights clinic.
Even for alleged gang members, Mukherjee said, the court “has been extremely clear that they are entitled to notice before they can be summarily deported from the United States.”
A wrongly deported man
In a separate case, the court on April 10 ordered the administration to facilitate the release from custody in El Salvador of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland. The administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to El Salvador.
The administration has yet to return Abrego Garcia to the United States, which according to some critics amounts to defiance of the Supreme Court.

The decision was taken at the third meeting of the Counter-Terr­orism Committee and Har­den the State Commi­ttee held here under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday.
The government had already announced it would deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting resettlement in the West if the prospective host countries didn’t relocate them by April 30. Tens of thousands of Afghans came to Pakistan fearing retribution after the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led forces.
 
 

An official told Dawn that so far 1.023 million Afghans had been repatriated. He said 135,865 had been repatriated in April and another 65,057 in May. On May 30 alone, 1,483 individuals had been repatriated.

Naqvi asks all institutions to coordinate for implementation of one-document regime

Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister said the federal and provincial agencies must coordinate their efforts to eli­m­inate the illegal spectrum undermining nat­io­nal security, emph­asising that all institutions must work together to fully implement the “one-document regime”.
He said that Nadra would provide live data verification facilities at exit points.
Referring to the beggar mafia, Mr Naqvi said they must be dealt with strictly as they were tarnishing the country’s image. He highlighted the need to declare begging a non-bailable offence.
As a nationwide crackdown on power theft continues, the meeting was informed by a representative of the power division that Rs142 billion was recovered with the cooperation of the interior ministry and provincial governments. The minister said every possible support was being provided to the Ministry of Energy and provincial governments to prevent electricity theft.
The meeting also reviewed progress on anti-encroachment operations.
Regarding maintenance of law and order, the meeting was briefed that more than 250 intelligence-based operations were being conducted on a daily basis.
It also reviewed progress on the establishment of the Pakistan Port Authority, ‘Gwadar Safe City Project’, besides the construction of a protection wall was also discussed.
Digital transformation
Also, progress on the digitalisation of petrol pumps to curb the sale of illegal and smuggled fuel came under review. According to new rules, customs officers and the relevant deputy commissioner will have the authority to seal petrol pumps and seize vehicles in case of violations.
During the briefing, it was stated that digital enforcement stations were being set up on the Indus River, while work on an Intelligent Trans­portation System (ITS) was also underway for effective motorway and highway monitoring.
Besides Minister of State for Interior Moha­m­mad Tallal Chaudhry, Punjab Law Minister Soh­aib Ahmed Bharti, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Adviser Bar­rister Mohammad Ali Saif and Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Home Minister Sha­msul Haq Lone, federal interior secretary, home secretaries of all provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Federal Inves­tigation Agency director general, Nacta’s national coordinator, Islamabad chief commissioner, coordinator for the National Action Plan and senior officials from security agencies also attended the meeting.

Generational theories determine how generations form and share similar values and characteristics. These are shaped by the political, economic and social/cultural paradigms in which a generation exists. These are then critiqued by a new generation to formulate a new set of values and ethos that may have been missing or undermined in the lives of the previous generation.
According to the architects of the Strauss-Howe generational theory — American authors William Strauss and Neil Howe — this process is cyclical. Strauss and Howe first unveiled their theory in 1997 in the book The Fourth Turning. After studying societal shifts in the West from the 15th century onwards, Strauss and Howe posited that history repeats itself after every 70 to 80 years.
This period is often referred to as a ‘saeculum’. According to Strauss and Howe, within every saeculum, are four ‘turnings’ or stages: High, Awakening, Unravelling and Crisis. The fourth turning, Crisis, marks the end of a saeculum and the beginning of a new one. Every stage/turning lasts approximately 20 years.

If history is cyclical, as posited by some generational theorists, is Pakistan about to enter a new era of optimism and prosperity?

The ‘High’ stage is a time of confidence, relative prosperity, feeling of security and a consensus or conformity, enacted to safeguard collective economic and political gains and a sense of security. Strauss and Howe give the example of the US between the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963.
The ‘Awakening’ stage is when political, economic and social ‘norms’ established during the High stage begin to be questioned, and a new generation begins to assert individualism and new forms of creativity and ‘spiritualism’. Imagine the US from the assassination of Kennedy in 1963 till the early 1980s. During the Awakening stage, the emphasis of society shifts from collective good to individual advancement — both material and ‘spiritual’.
 
 

During the ‘Unravelling’ stage, individualism hardens. Cynicism, hedonism and pragmatism completely sideline the consensual collectivism of the High stage. Whatever emerged during the Awakening stage is critiqued and viewed in a cynical manner. The critique does not call for collective action, though. This produces its own kinds of politics, economics and cultural products that are individualistic, detached and uninterested.
This leads to the ‘Crisis’ stage.
The Wall Street crash of 1928 that plunged the world into an unprecedented economic crisis is an example. The crash was preceded by an Unravelling stage.
The Crisis stage is destructive. It produces intense tensions and conflicts. It is a time of severe instability and uncertainty. But, eventually, it re-orients and regroups society towards rebuilding institutions and strikes a new consensus of collective existence. This marks the beginning of a new saeculum. The Second World War was the cataclysmic event during a Crisis stage, but one that led the West to regenerate itself and reach a new stage of High.
Howe has repeatedly insisted that the theory can be applied to non-Western societies as well. If so, then what if we view Pakistan’s history from the lens of this theory? Pakistan is about to complete its first saeculum.
 


Its High stage can be slotted in the years between the country’s creation in 1947 till when a ‘modernist’ dictatorship began to come apart in 1967. These 20 years encompass the early euphoria of the creation of the country, two economic ‘booms’, rapid industrialisation, and the state’s emphasis on creating a single collective identity by undermining ethnic and sectarian identities and promoting a ‘modernist’ variant of Islam.
The Awakening stage kicked in when the national ethos developed between 1947 and 1967 began being questioned. This was manifested by a protest movement that toppled the ‘modernist’ dictatorship and made way for parliamentary democracy. The once repressed ethnic identities surfaced and so did interest in various leftist and rightist ideologies. The country lost a war in 1971 to India and Pakistan’s eastern wing broke away on an ethnic basis.
The Awakening stage then saw a growing interest in Islam within the polity and an increasing mixing of politics and religion. By the early 1980s, this mixing led to an ‘Islamisation’ that merged material self-interest with individual ‘spiritual improvement.’ Prosperity and piety became two sides of the same coin.
 
 

In 1988, the Awakening stage came to a close followed by the Unraveling stage. The material and ‘spiritual’ tendencies of the Awakening stage began to mutate. The ‘ideological’ facades of the merger of prosperity and piety melted away, replaced by the cynical usage of faith as a business. Islamic sects and sub-sects fought pitched battles to secure their piece of this enterprise. Tensions developed between ‘old money’ and ‘new money’ [nouveau riche], and between the old middle classes and the new middle classes.
These sowed the seeds of the outcomes of the Crisis stage, which Pakistan entered in 2007. So far, the 18 years of this stage have witnessed severe polarisation, the rise of messianic populism and unprecedented Islamist and ethnic terrorism. Yet, according to the Strauss-Howe generational theory, the Crisis stage produces a major event which sees the state and society revive itself and enter a new High.
In Pakistan, maybe that event is its recent short but intense armed conflict with India, which saw large segments of Pakistan’s polarised polity unite behind its armed forces and government.
But the state and society have to be mindful of the fact that a Crisis stage, if mishandled, doesn’t always produce a High. The Soviet Union collapsed during the Crisis stage of its first saeculum. Therefore, Pakistan’s major stakeholders have to carefully navigate the recent events that have produced outcomes that may see the country successfully complete its first saeculum and produce a new High.
For this, history will have to be treated as a teacher, ideological moderation adopted, and a more robust ‘unity in diversity’ ethos developed.

Academic activities at government schools across Gilgit-Baltistan have been suspended since last week, as thousands of teachers announced that they would call off their protest only when their single-point demand was fulfilled.
For the past five days, teachers have organised demonstrations and rallies outside the education department offices in Hunza, Nagar, Astore, Skardu, Diamer, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang and Ghizer. On Friday, the protesting teachers from these districts marched towards Gilgit and joined the protest sit-in outside the Gilgit-Baltistan Directorate of Education in Gilgit, the regional headquarters, where the minister’s office is situated.
Despite harsh weather conditions on Saturday, a number of male and female government teachers continued their protest sit-in outside the GB Directorate of Education on the call of the Teachers’ Coordination Committee.

Verification of teachers’ academic, professional credentials ordered

The organisers said government teachers had been demanding promotions for many years. Teachers with a Bachelor of Education should be promoted to Grade 16, while those with a Certificate in Teaching should be promoted to Grade 14, they explained, but nearly 7,000 teachers despite the required qualification were ignored when the education department promoted only 300 in a “discriminatory” way.
 
 

According to them, the GB Supreme Appellate Court had directed the government to grant teachers their legitimate pay scales. Also, the chief court ordered the implementation of the appellate court’s order for qualified teachers to be given their due service scales. However, the protesters said, the GB government was reluctant to implement the court order, depriving teachers of their rights.
They said many teachers despite having qualifications for promotion had been serving in same grades for more than a decade. They demanded that all CT and BEd qualified teachers be promoted to their relevant grades immediately. They said that teacher representatives had held meetings with government officials and education department heads, but the issue was ignored.
GB officials said the education department had moved an appeal before the GB Supreme Appellate Court against the decision related to teachers’ promotion. After a court ruling on the appeal, the GB government would decide the matter accordingly.
Verification of credentials
At the same time, the GB government started a large-scale verification of academic and professional credentials of teaching staff working under the school education department.
According to an official notification issued by the school education department issued on May 30, the department has directed the director general of education to carry out “a comprehensive verification exercise of all teachers working under the school education department, across all districts of Gilgit-Baltistan”.
However, the protesting teachers termed it another ploy to delay the due promotions and announced that their protest would continue till the implementation of court order.

• Claims conflict never came close to a nuclear war
• Says ‘channels of communication’ with Islamabad were open
• BJP leader says PAF shot down five Indian aircraft
NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare­ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India’s top military general admitted losses.
In an interview with Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted losses but dismissed Pakistan’s claims that it shot down six Indian jets, including four Rafales, as “absolutely incorrect”.
 






“What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down… Why they were down, what mistakes were made — that are important. Numbers are not important,” he said.
In a separate interview to Reuters, Gen Chauhan said the losses India suffered were in the initial stages, on May 7, when it launched Operation Sindoor.
“What I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses… What was important is why these losses occur and what we will do after that,” he said.
 
 

However, the chief of defence staff said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.
“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,” India Today quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.
It may be recalled that Pakistan military says India did not fly its fighter jets again in the conflict after suffering losses on May 7.
Earlier on Friday, former law minister Swamy became the most candid Indian to admit that Pakistan Air Force had shot down five Indian planes, including French-made Rafales. Speaking in an online interview, Dr Swamy blamed the French planes as being responsible for the losses, implying that the deal the prime minister had made for them was to blame. The interview came as Mr Modi went about holding mammoth meetings in Gujarat and other states claiming victory and threatening more dire conflict with Pakistan.
Gen Chauhan’s remarks were the most direct by the army so far on losses suffered during the hostilities, which came as India attacked nine alleged terror camps deep inside Pakistan. It was in response to the horrific Pahalgam attack, which left at least 25 tourists dead.
As Pakistan retaliated by launching a wave of drone attacks targeting Indian military facilities and border towns, the armed forces struck 11 vital airbases with long-range BrahMos missiles, India Today reported.
Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal A.K. Bharti, Director Gen­e­ral of Air Operations, said “losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.
“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is, have we achieved our objective? Answer is a thumping yes. At this time, I would not like to comment on that (loss of jets) as we are still in combat and give advantage to adversary. All our pilots are back home,” he claimed.
The chief of defence staff also claimed that the conflict never came close to a nuclear war, while underscoring that “channels of communication” with Pakistan were always open to control the situation.
This flies in the face of US President Donald Trump’s repeated assertion that he avoided a potential nuclear disaster by mediating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the news report said.
“I personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,” Gen Chauhan told Bloomberg.
During the hostilities, Indian missiles and jets were able to bypass Chinese-supplied air defence systems to target Pakistani military sites, the report said.

In an unexpected move, IS-K has declared war not only on the Pakistani state but also on the insurgents themselves, denouncing their nationalist agendas as unIslamic.
Recently, IS-K released a booklet denouncing ethno-linguistic nationalist movements in Pakistan, explicitly targeting the Baloch and Pakhtun nationalist movements. The group singled out the BYC and its leader Mahrang Baloch, as well as the PTM and its leader, Manzoor Pashteen.
 
 

The release of this threatening booklet was alarming in itself. However, the following day, IS-K escalated matters by issuing an audio statement formally declaring war on Baloch insurgents, justifying the move by accusing the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) of killing its fighters in the Mastung district of Balochistan.
Although IS-K has had a presence in Baloch­istan since the early days of its parent group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and was one of the first global affiliates to pledge allegiance to its leadership, it had never directly confronted natio­nalist forces, until now. What does IS-K’s entry into this already volatile theatre mean? And can it reshape the dynamics of conflict in Balochistan?

Can the militant group’s entry reshape the dynamics of conflict in the province?

IS-K has been involved in 33 terrorist attacks in Balochistan since 2016, resulting in the deaths of 436 people and injuries to 691 others. Shrines and churches have remained among its primary targets. IS-K has attacked shrines and churches eight times, while among human targets, political figures, especially politicians affiliated with the JUI, are at the top of its hit list. Security forces and polio health workers follow close behind.
Many senior JUI leaders have been targeted by IS-K in Balochistan, including Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Hafiz Hamdullah and Maulana Abdul Wasay. While it also targeted a PTI candidate in Sibi, one of the most dangerous attacks was an assassination attempt on former president Arif Alvi, who survived. The group has not spared nationalist leaders and pro-state politicians either. Notably, Siraj Raisani of the Balochistan Awami Party was killed during the 2018 election campaign. Another significant incident was the kidnapping of Chinese nationals, who were held in Mastung.
 
 

Interestingly, IS-K operations in Balochistan, like in KP, are limited to specific territories. In KP, its activities are mostly confined to the Baja­­ur tribal district and Peshawar, where it has carried out 36 and 19 attacks, respectively. IS-K stri­ctly follows the Salafi interpretation of Islam, which is also prevalent in Bajaur and neighbouring regions in Afghanistan, such as Kunar and Nu­­ristan. These Afghan regions, where IS-K main­­­­tains a strong presence, share borders with Pakistan.
However, the operational context in Balochistan is different. IS-K’s activities are concentrated in the central western part of the province, from the outskirts of Quetta to Mastung, Kalat, and parts of Khuzdar. From Mastung, its presence extends into Bolan and reaches Sibi district, which borders Sindh. At one point, Sindh’s Counter-Terrorism Department reported that IS-K had established training camps in Balochistan near the provincial border and was exporting terrorism into Sindh, particularly by radicalising Sindhi youth, especially those from Brahui tribes. These reports surfaced after the February 2017 investigation of the IS-K terrorist attack on the famous shrine of Sehwan Sharif.
Mastung and the outskirts of Quetta serve as IS-K’s major hubs, where it has carried out 12 and 10 attacks, respectively. It also maintains a presence in Kalat, Bolan and Khuzdar, which are nearby. These areas are predominantly inhabited by Baloch communities, many of whom are affiliated with religious organisations. The JUI enjoys strong political support here, and some experts trace this religious inclination to the Qalat state’s pre-merger policy of patronising Deobandi madressahs. Regardless of the reasons, Balochistan has witnessed increasing competition among different Islamic movements, including the TLP and Shia organisations.
Shia madressahs have expanded their presence in the region over the past 15 years. Attacks on Shia pilgrims, particularly by groups like Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, which later merged into IS-K, have occurred along the routes passing through Mastung and Nushki districts. Convoys here have often been targeted in the past.
The TLP has also established a foothold in this region, primarily through Karachi, extending its influence along the Quetta-Karachi highway. Certain Baloch residents from this area who live in Karachi have played a key role in spreading this influence. Nonetheless, JUI remains a dominant political force in the region and continues to hold significant electoral power.
One understands why the IS-K targets JUI both in KP and Balochistan — the group considers it to be a close ally of the Taliban in Pakistan. In Afghanistan, the armed confrontation between IS-K and the Afghan Taliban has been going on even before the latter’s takeover of that country; the significant difference between the two lies in their views on state structure and the concept of a caliphate.
 
 

The IS-K believes that the Taliban is a nationalist movement and an ally of the West, and there is no difference between the power elites of Pakistan, other Muslim states, and the Taliban. To IS-K, nationalism is an unIslamic concept, and now it has expanded its circle to nationalist movements in the country, both violent and peaceful.
This development will heighten the threat level for nationalist and rights movements in Balochistan and KP, while also triggering potential clashes between Islamist militants and nationalist insurgents.
Until now, both sides had avoided confrontation, despite operating in overlapping territories; however, that dynamic is likely to change. Although the BLA has expanded its operational footprint across much of the province, IS-K remains confined mainly to Mastung and its surrounding areas. Still, its presence could become a significant distraction for the BLA.
It remains uncertain whether this confrontation is necessarily good news for the state’s security institutions. While some may view it as a conflict that could weaken two adversaries simultaneously, the reality may be more complicated. IS-K is unlikely to abandon its operational strategy; instead, it may adapt and evolve, further complicating the already volatile security environment in Balochistan.

MNA Abdul Latif and other party supporters have been convicted of attacking a police station in the federal capital.
The sentences, the first related to the May 9 events in the capital, raise troubling questions about the use of antiterrorism laws against political dissidents, including lawmakers.
While it is true that the violent actions of PTI supporters after the arrest of their party chief and ex-prime minister Imran Khan were indefensible in many cases, should these individuals be tried under antiterrorism laws? After all, ATCs and the even harsher military courts are reserved for anti-state elements including ‘jet-black’ terrorists.
 
 

The PTI’s lawmakers and supporters do not fall within this very narrow category. They should have been tried under the regular courts. The ATC judge concerned has said that the convicts met the threshold of terrorism, while the party has termed the sentences “unjust” and “politically motivated”.
In a related development, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, in a dissenting note, has criticised the use of courts martial in terrorism-related cases.
Pakistan indeed needs to tackle terrorism with the full force of the law. But there has to be a clear distinction between violent militants and political dissidents.
Political violence needs to be treated with the relevant legal instruments, while ATCs should be reserved for bringing violent terrorists to justice. While speaking in Lahore the other day, President Asif Zardari urged all “democratic forces” to unite.
Yet this unity will be hard to bring about if lawmakers and supporters of a major national political party are hounded by lawfare, using legal instruments meant for hardcore terrorists. All political forces, as well as the powers that be, must realise this.
 
 

The PTI has made plenty of mistakes in the course of its political journey, but parties evolve over time. The fact that it has a considerable national mandate cannot be ignored.
Instead of ‘punishing’ political opponents, a genuine process of reconciliation is needed with buy-in from all major political forces. Pakistan cannot afford internal discord and the suppression of rights at a time when it faces both external and internal threats to its security.

From July to April, the cotton import bill soared to $2.545 billion, compared to $1.189bn during the same period last year. According to data released by the State Bank, the significantly low cotton production has become a burden on the economy, particularly affecting exports.
At the beginning of the current fiscal year, it was estimated that cotton imports would be around $1.9bn, but the frequent decline in lint production has increased the import bill.
The country witnessed a record trade deficit in April. The rising cotton imports could jeopardise the country’s effort to keep the current account positive by the end of FY25. So far, the current account has a surplus of $1.88bn in 10MFY25.
The SBP data indicated that cotton imports surged by 58.4pc in the first ten months of FY25 compared to the entire FY24 figure of $1.6bn.
The official data showed that cotton production has decreased to one-third of its peak of 14 million bales. The cotton experts view this massive decline as a major reason for the decline in exports. Despite some growth, the country has failed to boost its exports significantly.
US cotton
Pakistan faces approximately 29pc reciprocal tariffs on its exports to the US. Formal negotiations are underway with the Trump administration to seek relief by importing US cotton and soybeans.
The US is the single largest export market. To save its exports, Pakistan has chosen to import American products to reduce around $3bn trade surplus.
A significant number of textile units have already shut down, primarily due to higher electricity tariffs, in fact, the highest in the region. With the shortage of domestic cotton and high costs, textile exports are unlikely to surpass the $16.6bn threshold recorded in FY24. The textile sector accounted for 54pc of the country’s total exports.

The FBR collected Rs10.233tr between July and May against the budgetary target of Rs11.241tr. However, the collection is 26 per cent higher than the Rs8.11tr collected a year ago.
On a monthly basis, the FBR collected Rs932 billion in May against the target of Rs1.11tr projected for the same month, indicating a shortfall of Rs178bn. However, the collection is 22pc higher than Rs762bn collected a year ago, according to provisional data released on Saturday.
The shortfall highlights poor tax compliance, particularly concerning sales tax collection at the domestic stage, even after the removal of substantial exemptions on products such as stationery and infant formula. However, the sales tax collection continues to fall short of the anticipated target, indicating potential gaps in the collection process.

Low imports amid a slowing economy hit sales tax generation

FBR has introduced several digital measures to plug loopholes and more will be announced in the upcoming budget to promote a cashless economy.
The FBR has identified two key factors contributing to the significant shortfalls observed in May. The eight-day strike by farmers in Sindh, who blocked the main highway, has significantly disrupted the supply chain, resulting in a decline in sales tax collection.
Furthermore, the recent conflict with India has resulted in a decrease in port clearances. Nonetheless, the FBR has yet to quantify the actual impact of these two factors on the decline in revenue collection during May.
The IMF has revised the FBR revenue collection target for FY25, decreasing it to Rs12.33tr from Rs12.913tr, marking a reduction of Rs580bn. Independent economists estimate that real revenue collection in FY25 will be approximately Rs12tr.
The shortfall is largely attributed to reduced tax collection from imports, sluggish manufacturing growth and unexpectedly low inflation, which has dropped to a record 0.3pc in recent months.
In the last year’s budget, the government has imposed a stunning Rs1.761tr in new revenue measures for the current fiscal year. However, the revenue collection fell short of the target.
The FBR paid Rs458bn in refunds/rebates to taxpayers in 11MFY25, up Rs5bn from Rs453bn in the same period last year. However, May saw a decline to Rs29bn against Rs31bn in the same month last year.
In July-May, income tax collection totalled Rs4.9tr, exceeding the target of Rs4.586tr by Rs314bn. The income tax collection grew 27pc compared with last year’s Rs3.852tr.
The sales tax collection fell short of the target by Rs895bn in 11MFY25, totalling Rs3.503tr against the target of Rs4.398tr. The sales tax collection recorded a growth of 27pc compared with last year’s Rs2.765tr.
The customs collection also fell short of the projected target by Rs263bn to Rs1.157tr in 11MFY25 against the target of Rs1.420tr. The customs collection recorded a growth of 17pc compared with last year’s Rs991bn.
The Federal Excise Duty collection fell short of the target by Rs165bn to Rs673bn in 11MFY25 against the projected target of Rs838bn. The excise duty recorded a growth of 34pc over last year’s Rs503bn.

The ministers condemned “Israel’s decision to ban the delegation’s visit to Ramallah (on Sunday) to meet with the president of the State of Palestine, Mahmud Abbas”, the Jordanian foreign ministry said.
Ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had been expected to take part alongside Turkiye and the secretary-general of the Arab League.
Israel had announced late Friday that it would not cooperate, effectively blocking the visit as it controls the territory’s borders and airspace.

Hamas responds to US truce proposal, to free 10 prisoners, return 18 bodies

Abbas “intended to host in Ramallah a provocative meeting of foreign ministers from Arab countries to discuss the promotion of the establishment of a Palestinian state,” an Israeli official said. “Such a state would undoubtedly become a terrorist state in the heart of the Land of Israel. Israel will not cooperate with such moves aimed at harming it and its security.”
Had the visit gone ahead, the delegation’s head, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, would have become the first Saudi foreign minister to visit the occupied West Bank.
Israel this week announced the creation of 22 new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, regarded by the United Nations as illegal under international law and one of the main obstacles to a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
During a visit to one of the new settlement sites on Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to build a “Jewish Israeli state” in the Palestinian territory.
In June, Saudi Arabia and France are to co-chair an international conference at UN headquarters meant to resurrect the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Saudi Arabia was said to have been close to recognising Israel before the start of the Gaza war, and US President Donald Trump, during a recent visit to Riyadh, called normalisation between the countries “my fervent hope and wish”.
But de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has repeatedly said Saudi Arabia will not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
Saudi Arabia is co-hosting with France a conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York aiming to revive the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
French President Emmanuel Macron previously said he could recognise a Palestinian state at that conference, drawing a sharp rebuke from Israel.
Prisoner deal
Meanwhile, Hamas on Saturday said it had responded to a ceasefire proposal from US envoy Steve Witkoff, saying 10 living prisoners would be freed from Gaza as part of the deal.
The Palestinian group did not explicitly say it had accepted the version of the proposal it received on Thursday, which reportedly included a provision for the release of 10 living prisoners.
Hamas noted that its response had been made out of a “sense of responsibility towards our people and their suffering”.
The White House previously said the proposal had been approved in advance by Israel, which on Friday warned Hamas to either accept the deal and free the prisoners “or be annihilated”.
Hamas said in a statement on Friday that it had “submitted its response to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff’s latest proposal to the mediating parties”.
“As part of this agreement, 10 living prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will be released, in addition to the return of 18 bodies, in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners,” it added.
A breakthrough in negotiations had been elusive since a previous ceasefire fell apart on March 18 with the resumption of Israeli operations.
US President Donald Trump had said Friday that the parties were “very close to an agreement”.
Two sources close to the negotiations have said the deal involves a 60-day truce, potentially extendable to 70 days. It would see the release of five living prisoners and nine bodies in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners during the first week, followed by a second exchange the following week, the sources said.

• Additional DC laid to rest in Kachhi
QUETTA: A Levies official was martyred in a shooting in Dera Bugti and a Levies police station was set on fire in Mastung district, while a roadside blast on the outskirts of Quetta left two siblings dead and nine others wounded on Saturday, officials said.
The gun and bomb attacks were carried out on the day when the additional deputy commissioner of Surab district, who had embraced martyrdom in an attack on Friday, was laid to rest with full state honour in Kachhi district.
According to Levies sources, the official, identified as Rehan, was on his way home when some armed men opened fire on him in the Sui Tehsil Bazaar area of Dera Bugti.
The body was shifted to a nearby hospital for medico-legal formalities before being handed over to the family.
A search operation was launc­hed to track down the assailants.
No one claimed responsibility for the shooting. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. Levies authorities later registered a case.
In the late evening, armed militants attacked a Levies police station in Wali Khan area of Mastung. “Armed militants set fire to the building of Levies thana. The building was badly damaged and record burnt,” a senior official said.
No casualty was reported in the attack.
The official said the armed men also attempted to surround the area but failed when security forces reached there and launched an operation forcing the militants to flee.
Earlier, on the outskirts of Quetta, a roadside bomb blast claimed the lives of two brothers and left nine others wounded, officials said.
They said an improvised explosive device (IED) planted at the roadside in the Nawan Killi area was detonated when a car was passing through the area. The blast left two sons of a tribal elder, Sardar Abdullah Kakar, dead.
Soon after the explosion, heavy contingent of police and Frontier Corps rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and injured to Civil Hospital Quetta.
“We have received two bodies and nine injured, who were hit by splinters after the IED blast,” Dr Wasim Baig, the spokesman for the Civil Hospital told Dawn.
He said that the deceased were identified as Abdul Salam and his brother, Abdul Nafay.
While three of the nine injured remained unidentified till the filing of this report, the six others were identified as Janan, Saifur Rehman, Samiullah, Zabihullah, Muhammad Asif, Naseebullah and Jameel Ahmed.
The bodies were handed over to the families after necessary legal procedures, authorities confirmed to Dawn.  Police termed the blast a targeted killing.
No  group claimed responsibility for the attack  with security agencies continuiing their investigations.
Funeral
Meanwhile, the additional deputy commissioner, Hidayatullah Buledi, who was martyred in an attack at his residence, was laid to rest in his native town of Bhag in the Kachhi district on Saturday.
His body was flown to the area by a helicopter.
People from all walks of life gathered to pay their final respects.
The funeral was attended by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Zahid Saleem, Naseerabad Commissioner Moeenur Rehman Khan, Kalat Commissioner Shahzeb Kakar, Kachhi Deputy Commissioner Jehanzeb Baloch, Surab Deputy Commissioner Habib Nasir, senior officers of the divisional and district administration, Frontier Corps officials, tribal elders, political figures and locals.
After the funeral, a smartly turned-out contingent of Levies and police presented a salute to the fallen officer. His coffin, draped in the national flag, was laid to rest with full state honour.
Former chief minister of Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri while condemning the attack said, “Those who storm homes in the presence of women and children and commit such brutal acts have no right to call themselves Baloch.”
He described the assassination as a cowardly and shameful act, stating that action against culprits was inevitable.
A day ago, a large group of militants cordoned off police and Levies stations in Surab and set fire  to multiple government offices and looted a local bank.
The militants also tried to storm the deputy commissioner’s office but were repulsed by secuirty forces.
The banned Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack.

According to a statement from his office, Mr Mushahid made the remarks during a 40-minute meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Eurasian Forum in Perm, Russia.
He was invited as Pakis­tani to speak at the international gathering, which brought together more than 100 delegates from 25 Eurasian countries.
A former federal minister and ex-chairman of the Senate’s foreign affairs and defense committees, Mr Mushahid praised Russia’s role in promoting regional stability.
He welcomed President Vladimir Putin’s Eurasian Security Initiative.
He likened it to China’s Global Security Initiative, saying both emphasise “indivisible security” and uphold the UN Charter.
He rejected the notion of an ‘Asian Nato’ or ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’ as these reflected militarisation of international relations.
The former minister also highlighted the Russian foreign minister’s criticism of India’s role in the US-led Quad alliance.

The first edition of Breathe Pakistan sparked national dialogue and global collaboration around vital climate challenges — from climate justice and finance to renewable energy transitions, disaster risk reduction, and inclusive public-private partnerships.
It emphasised the crucial roles of accountability, media engagement, and the empowerment of women and smallholder farmers in building climate resilience, according to a press release.
 
 

Pakistan remains increasingly vulnerable to the devastating effects of climate change, facing record-breaking heatwaves, destructive hail and windstorms, water scarcity, and extreme weather events that threaten lives, infrastructure, and livelihoods.
As climate challenges intensify, DawnMedia continues to bring this critical issue to the forefront through the following ways.
Raising awareness: Increasing awareness around critical issues such as water scarcity, air pollution, and deforestation to mobilise public action to combat climate change.
Impactful journalism: Leveraging multimedia platforms through in-depth articles, documentaries, podcasts, and TV/radio explainers to keep climate discourse at the forefront.
Engaging children: Involving children in the climate conversation through interactive activities and storytelling on tree plantation, recycling, and water conservation to cultivate lifelong environmental stewardship.
Strategic collaborations: Building and strengthening partnerships with the public and private sectors, as well as government institutions, to sustain momentum and drive meaningful change for a sustainable Pakistan.
“The fight against climate change must continue,” says a DawnMedia spokesperson. “Through awareness, education, and collaboration, we can forge a sustainable future.”
The Breathe Pakistan 2026 conference will further amplify these efforts, convening global and local leaders to accelerate actionable solutions.

This follows an earlier announcement by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) notifying the decrease of liquified petroleum gas prices by Rs4.62 per kilogram for the month of June.
According to a notification seen by Dawn.com, the finance divison stated that the new rates had been decided “based on the recommendations of Ogra and the relevant ministries”.
Petrol, which previously stood at Rs252.63 per litre, was increased to Rs253.63, the notification read.
Earlier, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of LPG by Rs4.62 per kilogram, or 1.88 per cent for June. The authority had announced a decrease of Rs3.20 per kg for May.
According to the notification issued by the authority today, the new price for an 11.8kg cylinder stood at Rs2,838.31 for June against Rs2,892.91 for May, making the cylinder cheaper by Rs54.6 per kg.
It added that consumers would now pay Rs240.53 per kg, with the price coming down from Rs245.16 in May.
According to a separate press release issued by the department, Ogra said that the LPG producer price was linked to Saudi Aramco-CP and the US dollar exchange rate.
As compared to the previous month, Saudi Aramco CP decreased by 2.67pc while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.35pc, resulting in a decrease in LPG consumer price by Rs54.6 per 11.8kg cylinder.
The government introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly aimed at digitally tracking petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration, which cause massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually besides affecting the environment and vehicle engines.
The Petroleum (Amend­ment) Act, 2025 — moved by Pet­roleum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik — seeks to amend the 1934 Petroleum Act. The draft law envisages new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb smuggling and to initiate strict actions against the illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with action against illegal petrol pumps.
In a separate development, eight units involved in the illegal sale of LPG cylinders were sealed and fined Rs5,000 earlier this month.</p><small>2025-05-31 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3123062105dc4e1.jpg?r=231136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914544/two-killed-11-injured-in-explosion-near-quetta-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two killed, 11 injured in explosion near Quetta: police</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and 11 others were injured in an explosion in the Killi Mangal area near Quetta in Balochistan, a police official told Dawn.com on Saturday.
According to Hanna Urak Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar, Abdul Salam, a notable and the owner of a coal mine, was the target of the attack.
“A banned organisation tried to extort money from him,” Akhtar told Dawn.com. “When he did not pay, around 100 armed suspects attacked his mine and destroyed the machinery there.”
The SHO said that Salam, his brother and several of his men arrived at the mine, but were ambushed by the suspects and a gun battle ensued.
“The armed suspects had planted explosives in the mine,” the SHO said. “They fled the scene before the explosion. Salam and his brother were killed by one of the explosives. There were also 11 injuries.”
Immediately after the explosion, police and security forces reached the scene and started collecting evidence from the crime scene. According to SHO Akhtar, the suspects were armed with advanced weaponry.
“Security forces have launched a search operation in the area, but panic has spread,” he added.
Meanwhile, Health Department spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig told Dawn.com that those injured in the blast were immediately transported to the Trauma Centre at Civil Hospital Quetta, where their condition is said to be out of danger.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a statement condemning the blast and expressing “deep sorrow over the loss of two lives”.
“Those who spill innocent blood at the behest of the enemy deserve no mercy,” the PPP chairman was quoted as saying.
 






The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
A district official was killed when his house was attacked by terrorists in Balochistan’s Surab city on Friday, a statement from the provincial government said.
Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind, in a statement, termed the incident a “nefarious attempt to challenge the writ of the state”.
“A bank was looted and the homes of several government officials were attacked, including Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Hidayatullah Buledi.</p><small>2025-05-31 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31202431cf51ea0.png?r=202813' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525/at-balochistan-grand-jirga-pm-stresses-need-to-win-back-misled-people' target='_blank'><strong>At Balochistan grand jirga, PM stresses need to win back ‘misled’ people</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that people who were “misled” by terrorists in Balochistan must be brought back on board, stressing the need for resolving issues through dialogue.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Speaking at the Balochistan Grand Jirga in Quetta, PM Shehbaz said, “The terrorists [in Balochistan] must not be tolerated by the public, government or armed forces.
“We must make efforts to bring back the people who were misled [by the terrorists] onto the wrong track.”
He added that economic or social injustices cannot happen in Balochistan during his rule and stressed collectively solving the issues through talks.
“If there are any concerns, brothers need to sit together to solve those issues,” he emphasised. “The blood-thirsty terrorists who are against Pakistan’s success and welfare must be stopped. I want to ask what the gaps [there] are that we can fill with your suggestions [to solve problems].”
Govt designates term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ for terrorist groups in Balochistan
The government has designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan, state media PTV News reported.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
A notification from the Ministry of Interior said, “… All terrorist groups and organisations operating in Balochistan will be referred to as ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’.”
“The change aims reflect the true nature and ideology of these terrorist organisations and groups, and nefarious designs of India against the people of Pakistan.”
 






Balochistan to receive Rs250bn development budget
The premier also announced that Balochistan will receive Rs250 billion in development funds from the federal budget.
He said, “In the upcoming budget, the federal-funded Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for provinces and [the] federation will be Rs1 trillion in total. Balochistan will get Rs250bn, which is 25 per cent of the total PSDP.”
He added, “To me, even that seems like a small amount.
“Whether it is Gwadar, Pasni, Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Quetta, Jhal Magsi or any other place, every penny of these resources must be honestly utilised for the public’s welfare.”
The premier also highlighted past development projects in the province, such as the Rs70bn solar initiative for farmers and the N-25 Highway.
Last month, PM Shehbaz announced that instead of passing on the relief of reduced oil prices in the international market to consumers, the government would use the saved money for the reconstruction of the N-25 Highway and completion of Phase-II of the Kachhi Canal project in Balochistan.
Addressing the event today, he further said, “In 2010, Punjab gave Rs11bn in NFC to Balochistan [and] that would be around Rs155-160bn today. But for the sake of national unity, even Rs1600 billion would not be too much.”
“The vastness of Balochistan demands greater investment,” he added.
Pakistan ‘flying high’ militarily, economically
Earlier on Saturday, the PM said that Pakistan was “flying high” off the back of its victory in a military conflict against India and economic progress made since he took office as prime minister.
The comments, made during an address at the Quetta Command and Staff College, followed a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
 
 

India, however, is still weaponising the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water distribution deal between the two countries — saying that it will no longer abide by the treaty, placing the agreement in “abeyance”.
In his address today, PM Shehbaz congratulated the military personnel in attendance on their counter-operations against India. He said these operations had left New Delhi “completely baffled and shell-shocked”.
“We won a war against an enemy, which in the eyes of our detractors was unthinkable, but we have converted this unthinkable into a reality, and I think that is our finest hour in history,” he stated. “Pakistan at this point in time is flying high.”
PM Shehbaz noted that the conflict with India was not only victorious, but illustrated that the threats Pakistan faces are no longer restricted to conventional battlefields.
“They [threats] are multifaceted, ranging from kinetic warfare to cyber attacks, economic coercion, disinformation campaigns and hybrid threats that challenge both our borders and ideological frontiers,” he elaborated.
“The recent Indian aggression … was not only countered successfully, but we turned the tables on those who tried to establish a new normal,” he added. “Indian leaders had no option but to concoct a patently false explanation for their losses. Operation Bunyanum Marsoos destroyed the enemy’s defences and shattered the myth of their military might.”
The PM highlighted that Pakistan “established a new norm” in its relations with India, warning that the country will never let its neighbour “behave in an arrogant and haughty manner”. He also reiterated that Pakistan would not allow India to continue weaponising the IWT, calling it a “red line”.
“We need to convert this moment into something this nation has been longing for — that Pakistan’s progress … would not only be witnessed [and] enjoyed by [the people], but that the world at large would respect Pakistan’s hard work,” he added.
‘Sacrifice, blood and sweat’
Noting Pakistan’s victory on the battlefield, the prime minister said that the country “faces major challenges” on the economic front.
Highlighting economic difficulties during his tenure in 2022, Shehbaz said, “International banks were refusing our letters of credit for vital imports like energy … linked to Pakistan’s wellbeing”, and the country faced the threat of international lending agencies walking away.
“As a result of that meeting in Paris in July 2023, we were able to sign a standby agreement with the IMF, which averted an impending economic meltdown,” the PM said.
He added that upon assuming office in 2024, his administration “wasted no time” implementing major reforms and making “cast-iron guarantees to lending agencies”.
“We would not shy away from undertaking difficult, tough, but very relevant, deep-rooted changes in our system,” he said. “We undertook those very difficult decisions and we were able to calm those fears of our lending partners. Today, we are witnessing the fruits of those sacrifices made by the common man in Pakistan.”
According to the PM, inflation plummeted from 38 per cent to 0.3pc, while interest rates were halved from 22.5pc in 2022 to 11pc.
“Our rupee stands stable [and] forex reserves have crossed over a billion dollars,” he said.
“These achievements, significant as they are, represent only the beginning of a very arduous, difficult, thorny journey towards progress and prosperity. On the way, we will meet huge challenges like mountains, rivers — we will have to surmount them [and] cross those rivers through unwavering commitment to our nation and our people, and that will require sacrifices, sweat and blood,” he emphasised.</p><small>2025-05-31 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31181638d644d16.jpg?r=181658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914527/iran-says-received-elements-of-us-proposal-for-nuclear-deal-amid-iaea-report-on-tehrans-past-activites' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says received ‘elements’ of US proposal for nuclear deal amid IAEA report on Tehran’s past activites</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday said he had received “elements” of a US proposal for a potential nuclear deal following five rounds of talks mediated by Oman, making the remarks the same day a report by the International Atomic Energy agency (IAEA) exposed Tehran’s nuclear activity.
Tensions between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief fell apart.
Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi “paid a short visit to Tehran today to present elements of a US proposal which will be appropriately responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran,” Araghchi said on X.
 






Iran stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium in recent months, said a confidential report by the watchdog, seen by AFP earlier on Saturday.
It said in its quarterly report that it is of “serious concern” that Iran has an estimated amount of 408.6 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 per cent as of May 17, up by 133.8kg since the last report in February.
Uranium enriched to up to 60pc fissile purity is close to the roughly 90pc level needed for atomic weapons. According to the IAEA, Tehran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to 60pc.
Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon.
In a separate in-depth report, the IAEA criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran over its scrutiny of Iran’s nuclear programme.
“While Iran continues to cooperate with the agency on matters of routine safeguards implementation, in a number of respects […] its cooperation with the agency has been less than satisfactory,” the report said.
It specifically notes Tehran’s lack of progress in explaining nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
“In particular, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the agency’s questions and has sanitised locations as listed in this report, which has impeded agency verification activities.”
Iran’s foreign ministry accused Israel of providing “unreliable and misleading information” to the UN nuclear watchdog to be used in the report.
“Relying on unreliable and misleading information sources provided by the Israeli regime … is contrary to the IAEA’s principles of professional verification,” the ministry said in a statement.
Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a landmark 2015 deal with Tehran during his first term as president. The deal had exchanged sanctions relief for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><small>2025-05-31 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31220129ec6d165.png?r=220225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914539/3-killed-in-separate-road-accidents-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>3 killed in separate road accidents in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Three people lost their lives in separate road accidents in Karachi on Saturday, according to police officials.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
A motorbike rider was killed in the Defence Housing Authority when a vehicle hit him early Saturday morning, Deputy Inspector General South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com.
He said, “The Bykea [hail-riding service] rider was passing through Khayaban-i-Nishat crossing when the an sport utility vehicle hit him. He sustained critical injuries and was transported to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) where he succumbed to his injuries.”
The police have impounded the vehicle and arrested the driver, he added.
Darakshan Station House Officer (SHO) Shahid Taj said that the victim’s heirs and the suspect had reached an out-of-court settlement and they told the police that they did not want any legal proceedings.
He added that the suspect was stated to be belonging to an influential family.
In another incident, a water tanker claimed the life of a motorcyclist in Qayyumabad.
Korangi SHO Mohammed Ali Niazi told Dawn.com, “The tanker hit the rider on Jam Sadiq Bridge. He suffered critical injuries and was transported to the JPMC where he was pronounced dead.”
The errant driver was arrested and a heavy vehicle was impounded, he added.
Separately, a trailer killed a man in Landhi. According to Malir Superintendent of Police Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar, the victim was a lecturer at a government college who was on his way to the institute when a trailer hit him at Future Colony.
Police surgeon Summaiya Syed said that he was shifted to the JPMC but he lost his life during the treatment.
The driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the heavy vehicle that was impounded by the police, the SP said, adding that a first information report was registered against the driver on the complaint of the victim’s brother.
Earlier this month, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.
In April, an employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.</p><small>2025-05-31 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/312120227438444.jpg?r=214700' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914540/pentagon-chief-warns-china-is-preparing-to-use-military-force-in-asia' target='_blank'><strong>Pentagon chief warns China is ‘preparing’ to use military force in Asia</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth warned on Saturday that China was “credibly preparing” to use military force to upend the balance of power in Asia, vowing the United States was “here to stay” in the region.
The Pentagon chief made the remarks at an annual security forum in Singapore as the administration of US President Donald Trump spars with Beijing on trade, technology, and influence over strategic corners of the globe.
China’s embassy in Singapore blasted the speech, accusing Washington of escalating tensions in the region and “profiting from creating risks of war”.
Trump has launched a trade war with China since taking office in January, has sought to curb its access to key AI technologies and deepened security ties with allies such as the Philippines, which is engaged in escalating territorial disputes with Beijing.
“The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent,” Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue attended by defence officials from around the world. Beijing is “credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”, he said.
Hegseth warned that the Chinese military was building the capabilities to invade Taiwan and “rehearsing for the real deal”.
China has ramped up military pressure on Taiwan and held large-scale exercises around the island that are often described as preparations for a blockade or invasion.
The United States was “reorienting toward deterring aggression by communist China”, Hegseth said, calling on US allies and partners in Asia to swiftly upgrade their defences in the face of mounting threats.
‘Stirring up trouble’
Hegseth described China’s conduct as a “wake-up call”, accusing Beijing of endangering lives with cyber attacks, harassing its neighbours, and “illegally seizing and militarising lands” in the disputed South China Sea.
Beijing claims almost the entire waterway, through which more than 60 per cent of global maritime trade passes, despite an international ruling that its assertion has no merit.
It has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines in the strategic waters in recent months, with the flashpoint set to dominate discussions at the Singapore forum, according to US officials.
As Hegseth spoke in Singapore, China’s military announced that its navy and air force were carrying out routine “combat readiness patrols” around the Scarborough Shoal, a chain of reefs and rocks Beijing disputes with the Philippines.
Hegseth’s hard-hitting address drew a critical reaction from the Chinese embassy in the city-state.
“The speech is steeped in provocations and instigation,” the embassy wrote on its Facebook page. “Mr Hegseth repeatedly smeared and attacked China and relentlessly played up the so-called ‘China threat’,” the statement said, accusing the United States of being the “biggest troublemaker” in the region.
Beijing did not send any top defence ministry officials to the summit, dispatching instead a delegation from the People’s Liberation Army National Defence University led by Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng.
Without referring to Hegseth by name, Hu said of his speech that “these actions are essentially about stirring up trouble, creating division, inciting confrontation, and destabilising the Asia-Pacific”.
Hegseth’s comments came after Trump stoked new trade tensions with China, arguing that Beijing had “violated” a deal to de-escalate tariffs as the two sides appeared deadlocked in negotiations.
The world’s two biggest economies had agreed to temporarily lower eye-watering tariffs they had imposed on each other, pausing them for 90 days.
‘Cannot dominate’
Reassuring US allies on Saturday, Hegseth said the Asia-Pacific region was “America’s priority theatre”, pledging to ensure “China cannot dominate us — or our allies and partners”.
He said the United States had stepped up cooperation with allies, including the Philippines and Japan, and reiterated Trump’s vow that “China will not invade [Taiwan] on his watch”.
However, he called on US partners in the region to ramp up spending on their militaries and “quickly upgrade their own defences”.
“Asian allies should look to countries in Europe for a newfound example,” Hegseth said, citing pledges by Nato members, including Germany, to move towards Trump’s defence spending target of 5pc of GDP. “Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap.”</p><small>2025-05-31 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31144617f9ff1ea.png?r=144627' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914503/arshad-nadeem-retains-javelin-supremacy-with-gold-at-asian-athletics-championship' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem retains javelin supremacy with gold at Asian Athletics Championship</strong></a><br><p>Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem threw a massive 86.40m to win gold in the men’s javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, on Saturday.

Speaking to Dawn.com after the final, Nadeem’s coach Salman Butt said: “It was a good performance, especially since this was his first competition of the season.
“If there had been one day of rest between [yesterday’s] heats and finals, he would have had more recovery and a better throw. But this is a good start,” he said.
Nadeem’s triumph marks the first time Pakistan has won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in 50 years.
Nadeem, who holds the Olympic record after throwing a monstrous 92.97m at Paris 2024, narrowly missed breaking the championship record of 86.72m.
Nadeem had a slow start in the competition, throwing 75.64m and 76.80m on his first and second attempts before bagging top spot with an 85.57m throw on his third attempt. He then threw 83.99m and 83.44m before flexing his muscles and throwing a commanding 86.40m to win gold in his sixth and final attempt in true Arshad Nadeem fashion.
All eyes were on Nadeem as he stepped up to the field for his first throw and the audience waved Pakistani flags.
‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ was blaring in the stadium as the crowd anticipated a massive throw from the javelin superstar, who is competing internationally for the first time since last year’s Paris Olympics.
Nadeem was in a state of prostation after winning gold, as his become characteristic of the 28-year-old who added another feather to his cap.
 
 

He bagged gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, followed by a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest.
Nadeem will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships, the only major tournament where he has yet to win gold.
In yesterday’s heats, Nadeem threw an impressive 86.34m throw on his first and only attempt to cruise into today’s final. Yasir qualified for the final with a 76.07m throw in the heats.
After he punched his ticket to the final, Nadeem took to Instagram to say: “As always I would need your support and prayers.”
Nadeem’s gold is Pakistan’s first and only medal at the championship.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s fastest female sprinter Tameem Khan finished 17th in the Women’s 100m heats with a 12.14.
Meanwhile, top sprinter Shajar Abbas ran a 47.17 in the Men’s 400m heats, and a 47.38 in the semi-finals, where he finished 12th. Compatriot Abdul Mueed ran a 50.10 in the heats and finished 27th.
Ahead of the championship, Nadeem was awarded Best Male Athlete of the Year by Asian Athletics.
 






Felicitations pour in
President Asif Ali Zardari said Nadeem “has once again brought glory to Pakistan” as he congratulated the 28-year-old on his win.
“He had excellent performance throughout the championship, including in the final,” the president was quoted as saying in a post on X by PPP.
“I congratulate the entire nation on this victory and pray for his success in the future.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Nadeem’s “hard work, dedication and outstanding success are a worthy example for young athletes.
“The glory of the crescent flag has increased after Arshad’s outstanding performance,” he said on X.
 






The cricket fraternity was quick to congratulate Nadeem, with T20 Vice Captain Shadab Khan calling his win “another proud moment for the nation.”
“What a throw, what a champ! Arshad Nadeem you beauty!” he said on X.
 






Former T20 captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi also felicitated Nadeem on their Instagram Stories.

The Climate Risk Index (CRI), published by Germanwatch, ranks countries by the human and economic toll of extreme weather. The latest edition highlights increasing losses and the urgent need for stronger climate resilience and action.
In the report published in February, Pakistan was ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, followed by Belize and Italy. Rehman shared the report to her X page, stating that Pakistan had been listed in the report as the country most affected by climate change.
“CRI ranks countries by the human and economic toll of extreme weather, measuring realised risk,” she wrote, adding that the report “should serve as a huge wake-up call”.
 






In a longer statement published by the PPP, Rehman regretted that Pakistan is now the most vulnerable country in the world to climate risks.
“Now it would be wrong to say that Pakistan is in the top 10, unfortunately, we are number one,” Rehman was quoted as saying. “The sharp increase in the risks of stormy rains, hailstorms [and] glacier melting shows the seriousness of the situation.”
Noting that Pakistan has suffered the most from climate change despite minimal impact on the environment, the senator asked why the country is suffering the consequences of the international community’s contributions to global warming.
“Both lives and the economy are at risk from environmental events. Why should countries like us be punished for the world’s massive use of carbon? The time for environmental justice has come,” Rehman was quoted as saying.
“The international community cannot have sustainable development without environmental justice,” she added. “Take a real account of global warming, only then will developing and poor countries be able to escape the effects of climate change.”
The senator also noted in the statement that “the imposition of an environmental emergency, policy reforms and global aid have become imperative for Pakistan”.
Pakistan has seen the effects of climate change in unprecedented floods in 2022, primarily caused by record-breaking monsoon rainfall, glacial lake outburst floods, and other factors.
The CRI highlighted that over 33 million people were affected and over 1,700 lives were lost due to the floods. It also says that climate change made the severity of extreme monsoon rainfall increase by 50 per cent.
Not only that, over eight million people lost their homes and were internally displaced due to the 2022 floods, while 1.3 million houses were damaged. The issue was compounded by a lack of drinking water availability and a surge in waterborne diseases, such as diarrhoea, cholera, dengue, malaria, and skin infections.</p><small>2025-05-31 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3116452302c47d3.jpg?r=164925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914521/pakistan-says-india-violating-global-human-rights-by-deliberate-incitement-against-its-own-muslims' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says India violating global human rights by ‘deliberate incitement’ against its own Muslims</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday said India was violating its international human rights obligations by its “deliberate incitement” against Muslims in its own territory.
The statement comes amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s allegations levelled without evidence against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
Responding to media queries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement: “The targeting of Muslims through hate speech, discriminatory actions, and state complicity is a matter of serious concern for the international community.
“At a time when restraint and reconciliation are most needed, the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes violates international human rights obligations and vitiates the prospects for communal harmony, and regional stability,” it added.
Pakistan expressed “grave concern over the alarming rise in Islamophobic incidents across India” and called upon its government to “uphold the rights and safety of all its citizens, regardless of faith”.
 






Earlier this month, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8.
These affected at least 316 individuals, “physically or otherwise”, noting that the actual number was likely higher.
The incidents comprised 84 hate speeches, 64 acts of intimidation, 42 harassment incidents, 39 assaults, 19 acts of vandalism, 14 threats, seven verbal abuses and three murders.
 






The APCR further said that 106 of the 184 hate crimes were linked to the Pahalgam attack. The highest number of them was recorded in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.
“The nature of hate crimes indicates a nationally resonant atmosphere of hostility and not local anomalies,” the civil rights group noted.
One such incident was the vandalism of Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad by the right-wing workers of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
According to Al Jazeera, incendiary music tracks labelling Indian Muslims as “traitors” and advocating their boycott were being circulated widely. Al Jazeera found at least 20 songs that “carried and amplified such Islamophobic themes”.
Besides intensifying a crackdown on alleged links to Pakistan, India has also made arrests over critical comments.
 
 

Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor with the Department of Political Science at Ashoka University, was arrested on May 18 in a case related to his comments on the military briefings during the India-Pakistan flare-up.
Days later, Mahmudabad was granted bail by India’s top court, which also ordered the formation of a special police team to probe his comments.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:12</small></div><hr>
