<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/69a3aa8355e8a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976880/board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>WHEN the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2803 on Nov 17, 2025, it expected the Board of Peace (BoP) to be a transitional administration that would coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment until such time the Palestinian Authority completed its reform programme and conditions were in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood. The resolution authorised the creation of a transitional governance administration, including a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to administer the territory and the establishment of a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza.
Three months after the resolution’s adoption, the BoP held its first formal meeting on Feb 19, 2026, in Washington. While officials from 50 nations attended the meeting, only 27, including some notable Arab and Muslim countries, have joined the BoP as members so far. Countries like China, Russia and France stayed away due to lack of clarity on the BoP’s scope. The confusion followed President Donald Trump’s statement that the BoP’s remit could expand beyond Gaza to address other conflicts worldwide. Understandably, the EU would not like the BoP to talk about Greenland, nor would India wish it to discuss Indian-occupied Kashmir. Ironically, while the BoP has been set up to discuss issues relating to Gaza’s future, it has no Palestinian member, even though Israel is one. While Trump characterised the BoP as the “most consequential international body in history”, its members are well aware that it essentially revolves around the persona of the US president and can never be a replacement for the UN, the most representative body for conflict resolution.
There were three immediate expectations from the BoP’s first meeting, nearly all of which have fallen short. Firstly, the world expected the BoP to take steps towards the solemn implementation of the Oct 10, 2025, ceasefire, which ended a brutal two-year war imposed by Israel on Gaza’s residents, killing over 72,000 people, destroying 80 per cent of its buildings and displacing 2.1 million Gazans. Sadly, the ceasefire has not been fully implemented as Israel has continued its killing spree daily, slaughtering over 600 Palestinians since the ceasefire.

Pakistan has taken a prudent position.


 

Another expectation from the BoP was to ensure that humanitarian assistance would flow in. Although assistance has started coming into Gaza to provide food, rehabilitate hospitals and clear the rubble, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has observed that the Palestinians continue to suffer “displacement, trauma, uncertainty and deprivation”. The European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management has also noted that humanitarian aid was entering Gaza “drop by drop” and needed expanded access through the Rafah crossing. More than 600 aid workers have been killed. For his part, Trump informed the BoP that the US would contribute $10 billion and that nine countries had pledged $7bn towards a reconstruction fund. However, Israel has conditioned any reconstruction on the demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas. The Israeli prime minister is keen to disarm Hamas, but fails to recognise that the Israeli Defence Forces are still occupying over half of Gaza and continue to bomb innocent Palestinians. Hamas is reluctant to surrender its arms as it fears Israeli reprisals, but is ready to hand over the administration to a committee of Palestinian technocrats.
The third expectation from the BoP’s first meeting was to work towards creating conditions for Palestin­ian self-determination and statehood. There appears to be no progress towards this pivotal issue, which must be addressed if the world wishes to see lasting peace in the Middle East. Amidst news of Israeli plans to integrate the West Bank, the US ambassador to Israel has termed the establishment of Greater Israel a biblical right of the Jewish state. This statement was strongly condemned by Arab and other Muslim states. Although the statement was later downplayed, it is being interpreted as tacit US support for the creation of Greater Israel on lands stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile.
As for the proposed ISF, five countries, including Indonesia, have volunteered to provide troops. However, troop-contributing countries would not want to be in a situation where they either fight Hamas or the Israeli forces. For its part, Pakistan has prudently decided to not commit any troops for the ISF until Israeli forces have withdrawn from Gaza and a Palestinian administration is in place. Commendably, Pakistan was one of the strongest voices at the BoP for the rights of the Palestinians, including self-determination and statehood.

The worst aspect, meanwhile, is the loss of lives on both sides, and the shattered dream of a friendly state on Pakistan’s western border as a strategic shield against India and geo-economic connectivity beyond Afghanistan and Central Asia up to the borders of Europe.
It may be hard for many to grasp the argument that Pakistan has taken a turn away from institutionalised radicalism — especially those who believe that the country is already suffering on account of religious extremism. There’s little doubt that religious radicalism had been a power elite project that was nurtured for multiple purposes — crafting national cohesion, cultivating proxies for geopolitical aims and shaping a strategic outlook in which the West and the Gulf were allies during its formative phase. Faith was also used to give the masses a sense of belonging to the state and to make them obedient to authority, rather than to grant them civil rights.

 

The power elites had crafted the system for the masses whom they sought to rule, though it held little meaning in their own lives. But they failed to achieve their aims of political and national cohesion through religion. Policies that allowed madressahs and religious groups — ranging from moderate to violent — to proliferate failed both state and society. Meanwhile, the major question of national cohesion still looms over the power elites: the Baloch insurgency, rights movements from Gwadar to Azad Kashmir, and a growing sense of ethnic sub-nationalism have weakened the system.
The 1973 Constitution was the best thing that happened to the country. It could have created the needed cohesion among the federating units and among the masses. However, the Constitution, severely distorted over the years, was unable to fulfil that utopian design. The rulers, instead, preferred to exercise power in a manner resembling the Gulf monarchies, with a worldview rooted in an ambition to become specialised security providers to the Gulf and the wider region.

Pakistan must use all means to eliminate terrorist networks operating from Afghan soil.

The enthusiasm the power elites showed after the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, looking at it as a strategic victory over a superpower, had two inbuilt dangers. First, the ideological influence of the Taliban — had the state here not changed course — would have grown inside the country, particularly among low-income groups, which comprise some 65 per cent of the population, while the rest would have gravitated towards opposing camps, mainly sub-national political, social and violent movements. This would have deepened the dangerous ideological and political divide, and the Taliban-style governance model would have become an attraction for madressahs that produce thousands of students with a narrow worldview. Second, Pakistan’s geopolitical and diplomatic space would have been eroded, a development disastrous for an already weak economy.
The Taliban’s stubbornness and short-sightedness taught the power elites here a lesson, and they quickly changed course before it was too late. Operation Ghazab lil-Haq, which the state launched after the Taliban’s attacks inside Pakistan, is a clear indication of the growing divide between the two countries. That divide runs deeper than differences in religious interpretation; it reflects the divergence between two states with distinct characters. Their future lies in pragmatic cooperation, not in ideological illusions.
If Pakistan refrains from provoking or using the anti-Taliban resistance front against them, there is a possibility of a broader shift in thinking about the use and exploitation of proxies, as was done in the case of the Taliban. This is a different world: the utility of proxies and tolerance for them at the regional and global levels are rapidly declining, as such actors often become a burden and prolong conflicts. China and the Central Asian states may not support such ventures, and without their consent, any adventurism would be costly and could prolong chaos in the region for decades.
Pakistan will have to focus on eliminating terrorist networks operating from Afghanistan using all means — political and coercive. The direction that has been set is the right one, and it can build pressure on the Taliban regime to review its attitude and policies regarding ties with globally designated terrorist groups operating from its soil.
A major challenge that requires greater attention from state institutions is the eradication of support bases and sources of inspiration for terrorists who align themselves with the Taliban and still operate in the country. This inspiration takes many forms: direct support; and the idealisation of the Taliban governance model and advocacy for implementing a similar system in Pakistan.
Though state institutions have achieved certain successes, many leading radical religious figures of the past, who once produced jihadist literature, nurtured extremist mindsets and developed nexuses with international extremist groups, have recently changed their tone, presenting themselves as moderates and patriots, while distancing themselves from the Taliban and other terrorist groups. This change is welcome, but their political economy still thrives on the business of hate and state patronage. If the state regulates religious institutions, confines them to their scholarly role, and refrains from using them for political purposes, the inflated number of such institutions would gradually be rationalised, and they would begin functioning according to their mandate.
The state has also taken initiatives to break the power of violent radical groups, such as in the case of the TLP; but much still needs to be done. The misuse of blasphemy laws, especially by organised groups, often with the support of officials, has been one of the worst forms of institutionalised radicalism. The system has been so corrupted and distorted that it has crossed the boundaries of humanity. State institutions must distance themselves from such spoilers.
This will be possible only if state institutions build trust in constitutional and democratic norms rather than remaining hostage to religiously inspired groups, which have mastered the art of shifting their position in keeping with elite interests.

His assassination removes a figure who for more than three decades stood at the apex of Iran’s political, military and religious order. Yet those expecting the immediate collapse of the Iranian system may be misreading both its structure and its history.
Ayatollah Khamenei was not merely a head of state. As Supreme Leader, he exercised ultimate authority over foreign policy, the armed forces and the direction of the revolution. As Marjai Taqleed, a source of emulation in Shia jurisprudence, he embodied religious legitimacy that extended beyond Iran’s borders. His passing, therefore, creates a vacuum that is institutional as much as personal.
Under Iran’s constitution, an interim council comprising President Masoud Pezeshkian, the judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Council is to assume responsibilities until the Assembly of Experts appoints a successor.
The Assembly must choose from among senior Shia clerics. No consensus candidate has so far emerged.
Names circulating in Tehran include Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief and a close aide to Khamenei; Alireza Arafi, who oversees Iran’s seminaries; Mohsen Araki, a longtime member of the Assembly; Mohsen Qomi, an adviser within the Supreme Leader’s office; and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ruhollah Khomeini.
Arafi, a source said, may be the favourite for filling in the space left behind by Ayatollah Khamenei.
The late Ebrahim Raisi had been widely seen as a frontrunner before his own death in an air crash. Reports that Ayatollah Khamenei had quietly identified three potential successors during earlier crises suggest that contingency planning was already underway, though the names remain undisclosed.
Despite the shock, Iran’s system is not built around one man alone. The Islamic Republic rests on multiple pillars, including the clerical establishment, security services, the bureaucracy, and an ideological base shaped by the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih.
Unlike personality-driven autocracies, it therefore has institutional depth.
During the transition phase, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is likely to play a decisive role in managing the affair. Whether as a stabiliser or dominant force, it will seek to prevent fragmentation.
That, however, does not mean friction is impossible. Economic sanctions have already strained society and fueled periodic unrest. Elite rivalries could surface as factions maneuver for influence over the next Supreme Leader.
A hardline successor would definitely double down on ideological orthodoxy. Even if a relatively moderate cleric is chosen, immediate flexibility toward the West appears unlikely, as regimes, in moments of perceived siege, tend to project strength, not compromise.
Iran’s own history counsels against premature obituaries. The Islamic Republic has faced moments far more perilous and yet endured. During the Iran-Iraq War, when the revolution was still young, Iran confronted invasion, diplomatic isolation, and crippling arms embargoes.
It answered not by retreat but by mobilising society through revolutionary zeal and religious conviction, expanding the Basij volunteer force and adjusting its economy to survive under siege.
During that period, the Hafte Tir bombing, carried out by the militant Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), eliminated 74 senior officials in one stroke, among them Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti and several cabinet members.
It was a decapitation attempt targeting the heart of the nascent revolution. Yet the system did not unravel. Vacancies were filled with speed, institutions closed ranks, and the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih was consolidated rather than diluted.
The external consequences are already visible. Iran has responded to aggression with missile and drone strikes against Israel and US facilities in the Gulf. Its network of regional allies and proxies, often described as the Axis of Resistance, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, is expected to intensify asymmetrical attacks.
Ayatollah Khamenei’s death will be framed as martyrdom, a narrative that resonates deeply within Shia political theology and could mobilise supporters from Iraq to Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia.
For Israel, the operation may have removed a principal adversary, but it also introduces new unpredictability. Khamenei, though implacably opposed to Israel, was a calculating actor who calibrated escalation.
A leadership in transition, under pressure to demonstrate resolve, may be less restrained. Multi-front confrontations stretching from the Gulf to the Levant become more conceivable.
The US under President Donald Trump has presented the assassination as an act of “justice” and even an opportunity for Iranians to reclaim their country.
Yet history offers caution. Air power alone seldom topples entrenched systems absent ground intervention or a coherent internal uprising. Instead, external attack often consolidates ruling elites and blunts domestic dissent, at least in the short term.
The strategic gamble is therefore immense. If retaliation expands to target US assets across West Asia, Washington could find itself drawn deeper into a conflict without a clear political end state.
Moreover, with the erosion of deterrence, cycles of strike and counterstrike may harden into a wider war. And if the Islamic Republic survives, as seems probable in the near term, it may emerge more securitized and more distrustful.
Khamenei’s assassination has closed one chapter in Iran’s revolutionary history, but it does not automatically open another aligned with the ambitions of those who ordered the strike. Instead, it ushers in a period of uncertainty.
The Islamic Republic is wounded but not necessarily weakened and the region is unsettled and more combustible. The world may soon discover that removing a man is far easier than reshaping the order he helped build.</p><small>2026-03-01 04:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976879/a-new-war' target='_blank'><strong>A new war</strong></a><br><p>UNLESS there is an immediate diplomatic breakthrough, the joint Israeli-American aggression against Iran launched on Saturday morning has the potential to create a maelstrom across the Middle East and beyond. Already hostilities have spread, as the Iranians, along with lobbing missiles at Israel, have also hit American military facilities in several Gulf states, just as they threatened they would in the run-up to this unfolding disaster.
For Iran’s rulers, this is the third time they have been double-crossed by US President Donald Trump. The first time was when Mr Trump withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, the second when America joined Israel in the 12-day war last year. On Thursday, after talks in Geneva, it had seemed that things might be moving towards a resolution, particularly on the nuclear issue, with the Omani foreign minister saying that “peace … is within our reach”. But clearly, the US and Israel had other ideas.
Mr Trump has referred to himself as a man of peace, claiming that he has stopped eight wars, and saved tens of millions of lives by intervening during the armed clash between Pakistan and India last year. While the jury is still out on these claims, his recent actions contradict this impression of himself: in other words, Mr Trump has proved to be a warmonger where Iran is concerned.
Apparently, Iran was ready to reassure the global community that it would not develop nuclear weapons, as the Omani foreign minister observed, though discussion on Tehran’s ballistic missiles was off the table. Moreover, the US kept shifting the goalposts, variably criticising Tehran’s nuclear policy, its crackdown on internal dissent and its support to armed groups in the region. This indicates that the talks were a ruse to buy time, and the US-Israeli combine was never serious about peace. Now they have a war they have long sought to fight, and how this ends is anybody’s guess.

 

Aiming for regime change in Iran, Mr Trump has said Iranian defence capabilities with be “annihilated”. But regime change may not be as easily achieved; and disaster will surely follow as it did in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq. Already there have been civilian casualties reported in Iran, with local media saying a girls’ elementary school in Hormozgan has resulted in several fatalities. Is this the ‘help’ Mr Trump promised to send the Iranian people?
If the conflict continues, there will be much more bloodshed, as well as worldwide economic chaos as the region is key to global oil and gas supplies, and a trade hub. An immediate ceasefire is required, along with a commitment to respect the territorial sovereignty of all states. But judging by their behaviour, it is unlikely that Tel Aviv and Washington will listen to the voice of reason.

The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development.
“Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said.
At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.”
He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.”
Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties.
This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy.
The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs.
In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.”
Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.”
This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents.
At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation.
The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.”
Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.”
Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.</p><small>2026-03-01 04:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/0108575416e88c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976842/40pc-people-see-pakistans-progress-on-right-track-report' target='_blank'><strong>40pc people see Pakistan’s progress on right track: report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As many as four in 10 Pakistanis believe the country is on the right track, with optimism higher among men, the upper-, lower- and middle-income classes, rural residents and people living in Punjab.
Confidence in the country’s direction has increased more than threefold from 12pc to 40pc since the current government came to power, reaching its highest level soon after the Pakistan-India conflict.
These findings are contained in the Consumer Confidence Index report for the first quarter of 2026. The survey was conducted by a market research company, Ipsos, which interviewed more than 1,000 people across the country. Although economic concerns rem­ain the most worrying, their intensity has fallen sha­rply across all indicators since the first quarter of 2024.
The most pressing issues of inflation, poverty and unemployment have declined significantly over the past two years under the government.
Asked about the current state of the economy, one in four Pakistanis said the economy was strong, with the perception led by men, youth, residents of Punjab and Sindh, and affluent respondents.
“The perception of a strong economy has jumped from 4pc to 23pc, a sixfold increase, since the first quarter of 2024 after the government took office, approaching its highest recorded level,” the report stated.
The survey revealed that only 12pc Pakistanis feel comfortable making household purchases, with higher comfort levels among youth, affluent groups, urban residents and those living in Punjab.
“Comfort in making household purchases has tripled from 4pc to 12pc over the past two years, marking steady progress during the government’s two-year term,” it said.
Regarding economic expectations, one in three Pakistanis expects the economy to strengthen, with optimism highest among youth, rural residents, upper- and lower-income groups, and people in Punjab.
Personal financial optimism has reached an almost record high of 40pc, up from 35pc since the first quarter of 2024, reflecting sustained positive sentiment under the government. When asked about their personal financial situation, 40pc of respondents expected improvement, with optimism strongest among youth, men, Punjab residents, and upper- and middle-income groups.
Comfort in making major purchases edged up from 2pc to 5pc over the past two years, indicating modest improvement.

Once Sri Lanka had eliminated Pakistan from the tournament, the rest of the match was irrelevant from a Pakistani perspective. In the end both Pakistan and Sri Lanka were losers.
Pakistan had failed to defeat any major team in the tournament before this game, and that says everything you need to know about the current standing of Pakistan in world cricket.
With three changes in Kandy, Pakistan relied on their bowlers to exploit Sri Lanka’s batting weakness. However, it was the stunning performance of Pakistan’s opening batsmen that created hope before Sri Lanka reminded the world of their own talent.
Farhan took the batting glory on his way to his second tournament hundred and to race past Virat Kohli’s record for most runs scored in a World T20.
The conditions supported his vigorous stroke play, the ball coming on nicely in pace and in line. The sense was that Farhan just needed to find some support from his fellow batsman, and here he found a willing accomplice in Fakhar Zaman.
Naseem Shah, one of the returning players, made the first incision of Sri Lanka’s chase.
He spotted Nissanka making room and cleverly produced a perfectly pitched googly that found Sri Lanka’s danger man overstretching.
The wicket started taking turn towards the end of Pakistan innings, and was now a more appetising prospect for spinners. Sri Lanka had won the toss and could only blame themselves for this slight imbalance.
Abrar rekindles hope
Abrar Ahmed, who had fluffed his lines against India, was the man who made Pakistan fans dare to believe. Full of confidence here, he slowed his pace down dramatically to repeatedly deceive Sri Lanka’s batsmen.
When Mohammad Nawaz chipped in to take the fifth wicket, and with Sri Lanka still some 50 runs short of the target that would eliminate Pakistan, hopes were high of completing a mission that wasn’t impossible..
Rathnayake had other ideas. As the rest of Sri Lanka’s batsmen struggled, Rathnayake launched into Nawaz and Shadab Khan. The ghosts of Pakistan’s inadequate tournament performance were back to haunt them. Pakistan had backed spin and spin bowling all-rounders, and the strategy hadn’t delivered.
When Shanaka plundered Usman Tariq for 13 runs in the 16th over, Pakistan were out and New Zealand were through to the semi-finals. Now, Pakistan had to somehow find the desire to win this game, and thanks to Shanaka’s brutal late hitting they almost didn’t.
Earlier Sri Lanka had put Pakistan in to bat, and Pakistan quietly expected. But nobody quite expected what followed.
Farhan and Zaman took the attack to Sri Lanka, quickly setting the run rate at 10 an over, and keeping it there. It was Farhan who generated the momentum, powerfully punching boundaries almost at will. He was also aware enough to settle for a single when it was the best option.
Farhan’s acceleration took the pressure off Fakhar in his return to the team. But once Fakhar too found his trademark strokes, Pakistan were flying.
Sri Lanka probably settled too early to defend runs by targeting width rather than seeking to slow down Pakistan by taking wickets. Both batsmen, as is the modern way, line up shots and then get their front leg out of the way to generate power. Farhan is more orthodox, while Fakhar is an innovator.
The result was a partnership of 176. At that moment Pakistan looked well set for a total above 220. After such a brilliant opening stand, the eventual target felt at least 20 runs short.
Question mark over Babar, Shaheen
In the end, Pakistan’s big decision to drop Babar Azam made no material difference to their score other than forcing the responsibility onto others. It really is hard to see how, as prolific as he has been, Babar has a future in the T20 team after this tournament.
Pakistan will point to recent improvements in performance leading up to this World Cup, and perhaps they got unlucky when their match with New Zealand was rained off.
But the hard truth is that Pakistan are short of high-quality cricketers in this format and probably the other formats as well. When the problems with Pakistan’s cricket are so systemic and deep-rooted, it seems almost academic to focus on individuals.

 

Of course that must be done, and the areas are clear. Pakistan fall short in quality of top order batting and pace bowling. The all-rounders aren’t good enough to support a strategy built on them. Then there is the question of whether the captain and a whole generation of senior players should continue in the T20 team — and, yes, this includes Babar and Shaheen Shah Afridi, alongside Nawaz and Shadab Khan.
The brutal answer is no. Pakistan must shed the deadwood that is now drenched in failure. Grow the tree again.
As ever, Pakistan do unearth talented new cricketers, but the problem is that the development of these cricketers is failing.
The PSL cannot continue to be the main pipeline for Pakistan’s cricket team across the three formats. The problems, therefore, are systemic and the challenge is complex and long-term. But what the PCB has continued to demonstrate, under every leadership and regime for the last 20 years and more, is that it does not have the patience to cure the disease at the core of Pakistan’s cricket.
Unless it does so, these disappointments will endure — and sadly failure is something that Pakistani fans are now numb too. The message to the PCB is simple: shed the deadwood, grow a new tree from the roots upwards, and make the trunk — the core — strong.
What’s true for the T20 team is also true for Pakistan cricket as a whole.
Pakistan’s main contribution to this tournament, the performance of Sahibzada Farhan aside, was to fulfil their obligations to the ICC and Sri Lanka by playing India. Is that all Pakistan cricket is — a cash cow for the ICC, albeit a cash cow that is in a sideshow?

Following the increase, the price of petrol has jumped from Rs258.17 to Rs266.17 while the HSD price now stands at Rs280.86.
According to the press release, the government has revised the petroleum products’ prices based on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority’s recommendations.

Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of the middle and lower-middle class.
While the heavy transport sector runs on HSD, its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.</p><small>2026-03-01 03:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/010836108e68836.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976835/no-let-up-as-pak-afghan-clashes-enter-third-day' target='_blank'><strong>No let-up as Pak-Afghan clashes enter third day</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: There was no let-up in fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the conflict entered its third day despite efforts by the international community to de-escalate the situation, which has claimed scores of lives since Thursday night.
The clashes started after the Afghan Taliban targeted Pakistani positions along the border in response to earlier air strikes by Pakistan in multiple Afghan provinces to target the militants involved in cross-border attacks. Pakistan launched the operation ‘Ghazb lil Haq’ in response and took out military targets across Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the armed forces continued ground and air operations against the Afghan Taliban overnight, striking formation headquarters in Nangarhar and other areas.
The headquarters of the Afghan army in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces were destroyed in targeted air strikes carried out by the armed forces, said security sources. State-run media reported that air strikes “hit two targets at the Mohmand Dara Base in Nangarhar” while Afghan Taliban posts near Miranshah and in the Ghulam Khan sector along the border were also destroyed.

Info ministry says 331 Taliban combatants killed, 104 posts destroyed so far

In a statement on Saturday, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that under the operation ‘Ghazab lil-Haq’, the armed forces have killed “331 Afghan Taliban personnel and injured more than 500 others” since the start of the operation. He said that the armed forces had destroyed 104 posts and captured 22 others. According to the minister, 163 tanks and other vehicles were also destroyed, and 37 locations had been targeted across the border.
Amid intense clashes along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, authorities across the country took a series of precautionary measures, such as hospital emergencies in areas near the border and a ban on drones in almost all parts of the country.
According to a notification, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government imposed an immediate and complete ban on outdoor drone flying across the territory for 30 days to ensure the safety of citizens and protection of public and private installations amid heightened tensions along the country’s western borders.
Meanwhile, in Landi Kotal, the authorities relocated all 37 under-trial prisoners to a lockup in Jamrud after mortar shells fired from Afghanistan fell in the nearby tehsil offices compound. Officials said that the tehsil offices compound was earlier vacated, with district administration officials advised to work from home. The ‘open war’ also took a toll on the Afghan refugees, as the state authorities intensified their crackdown against them.
Claim rejected
The information ministry rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar.
The ministry’s fact-check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”.
“The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said.
A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, Reuters reported, adding Wash­ington hoped the situation would not escalate further.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that “our cup of patience has overflowed” and described the fighting as “open war”, warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks.
According to Reuters, Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim.
Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict “will be very costly”, and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged.
Pakistan’s military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force. In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces.

What has unfolded since Saturday morning has instead signified a shift in objective, in tactics, in timing and in political framing of this long-running conflict bet­ween the US and Israel, and Iran.
The US-Israel war aga­inst Iran has, since the last 12-day confrontation, mo­­ved from deterrence management to regime change and this transformation will determine the direction of this confrontation.
Only days ago, diplomacy was not dead. Under Omani mediation, discussions were progressing and technical talks involving the International Atomic Energy Agency were scheduled for Monday. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Al Busaidi, had publicly spoken of near agreement on Iran not producing nuclear weapons, down-blending of existing stockpiles, not stockpiling in future and IAEA inspection and verification mechanism.
Moreover, despite Iran’s reluctance to discuss its support for regional non-state actors and its missile programme, there was an understanding that Tehran would discuss that with regional countries. By all standards, that was not empty signalling. Tehran may not have agreed to surrender, as US President Donald Trump wanted, but had almost agreed on a structured compromise.

Endurance, not spectacle, appears to be the guiding principle for Iranian leaders

The shift, however, began when rhetoric from Washington moved beyond enrichment caps and verification mechanisms. As President Trump spoke in terms that blurred nuclear rollback with political change inside Iran, it was clear that the goal post had been shifted.
Against that backdrop, the US and Israel launched strikes against Iran.
During the June 12-day war, the strikes were limited to degrading missile depots and eliminating military top brass for operational decapitation. This time, the targeting pattern suggested something deeper as sites linked not only to military command but to the political leadership, including buildings associated with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian, were struck right at the start, signalling a widening of intent.
The difference is not that leaders were targeted in both wars; rather, it is about which layer of leadership and with what political implications.
The timing was also telling. Previous Israeli operations occurred under the cover of darkness, whereas this round began in broad daylight. It was meant to maximise disruption and expose the collapse of the system; in other words, strikes were designed for overt shock, not attrition.
The American role further distinguished this phase. During the June war, Washington initially stayed back before entering the fray to bomb the nuclear sites and then went back. This time, there was deeper operational coordination from the outset, which shaped Iran’s response.
Within hours, Iranian missiles struck not just Israel but also the US assets across the Gulf.
If the June retaliation was calibrated and largely symbolic, leaving room for de-escalation, this time horizontal escalation came early, which hints at prior authorisation and readiness.
This perception is reinforced by the maritime dimension. Saturday evening reports indicated that Iran had moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, warning vessels against passage. Introducing the long-feared Strait of Hormuz closure into the equation at an early stage signalled preparations for a protracted conflict.
This brings us to the central divergence in strategy.
Washington and Tel Aviv appear to pre­­fer compressed plans, with a quick vic­­tory involving a short, decisive campaign that eliminates leadership, degra­des Iranian military capability and avo­ids prolonged engagement. For Trump, duration carries domestic implications. A brief conflict framed as decisive stren­gthens his standing, whereas a long war erodes it. Similarly, Israel doesn’t prefer sustained attacks because of its ‘geography curse’ and the character of its economy.

 

Tehran’s calculus is almost the mirror opposite. Time can work in its favour by stretching interceptor stocks, raising energy prices and increasing regional economic pressure. In Iranian calculation if the conflict extends without the US ground involvement, Iran’s doctrine of endurance begins to look more viable than shock.
Iran’s layering strategy for missile use, deploying older systems first to saturate defences is another indication of preparation for sustained engagement rather than immediate maximal retaliation. Therefore, endurance, not spectacle, appears to be the guiding principle for the Iranian leaders.
The key question now is whether leadership cohesion in Tehran remains intact. If the upper tier fractures, the shock doctrine may succeed and the war could compress. If cohesion holds, the confrontation shifts into an endurance phase in which escalation control beco­mes more fragile with each passing day.
Three trajectories are likely: rapid containment with mediation resuming after calibrated exchanges; extended but controlled confrontation involving sustained strikes and avoiding full energy infrastructure destruction; and a reg­ional war, where proxies expand the theatre and maritime disruption intensifies.
All sides would certainly not like the third option, whereas this episode is already beyond symbolic exchange, leaving the sides with the second scenario.

The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules transport plane — manufactured by Lockheed Martin — veered off the runway at El Alto Intern­ational Airport and crashed into an avenue, destroying multiple cars and damaging trucks, local media footage showed.
Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down and bystanders could be seen rushing to grab the scattered cash prompting police to deploy tear gas to repel the hordes. Authorities were later seen setting the money alight in a bonfire at the scene of the crash.
It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses told AFP that the weather had been treacherous.

28 injured as hospitals launch emergency blood donation drive

The Ministry of Defence said it would launch an investigation into the crash.
Colonel Rene Tambo, head of the police homicide division in El Alto, told reporters late Friday that “there are about 20, maybe a few more,” casualties.
Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department gave an earlier toll of “between 15 and 16 people” dead in the disaster.
“We are recovering the bodies of these people who have sadly suffered in the accident,” he said.
Bolivia’s health ministry rep­orted that at least 28 people were injured.
Money grab ‘a crime’
Fatalities were recorded both at the airport and on the busy avenue where the plane crashed and struck several vehicles.
The Bolivian Air Navigation and Airports authority NAABOL said in a statement that the C-130 Hercules had departed from the eastern city of Santa Cruz and crashed while landing at El Alto international airport, which has since suspended operations.
The defence ministry in a statement said that “the money transported in the crashed aircraft has no official serial number… therefore it has no legal or purchasing power.” It said that “its collection, possession, or use constitutes a crime.”
The La Paz Prosecutor’s Office received reports of businesses that were also targeted by criminals taking advantage of the chaos.
“Twelve people have been arrested” for questioning, prosecutor Luis Carlos Torres told reporters.
Hospitals in El Alto also launched a blood donation campaign to treat the injured.
La Paz, at an altitude of 1,975 feet and surrounded by Andean peaks, is the highest administrative capital in the world.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened US firm Micron Tech­n­o­logy’s Semiconductor Assembly, Test and Packaging unit in his home state of Gujarat, hailing the “dawn of a new era” for India’s technology ambitions.
“When young Indians look back in the future, they will see this decade as the turning point in our tech future,” Modi told the event, which was broadcast on his official YouTube channel.
The plant will convert advanced semiconductor wafers from Micron’s global network into finished memory and storage products.
India’s semiconductor market has expanded from $38 billion in 2023 to an estimated $45-50bn in 2024-25, with government targets of up to $110bn by 2030.
New Delhi is currently developing 10 chip projects worth more than $18bn , including two cutting-edge 3-nanometre des­ign facilities in the cities of Noida and Bengaluru.
Modi said at least three other semiconductor projects would begin production soon.
“India, which is known for software, is now also building its identity in hardware,” he said.

 

The prime minister linked the launch to deepening technological cooperation with Washington, noting India’s entry into the US-led Pax Silica alliance focused on artificial intelligence, critical minerals and supply-chain security — areas where China holds considerable sway.
“The entire world wants to secure these supply cha­ins which are key for hum­anity’s future,” Modi said.
The US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, said the opening marked “India’s entry into the global semiconductor supply chain as a manufacturer nation”.
“This is just the beginning,” Gor said.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Int­ernational Airlines (PIA) suspended flights to several Gulf countries on Saturday, joining a cascade of global carriers grounding aircraft across the Middle East after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the region into a renewed military conflict and shut down major air corridors.
According to a statement by the PIA spokesperson, flights have been suspended to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait.
“These flights will not operate until tomorrow evening or until the restoration of airspace, whichever comes later,” the spokesperson said.
“PIA flights to Saudi Arabia will continue; however, their routes have been changed,” he added.
“Flights have been shifted to Boeing 777 aircraft and will reach their destinations via longer routes,” the spokesperson added.







The national carrier requested the travellers to contact the PIA call centre at 111-786-786 for information related to their flights or changes in the booking of flights.
The widespread disruption followed a series of Israeli strikes on Iran and retaliatory missile salvoes from Tehran, forcing an immediate shutdown of airspace over at least seven countries.
The conflict’s most significant impact was felt at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Dubai Airports announced a suspension of all flights until further notice, a move echoed by its flagship carrier, Emirates.
Flydubai, its sister airline, also halted operations, while in the neighbouring Emirati capital, Etihad Airways suspended all departures from Abu Dhabi until Sunday morning and cancelled expected arrivals.
The skies over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan were virtually empty on Saturday, according to flight-tracking service Flightradar24, as civilian aircraft were rerouted around a vast no-fly zone. The European Union’s aviation regulator, EASA, recommended that its airlines stay out of the affected airspace.
Oman Air has also announced cancellations and temporary suspensions of several flights due to the evolving regional situation.
Major international carriers moved swiftly to suspend services. British Airways cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until March 3. Germany’s Lufthansa suspended flights to and from Dubai for the weekend and halted routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman until March 7.
Air France cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Dubai, while Italy’s ITA Airways suspended its Tel Aviv route and announced it would avoid the airspace of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon until March 7. Wizz Air halted flights to Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until the same date.
The chaos rippled eastward, with Air India and Indigo suspending flights to the Middle East. Russia’s transport ministry said its air carriers had suspended flights to both Iran and Israel.
Regional carriers were also profoundly affected, with Qatar Airways and Kuwait Airways temporarily suspending all flights from their home hubs after their national airspace was closed.
Turkish Airlines cancelled flights to 10 Middle Eastern nations, though some Gulf suspensions were only for Saturday.
The sudden shutdown caught many flights mid-air, with a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Dubai forced to return to its origin city. Virgin Atlantic said it would temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, causing some re-routing.
Throughout the day, more airlines suspended services, including Swiss, KLM, Iberia Express, SAS, Finnair, and Norwegian. Regional operators like Air Algerie and Aegean Airlines also grounded routes. Japan Airlines also cancelled a flight to the region.

Khamenei, 86, became Iran’s highest authority in 1989, following the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
He remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.
He also survived the 2022-2023 “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.
As supreme leader, he held ultimate control over Iran’s political, military and religious institutions, shaping domestic policy and guiding foreign relations.
An article published in Al Jazeera said “critical to Khamenei’s power is the loyalty of two of Iran’s premier security institutions – the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij paramilitary forces, which have hundreds of ⁠thousands of volunteers”.

 

Khamenei upheld the conservative vision of his predecessor, Khomeini, quashing the ambitions of elected presidents who sought more open policies at home and abroad. Under his rule, authorities sidelined reformists pushing for less confrontation with the West.
He backed the 2015 nuclear deal brokered with world powers and pragmatist former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, which briefly eased Iran’s isolation. But tensions spiked after US President Donald Trump abandoned the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
Israel has long seen him as a destabilising force in the Middle East, citing his alleged backing for a network of militant allies.
When Israel and Iran fought a 12-day air war in June 2025, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to assassinate him, saying the supreme leader “cannot continue to exist.”
Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the war, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.
But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook Iran earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.
Tight security
Khamenei lived under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances were never announced in advance or broadcast live.
As supreme leader he never set foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.
Khamenei’s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim II Sung.
There had long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.
Khamenei’s right arm was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 that authorities have always blamed on the People’s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.
‘I am opposed’
Repeatedly arrested under the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei, shortly after the Islamic revolution, became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the front line during the Iran-Iraq war.
He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.
During the 1980s, Khomeini’s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri, but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.
When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic’s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts, met, it was Khamenei whom they chose as leader.
Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, “I am opposed”. But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power has never slackened.
Khamenei worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures, such as Mohammad Khatami, who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.
But in the end, Khamenei always came down on the side of hardliners.
He was believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, had public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.
A family dispute also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><small>2026-03-01 02:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01055106adfcba3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976825/how-us-iran-tensions-could-shape-world-markets' target='_blank'><strong>How US-Iran tensions could shape world markets</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, targeting its leadership and plunging the Middle East into a new conflict that President Donald Trump said would end a security threat and give Iranians a chance to topple their rulers.
The strikes put nearby oil-producing Gulf Arab countries on edge as fears of escalation grew, and Tehran responded by launching missiles towards Israel.



Here’s how the conflict could play out across world markets.
Oil spike
Oil is the main barometer of Middle East tension.
Iran is a major producer and lies opposite the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula across the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20 per cent of global oil supply passes. Conflict could limit oil entering the global market and push up prices.
Brent crude traded on Friday around $73 a barrel, already up by a fifth this year.
Some oil majors and top trading houses suspended crude oil and fuel shipments via the Strait of Hormuz because of the attacks, four trading sources said on Saturday.
William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that even if the conflict was contained, Brent might rise to about $80, which was the peak during the 12-day war in Iran last June.
A prolonged conflict affecting supply could cause oil prices to jump to around $100, potentially adding 0.6-0.7 percentage points to global inflation, he said in a note.
Wild swings, everywhere
The conflict is likely to exacerbate volatility across global markets, which have already swung wildly this year owing to Trump’s tariffs and a sharp tech selloff.
The VIX volatility index has risen by a third this year, and implied US bond volatility is up 15 per cent.
Currency markets are unlikely to be immune, analysts say.
The dollar index fell by around 1pc during the June war, CBA notes. But that fall was short-lived and unwound after three or four days.
“In current circumstances, the size of the fall will depend on how large and how long-lasting the conflict is expected to be,” CBA analysts said in a note a week ago.
“If the conflict was long-lasting and disrupted oil supplies, we expect the US dollar would lift against most currencies except the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The US is a net energy exporter and so benefits from higher oil and gas prices that would result from a disrupted oil supply.”
Israel’s shekel will almost certainly be another mover — Iran quickly retaliated against Israel on Saturday.
It dropped 5pc at the start of the June war and also reacted after Israel struck Iran’s Damascus consulate in April 2024 and when Iran launched missiles at Israel that October.
All episodes were short-lived and followed by quick shekel rebounds. However, JPMorgan said it could be different this time if the conflict and a rise in market risk premia proved more persistent.
“This would especially be the case if confrontation with Iran also triggers more intensive operations against Iran’s proxies,” the Wall Street bank said.
Safe havens do their thing
The Swiss franc, widely regarded as a safe haven in times of turmoil, is expected to face further upward pressure, creating a headache for the Swiss National Bank. It is up 3pc this year against the US dollar.
Investors could also make another dash for gold, which has had a record run and is up 22pc so far in 2026, and into silver, which has also been on a roll.
The conflict could also add to demand for US Treasuries, whose yields have been falling in the past few weeks.
The outlier has been Bitcoin, no longer seen as a haven. It fell 2pc on Saturday and has shed more than a quarter of its value in two months.
Watch Middle East markets
Trading in bourses in the Middle East on Sunday, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, will provide an initial indicator of investor sentiment. While these markets are highly correlated to oil prices, an escalating conflict could ripple through the economies.
“I suspect markets will be down if these hostilities continue through the day,” said Ryan Lemand, chief executive officer and co-founder of Neovision Wealth Management. Depending on the scale of the conflict, Gulf equities could drop by 3-5pc, he said.
Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index dropped 1.3pc in five days through Thursday, its second consecutive week of declines. Dubai’s main market, which reopens on Monday, fell in the last two weeks.
Airline and defence stocks
Global airlines cancelled flights across the Middle East on Saturday, and their stocks could be under pressure if the conflict spreads and forces more airspace closures.
European weapons makers, up 10pc this year, could see more demand.</p><small>2026-03-01 00:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01000107dbad0b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976671/pakistan-have-underperformed-says-salman-agha-after-t20-world-cup-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ‘have underperformed’ says Salman Agha after T20 World Cup exit</strong></a><br><p>A disappointed Salman Agha said his team had “underperformed” after they exited the T20 World Cup on Saturday, but held back from making an “emotional” decision on his future as Pakistan captain.
Pakistan were knocked out on net run rate despite beating Sri Lanka in their final Super Eights match in Kandy on Saturday.
“We have underperformed in the whole tournament,” Agha told reporters.
“We are out of the semis due to our failure in decision-making in pressure situations.”
Opener Sahibzada Farhan became the only player to score two hundreds in the same T20 World Cup as Pakistan posted 212-8.
But they failed to restrict Sri Lanka to 147 and New Zealand went through to the semi-finals.
“Farhan was outstanding in the tournament but none of the other batters could come up to expectations,” said Agha, who only managed 60 runs in seven tournament matches.
Sri Lankan skipper Dasun Shanaka hit 76 not out off 31 balls with eight sixes as Sri Lanka scored 207-6 to lose by five runs.
A rained-off Super Eights opener against New Zealand and a defeat to England left Pakistan needing to beat Sri Lanka by a massive margin to advance.
“(Head coach Mike) Hesson and I take the responsibility as we selected the eleven for the matches,” said Agha, who added he would not make an immediate call on whether to stand down as captain.
“I will go back and take some time to decide,” he said.
“Because at this point in time, stepping down would be an emotional decision.”</p><small>2026-02-28 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/28230917b7c1eb1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976661/pm-chairs-meeting-on-overall-security-situation-in-country-directs-authorities-to-ensure-strict-measures' target='_blank'><strong>PM chairs meeting on overall security situation in country, directs authorities to ensure strict measures</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday directed all relevant institutions at the federal and provincial levels to immediately ensure comprehensive and effective security measures in view of the prevailing situation.
The premier chaired a high-level review meeting in Lahore on the overall security situation in the country, according to the report.
The development comes in the wake of Pakistan launching  Operation Ghazab lil-Haq after the Afghan Taliban opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that all institutions must discharge their responsibilities with mutual coordination and complete harmony.
The participants of the meeting informed the prime minister that all security agencies were on alert in light of the current situation and that all necessary measures were being taken to safeguard national security.
In view of the evolving situation in Iran, which was struck by US and Israel earlier in the day, the premier directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take all necessary steps to ensure the safe repatriation of Pakistanis in the country.
He directed that they be brought back safely to Pakistan via Azerbaijan.
In this regard, the prime minister further directed the ministry to immediately contact the government of Azerbaijan.
PM Shehbaz stated that the people of Pakistan and the armed forces were fully prepared at all times to safeguard the country’s security, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“Under the leadership of Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, the armed forces of Pakistan are performing their duties in the best possible manner with national spirit and dedication,” he said.
The prime minister further said, “The entire nation salutes the sacrifices being rendered by the security forces in the war against terrorism.”</p><small>2026-02-28 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/282034563f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976494/pakistan-regrets-outbreak-of-hostilities-in-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan regrets outbreak of hostilities in Middle East</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday regretted the “breakdown of talks and outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East”.
The statement came after United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran, plunging the region into a renewed military confrontation. Subsequently, several Gulf Arab states said they were targeted by Iranian missiles after Tehran pledged to retaliate against the strikes.
In a statement, the FO said, “Pakistan regrets the breakdown of talks and outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East. Pakistan condemns the unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran. These attacks come at a time when diplomatic efforts were underway to reach a peaceful and negotiated solution.”







The ministry maintained that such a course of action “will undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far reaching consequences”.
Pakistan also “strongly condemned” the attacks by Iran against the brotherly countries of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
“[Pakistan] … stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries and underscores the need to exercise maximum restraint,” the ministry said, adding the unprovoked attacks constituted “blatant violations of the sovereignty of the brotherly Gulf states”.
The FO also said that Pakistan condemned the unfortunate death of a Pakistani national in the UAE during the “dastardly attack” and urged all sides to “refrain from any further actions that may undermine the security and territorial integrity of other regional countries”.
PM speaks to Saudi prince, UAE president, Qatari emir
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the premier strongly condemned the serious regional escalation that had taken place as a result of the Israeli attack on Iran, followed by the “regrettable attacks on other Gulf countries”.
“While assuring the Saudi leadership of Pakistan’s full solidarity and support in the current situation, the prime minister said that Pakistan would always stand with its Saudi brothers and sisters, at all times to come, and under all circumstances,” the statement said.
“The prime minister said that Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role at this difficult time and prayed that the blessings of the holy month of Ramadan would bring peace to the region at the earliest,” it said.
PM Shehbaz also took to X and said, “Pakistan stands in full solidarity with Saudi Arabia and our brotherly Gulf countries in this perilous time. We remain ready to play a constructive role for peace and pray that the blessings of Ramadan bring calm and stability to our region.”







He also spoke to UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. According to the PMO, he strongly condemned the “the serious regional escalation” resulting from the Israeli attack on Iran earlier today, followed by the “regrettable attacks against the UAE as well as in other Gulf countries”.
The premier also expressed his sadness at the tragic demise of a Pakistani national in the missile attack on Abu Dhabi, the statement said.
“He assured the UAE leadership of Pakistan’s solidarity and support in the current crisis and said that Pakistan would always stand with its Emirati brothers and sisters, consistent with the close fraternal bonds between both countries, that had withstood the test of time,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz also posted about the conversation on X.







In a subsequent post, he said he had also spoken to Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on the phone “to express Pakistan’s strong solidarity with the brotherly people of Qatar”.
“We strongly condemn the  serious regional escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran earlier today, which was followed by the regrettable attacks against Qatar as well as in other Gulf countries.
“I reaffirmed Pakistan’s full solidarity with the brotherly State of Qatar. Pakistan will continue to support all efforts for peace and stability in the region,” PM Shehbaz said.







Dar speaks to counterparts from Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar
Further, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran” in a phone call he received from the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
According to the FO, the two leaders “reviewed the evolving situation in Iran and the wider region”.







The statement said Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran” and called for an immediate halt to escalation through “urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.
Meanwhile, Dar also spoke to Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
“Both leaders expressed deep concern over the unfolding regional developments, and agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation,” the FO said.







He also spoke to his United Arab Emirates counterpart, Abdullah Bin Zayed al Nahyan.
“Both leaders exchanged views on the evolving regional situation, expressed serious concern over recent developments, and agreed to remain in close contact,” the Foreign Office said.







The foreign minister also spoke to his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, and the two “exchanged views on the evolving regional situation and agreed to stay in close contact”.
“Both leaders conveyed serious concern about the ongoing attacks in the region, including those on Qatar, and underscored the urgent need for de-escalation,” an FO statement said.







Travel advisory for Pakistani nationals
Separately, the FO also issued a travel advisory for Pakistani nationals.
“For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all non-mandatory travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” it said.
“Pakistani nationals currently residing in Iran must exercise caution, remain vigilant, minimize non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani Missions,” it said.

The advisory issued by the office of the Karachi additional inspector general of police, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “Karachi has been placed on high alert following increased military tensions between Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces near the Pak-Afghan border.”
“Police and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have strengthened surveillance and tightened security at key entry-exit points, transportation hubs, sensitive and important places to pre-empt potential security threats,” it said.
In the safety guidelines for residents and visitors, the Karachi police urged them to stay vigilant and alert to announcements from local police, law enforcement and provincial officials.
The advisory urged the citizens to report suspicious activity and immediately notify local police or emergency services if they observe unusual movements, unattended packages, unfamiliar persons loitering in sensitive areas, illegal foreigners or any other suspicious activity.
It also urged citizens to follow the directions of security personnel and comply promptly with instructions from police checkpoints or clearance operations.

 

Further, it urged citizens to verify information and to avoid spreading unverified rumours or “panic content” on social media. The advisory pointed out to a recent fake threat alert on social media related to a few shopping centres and commercial areas that caused “fear and panic” in public.
It advised the citizens to “rely on official statements from Sindh Police, local administration, or government press briefings”.
Further, air travellers were advised to leave their homes for the airport at least one hour earlier than usual due to enhanced screening, stop-and-search measures and increased security around airport and key points.
It stated that only one visitor or attendant should accompany one passenger to the designated drop off or pick-up point to avoid crowding at the airport.
Citizens were also told to carry their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) with them at all times, as they may be required for verification at various checkpoints.
“National security forces and law enforcement agencies are fully prepared to respond to threats and protect citizens. All measures are designed to maintain peace, stability, and public safety,” the advisory concluded.</p><small>2026-02-28 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2818504355dc8ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976544/uk-man-charged-with-criminal-damage-after-pro-palestinian-graffiti-on-churchill-statue' target='_blank'><strong>UK man charged with criminal damage after pro-Palestinian graffiti on Churchill statue</strong></a><br><p>London police said on Saturday a man had been charged with criminal damage for graffitiing a statue of Britain’s World War II prime minister Winston Churchill with pro-Palestinian slogans.
The monument in the central Parliament Square was smeared with red paint early on Friday and “Zionist war criminal” among the slogans written on it.
The Metropolitan Police said Caspar San Giorgio, 38, of no fixed address, was charged early on Saturday, some 24 hours after his arrest.
He had been detained within minutes of officers being alerted to the incident, according to the force.
He was due to appear at a London magistrates’ court later on Saturday.
The words “free Palestine” and “stop the genocide” were also sprayed on the statue, which workers cleaned off on Friday.
The incident prompted Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office to call the damage “completely abhorrent” and commend police for the swift arrest.
“Churchill was a great Briton,” a spokesman said.
The 3.6 metre Churchill statue has been vandalised a number of times in recent years, including during Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion climate demonstrations in 2020.</p><small>2026-02-28 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2818125308ebedc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976509/information-ministry-rubbishes-claim-about-pakistani-jet-being-shot-down-in-afghanistans-nangarhar' target='_blank'><strong>Information ministry rubbishes claim about Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and the pilot being captured.
The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”.
“The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said.







The ministry further said Pakistan’s armed forces had not reported any aircraft loss and stated that no “independent international media outlet or defence monitoring agency” had verified the claim.
“The story relies solely on statements from Afghan officials and selective media amplification,” it said.
It further stated that there was no visual proof of crash debris, the wreckage site or the captured pilot. “No geolocated imagery or satellite evidence supports the claim,” it said, adding that “in modern conflict environments, verified crashes are rapidly documented — none exists in this case”.
It said that viral footage being shared as “jet crash evidence” was from an unrelated panic situation in Afghanistan.
“Multiple videos used in the narrative are old clips being recycled to fit the false claim,” the ministry said.
It also pointed to a “misleading image” shared by TOLO News, saying: “he image corresponds to a Russian aircraft incident in Turkey in 2021”.
“Reusing unrelated foreign crash imagery is a deliberate attempt to construct a false narrative,” the ministry said.
It said that the past two days, “hundreds of fake or misleading videos linked to the India–Afghan propaganda ecosystem have been debunked”.
“The current jet claim fits into the same coordinated disinformation cycle. No credible defence analysis suggests Afghan forces possess the operational capability demonstrated in the claim,” it said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said that Afghan claims of downing a Pakistani jet and capturing a pilot were “totally untrue”.
“That’s a false claim. Totally untrue,” Andrabi told AFP.</p><small>2026-02-28 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/28151105aefb7a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976446/pta-urges-citizens-to-avoid-sharing-unverified-inflammatory-information-amid-heightened-geopolitical-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>PTA urges citizens to avoid sharing ‘unverified, inflammatory’ information amid heightened geopolitical tensions</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Saturday issued an advisory cautioning citizens against sharing “unverified, inflammatory or misleading information” in light of the recent geopolitical situation.
“In view of the prevailing sensitive national situation, PTA urges all citizens to be responsible while using social media and digital platforms,” the body said, advising citizens not to “share, disseminate, forward or upload information/content which is authentic and based upon official sources and to refrain from spreading rumours and fake news”.







PTA cautioned against sharing fake news or information “liable to legal action in accordance with applicable laws”.
“PTA calls upon all citizens to act with caution, maturity, and a strong sense of national responsibility to help, maintain stability and public confidence,” the statement added.
The statement comes against the backdrop of escalating geopolitical tension in the Middle East, as Israel and the United States launched an attack on Iran on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s armed forces continue to counter the Afghan Taliban regime’s aggression on its western border as part of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq, which was launched against the Afghan Taliban after “unprovoked firing” from across the border.</p><small>2026-02-28 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/281029214f42378.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976371/trump-directs-us-agencies-to-toss-anthropics-ai-as-pentagon-calls-startup-a-supply-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Trump directs US agencies to toss Anthropic’s AI as Pentagon calls startup a supply risk</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing the government to stop work with Anthropic, and the Pentagon said it would declare the start-up a supply-chain risk, dealing a major blow to the artificial intelligence lab after a showdown about technology guardrails.
Trump added there would be a six-month phase-out for the Defence Department and other agencies that use the company’s products. If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow”.







The actions mark an extraordinary rebuke by the United States against one of the premier companies that has kept it in the lead on national security-critical AI, threatening to give Anthropic a pariah status that Washington until now had reserved for enemy suppliers. Google and Amazon are among Anthropic’s financial backers.
The moves further set a precedent that US law alone would constrain how AI is deployed on the battlefield, with the Pentagon seeking to preserve all flexibility in defence and not be limited by warnings from the technology’s creators against powering weapons with unreliable AI.
In a statement, Anthropic said it would challenge any risk designation in court by the Department of Defence, which the Trump administration has renamed the Department of War.
“We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said.
“No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.”
Late on Friday, rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, Amazon and others, announced its own deal to deploy technology in the Defence Department’s classified network.
CEO Sam Altman on X said the Pentagon shared its principles for human responsibility over weapon systems and for having no mass US surveillance.







“We put them into our agreement,” Altman said of the points. “We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.”
It was not immediately clear whether these contractual details differed from the red lines proposed by Anthropic. The Pentagon and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
‘Nuclear War’
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Anthropic would be designated a supply-chain risk, following an impasse in months of talks on whether the company’s policies could constrain military action.
Meeting with Hegseth this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei argued for weapons and surveillance limits and irked Pentagon officials. The Pentagon said US law, not a private company, would determine how to defend the country.
The designation could bar tens of thousands of contractors from using Anthropic’s AI when working for the Pentagon. That represents an existential threat to its business with the government and could harm its private-sector relationships, said Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts.
“Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said.
Similar US action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains. Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defence Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment.
Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.
Saif Khan, who served in the National Security Council in former President Joe Biden’s White House, said the Defence Department’s action “may be the most draconian domestic AI regulation any government has ever issued.” “The Department is arguably treating Anthropic as a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI companies, none of whom they’ve designated supply-chain risks,” Khan said.
‘Killer Robots’
Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of its AI to analyse drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged co-operation last year with the Trump administration.
But theoretical “killer robots” have worried human-rights and technology activists as wars in Ukraine and Gaza showcased increasingly automated systems.
Bolder US military action in the past year has added to these concerns, said Jack Shanahan, who had directed the Pentagon’s algorithmic warfare effort Project Maven.
“People might be a little bit more nervous about no restrictions,” Shanahan said. The White House’s legal sign-off could be “top cover for anybody that does anything that would potentially result in lack of due process, civilian casualties, collateral damage.”
The Pentagon signed agreements worth up to $200 million each with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google.
Anthropic, negotiating for awards under that ceiling, had flagged concerns about the legal system’s ability to keep up with AI progress. At present, for instance, US laws do not prevent the use of technology to compile seemingly innocuous data to reveal information about people’s private lives, its CEO Amodei has said.
Anthropic’s AI has been in use across the intelligence community and armed services, and it was first among peer AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon.</p><small>2026-02-28 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/28074858e54b11e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976347/fbr-forms-committee-to-address-taxpayers-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>FBR forms committee to address taxpayers’ concerns</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mah­mood Langrial has constituted a committee to add­ress taxpayers’ issues following a meeting at the FBR Headquarters with representatives of the Pakis­tan, Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi-Islam­abad tax bar associations.
An official statement said members of the Tax Bar Associations apprised the chairman of the challenges being faced by taxpayers, particularly in relation to the super tax and SRO 350(I)/2024.
Mr Langrial assured participants that the FBR remains fully committed to facilitating taxpayers and addressing all genuine concerns on a priority basis. To ensure timely resolution, he announced the formation of a committee to examine the issues raised by the tax bar associations and propose practical solutions for their early redress.
Operations, policy and legal members of FBR’s Inland Revenue wing also attended the meeting and took part in detailed deliberations.
Appreciating the consultative role of the tax bar associations, the chair­man said their in-depth understanding of Pakistan’s taxation framework makes their input valuable for policy refinement, system imp­rovement and the promotion of voluntary compliance.
The meeting was atte­n­ded by prominent representatives of the tax bar associations, including Pak­istan Tax Bar Association Patron Rana Munir Hus­sain, Pakistan Tax Bar Association President Shei­­kh Ahsanul Haq, Lahore Tax Bar Association Presi­dent Muhammad Asif Rana, former president of Lahore Tax Bar Association Chaudhary Qamaruz Zam­an, Senior Vice President of Pakistan Tax Bar Associa­tion Sheikh Muhammad Yasin Pakistan Tax Bar As­­sociation General Secretary Tahir Mahmood Butt Lahore Tax Bar Association General Secretary Mian Asad Hanif, Pakistan Tax Bar Association Senior Vice President Faraz Fazal Sheikh, and Karachi Tax Bar Association President Muhammad Mahmood Bikiya.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has ruled that immigration authorities must record and communicate written reasons in every case where a passenger is offloaded from an international flight, holding that such action, though preventive, must comply with constitutional safeguards of due process.
Justice Raheel Kamran announced the judgment while deciding two identical petitions filed by Muhammad Soban and Ali Raza against the federal government.
The petitioners were off­loaded on Dec 24, 2025, from the Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport, Lahore, while attempting to travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on valid visit visas. They contended that they possessed valid passports, return tickets, confirmed hotel bookings, and that no criminal case, blacklist order or placement on the Exit Control List (ECL) existed against them.

 

Through their counsel, they argued that the offloading was arbitrary, unlawful and violative of their fundamental rights protected under various articles of the Constitution.
On behalf of the federal government, an additional attorney general maintained that the petitioners were neither blacklisted nor permanently barred from travelling. However, he said, immigration authorities claimed that the passengers failed to satisfactorily explain the purpose of their visit. He said the passengers had insufficient funds and doubtful hotel bookings.
The law officer argued that the action was taken under the Emigration Ordi­nance, 1979 and Standing Order No.31/2005, which empower immigration offici­als to scrutinise travel documents and prevent unlawful emigration. He further contended that the petitioners’ own pleadings referred to travelling “to earn bread and butter,” suggesting possible intent to seek employment abroad under the guise of visit visas.

 

In his judgement, Justice Kamran held that while the state possesses statutory authority under the Emigration Ordinance to regulate and prevent unlawful emigration, such authority is not unfettered.
He observed that the right to travel abroad is a valuable civil right protected under Article 15 of the Constitution.
The judge said administrative discretion must meet standards of reasonableness, transparency and proportionality.
“Even preventive measures must comply with due process requirements under Article 10-A of the Constitution,” he ruled.
Justice Kamran noted that although immigration officers may legitimately examine financial capacity, documentation, and travel purpose, no written order stating reasons for offloading was furnished to the petitioners at the time of restraint.
The absence of recorded and communicated reasons, the judge held, undermines transparency, prevents meaningful legal challenge and opens the door to arbitrariness.
While upholding the authority of immigration officials to regulate emigration, the judge issued a prospective direction, requiring the officer concerned to record brief but specific reasons in writing and provide a copy to the offloaded passenger at the earliest opportunity.
The judge observed that the petitioners may travel in the future on valid visit visas, subject to lawful scrutiny and compliance with documentary and financial requirements.
The additional attorney general assured the court that the ministry of interior would consider establishing a structured administrative review mechanism for offloading decisions to reduce unnecessary constitutional litigation.

ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”.
The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”.
“Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone.
Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”.
Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling.
Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.







Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
“Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation.
Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged.







Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said.
From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation.
China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence.
“China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.
She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects.
Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development.
“We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that Moscow was “closely monitoring this situation.”
From Europe, Britain expressed grave concern. “We are deeply concerned by the significant escalation in tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” UK Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said on X. “We urge both sides to take immediate steps toward de-escalation, avoid further harm to civilians, and re-engage in mediated dialogue.”







Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, known for his enthusiasm in mediating conflicts and a strong desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, offered a stance that diverged from his usual eagerness to resolve disputes.
In Washington, Trump suggested he would not be willing to step in, highlighting his strong ties with Pakistan’s leadership. Spe­aking to reporters before heading to Texas, Trump was asked about Pakistan’s retaliation to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban.
Asked whether someone had asked for him to intervene, Trump said, “Well, I would but I get along with Pakistan, as you know, very well. Very, very well.
“[They] have a great prime minister, a great general there … two of the people I really respect a lot,” he said.
“And I think that Pakistan is doing terrifically well,” he said.
The United Nations added its voice to the global chorus for peace. UN Secretary-General Ant­onio Guterres “is deeply concerned by the escalation of violence we’re seeing,” his spokesman Step­hane Dujarric said.
“He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and he reiterates his call on the parties to resolve any differences through diplomacy.”
The International Comm­­ittee of the Red Cross also echoed calls to protect civilians. The organisation’s president has called for a de-escalation of hostilities between Afghanistan and Pakistan, AFP reports.
ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement that her organisation was “preparing an operational response to humanitarian needs on the ground”.
