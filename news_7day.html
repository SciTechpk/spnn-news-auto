<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0110520850ef778.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938863/over-800-dead-as-60-magnitude-earthquake-hits-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Over 800 dead as 6.0-magnitude earthquake hits Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>A massive rescue operation was under way in Afghanistan on Monday, after a strong earthquake and multiple aftershocks flattened homes in a remote, mountainous region, killing more than 800 people, the Taliban authorities said.
The quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27 kilometres from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Nangarhar and Kunar provinces border Pakistan, with the Torkham crossing, the site of many waves of Afghan returnees deported or forced to leave, often with no work and nowhere to go.
The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from capital Kabul to Islamabad in Pakistan. After the initial quake, a series of at least five aftershocks followed throughout the night, with the strongest being one of magnitude 5.2 just after 4am (2330 GMT on Sunday).
More than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking, according to the USGS.
Near the epicentre in the east of Afghanistan, around 800 people were killed and 2,500 injured in remote Kunar province alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
Another 12 people were killed and 255 injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province, he added.
“Numerous houses were destroyed,” interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP.
The majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes that are vulnerable to collapse.
Some of the most severely impacted villages in remote Kunar provinces “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned in a statement to AFP.
Afghanistan’s government-run Bakhtar News Agency reported citing officials from the Disaster Management Department in Kunar that “the most severely impacted districts include Noor Gul, Chawkay, Watapur, Mano Gai, and Chapa Dara”.
 






Three villages were razed in the province of Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, the health ministry earlier said.
The Taliban authorities and the United Nations mobilised rescue efforts to hard-hit areas. The defence ministry said 40 flight sorties had so far been carried out.
A member of the agricultural department in Kunar’s Nurgal district said people had rushed to clear blocked roads to isolated villages, but that badly affected areas were remote and had limited telecoms networks.
“There is a lot of fear and tension … Children and women were screaming.
We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad told AFP.
He said that many living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghans who have returned to the country from Iran and Pakistan in recent years.
“They wanted to build their homes here.”
Images from Reuters Television showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped soldiers and medics carry the wounded to ambulances.
Rescuers were scrambling to find survivors in the area bordering Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where homes of mud and stone were levelled by the midnight quake that hit at a depth of 10 kilometres.
The disaster will further stretch the resources of the South Asian nation already grappling with humanitarian crises, from a sharp drop in aid to a huge pushback of its citizens from neighbouring countries.
Condolences
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed grief over the incident and extended his condolences.
“I stand in full solidarity with the people of Afghanistan after the devastating earthquake that hit the country earlier today,” he said.
Delegation of the European Union to Afghanistan posted on X: “The EU extends its heartfelt condolences to all affected by the recent devastating earthquake in Afghanistan’s Kunar & Nangarhar provinces. Our humanitarian partners are actively on the ground, providing critical aid to the victims. We stand in full solidarity with Afghans.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also extended condolences over the loss of life.
“Deeply saddened by the devastating earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, which shook Kabul & was also felt in various parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad. With reports confirming hundreds of precious human lives lost & villages destroyed, our hearts go out to the victims and their families. On behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan, I extend my heartfelt condolences & prayers to the bereaved families,” he said on X.
He added, “We stand in solidarity with our Afghan brothers & sisters in this hour of grief, and we are ready to extend all possible support in this regard.”
 






In his condolence message, President Asif Ali Zardari’s also said that “during this hour of grief and hardship, Pakistan stands firmly in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan.”
The statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said, “He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured and for strength and resilience of the affected communities. He further prayed that the departed souls may rest in eternal peace and that the Almighty may grant courage to the bereaved families to bear this immense loss.”
Following earlier reports of casualties, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said he was “extremely saddened by the tragic loss of over 300 lives and the many injuries”.
“My deepest condolences go out to the families who have lost their loved ones and heartfelt prayers for full and quick recovery of those injured. This immense sorrow is felt by us all,” he said on X.
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Karim Kundi also expressed grief over the “loss of hundreds of lives and large-scale financial damages caused by a powerful earthquake”.
In his condolence message, Kundi “extended heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families and prayed for the early recovery of the injured. He said the people of Pakistan stand in solidarity with the Afghan government and people during this difficult time.”
Deadly quakes
Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.
In October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.
In June 2022, a 5.9-magnitude quake struck the impoverished eastern border province of Paktika, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.
Ravaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a series of humanitarian crises.
Since the return of the Taliban, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished nation’s ability to respond to disasters.

PM Shehbaz arrived in China on Saturday to attend the SCO Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit held from August 31 to September 1. Besides Pakistan, the SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
“We respect all international and bilateral treaties and expect similar principles to be followed by all SCO members,” PM Shehbaz said at the summit today, in an apparent reference to fellow SCO member India and its unilateral move to hold the IWT in abeyance in April.
“Uninterrupted access to due share of water as per existing treaties among SCO members will strengthen the SCO working smoothly and will support the achievement of broader goals for which the SCO was established,” he stressed at the summit in China’s Tianjin.
 
 

India held the IWT in abeyance following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
Earlier this month, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz called for a “comprehensive and structural dialogue to discuss all outstanding disputes”, adding: “I will request your consideration to lead this dialogue under your sagacious leadership so that they can have its dividends as early as possible.”
The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan sought a “normal and stable relationship with all its neighbours”. “It seeks dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz noted: “Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism. And yet, to our shock and deep disappointment, the region witnessed extremely disturbing developments during the last few months.
“Pakistan supports and respects the sovereignty and integrity of all SCO members and its neighbours,” he added.
 


“We will continue our efforts, along with all SCO members and the chairman of SCO, to promote progress and prosperity in the entire region and to ensure lasting peace in South Asia,” PM Shehbaz pledged.
“Pakistan has always abided by the UN and SCO charters and will always respect the principles that will hold dear to all of us for our collective good. As a peace-loving nation, Pakistan has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy, consultation over confrontation,” he reiterated.
During his address, the premier also highlighted the severe floods that Pakistan was once again facing.
“My country is once again passing through unprecedented torrential rains, cloudbursts and massive devastation due to consequent flooding in three of our major rivers,” PM Shehbaz said, highlighting huge loss of lives and livestock, as well as severe damage to infrastructure and crops.
 
 

“We deeply appreciate the international community’s, including China’s, solidarity, sympathy and support with us,” he said, hailing the rescue and rebuilding efforts of “my brave and resilient people”.
At the outset of his speech, the prime minister noted that the port city of Tianjin, where the summit is taking place, represented “China’s core values as a connector and bridge of cultures and civilisation”.
He thanked President Xi and his government for the warm hospitality and excellent arrangements for the SCO gathering. The premier also extended his felicitations to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan on their national days today and yesterday, respectively.
PM Shehbaz further said: “For us, the SCO is a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration. China’s successful tenure as chair of the SCO is reflective of President Xi’s sagacious and visionary leadership.”
He stressed that China’s “global leadership” was exemplified not only through the bloc but also in landmark initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
‘Irrefutable evidence of foreign hands in terrorism on Pakistani soil’
At the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz also highlighted the issue of terrorism and said Pakistan had “irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands” in the Jaffar Express hijacking in March.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of at least 26 passengers, including 18 security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.
“We have irrefutable evidence of involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident, as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and KP provinces of Pakistan,” the premier said at the summit.
“Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interests must know that the world no longer buys this fictitious narrative.”
 
 

Days after the hijacking, the military spokesperson had said India was the main sponsor “in this terrorist incident in Balochistan and others before”. In April, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations had also said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.
At the SCO summit, the prime minister noted: “The menace of terrorism, separatism, [and] extremism continues to pose a grave threat to Pakistan and endanger peace and security of the entire SCO region and the SCO family.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with the fullest force at our command, including state terrorism in clear and ambiguous terms,” he added.
Recalling the country’s “great sacrifices in combating terrorism not only for its own self but for the region and far beyond”, PM Shehbaz reiterated that Pakistan had lost over 90,000 valuable lives and endured economic losses of over $152 billion.
“A sacrifice which has no parallel in history,” the premier said, adding that there “cannot be a bigger manifestation of our unwavering commitment to defeat terrorism with the cooperation of all SCO members and global powers around the globe”.
Afghanistan and regional connectivity
The prime minister also voiced Pakistan’s desire for a “peaceful and stable” Afghanistan, noting that it was not only in Islamabad’s interest but that of the entire region.
“While we remain engaged in building our ties with the Afghan leadership to leverage them as economic partners and good neighbours, we hope that this cooperation with Afghanistan and our trilateral meetings between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan will have positive results in times to come,” Shehbaz said.
 
 

“As SCO leaders, we have reaffirmed year after year the significance of enhanced regional connectivity. This requires efficient land, air and rail transport corridors to ensure the reliability of supply chains,” he stressed.
The premier asserted that the expansion of CPEC could serve as a “practical demonstration of SCO’s vision for regional connectivity and economic integration”.
‘Heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza’
During his address, PM Shehbaz also condemned Israel’s deadly attacks on Iran in June this year and its “heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza”.
“Israel’s unjustified aggression against our fellow brotherly member country Iran, a fellow SCO state, is condemnable and therefore unacceptable,” the prime minister said.
 
 

“The suffering and starvation unfolding in Gaza is a festering wound on our collective conscience. We reiterate our call for an immediate end to gruesome violence and heart-wrenching bloodshed in Gaza,” the premier said.
He underscored that Pakistan has consistently supported the UN-mandated two-state solution, which meant the creation of an independent state of Palestine with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p><small>2025-09-01 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01145443e11c73e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938911/thousands-protest-in-indonesia-as-military-deployed-in-capital' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands protest in Indonesia as military deployed in capital</strong></a><br><p>Thousands rallied across Indonesia on Monday as the military was deployed in the capital after six people were killed in nationwide protests sparked by anger over lavish perks for lawmakers.
At least 500 protesters gathered outside the nation’s parliament in Jakarta on Monday afternoon as dozens of police officers watched on. Soldiers were present earlier but left after several hours.
Thousands more rallied in Palembang on Sumatra island and hundreds gathered separately in Banjarmasin on Borneo island, Yogyakarta on the main island of Java and Makassar on Sulawesi island, according to AFP journalists around the country.
“Our main goal is to reform the parliament. We hope the parliament will come out and meet us. We want to talk to them directly, they are our representatives,” protester and university student Nafta Keisya Kemalia, 20, told AFP outside parliament.
“Do they want to wait until we have a martial law?”
The deadly protests, which began last week over MP housing allowances nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta, have forced President Prabowo Subianto and parliament leaders to make a U-turn over the measures.
Demonstrations began peacefully, but turned violent against the nation’s elite paramilitary police unit after footage showed one of its teams running over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan late on Thursday.
Protests have since spread from Jakarta to other major cities, in the worst unrest since Prabowo took power.
Police set up checkpoints across the capital on Monday, while officers and the military conducted city-wide patrols and deployed snipers in key locations. While the usually traffic-clogged streets were quieter than usual.
Hundreds of soldiers were camped at the city’s national monument, and some were stationed outside the presidential palace, according to an AFP journalist.
At least one group, the Alliance of Indonesian Women, said late on Sunday that it had cancelled its planned protest because of heightened security.
Schools and universities in Jakarta were holding classes online until at least Tuesday, and civil servants based in the city were asked to work from home.
On Monday, Prabowo paid a visit to the injured police at a hospital where he criticised protesters.
“The law states that if you want to demonstrate, you must ask for permission, and permission must be granted, and it must end at 6pm (8pm PKT),” he said.
Looting
Experts said Prabowo’s U-turn in a speech on Sunday and parliament’s gesture to revoke some lawmaker perks may not be enough to dispel the unrest.
“The Indonesian government is a mess. The cabinet and parliament will not listen to the people’s pleas,” 60-year-old snack seller Suwardi, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told AFP near parliament.
“We have always been lied to. That’s why people are always angry. Because they never met our demands.”
The Indonesian stock index fell more than three per cent at the open on Monday after the weekend unrest rattled markets.
Deep-rooted anger against police drove protests on Friday after footage of the van hitting Affan went viral. Seven officers were detained for investigation.
On Monday, Agus Wijayanto, head of the accountability bureau at the National Police, told reporters an investigation had found criminal acts committed by two officers — the driver of the van and the officer next to him.
They “could be dishonourably discharged”, said Agus, adding their ethics trial would take place on Wednesday.
The crisis has prompted Prabowo to cancel a trip to China this week for a military parade commemorating the end of World War II.
The finance minister’s house was pillaged overnight on Saturday, and several lawmakers have reportedly had their houses ransacked.
At least three people were killed after a fire on Friday started by protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar, while a fourth was killed by a mob in the city in a case of mistaken identity. Another confirmed victim was a student in Yogyakarta, who died in clashes.
In anticipation of further unrest, TikTok on Saturday suspended its live feature for “a few days” in Indonesia, where it has more than 100 million users.</p><small>2025-09-01 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/011108231e00b7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938881/crew-of-5-dead-as-army-helicopter-crashes-in-gbs-chilas-due-to-technical-fault-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Crew of 5 dead as army helicopter crashes in GB’s Chilas due to ‘technical fault’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A crew of five died on Monday after an army helicopter crashed in Diamer District’s Chilas town in Gilgit-Baltistan after developing a “technical fault”, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
“On 1 Sep 25, at around 1000 hours, an MI-17 helicopter crash landed near Hudor village, approximately 12 kilometres away from Thakdas Cantonment,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement. “The helicopter was on routine training flying when it developed a technical fault and crashed.”
It added that all crew members on board were martyred as a result of the crash.
The crew members were identified as Major Atif, who was the pilot in command, Major Faisal, the co-pilot, flight engineer Naib Subedar Maqbool, and crew chiefs Havaldar Jahangir and Naik Amir, according to the ISPR.
Earlier, Diamer Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, in a statement, had confirmed the incident, saying that the helicopter was conducting a test landing on a newly proposed helipad when it crashed.
He said that the Diamer police and rescue teams had reached the incident site to start the evacuation.
Separately, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, in a statement, said he had issued directions to impose an emergency at Chilas Hospital and ordered the immediate availability of medical staff.
He also expressed his condolences and paid tribute to the martyred personnel. “The sacrifice of the martyrs of the helicopter crash is a source of pride for the nation,” he said.
Earlier this month, a rescue helicopter crashed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, killing two pilots and three crew members. The helicopter was dispatched with supplies following flash flooding in the region.
In 2024, at least six people died and eight others were critically injured after a helicopter of a petroleum company crashed near the Shewa oil field in North Waziristan.</p><small>2025-09-01 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01142031fc11226.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938893/the-harsh-reality-of-climate-refugees-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>The harsh reality of climate refugees in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>“We left our village and came to Karachi when the floods destroyed everything. But here, surviving is a constant struggle,” lamented Abrar, 62, seated outside his house in Tent City, Hawkesbay.
His house and that of other flood victims are made of fabric, bamboo and other scraps that the migrants have assembled to create a semblance of shelter. The Tent City was established as part of the state’s response to manage and relocate displaced people across Karachi after catastrophic floods hit Sindh, first in 2010 and then in 2022, when 33 million people lost their homes to the deluge that submerged one-third of the country.
Internal displacement has today become a predominant form of forced migration across the globe. Internally displaced people are particularly vulnerable, and this is contingent on the complex linkages between migration and gender, economic distress, conflict, violence, and climate crisis impacts.
Most of the displaced people across the world are situated in hot regions, such as Pakistan, and, like Abrar, live in poor quality shelters with limited access to health services, which puts them at a high risk of exposure to extreme heat.
Pakistan is now one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the Climate Risk Index 2025. The intersection of climate change and internal displacement presents a complex array of challenges, both immediate and long-term term for cities and for the people who are forced to migrate to them.

At the same time, it also adds to the ongoing infrastructural, economic, and demographic challenges in cities like Karachi, already brimming with a population of over 25 million. These challenges are deeply interwoven across environmental, socio-economic, governance and infrastructure domains.
According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), there have been over 24.3 million internal displacements between 2009 and 2023, due to 107 disaster events — droughts, wildfires, wet mass movements and floods — in Pakistan. Floods alone have accounted for 24.1 million of such displacements.
Both the 2010 and 2022 floods triggered extensive displacements and migrations from rural to urban areas, Karachi being a major recipient here in Sindh. Even though there is no clear-cut data on displacement and the resulting migration induced by heatwaves, urban heat islands are, nevertheless, exacerbating the vulnerability of displaced people as they endeavour to adapt to new urban environments.
The long road from rural to urban
In Sindh, frequent and intense flooding, coupled with the deterioration of the Indus River Delta system, droughts and water scarcity, have triggered large-scale migrations of rural-agrarian populations into cities such as Karachi, Hyderabad, and Jacobabad, where basic services are already stretched.
There are several critical challenges that emerge from these dynamics and are particularly relevant to Sindh and Balochistan. The most fundamental challenge is the absence of robust climate information systems and the dearth of resilient infrastructures, both of which can easily compound displaced people’s vulnerability.
Furthermore, given the weak coordination between national and local governments, the process for receiving, managing and reintegrating or resettling displaced people is often poorly managed or is ad hoc. The absence of a centralised registry, policy and planning framework further exacerbates these challenges.
 
 

One challenge that is often overlooked is the overcrowding of informal settlements, which largely takes place when displaced families end up living in informal or low-income settlements. In Karachi, these are typically situated along the coast, such as Ibrahim Hyderi, Rehri Goth and Lath Basti, or in peri-urban areas such as Sindhabad and Tent City Hawkesbay, where infrastructure services are largely absent.
Hence, there is increased strain on housing, water, sanitation, healthcare and transport. This can generate tensions between new migrants and the older communities that host them. Some of the migrants who arrived in Karachi after the 2022 floods perceived a difference in terms of how they were welcomed and accommodated.

“I feel like the people of Karachi have not accepted us with an open heart this time; not the way they did many of those who arrived after the floods in 2010,” said a resident at the Tent City.
This issue is intensified by the ongoing challenge of tenure security, whereby displaced people risk being evicted when they — unknowingly or otherwise — squat on public land to build shelter. Consequently, they are forced to navigate risks at various scales.
The missing piece of the puzzle
The challenges do not end here. The difficulties mentioned above intersect with existing gaps in data on displaced people migrating to urban centres. Even though migrants are documented in various surveys by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), these documents often fail to capture the scale of migration that has grown due to the impacts of the climate crisis.
For instance, the Labour Force Survey lists the causes of migration as either economic (including job transfer, searching for a job or better agricultural land, business, etc); social (education, health, marriage, who they migrated with, change or residence, etc); security/law & order situation; natural disaster; and ‘other’. However, the climate change-related disaster category is not disaggregated into what types or for how long ago.
Similarly, the Pakistan Social & Living Standard Measurement Survey (PSLM) lists only the proportion of migrant vs non migrant populations across the country, but not the causes of migration. In fact, it defines a migrant as someone who is ‘born in one district and at the time of interview living [sic] in another district’.
The national Census 2023 is less clear: the reasons for migration include job/ business, education, marriage, with family, back to home, and others. Even though, as a census, it is meant to capture such information, there is no coverage given to climate-induced displacement and the resulting migration. Thus, data-wise, it is difficult to gauge the impact of climate change-induced migrations on demographics, labour, and urban indicators.
There are also gaps in the decentralisation of service provision whereby local governments in cities such as Karachi lack the authority, resources, or at times the legal mandate to manage post-disaster migration flows effectively.
This creates a vacuum that philanthropists, NGOs or charitable organisations often fill by deploying their own models of service delivery in certain neighbourhoods, rather than in districts as a whole, simply because they don’t possess the capacity that the state holds.
Post-resettlement challenges
In the broader landscape of city and regional planning across Pakistan, urban planners hardly engage with the increasingly critical issue of integrating climate adaptation, displacement, and migration flows in terms of how these will shape development plans, especially the availability of shelter, jobs, health services and land.
Across Pakistan’s cities, economic marginalisation and livelihood insecurity feed into displaced people’s lives. They are often forced to rely on precarious, low-wage, undocumented jobs that offer no social protection. At most, they take up menial labour tasks, vending, or unskilled construction work.
“Ghurbat bohot hai idhar (there is a lot of poverty here),” explained Abdul, who lives at the Tent City. “Many people beg on the roads; others work as labourers; some women sell bangles. We used to be respectable farmers, but we have been forced to become beggars.”
 
 

Abdul’s story echoed through the weak walls of most of the houses at the settlement, showing how the loss of rural livelihoods — caused by climate change — is rarely offset by comparable opportunities in urban centres.
Moreover, there are significant mental health and social stress-associated challenges that displacement often triggers. These manifest in different ways for men, women, children and the elderly. Even though displaced people who migrate to cities often adapt to their new urban environments, the process also generates adverse experiences, intergenerational trauma, and compounded vulnerabilities — children miss out on education, play spaces, and can be exposed to malnutrition.
On the other hand, displaced women might be more exposed to the effects of extreme heat that could impact nutrition due to the absence of safe and clean water that is essential for hydration, cooking and hygiene. This risk is even more pronounced if they are breastfeeding and responsible for household chores, with exposure to heat sources.
These conditions then give way to long-term health consequences such as chronic kidney diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses and adverse effects on the body’s thermoregulation abilities. Furthermore, floods and extreme heat amplify existing urban inequalities, with migrants being hit the hardest due to the inadequate provision of safe shelter, location in flood-prone or heat-intensified zones, and lack of health services, insurance, credit, or safety nets.
Effective governance of displaced people requires, at the bare minimum, a recognition by the state of the complexities of climate-change-induced displacement, in addition to the problems encountered during phases of post-resettlement to a temporary or even a permanent site.
The case of Sindhabad
The aforementioned issues are on show in Sindhabad, an informal settlement located near the Karachi-Hyderabad Super Highway. It has served as a place of refuge for displaced people who migrated to Karachi during the 2010 and 2022 floods.
Typically, people here live in makeshift shelters and with limited access to water, sanitation, electricity, primary healthcare and education. According to the residents, they convinced PBS representatives who were conducting census surveys around their neighbourhood in 2023 to include their settlement in the assessment.
 

Sindhabad, 2023. — photo by authors

Today, Sindhabad has a population of 152,381, with an average family size of five persons per household. Given that, on average, families have three children, there are approximately 91,428 children out of school in the locality.
The problems of inaccessible infrastructure are pervasive, which often leads to violent outcomes as residents navigate a precarious route to access water.
“Here, you have to sacrifice your life just to get water,” said Preeti, 45.
“Two years ago, we lost our daughter because she was crossing the highway to get water. A speeding truck hit her and her friend … my daughter died on the spot, and her friend was disabled,“ the grief-stricken mother recalled.
Preeti’s words reveal the brutal reality that displaced people must face at times, compelled to find water as they adapt in perilous environments where essential services are often absent or located far away.
Thinking about effective policy
Despite these glaring ground realities, there is limited solid data available at the urban level on internal displacement and the ensuing migration driven by climate crisis impacts in Pakistan.
Local governments often rely on voluntary registrations, making targeted planning and relief provision difficult across cities. There is limited disaggregation by gender, age, ethnicity or vulnerability levels, and the absence of integrated data systems between agencies such as the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and urban planning departments.
 
 

Even though a positive step has been taken at the national level in terms of establishing a Global Climate-Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad, which is dedicated to producing research on Pakistan, there is still an urgent need for clear-cut, cohesive interventions for policy action.
Here are some necessary actions, at the bare minimum, to tackle the challenge of climate-change-induced internal displacement and migration for immediate as well as long-term planning for Pakistan’s cities.

Legal and institutional framework: develop a national framework for climate change-driven displacement and migration, and recognise the different kinds of climate migrants. Develop a spatial database of migrant populations disaggregated by socio-demographic indicators, for relief purposes
Urban planning and adaptation: strengthen urban planning with climate adaptation and inclusive zoning, including resumption of work on the Internal Migration Policy and introducing District-level Climate Action Plans
Housing and basic services: invest in climate-resilient housing and services in informal settlements, learning from and enhancing already existing practices and materials
Data and monitoring: improve data collection on internal displacement and establish mandatory climate migration registration in all host cities

The rules defined for the approval of private housing schemes by various authorities are either not being implemented or enforced when it comes to the area prone to floods.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda).
There is also a disparity in the approval mechanism between different authorities, especially Ruda. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) follows the Private Housing Scheme Rules 2014 (updated), under which (rule-7) says the land proposed for any housing scheme or land subdivision cannot be approved if it doesn’t fulfill certain requirements. One of them is that the land must be out of the flood-prone area. The tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) also follow the same rules in areas within their jurisdictions.

Disparity muddies the water in different authorities’ approval mechanisms

But on the other hand, Ruda — an authority having territorial jurisdiction carved out in 2020 by the then PTI-led government covering a 46km stretch along the river with 132,000 acres and 960 sq-km land — interprets its Ruda Private Housing Scheme Rules 2021 differently. However, it has the same conditions for the approval of housing schemes as the LDA or TMAs.
 
 

“It is very confusing that Ruda may accord approval to housing schemes in flood-prone zones without an NOC from the irrigation department. But the LDA and TMAs don’t approve schemes if its land exists in flood-prone regions identified by the irrigation department,” wonders an official source in the Punjab government.
The recent flooding in various housing schemes approved by Ruda shows that if its own rules were followed in true letter and spirit, the massive devastation seen in various approved and unapproved housing schemes could have been averted.
“I think Ruda’s focus is on approving and regulating housing schemes instead of on one of its most important jobs i.e. building river training works, embankments, barrages, river channelisation among others. In my opinion, Ruda should have developed the aforementioned infrastructure first and then accorded approval to housing schemes,” deplores an officer, who requested not to be named.
“I am really surprised as to how the housing schemes in Ruda, which already exist in the flood plains as per the irrigation department, can be developed,” he said. He also criticised LDA and TMA for keeping mum on the mushroom growth of housing schemes, mostly illegal, in the flood-prone areas near Ravi before the existence of Ruda. “Why had the LDA and TMAs failed to stop such malpractice?” he questioned.
However, an LDA officer, on the condition of anonymity, claimed the authority had taken stern action against illegal housing schemes. “We took very serious action against various housing schemes in the past. These included declining approval for illegally extending portion of a housing scheme on the Multan Road. Similarly, we carried out several demolition operations in another illegal housing scheme near Chuhng on Multan Road,” he argued.
A spokesperson of Ruda, when contacted, said, “Ruda, having land in Lahore and Sheikhupura, inherited as many as 103 illegal housing schemes and land subdivisions from LDA and the TMAs. Besides these there were some other schemes that already had approval for a phase or the initial piece of land measuring 100, 200, 300 kanals, but hadn’t obtained approval for their extensions. Such societies developed extensions unlawfully that showed weak enforcement by their then regulators”.
When asked about development of housing schemes in the area prone to flooding, he claimed that the ongoing river training works and embankments would completely eliminate the risks of floods. He said the authority also bound developers to ensure construction of flood protection embankments on their before giving them the final approval.
On the question of giving approvals to housing schemes without the NOC from the irrigation department, the spokesman said, “There is no need for an NOC from the irrigation department as the authority gives approval as per its master plan that guarantees safeguards from floods.”
The spokesperson said that despite Ruda inheriting already existing housing schemes, its teams were doing their best to regulate all of them. Several illegally developed schemes have huge populations that could not be relocated due to various legal, administrative and livelihood issues.
When asked why Ruda focused on according approvals instead of focusing on quickly completing river training works to mitigate floods, he said that the river training works had already been completed in a 7km area onward from Ravi Syphon. He claimed, “You can see that wherever we completed our works, the flood didn’t affect anyone”. The fees received from housing scheme developers were being spent on the ongoing development works in Ravi, he added.
To another question, he said enforcement teams had carried out several operations in the Ruda project area against illegal housing schemes. He claimed that when Ruda’s flood adaptation work was completed, the remaining area would be completely safe.
Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, who has been under fire after his housing scheme — the ParkView Housing society — was flooded from Ravi, released a video on social media on the issue. He said that he acquired the housing scheme through a bank auction in 2010 along with all the NOCs and approvals from relevant government bodies, including LDA as Ruda was established later.
 






He also criticised Ruda for not completing the barrages, embankments and other protective structures in the area. He said that it was Ruda’s responsibility to safeguard the area from floods. He said the authority charged housing societies for building protective structures.
He claimed that despite collecting all the charges, Ruda had not made a single road, embankment, lake or barrage in the area.According to former LDA chief engineer Dr Habib ul Haq Randhawa, who also specialises in environmental sciences, river routes whether old or new should not be blocked through urban development, commercial regeneration or for any purpose whatsoever. During normal flow, he said, a river could be temporarily diverted with the help of embankments.
“But extreme flooding will damage such structures, besides increasing the intensity of the flood. Therefore, we should refrain from all kind of developments in the river-influenced areas which are prone to flooding even only once a decade,” Dr Randhawa said while talking to Dawn.
“In the river routes adjacent to cities, a delicate relationship exists between humans and the ecosystem. Government agencies should only allow sustainable town planning having the least impact on the river ecosystem and its flow,” he said.
He suggested to conduct a comprehensive report delineating each riverbed and flood influence. He said intensive plantation should be done in the vacant riverbeds as it curbed flash flooding from the rivers. “The riverbeds must have margins wide enough to grow and shrink without endangering the population. Native vegetation and classic riparian forests should be grown there. These steps help to reduce the waterflow and flooding,” Mr Randhawa said.

The 13th edition of the women’s showpiece 50-over tournament will begin on Sept 30. Pakistan is set to play its matches in Sri Lanka following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, which resulted in a “hybrid model” being decided upon.
The overall prize money at the eight-team marquee tournament totals $13.88 million — a monumental rise of 297 per cent from $3.5m at the last edition held in New Zealand in 2022, ICC said in a statement.
The total prize pot eclipses that at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup from two years ago in India, which had total prize money of $10 million.
“The announcement aligns with ICC’s strategy to amplify the growth of women’s cricket and a decision to introduce pay parity was announced ahead of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024,” ICC said.
 






The winners of the 13th edition of the Women’s Cricket World Cup will receive prize money of $4.48 million — a 239pc increase from the $1.32m awarded to Australia in 2022.
“Meanwhile, the runners-up will receive $2.24m, an increase of 273pc in comparison to the $600,000 England won three years ago. The two losing semi-finalists will take home $1.12m (up from $300,000 in 2022) each.
Each group stage participant is guaranteed to earn $250,000 while each group-stage win will get the victors $34,314.
In the second half of the final table, the teams finishing fifth and sixth will take home $700,000 each and those in seventh and eighth place will earn $280,000.
“This announcement marks a defining milestone in the journey of women’s cricket,“ ICC Chairman Jay Shah said.
“This four-fold increase in prize money is a landmark moment for women’s cricket and reflects our clear commitment to its long-term growth.

“Our message is simple, women cricketers must know they will be treated on par with men if they choose this sport professionally.

“The uplift underscores our ambition to deliver a world-class ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup and to inspire the next generation of players and fans.
“Women’s cricket is on a remarkable upward trajectory, and with this step we are confident the momentum will accelerate.
“We call upon all stakeholders, fans, media, partners, and Member Boards, to join us in championing the women’s game and ensuring it receives the recognition and respect it deserves.”</p><small>2025-09-01 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01095053a766292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938835/floods-will-keep-45-lahore-schools-shut-after-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Floods will keep 45 Lahore schools shut after holidays</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: While announcing the reopening of all other schools in Lahore on Monday (today) after the summer vacations, the District Education Authority (DEA) Lahore said that 45 schools will remain closed due to flooding or their current use as flood relief camps.
The schools that will remain closed are primarily located in severely flood-impacted areas, including Shahdara, Saggian, Maraka, Chung, Manga, and Bund Road.
The affected institutions include 33 government schools, three schools managed by the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), one school under the Punjab Education Initiative Management Authority (PEIMA-PSSP), and eight private schools, according to an order issued by the deputy commissioner.
Temporary closure also affects specific institutions, including Government Higher Secondary School Maraka Quarter, Government High School Shahdara Mor Farakh Abad, Government Higher Secondary School Niaz Baig, and Government Central Model School No. 2 Rattigan Road.
Private institutions in the Tehsil Raiwind area, including British Grammar School, The Heaven School System, and Dar-e-Arqam Manga Mandi, will also remain shut.

In the tournament being played as warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts Sept. 9 — Pakistan have started with thrashings of Afghanistan and UAE thanks to a number of players chipping in with impactful contributions.
After seasoned pacer Haris Rauf and skipper Salman Ali Agha led Pakistan to a 39-run win over Afghanistan in the opener, Saim Ayub and Hasan Nawaz himself scored half centuries each to see the side down UAE by 31 runs.
The UAE fixture saw Pakistan cross the 200-mark as Hasan Nawaz launched a late onslaught after opener Saim Ayub had set the stage. Experienced fast bowler Hasan Ali then wrapped up the proceedings with 3-47 as UAE’s Asif Khan’s blistering 77 off 35 went in vain.
Under white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Pakistan are building up to next year’s T20 World Cup without now discarded senior pros Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and Hasan Nawaz said the young team was prepared for the upcoming challenges.
“You see the youngsters in front of you, all of them work very hard, even in the off-season,” he told reporters after the match on Saturday.
“I honestly feel this is Pakistan’s best T20 team … the plan is to win the tri-series and then, god-willing, the Asia Cup as well.”
 






Hasan Nawaz, coming in at number six, smashed 56 off 26 – a knock studded with six sixes and two fours – to boost Pakistan to 207. For the Layyah-born right-hander, his freedom to go big came due to Saim’s knock for 69 off 38 (seven fours and four sixes).
“In the beginning, Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan had already set the tone,” he said.

“So, my mindset was that we should now aim for a bigger target. There wasn’t much time to settle, so the plan was to cross 200. I just played according to that plan.”

Pakistan shuffled their bowling line-up to bring in Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris — the latter duo having played against Afghanistan.
Hasan Nawaz said the changes pointed towards a changing culture, where no players are considered second choice.
“I don’t see it as ‘bench strength’ because for me, all our players are equal,” noted the 23-year-old.
“Hasan Ali, for example, is a senior player — you can’t call him ‘bench strength’.
Pakistan’s will face Afghanistan again in their third tri-series match on Thursday. The tournament’s final is set for Sept. 7.

The report, published by the government on Monday, said photo-based age estimation products were broadly accurate, fast and privacy-respecting but noted worsening results for people near the age minimum of 16.
The findings foreshadow a mixed experience once the ban takes effect in December: Caucasians three years over the age cut-off can expect minimal disruption, but non-Caucasians and teenage girls face challenges.
The experience may also be more complicated for social media platforms from Meta’s META.O Instagram to Alphabet’s GOOGL.O YouTube, which, under the law, must show they are taking reasonable steps to block users under 16 or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).
The trial found high accuracy for people over 19, but those up to three years on either side of the cut-off were in a “grey zone where system uncertainty is higher”.
Users aged 16 had an 8.5 per cent chance of being estimated as underage, so they might need to be “diverted to supplementary assurance methods, such as ID-based verification or parental consent”, the report said.
“While systems generally performed well across diverse user groups, some showed reduced accuracy for older adults, non-Caucasian users and female-presenting individuals near policy thresholds,” the report added.
Social media experts said the report raised questions about whether the ban could work in three months.
“It seems like there are a lot of variations in accuracy,” said Justine Humphry, a media researcher at the University of Sydney who specialises in online safety.
“That variation is concerning, with the tight schedule for the introduction of a system that will need to be robust and working by the end of this year,” she added.
Communications minister Anika Wells said the report proved that “while there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to age assurance, this trial shows there are many effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded”.</p><small>2025-09-01 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/01095305b5a7959.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938871/alcaraz-djokovic-stroll-into-us-open-quarter-finals-as-sabalenka-cruises' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz, Djokovic stroll into US Open quarter-finals as Sabalenka cruises</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic motored into the quarter-finals of the US Open on Sunday as reigning women’s champion Aryna Sabalenka kept her title defence firmly on track.
Spanish second seed Alcaraz and tennis icon Djokovic — who are on course to meet in the semi-finals — both recorded straight-sets wins on the Arthur Ashe Stadium main court.
Five-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz overpowered France’s Arthur Rinderknech 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 and has not dropped a set to date at the championships.
 






“I think my style of tennis suits pretty well the energy here in New York,” the 22-year-old said.
“The energy is special playing the day session, playing the night session.
It doesn’t matter, people are always there. I love it and I think that’s why I play my best tennis here,” he added.
Alcaraz will face Czech 20th seed Jiri Lehecka in the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
Lehecka reached the last eight of a Grand Slam for only the second time after battling past veteran Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, winning 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.
Djokovic, 38, continued his latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title with a brisk 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 defeat of unseeded German Jan-Lennard Struff.
“It definitely helps if you serve well. I think I had a great serving performance last round and also tonight,” said Djokovic.
“That helps make it easier on the court.” Djokovic faces a quarter-final on Tuesday against fourth seed Taylor Fritz, the lone American man left in the draw.
 






Fritz sprinted into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 defeat of the Czech Republic’s Tomas Machac in 1hr 38min.
Fritz is carrying hopes of being the first US men’s Grand Slam champion since Andy Roddick in 2003 following the exits of fellow seeds Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe.
But Fritz will head into his quarter-final against Djokovic with history stacked against him. Djokovic has won all 10 of their past meetings, including a 2023 quarter-final win at the US Open.
“I think the first, almost like seven or eight times I played him, I probably just wasn’t a good enough player to really have that much of a chance,” said Fritz.
“I think only the last couple times we’ve played I think I’ve been this just better player that can, you know, I’d say compete and have chances.”
Sabalenka balance
In the women’s draw, Sabalenka never looked troubled in a 6-1, 6-4 defeat of Moldova-born Spaniard Cristina Bucsa, ranked 95th in the world.
Sabalenka has now reached the quarter-finals or better at 12 straight Grand Slam tournaments, a consistency she attributes to striking a balance in her life on and off the court.
“I’m super proud, I think that’s an incredible achievement,” Sabalenka said.
“I think for me the key was balancing on and off-the-court life. I think I’ve done a great job on balancing really hard work and also great recovery and some fun time outside of tennis court. I think that’s been the key.”
Sabalenka faces a quarter-final against the Czech Republic’s Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, who upset ninth seed Elena Rybakina 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 in the late game on Arthur Ashe.
In other women’s draw action on Sunday, another Czech, unseeded former French Open and Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, conjured a remarkable escape to oust Taylor Townsend, saving an incredible eight match points before digging out a 1-6, 7-6 (15/13), 6-3 victory.
 






Krejcikova fought off a match point on her own serve at 5-4 down in the second set, and then somehow survived seven match points in an enthralling tie-breaker to move on.
“What a match,” said Krejcikova, who revealed she had wondered if she would ever play tennis again after missing the opening months of the season with a back injury.

“I was sidelined for six months and didn’t know if I would ever play again.
I’m super happy I can be here.”

Krejcikova will face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals.
Pegula, beaten in the final last year, advanced to the last eight after breezing past compatriot Ann Li 6-1, 6-2 on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.</p><small>2025-09-01 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/010926477b814f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938837/pakistan-suspends-mail-to-us-amid-tariff-hike' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan suspends mail to US amid tariff hike</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: More than 25 countries of the world, including Pakistan, have temporarily suspended mail delivery to the United States after the US imposed new taxes and duties.
Because of this situation, the Pakistan Post has also stopped delivering booked mail to the US because it fears it will be returned under the new US rules.
The US government has suspended the previous duty-free facility under an executive order number 14324 on July 25. The US move has severely affected postal communications to the US worldwide because now all types of mail delivery to the US will have to pay duties and taxes under the new system.
 
 

All major countries of the world, including China, the UK, Japan. Austria, Australia, New Zealand, India, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, have temporarily stopped mail delivery to the US because airlines have also shown their inability to deliver mail.
The countries hit by the US move have taken up the matter with the US through the Universal Postal Union, a UN agency, which is taking steps to resolve the dispute.

He is accompanied by his wife, a toddler daughter and around a dozen members his family, who have come to the camp in the hope of getting some relief goods.
“The flood hit our village, Nagar, about 10 days ago, but the water did not reach our homes until three days back. On Thursday, it surrounded my house and the rest of my neighbourhood. We could not leave on our own because there was water all around the village.”
“I kept calling the helpline, as well as a welfare organisation, but despite promises that they would send the boat, help arrived today after three days. Now, tell me where to go from here?” he asks, pointedly.
Javed’s daughter has a fever and she has developed a skin allergy due to exposure to rain and floodwater. His niece and wife also have similar symptoms, so they make a beeline for the medical camp, where a doctor examines them and gives them some medicine.
When asked where they they will go from here, Javed says they have to make it to their relatives in Bhai Pheru. “But I don’t know how to reach Kasur from here,” he says, looking around for help.
A rescuer tells him that their duty is to evacuate them from flooded areas; they cannot promise further conveyance.
Javed’s is one of the many families who were rescued and brought to the relief camp near the Talwar post. The border with India can be seen across the huge body of water that spreads as far as the eye can see.
This site has become an assembly point for flood-hit people from around 16 villages, the last Pakistani settlements before the border. Now, they are all inundated with water from the River Sutlej.
The meandering Sutlej flowing alongside lush green rice fields: this is the sight that greets us on our way to the Ganda Singh border.
 
 

Initially, as we head down the main road, there is no sign of flooding. But as the village of Mahalam Kalan nears, around 15km from Ferozepur Road, the presence of Rangers bunkers and military personnel indicates that something is up.
At Rajiwala Araiyaan, the floodwater comes into view, along with a hullabaloo of activity, with hordes of flood-affected people and their cattle gathering in groups as relief activities are in full swing.
It has been two weeks since waters from the overflowing Sutlej first hit this area, but rescue boats are still busy ferrying those stranded in nearly villages.
A medical camp has been established near the Talwar Post, so that flood victims can receive first aid before they head out, most seeking shelter with relatives in nearby towns, or in relief camps.
The embankment at Rajiwala Road, on the edge of the floodwaters, is quite muddy due to fresh rain. Here, we see about 50 sheep, and Salman – a young man in his 20s – tending to them. He tells us he brought his animals to safety in a rickety boat around 11 days ago.
“There is nothing left in our houses. All we have were these animals. We are keeping the sheep here, but we have sent cows and other large animals ahead for fodder. There is nothing here. We don’t even have fodder for the sheep. We are arranging everything on our own, including food.”
He says there were 150 houses in his village, all of which were empty by the time they left. The authorities are preventing anyone from going back, so most people are understandably quite anxious about the state of their homes.
The main concern here is not just with people or property; it is the animals. Most of the flood-hit villagers are farmers who depend on their cattle for their livelihood. They cannot simply leave them behind, and relocating them to far-flung places is not feasible.
Mushtaq and Shahid, from the Bhikhiwind village, have also tethered their cows and buffaloes near the relief camp. They point to their village from where they sit; there is nothing there but deep, unnavigable waters.
They say that in the past, the water would reach their village, but it never breached their homes. This year, they said, there was more water than they had ever seen in their lives.
There were 25 families living in Bhikhiwind, all of whom have now been evacuated.
Around a fortnight ago, when they first evacuated, one man from each family stayed behind to protect their animals and property. However, law enforcement forced these stragglers out too, and now the people complain they have no support from the government, either in arranging food for themselves or fodder for their animals.
When we head over to the relief camp set up in the Rajiwala school, the guards don’t let us enter.
Amir Ali, a policeman deployed at the camp, says that residents of around 16 flooded villages had been brought to the camp. If people don’t leave their flooded villages and homes, the police brings them over forcibly, he says.
But the women from Bhikhiwind tell us that the day the army chief visited the area, they were enrolled at the camp. However, they did not receive any food, despite waiting the entire day.
The disappointed families say that they don’t expect anything from the government now. “Only Al-Khair and Al-Khidmat Foundation gave us some food,” says Mushtaq.
However, officials deputed at the relief camp deny these allegations. “Many people from the villages which are not affected by flood also approach the camp to demand food and fodder. We need to check their CNICs and seek the evidence of animals and family members,” said an official.
Muhammad Farooq has been voluntarily operating a raft (locally known as a Baira) since the flood hit. When we meet him, he is bringing ashore a motorcycle-rickshaw, a couple of heads of cattle, as well as people from the villages of Changa Singh and Dhupsari.
He says he gets diesel from the deputy commissioner’s office to run his Baira, which he uses to transport people, their animals and other heavy loads to the camp.
Asif, a resident of Changa Singh, is disembarking from Farooq’s raft as we arrive. He has just returned from a visit to his inundated village, which he left about eight days ago.
When they left, some elders were left behind to look after the houses, and every couple of days, someone returns to check on them. On this trip, Asif spent the night trying to save his family’s wheat stocks, placing them on the rooftop and covering them up to protect them from the elements.
But as the heavens open up, he looks crestfallen, fearing the rain might spoil their wheat too.

Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani and Adviser to the Chief Minister Dr Rubaba Buledi warned of an increasingly alarming flood situation. The provincial government was monitoring developments closely and coordinating with Sindh and Punjab to ensure a timely emergency response, they claimed.
Citizens, especially those living near rivers and canals, have been urged to take precautionary measures and strictly follow local administration guidelines.
Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Jahanzeb Khan, Nasirabad division commissioner Salahuddin Noorzai, and deputy commissioners of flood-prone districts visited vulnerable areas near the Sindh border. They reviewed the situation, assessed readiness, and coordinated with local administrations.
Nasir Majeed, chief engineer of canals, who inspected the Pat Feeder Canal from RD-418 to RD-505, was briefed by irrigation officials on the current flood risk and the capacity of the Indus River to carry nearly one million cusecs of water.
Meanwhile, the health department reviewed the situation and ramped up medical and relief operations. Senior officials at a meeting, chaired by Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar, decided to strengthen disease surveillance, ensure immediate availability of anti-venom, deploy mobile health units, and activate the 1129 control room for public support.

The Election Comm­ission of Pakistan (ECP) has set Sept 9 for polling to fill the vacant Punjab seat.
According to party’s media wing, the annou­ncement has been made by expected candidate Salma Ejaz, wife of Mr Ejaz. She has made it clear that she will not contest the by-election as she does not want to become part of the ‘fraudulent elections’.
PTI Central Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram said that the founding chairman PTI Imran Khan has stated in his message that members of assemblies and senators affiliated with PTI, have been unjustly imprisoned under the false pretext of May 9 cases.
He also said that it will be an insult to them if the party decided to contest the election on seats which have been vacated due to their disqualification.
He said that, after getting the message, party’s political committee also decided that no candidate will be fielded on any seat apart from Mian Azhar’s seat which has been vacated after his death and his son Hammad Azhar will contest the election from there in Lahore.
“This decision gives a clear message that PTI will not accept any unjust or imposed electoral process. The party stands firmly with its workers and leaders and it will continue its struggle under all circumstances,” Mr Waqas said. According to media reports, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has awarded the ticket to former interior minister Rana Sanaullah Khan for the seat.

The reason for the decline in area of plantation is attributed to the removal of the minimal support price since May 2024, combined with low domestic wheat prices at the planting time that led some farmers to shift to more profitable vegetables and cash crops, including oilseeds, condiments and vegetables, says Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) on Pakistan in its latest issue.
In irrigated areas, yields are estimated to be above average, but dry weather conditions caused crop losses in rain-fed areas, which acco­unt for about 20pc of wheat plantings, and in some irrigated areas in northern parts due to shortage of irrigation water, the FAO report says.

Removal of minimal support price since May 2024 blamed for decline in plantation area

Planting of the 2025 paddy crop finalised in early August. In some areas, farmers undertook replanting operations following severe localised flooding between June and early August. The floods and landslides particularly affected northern and northwestern areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, as well as parts of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan provinces, resulting in localised crop losses and disruption of agricultural livelihood.
The report says in the 2024-25 marketing year wheat imports were significantly below the five-year average after the introduction of an import ban on wheat grain in July 2024. This year the government also put a ban on exports of wheat flour, including flour made from imported wheat, wheat products, refined flour and semolina, which is still in place as of early August 2025.
Exports of rice, the country’s major exportable cereal, are preliminarily forecast at 5.5 million tonnes in calendar year 2025. Exports of maize in the 2025-26 marketing year are preliminarily forecast at an average level of 500,000 tonnes.
Domestic prices of wheat flour, the country’s main staple food, declined by about 50pc between March 2024 and July 2025. The decline in prices reflects abundant market availability driven by consecutive good harvests and large imports in 2023-24, as well as by the government’s decision, since 2024, to cease wheat procurement from farmers at an MSP.
The abolition of the minimum support price was part of a broader package of economic reforms required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a condition to secure a $7 billion bailout approved in 2024.

Extension of Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank — de facto annexation of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war — was on the agenda for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet meeting late Sunday that is expected to focus on the Gaza war, a member of the small circle of ministers said.
It is unclear where precisely any such measure would be applied and when, whether only in Israeli settlements or some of them, or in specific areas of the West Bank like the Jordan Valley and whether any concrete steps, which would likely entail a lengthy legislative process, would follow discussions.
Any step toward annexation in the West Bank would likely draw widespread condemnation from the Palestinians, who seek the territory for a future state, as well as Arab and Western countries. It is unclear where US President Donald Trump stands on the matter.

IDF pounds Gaza City suburbs, claims killing of Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida

Israel, which is facing mounting international criticism over the war in Gaza, is angered by pledges by France, Britain, Australia and Canada to formally recognise a Palestinian state at a summit during the UN General Assembly in September.
The United Nations’ highest court in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
Israel argues the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory.
Its annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights decades ago have not won international recognition.
Thirty more killed in a day
Israeli forces pounded the suburbs of Gaza City overnight from the air and ground, killing 30 people, including 13 who tried to get food from near an aid site in the central Gaza Strip, destroying homes and driving more families out of the area.
Gaza health authorities said Israeli gunfire and strikes killed at least 30 people on Sunday, including 13 who tried to get food from near an aid site in the central Gaza Strip.
Residents of Sheikh Radwan, one of the largest neighborhoods of Gaza City, said the territory had been under Israeli tank shelling and airstrikes throughout Saturday and on Sunday, forcing families to seek shelter in the western parts of the city.
An Israeli official said Netanyahu’s security cabinet will on Sunday discuss the next stages of the planned offensive to seize Gaza City, which he has described as Hamas’ last bastion.
On Saturday, Red Cross head Mirjana Spoljaric said an evacuation from the city would provoke a massive population displacement that no other area in the Gaza Strip is equipped to absorb, amid severe shortages of food, shelter, and medical supplies.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians.
On Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said seven more people had died of malnutrition and starvation in the enclave, raising the number of such deaths to 339 people, including 124 children, since the war began.
Hamas spokesman
Israel claimed on Sunday its forces had killed the spokesman of Hamas’s armed wing in a strike on Gaza a day earlier.
Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida has been eliminated in Gaza, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X.
Israel has killed most leaders of Hamas during its 23-month devastating offensive in the Gaza Strip.
Hamas has not commented on the ‘killing’ of Abu Obeida.

The vessels will set off from the Spanish port city to “open a humanitarian corridor and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people,” said the Global Sumud Flotilla — sumud is the Arabic term for “resilience”.
The group’s website states it is an independent organisation with no affiliation to any government or political party.
A fleet of boats was ready to depart with hundreds on board, including activists from various countries like Irish actor Liam Cunningham and Spain’s Eduard Fernandez, as well as European lawmakers, public figures and former Barcelona mayor Ada Colau.

Greta Thunberg and other public figures sail to open a humanitarian corridor

The flotilla is expected to arrive at the war-ravaged coastal enclave in mid-September.
“The question here today is not why we are sailing. This story is not at all about the mission that we are about to embark upon,” Ms Thunberg told reporters. She said the goal was to bring in aid and open a humanitarian corridor to break an “illegal” and “inhuman” blockade of Gaza.
“The story here is about Palestine. The story here is how people are being deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive. The story here is how the world can be silent,” she said.
Mr Cunningham said the presence of the flotilla signifies the world’s failure to uphold international and humanitarian laws, marking a disgraceful period in history.
Organisers say other vessels are expected to leave Tunisian and other Mediterranean ports on Sept 4 to join the aid mission. “This will be the largest solidarity mission in history, with more people and more boats than all previous attempts combined,” Brazilian activist Thiago Avila said.
Activists will also stage simultaneous demonstrations and other protests in 44 countries “in solidarity with the Palestinian people”, Ms Thunberg wrote on Instagram.
“We understand that this is a legal mission under international law,” Portu­guese lawmaker Mariana Mortagua, who will join the mission, told journalists.
Previous attempts
Previously, Israel blocked aid ships to Gaza in June and July. In one instance, the sailboat Madleen with 12 activists, including Thunberg, was intercepted 185 km from Gaza, and its passengers were detained and expelled.

The Met Office advised provincial authorities in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) to take necessary precautions against Glof events, which are triggered by accelerating glacier melt.
According to the alert, hydro-meteorological data from monitoring stations under the Glof-II project showed “a significant rise in temperature values, much higher than normal,” which may hasten the melting process.
It stated an increased probability of Glof and flash floods in locations including Arkari, Badswat, Darkut, Hisper Hoper, Ghundus and Gulkin.
“All concerned are advised to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation,” the department said.
More monsoon rains
Simultaneously, the agency’s forecast noted that monsoon currents from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea are penetrating the country’s upper and central parts. This system, combined with a westerly wave, is expected to persist until Monday.
Wind and thunderstorms are expected in Kashmir, GB, KP and upper and southern Punjab, as well as Islamabad. Meanwhile, isolated heavy rainfall is anticipated in Kashmir, upper KP, and northeastern and southern Punjab.
Other regions of the country are likely to experience hot and dry conditions.
The department warned that on Sept 1, heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in the local streams of Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Manshera, Abbottabad, Nowshera and Swabi.
The risk also extends to Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, northeast Punjab and the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan.
Heavy downpours could also cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Narowal, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan.
Officials warned that landslides and mudslides may lead to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat and Kashmir during the forecast period.

• Central bank debt reduced to Rs3.8tr from Rs5.5tr; average domestic debt maturity rises to 3.8 years
• Falling interest rates saved Rs800bn in FY25, easing taxpayer burden
ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday said it had retired about Rs1.133tr debt to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), taking advantage of the central bank’s record profits driven by the highest interest rates in the country’s history.
“On August 29, 2025, the Debt Management Office (of the Ministry of Finance) executed another monumental repayment of Rs1.133 trillion,” the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said in a statement, adding that this came on top of an earlier Rs500bn repayment on June 30, 2025. The total repayment, therefore, amounted to Rs1.633tr in just 59 days, and Rs2.6tr in about a year.
The government had earlier announced in November last year that it had retired Rs1.867tr against a borrowing of Rs753.2bn for budgetary support in FY2023-24 through earlier repayments and buybacks of its securities from the market. “The MoF had, in the first half of FY25, retired domestic commercial market debt of Rs1tr — the first such advanced debt retirement operation in Pakistan’s history,” the statement said, adding that “including both the central bank and commercial portions, the total early debt retirement in less than one year now comes to over Rs2.6tr— an unprecedented scale and decisive action in the country’s fiscal history.”
The MoF said the early debt retirement was part of government efforts to strengthen public finances through early repayments and restore fiscal credibility. It marked a decisive shift from past debt-heavy practices, where reliance on borrowing crowded out fiscal space and increased risks. The ministry said the government had now initiated debt discipline under which 30pc of central bank debt was retired ahead of its maturity in 2029. As a result, government debt to the SBP dropped to Rs3.8tr from Rs5.5tr, thereby reducing risks and improving fiscal space.
Consequently, fiscal resilience had strengthened, the MoF maintained, adding that “the average maturity of domestic debt has risen to 3.8 years from 2.7 years in FY24 — the sharpest single-year improvement in history, and well ahead of IMF targets.”
The statement acknowledged that falling interest rates helped secure about Rs800bn in saving that would have otherwise put an additional tax burden on taxpayers.
Earlier, the government had said the pre-mature debt retirement was possible because of 186pc growth in federal revenues. The unprecedented increase in revenues in FY2024-25 was mainly driven by the surplus profit of the SBP (Rs2.5tr).
The government’s recent Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDMS 2026-28) emphasises increasing net issuances of PIBs, fixed-rate and zero-coupon bonds to help lower refinancing and interest rate risks. The strategy also seeks gradual repayment of securities held by the SBP to reduce refinancing risk in FY2029.
With IMF consent, the plan will be supported by “utilising any windfall from SBP dividends exceeding 1pc of GDP for the retirement of SBP debt,” the MoF said, adding that demand from long-term institutional investors was also expected to support this shift. Longer-dated zero-coupon bonds would suit their liability structures, it said, noting that the recently introduced two-year zero-coupon bond had already attracted strong interest from both commercial banks and insurers. Increased issuance of this instrument was therefore envisaged under the MTDMS.
The MTDMS conceded that the cost of debt in FY2025 remains elevated, particularly for domestic borrowing. The overall weighted average interest rate stands at 11.9pc, driven largely by the significantly higher cost of domestic debt relative to external sources.
While external debt carries a much lower weighted average interest rate of 4.4pc — reflecting the high share of concessional and semi-concessional financing — domestic debt bears an average rate of 15.82pc. As a result, interest payments consumed nearly 6pc of GDP in FY2025.
According to MoF, interest rate risk is high for domestic debt, reflecting a shift to floating-rate domestic debt instruments in response to market demand in recent years, primarily due to a growing reliance on floating-rate instruments in response to market preferences, the ministry said.
This trend was particularly evident in FY2023, when investors showed a strong preference for short- to medium-term floating-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), notably the five-year tenor with semi-annual coupons. “This shift was driven by expectations of continued interest rate hikes and a high policy rate environment, which peaked at 22pc during FY2023,” the ministry added.
Nearly 80pc of domestic debt is subject to an interest rate re-fixing in FY2026, with an average time to re-fixing (ATR) of only 1.2 years. For external debt, ATR is higher at 4.5 years, reflecting a greater share of fixed-rate debt, it added.

LAHORE: The overflowing Che­nab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers have displaced more than two million people across 2,200 villages since Aug 23, while Sindh braces for what officials warn could be a “super flood” as mas­sive inflows from Punjab move downstream.
Rescue and relief operations are underway on an unprecedented scale in Punjab, where the Provincial Disa­ster Management Authority (PDMA) has warned that the next 48 hours are critical. In Sindh, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has cautioned that inflows of nearly one million cusecs could threaten barrages and inundate vast swathes of land, endangering more than 200,000 people.
The Punjab PDMA has warned that the next two days are critical, as heavy rainfall in India’s Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh catchment areas is expected to push additional floodwaters into Pakistan.
Officials fear that if India releases an additional 300,000 cusecs into the Sutlej, areas around Lahore and its outskirts could face massive devastation. Already, localities such as Mohlanwal on Multan Road have been inundated, forcing emergency evacuations as water entered residential homes.
Monsoon rains over the past week swelled the three major rivers that cut through Punjab. The flooded rivers have affected mostly rural areas near their banks, but heavy rain also flooded urban areas, including several parts of Lahore. While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, and deadly, across the region.
Landslides and floods triggered by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains have killed more than 850 people nationwide since June.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia confirmed that very high to exceptionally high floods are expected to persist in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala, while the Chenab at Trimmu and Panjnad is likely to attain exceptionally high flood levels through Sept 3.
Addressing the media, the PDMA chief said the situation regarding the release of water from Indian dams has been sensitive and all relevant departments remained alert.
He said the Indus Water Commission, the NDMA and all departments remained active and they spoke with the Indian Commission regarding the Sutlej water.
The Indian Commission did not give any official update regarding the release of water from the Salal Dam, he said.
The decision to conduct breaches in the flood dykes was taken to save populated areas, he said, adding that the Sutlej River caused more destruction in Kasur.
He said the Punjab Irrigation Department had managed the flow of Sutlej water. There is an expected flow of 253,000 cusecs there, which will further decrease at the Kasur point and there will be more water at Head Islam and Vehari.
 
 

Mr Kathia said that when the water reaches the Panjnad at Ali Pur, there will be a flow of over 900,000 cusecs, and a flow of 1.1 million cusecs is expected to enter Sindh.
Water flow
According to data released by the Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) at 11pm on Sunday, the flow at Marala Headworks on the Chenab River was recorded at 114,550 cusecs (falling trend), while Khanki Headworks was at 154,339 cusecs (steady trend).
The flow at Qadirabad Headworks stood at 154,865 cusecs (steady trend). At the Chiniot Bridge, the flow was 209,457 cusecs (falling trend).
A significant concern was Trimmu Headworks, where the flow was in the “very high flood” category at 479,743 cusecs but was falling.
On the River Ravi, the flow was 479,743 cusecs at Jassar, 69,780 at Shahdara, 179,730 (very high) at Balloki, and 50,158 at Sidhnai.
As for the Sutlej River, the flow at Ganda Singh Wala was in “exceptionally high flood” at 253,068 cusecs. The flow was 134,970 at Sulemanki Headworks and 69,730 cusecs at Islam Headworks.
The key point of observation is the Panjnad Headworks, where the flow was normal at 87,564 cusecs at 11pm but was rising.
Death toll rises to 33
PDMA’s latest Flood Situation Report revealed that 33 people lost their lives and eight others were injured due to high floods in the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers from Aug 23 to 31.
According to the report, 2,066,785 people of 2,222 mouzas were affected and 506 relief camps were established to provide shelter to 10,654 people in the province. As many as 352 medical camps were established, in which 17,853 people were treated.
The rescue teams evacuated 760,424 people and 516,258 animals and transported them to safe locations. Veterinary services are being provided through 331 camps.
Meanwhile, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Sunday that recent rains and flash floods have claimed 850 lives and left more than 1,150 people injured across the country.
Speaking to the media alongside Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, the NDMA chief said that over 600,000 people were relocated to safer areas during the flooding, and thousands of livestock were also rescued across the country.
He said the final monsoon spell is expected in the first 10 days of September, with heavy rainfall likely in eastern Punjab, Azad Kashmir and nearby regions.
Over 2m displaced
Climate Minister Musadik Malik told the briefing that nearly 2m people have been displaced across the country, mostly in Punjab, due to devastating floods, warning that the brunt of the crisis is falling on the country’s poorest families.
“Our first, second and third priority is around the 800,000 poorest people who do not have wealthy relatives to rely on and are in dire need of aid,” Mr Malik told the media.
He urged the nation to stand with the poor. “If there is any NGO in your area or if you personally can help a displaced family, please do so,” he emphasised.
Mr Malik pointed to Punjab’s geography, where five rivers converge, as a challenge, warning that the Panjnad system could face flows as high as 3m cusecs if conditions worsen.
Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also confirmed that over 2m people have been affected by floods in Punjab. Of them, nearly 750,000 have been safely evacuated, Ms Aurangzeb said, calling it the “largest evacuation operation in the country’s history”.
UN delegation visits flood-hit Sialkot
Meanwhile, a United Nations delegation led by Resident Coordinator Dr Muhammad Ahmad Yahya visited the flood-affected areas of Sialkot to assess damage and distribute aid.
Accompanied by local officials, including Deputy Commissioner Saba Asghar Ali, Additional Deputy Commissioner General Ayub Bukhari, and Regional Director of Rescue 1122, Syed Kamal Abid, the eight-member delegation embarked on a tour.
They spent two hours visiting the flood-hit areas, including Kot Dasu and Daska, using Rescue 1122 boats. During their visit, they provided rations, ready-to-eat food and drinking water to people impacted by the floodwaters.
“The United Nations stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time,” Dr Yahya said.
Sindh braces for ‘super flood’
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the provincial government had devised a comprehensive plan to deal with the looming “super flood” — a term used when inflows reach 900,000 cusecs or more.
On Sunday, the chief minister visited the Guddu and Sukkur barrages, where he was briefed by the PDMA and other officials regarding flood preparations and relief measures.
He told the media that inflows from Trimmu would reach Sindh in about five days via Panjnad.
He said that in 2010, inflows of 1.1 million cusecs had passed from the Guddu Barrage. “This time, even 900,000 to one million cusecs would be extremely challenging. If inflows remain limited, losses will be manageable, but crops may still not survive,” he said.
Mr Shah said the provincial government’s foremost priority was to protect human lives and livestock, followed by safeguarding the Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages.
“We know exactly which areas will be affected at different water levels — 500,000 to 700,000 cusecs, 700,000 to 900,000, or even beyond. If inflows cross 900,000 cusecs, over 200,000 people may be impacted,” he warned.
He noted that Sindh’s terrain poses greater risks than Punjab’s. “In Punjab, designated breaches allow water to return quickly to the river. But Sindh lies below river level, so once water spreads, it does not recede easily,” he explained.
Also on Sunday, authorities relocated thousands of people from Sindh’s riverine areas to safer locations.
Woman, two daughters killed in KP
Meanwhile, a woman and her two daughters died after the roof of their house caved in due to heavy rains in the Spin Mazak area of Upper South Waziristan’s Sararogha tehsil late on Saturday night.
According to the district administration officials, the incident occurred when the roof of a room collapsed owing to heavy rains. Locals rushed to the scene and managed to recover bodies from debris before shifting them to Wana Hospital.
Deputy Commissioner Upper South Waziristan Asmat Ullah Wazir expressed grief over the loss of lives and directed officials to provide non-food items and other basic relief to the affected family. He said that compensation and further assistance measures were being arranged.
Only last week, torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc across the district, sweeping away three key bridges and destroying three houses completely.
In a separate incident, an 18-year-old girl was swept away by floodwaters and lost her life. The deputy commissioner said the district administration in South Waziristan Upper was making all-out efforts to support the affected families.

Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and motorcycles, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
A notification from the Finance Division, available with Dawn.com, stated that the new price of HSD was Rs269.99, while petrol would remain at Rs264.61 — the same as the start of August. Additionally, the prices of superior kerosene oil and light diesel oil were slashed by Rs1.46 per litre and Rs2.40, respectively.
“The government has revised the petroleum product prices for the fortnight starting tomorrow (September 1), in line with the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the concerned ministries,” the Finance Division stated.
Earlier this week, the cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved a financial bailout for Pakistan Television (PTV), a recovery plan for Rs47 billion in outstanding petroleum levy from Cynergico Refinery, and the use of funds collected under the captive levy on gas to reduce electricity rates for all consumers.
On August 16, the Finance Division announced a cut of Rs12.84 per litre in the price of HSD for the next fortnight, while petrol prices remained unchanged. The prices of superior kerosene oil and light diesel oil were slashed by Rs7.19 per litre and Rs8.2, respectively.</p><small>2025-08-31 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/311626240c4f544.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938680/govts-policies-closely-align-with-president-xis-vision-for-nations-progress-pm-shehbaz-says-on-china-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Govt’s policies closely align with President Xi’s vision for nation’s progress, PM Shehbaz says on China visit</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday that all the endeavours and initiatives of the current government of Pakistan closely aligned with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s vision and philosophy that were anchored in progress and prosperity of the Chinese nation.
PM Shehbaz arrived in China yesterday to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) two-day Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
Addressing students and faculty members of Tianjin University today, the premier urged the Pakistani students currently studying there to gain the latest knowledge and technology with sheer commitment and hard work.
In his address, which was also broadcast on national TV channels, the prime minister said that Pakistan fully supported President Xi’s philosophy and vision.
He noted that the Chinese leadership had “inspiring” strategic long-term planning for the progress of the country while keeping the welfare of its people at heart.
 


“President Xi’s visionary leadership conveyed to the entire globe that long-lasting friendship could be achieved through multilateralism and not through unilateralism, while shared progress and prosperity could be conceived through joint teams’ work and not through exclusive rights,” PM Shehbaz added.
Members of the prime minister’s delegation, ambassadors, and officials were also present on the occasion.
The premier also mentioned that taking 800 million people out of poverty had been the most towering achievement of China, which was made possible due to the historic transformation under President Xi’s visionary leadership. He hailed the Chinese president’s commitment to the welfare of his people and to building a shared destiny and future.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that the enduring friendship between the two nations not only stood the tests of time but faced enormous challenges of history.
“It withstands owing to commitment and clear vision in our minds; together to find a shared destiny,” he said, adding that all the designs to keep these two great friendly countries were defeated by their united actions and clear understanding.
 
 

The prime minister said the Pak-China time-tested friendship was built by their elder generations through unwavering commitment, honesty and unbelievable sincerity, thus “laying the foundation of a friendship to stand on pillars of mutual trust”.
He asserted that the friendship between the two nations would last forever, no matter what challenges came in their way. He noted that their ties were as old as the Silk Road, and as profound as the religious ties between Gandhara, Taxila and Beijing.
He enumerated the historical facts that forged stronger ties, including Pakistan being the first Muslim country to recognise the People’s Republic of China and PIA’s first direct flight from Karachi to Beijing about 60 years ago.
The prime minister lauded that owing to their hard work, sincerity and untiring efforts, the Chinese leadership and its people had transformed the country into the second-largest economy and military powerhouse in the world, adding that Pakistan felt pride over the achievement of its friend.
PM Shehbaz asserted that the incumbent government in Pakistan was also committed to eradicating corruption and poverty, and went on to claim that “not a single corruption case had emerged” during the current government’s tenure.
“We have a shared destiny with China and should learn from the knowledge imparted by the Chinese universities to bring economic [and] agricultural prosperity to the people of Pakistan,” he said.
 
 

The prime minister expressed his satisfaction that more than 200 individuals from various parts of Pakistan were studying at Tianjin University. He called on them to utilise their expertise in Pakistan for the welfare, progress and prosperity of their people.
Noting that the university was regarded as “a cradle of great learning” and terming students as ambassadors of Pakistan, the premier expressed the optimism that, owing to their hard work and dedication, they would return to Pakistan as architects for their future.
“Above all, you are the torch bearers of Pakistan-China friendship,” PM Shehbaz highlighted.

The prime minister said the students would become great experts and serve as helping hands not only in China’s progress but also for the well-being and progress of Pakistan.
He observed that about 60 per cent of the population in Pakistan comprised the youth, “which is a huge challenge”, and stressed that they should reap the demographic dividends to unlock this potential and chart new horizons in collaboration with China.
The prime minister noted that the government had sent 1,000 agriculture graduates from Pakistan to China to learn modern techniques. Moreover, about 30,000 students from Pakistan had been getting education and training in China.
He also termed vocational training as critical in building and training the youth in different parts of Pakistan. The prime minister also fondly recalled his memories of his visit to the university in 2017.
The prime minister also visited the National Earthquake Simulation Centre at Tianjin University and appreciated China’s use of modern technology for disaster management.
“By benefiting from Chinese expertise in this regard, Pakistan will be able to adopt effective precautionary measures and strategies to deal with natural disasters in the future,” he said.

Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the prime minister had met visiting heads of state at the summit, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“At the 25th SCO Heads of State Council in Tianjin, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held informal meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedow, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres,” the post read.

PM Shehbaz is slated to reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to promoting multilateralism, enhancing regional security and advancing sustainable development, the FO said in a statement earlier. He is also expected to have bilateral meetings with other SCO leaders and invited members to “strengthen diplomatic relations”.
The prime minister would also hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”, according to the FO.

Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.</p><small>2025-08-31 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/31195822fd2d20e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938704/pakistan-and-armenia-formally-establish-diplomatic-relations-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Armenia formally establish diplomatic relations: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Armenia on Sunday formally established diplomatic relations, the Foreign Office (FO) announced in a statement.
Until today, Pakistan and Armenia did not have formal diplomatic relations. The relationship was characterised by a regional geopolitical rivalry, with Pakistan supporting Azerbaijan against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as per the Press Information Department.
However, earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan had agreed to consider establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia after a phone call with counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan following a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
According to the FO today, Islamabad and Yerevan formally established diplomatic relations by exchanging a joint communique in Tianjin, on the sidelines of the ongoing Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.
“Marking a historic step forward, both the leaders [Dar and Mirzoyan] affirmed their commitment to the principles and objectives of [the] United Nations Charter and discussed possible avenues of cooperation, including economy, education, culture, and tourism,” the FO statement read.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their desire to work closely with each other at bilateral and multilateral fora, to achieve their shared objectives of peace, progress, and prosperity for the peoples of their two countries.”
 






In a post on X, Dar wrote that he was pleased to sign the joint communique with his Armenian counterpart and echoed the FO’s remarks on affirming their commitment to the principles of the UN Charter.
 






The FM also attached photos of himself and Mirzoyan signing and exchanging the document, fanked by their national flags.
The Armenian foreign minister aslo wrote on X: “By this major step, our governments express their desire to develop mutually beneficial cooperation in line [with] the UN Charter [and] readiness to foster constructive engagement in multilateral fora.
 






Previously this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal.
“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a statement on X.
He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”</p><small>2025-08-31 16:27</small></div><hr>
