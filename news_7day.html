Accompanied by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and other leaders on the second day of his three-day Lahore visit, the KP chief minister spoke to the media on two occasions as he visited the residences of incarcerated party leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed.
Answering a question about the prospects of dialogue with the government in the wake of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer, the KP chief minister said: “Incumbent rulers are showing no sign of dialogue and instead are displaying their dictatorship mindset, which was inculcated in their minds since they began politics.”
Asked whether he thought issues with the federal government could be resolved through talks, CM Afridi said Imran had given the responsibility for “dialogue or protest“ to the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP).
The KP CM said that while the TTAP was “making efforts on its end”, which he supported, he had been directed to prepare for a street movement and he would take “those preparations to their peak”.
“Imran Khan is a symbol of national solidarity and stresses that everyone needs to respect others,” the chief minister added.
For the street movement, he said he was in contact with all party leaders and organisations, as well as wings within the party to run the movement.
The TTAP on Thursday welcomed PM Shehbaz’s recent invitation for talks. However, no concrete steps have so far been taken by the government to initiate a formal talks process, and PTI leaders say they are waiting for the government to make the first move.
PM’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has stressed that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations.
Referring to the Punjab government’s claim that the PTI had been eliminated from Punjab, he issued a challenge that he would hold a public rally at Minar-i-Pakistan on a 24-hour notice, while claiming that Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz would take a week to stage a rally and thus be able to examine the difference in popularity for both the PTI and PML-N.
CM Afridi quipped that he would support her in establishing a stage and providing vehicles to bring supporters.







He also criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour with him, as well as party leaders and workers, during his arrival at Chakri interchange to reach the Punjab Assembly a day ago.
“This shows their mean mentality that cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“
Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respected the office of a province’s chief executive.
He said the Punjab government had not responded to the KP government’s request about him wanting to meet incarcerated PTI leaders at Kot Lakhpat jail. “The incumbent rulers have neither allowed me to meet my leader Imran Khan nor leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat jail,” CM Afridi added.
The KP chief minister said that he was impressed with the courage that the incarcerated leaders and their family members had shown in the face of “fascism” unleashed against them.
Bemoans treatment of courts in address to LHCBA
Speaking to the legal community at the Lahore High Court Bar Association, CM Afridi lamented that the courts in the country had been rendered useless after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
He said three judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had allowed him to meet Imran, but “a mere jail superintendent threw the orders in the dustbin”.
The chief minister urged the lawyers’ fraternity to “stand for an independent judiciary” in the party’s struggle for real independence. He complained that PTI workers were not even allowed to hold party flags in the open.
Referring to his responsibility to run the PTI’s street movement, he said Imran wanted the Constitution and the judiciary to be restored in their original shape. “The PTI is standing with the independence of the judiciary,” he added.
Visit to Imran’s Zaman Park residence
The KP chief minister also visited Imran’s residence at Zaman Park with Aleema Khanum amidst massive police deployment around the house.
The two spoke at a joint media talk amidst massive sloganeering by party workers.



Aleema alleged the Punjab government was “terrified” to the extent that it had closed all roads leading to Zaman Park and stopped even women and children from reaching there. “They have converted Zamaan Park into a jail, where even residents cannot go in or out,” she added.
Referring to the massive police deployment outside her residence, she said she was not afraid and continued rebuffing any “cheap tactics”.
She said CM Afridi and others would come and sit at the spot too and people would see how long the administration would be able hold them away.
“Today is the beginning of the movement; the Punjab government will not be able to stop people on Lahore roads soon,” she asserted and asked, “Will they shut down all of Lahore?”
Answering a question, she said, Imran had given his clear-cut message through Noreen Niazi that people should come out on the roads because the “incumbent rulers want to prolong their rule and loot in the country”.
CM Afridi said that he was half-happy that he had arrived at his leader’s home alone and wished he had been accompanied by Imran. “My leader will soon be with me here,” he said.
He said those in the government never wanted talks; instead, they wanted the confrontation between the political parties to continue.
Later, he paid a brief visit to the residences of Hammad Azhar, where he offered prayers for the recently deceased Mian Azhar, and party worker Zill-e-Shah, who died during a party protest in 2023.
Meetings with families of jailed leaders
CM Afridi first visited Qureshi‘s home, with visuals released by the PTI on X showing the former foreign minister’s son Zain Qureshi and daughter Meher Bano present during the meeting. Addressing the media alongside them, Afridi said, “This is my Pakistan, and wherever I go, I do not need a reason for it.”
The chief minister said the aim of his Lahore trip was to meet party leaders.
Afridi mentioned the names of multiple incarcerated leaders he wanted to meet and added, “I also wanted to meet the rest of the leadership and workers, but unfortunately, they did not let me meet them.”







Following Afridi’s visit, Zain expressed his heartfelt gratitude to him and other PTI leaders in a post on X.
He said the KP CM enquired about Qureshi’s health, “hailed his sacrifices and also visited my mother”. “His visit is a source of encouragement and strength for us.”
According to statements by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi, CM Afridi also met Yasmin’s husband, Rashid Nabi Malik, and Chaudhry’s wife and children.

 

According to PTI lawyer Naeem Panjutha, the KP CM was not able to visit former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema’s house as it was located in a cantonment and “permission was not being given to enter”.







At Rasheed’s residence, KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi asserted that Punjab stood with Imran and “had always given us affection”.
While on his way to Rasheed’s house, Panjutha said there will be lots of people on the streets of Lahore in the evening, and called on the public to take part in the PTI’s movement till Imran’s release.







First day in Lahore
Afridi had arrived in Lahore on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly. However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Although the KP CM managed to reach Liberty Roundabout last night, he was unable to deliver a planned speech at the venue as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to the area by setting up pickets.
Addressing PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, he had thanked the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighted his treatment at the hands of the police during the journey to Lahore.
“Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.”
In separate remarks to the media, Afridi had said he was in Lahore to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of Imran, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism without making mistakes.
“We will take Imran Khan’s ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ (real independence) movement to its logical conclusion, restore the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and revive an independent judiciary and independent media,” he had asserted.</p><small>2025-12-27 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27181920c613abd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963550/bilawal-urges-greater-role-for-provinces-as-solution-to-centres-financial-woes' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal urges greater role for provinces as solution to Centre’s financial woes</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday urged giving the provinces a greater role in areas such as tax collection to help address the federal government’s financial issues.
The Bhutto scion was addressing the death anniversary programme for his mother, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. Benazir was assassinated in a gun-and-bomb attack near Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007, after a public gathering.
The Sindh government announced a public holiday today to commemorate Benazir’s death anniversary. Foolproof security for the VVIPs, VIPs, and general public was ensured in Larkana, with over 8,500 police officers and personnel, alongside Rangers and other security agencies, deployed at and around Bhutto’s mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.

 

Speaking at the event, Bilawal said the PPP was a federal party that conducted politics at both the national and provincial levels with sincerity, treating the Centre’s problems as its own.
“If there is an issue of fiscal space for the federal government, then as a patriot, I would want to help solve it. The PPP has its own politics and history, and as the chain binding the four provinces, we have a greater responsibility to address the Centre’s issues while protecting provincial rights.”
“We think that instead of attempts to take authority away from the provinces, it would be better if the federal government gave more responsibilities to them. We are ready to take on additional responsibilities to help fix the economy and the government’s issues.”
Pointing to tax collection, the PPP chairman said the federal government should work together with provincial governments and give them more responsibilities in this area to boost revenue.
“We will collect taxes better than the Federal Board of Revenue and will eliminate your financial crises.”
Bilawal maintained that the government should remove itself from the business of supplying electricity through power utility companies and instead hand this responsibility over to the provinces.
“We will perform better than the Centre. There are many other ways in which the PPP will work together with the federal government to address its issues. We should all tackle Pakistan’s economic problems together so we can improve the people’s financial situation.”



On his mother, Bilawal said her last message was one of reconciliation. He added that reconciliation would be necessary to resolve the country’s current political crisis.
The Bhutto scion said that parties would have to abandon “political extremism” for the reconciliation effort to succeed, and their supporters would need to bring politics back within bounds. He added that actions such as the May 9, 2023, nationwide riots or cursing institutional heads were not the way forward.
He said Benazir and the PPP had never pursued the politics of revenge, as it caused losses to the country, its people, and the party’s supporters.
“Political forces will have to follow a responsible political path. The opposition parties should engage in responsible politics, and government parties should also think in the national interest.”
President Zardari says PPP always ready to defend Pakistan
In his speech, the president said today marked the day the PPP saved the country by championing the slogan of Pakistan and refraining from any retaliation for Benazir’s assassination.
He also referred to the May conflict with India, saying that the Pakistan Army gave a “befitting response” to the enemy, making it realise that it was serious.
“Modi realised it was no joke. Pakistan is Pakistan, and we, as Muslims, know how to defend ourselves.”
He warned that if any evil eye or country ever looked at Pakistan again, “they should remember that Asif Zardari, the PPP, and the scions of Bhutto and Bibi are present, and we are all ready to step onto the field of battle and make sacrifices to protect our nation”.
‘Unity over division’
In an earlier message on his wife’s death anniversary, the president said: “As we reflect on this solemn day on her 18th martyrdom anniversary, we must choose unity over division.”
He stressed that Benazir “never believed in vindictiveness and vendetta”.
“She always reminded us that democracy was the best revenge. Her message calls on us to heal political rifts, strengthen democratic institutions and work together for the progress of our motherland,” he said.
“On her anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment to carrying forward her vision of a democratic, inclusive, tolerant, pluralist and forward-looking Pakistan,“ he added.







Recalling that Benazir was the first female prime minister of a Muslim country and had been elected twice to the role, Zardari said: “In a political landscape shaped by exclusion, patriarchy, longer authoritarian rule and repeated disruptions of democratic order, she stood like a rock for the supremacy of the Constitution, authority of the Parliament and the peoples’ right to choose their representatives.
“Her repeated return to electoral politics reflected an unshakeable faith in peaceful political struggle and unadulterated democracy,” he asserted.
“She gave voice to the voiceless. She pulled farmers, workers and low-income families like a super magnet towards her, who remained at the centre of her politics,” the president highlighted, pointing out Benazir’s focus on widening access to livelihoods and education.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto believed deeply in an inclusive Pakistan. She rejected sectarianism, bigotry and intolerance, and consistently spoke for the protection of minorities,” President Zardari said about his late wife.
“Her courage in the face of extremism remains one of her most enduring legacies,” he further said, adding that Benazir’s assassination was a “reminder that the fight against terrorism is not only about security, but also about ideas, education and respect for diversity”.

 

“For the youth of Pakistan, her life offers a clear lesson. Speak up for justice, organise peacefully and do not surrender hope in the face of adversity. She confronted censorship and repression with resolve, proving that truth cannot be silenced forever.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to her, saying her political legacy was marked by patriotism, courage, and an unwavering commitment to democratic values, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said she consistently promoted tolerance, harmony, and forbearance in the political process, which remained a guiding principle for strengthening democracy in the country.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the government’s resolve to continue the journey of tolerance, rule of law, democratic governance, and public welfare.







Bilawal, in a message released by the PPP yesterday, said his mother’s “supreme sacrifice was a pledge written in blood that democracy in Pakistan would never surrender”.
“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was not just a leader; she was the fearless voice of democracy, the hope of the oppressed and an unyielding symbol of resistance against dictatorship, extremism and intolerance,” he was quoted as saying.
Reaffirming the PPP’s unwavering commitment to Benazir’s mission, Bilawal said the party will continue to fight for social and economic justice, constitutional supremacy, women’s empowerment and the protection of minorities.
“We bow our heads in reverence before Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. Her sacrifice is our strength, her vision our guiding light and her courage our lasting responsibility. Her dream lives on in every voice raised for justice and every step taken for democracy,” the PPP scion said.







Bilawal went on to say that Benazir’s vision of a “peaceful, democratic and inclusive Pakistan continues to inspire generations, especially women and youth”.
He noted that as the premier, his mother “pursued people-centred policies, strengthened Pakistan’s defence, safeguarded national sovereignty and restored the country’s progressive and dignified image internationally”.
Benazir‘s daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, who paid a visit to her mother’s mausoleum yesterday, said on social media platform X: “Today we remember Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.
“She lived with courage and led with compassion. Her strength lives on in every voice that refuses injustice.”
Aseefa further said, “In every struggle and every accomplishment, we think of you, miss you, and pray for you. We continue to strive to fulfil your vision and values. Your absence leaves us searching for the guidance only you could give.”







Senator Sherry Rehman posted a video message on her X account, saying that Benazir “never wavered, she never compromised on her dreams for her beloved Pakistan”.
“Despite all threats, risks and real dangers, she did what she believed in. Her courage and resilience define her as one of the greatest leaders the world saw,” Rehman said, adding that her vision lives on in the hands of Bilawal, Aseefa and President Zardari.







Govt delegation to attend gathering at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh
Meanwhile, a government delegation led by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, has departed for Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to attend the gathering being held to mark Benazir’s death anniversary.
The delegation, including Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, and MNAs, is attending on the special instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The delegation will also hold meetings with the PPP leadership.







In a statement released prior to his departure, Sadiq said, “Today we are commemorating the death anniversary of Pakistan’s great daughter, former prime minister Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.”
He said Benazir had played a significant role in strengthening the role of women, adding she worked to make Pakistan a peaceful, progressive, and democratic state.
“Her sacrifices and services are a guiding light for the entire nation,“ he said.</p><small>2025-12-27 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27201850852de34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963579/pcb-shortlists-10-bidders-for-two-new-psl-franchises' target='_blank'><strong>PCB shortlists 10 bidders for two new PSL franchises</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Saturday announced that it has approved 10 bidders after completing the technical evaluation of the proposals for the sale of two new franchises of the Pakistan Super League.
The auction for the two teams is slated for Jan 8 in Islamabad and comes after the PCB, which had received 12 proposals, had earlier said that investors from the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan expressed their interest in acquiring the franchises up for sale.
“A total of 12 proposals were received from interested parties within the stipulated deadline from across the globe and were scrutinised by the PCB Bid Committee over the last three days,” PCB said in a statement.
“Following a thorough and transparent evaluation process, the PCB Bid Committee has qualified 10 bidders who have successfully met the technical criteria and now enter the second stage.
“These 10 technically qualified bidders will now proceed to participate in the auction scheduled on Thursday, 8 January, 2026 at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad, where the franchise rights for the two new HBL PSL teams will be up for grabs.

Akhtar, known for her leadership roles in both national and international financial institutions, took over as the 14th governor of SBP on January 2, 2006, becoming the first woman to hold the position.
She had also been the finance minister in the caretaker setups before the 2018 and 2024 general elections.
Akhtar also served as the vice president of the World Bank for the Middle East and North Africa and the executive secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
Prior to her appointment as SBP governor, Akhtar served as the director general of the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Southeast Asia Department since January 2004. She also held the position of the Governance, Finance and Trade Division director for ADB’s East and Central Asia Department.
Born in Hyderabad, Akhtar received her early education in Karachi and Islamabad. She graduated from the University of Punjab with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics in 1974.
She then acquired a Master‘s degree in Economics from the Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, an M.A. in Development Economics from the University of Sussex in 1977 and a PhD in Economics from the United Kingdom’s Paisley College of Technology in 1980. She was also a post-doctoral fellowship Fulbright Scholar and was a visiting fellow at the Department of Economics, Harvard University in 1987.
‘Served the country with honesty and dedication’
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over her passing and paid tribute to her services in the field of economics and financial management, noting her contributions to strengthening economic governance in the country.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the late former central bank governor and said she was a “devoted public servant” and served the nation with distinction.
“She made outstanding contributions to strengthening Pakistan’s financial architecture,” said the premier and offered his “heartfelt condolences and prayers” to the family.







Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb described Akhtar as a principled and dignified voice in Pakistan’s economic history, praising her integrity, professionalism and long public service.
“She served the country with honesty and dedication in some of the most senior economic roles,” Aurangzeb said in a statement, offering condolences to her family, friends and colleagues.







Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal also paid tributes to the former SBP governor. He said he was “deeply saddened” by her passing and offered his prayers and deepest condolences to her family.







The United Nations ESCAP, of which Akhtar was the former executive secretary, said the economist “steadfastly worked to strengthen regional economic cooperation and integration, supporting inclusive and sustainable development across Asia and the Pacific”.







Pakistan‘s former ambassador to the UN, Maleeha Lodhi, said she was “devastated” by the former SBP governor’s passing. She said Akhtar’s services to the country would always be remembered and she was an “outstanding professional and a wonderful, caring human being”.







Journalists Khurram Husain and Ali Khizar also offered prayers and condolences on Dr Akhtar’s passing.

Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
The decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession.
“Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.







“Such illegal and provocative actions constitute a flagrant violation of international law and not only threaten the peace and stability of the brotherly country of Somalia, but also that of the entire region,” it added.
Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”.
“Pakistan reiterates its complete support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, as well as for all efforts aimed at achieving lasting peace and stability in the country,” the FO said.
It added that Pakistan also reiterated its “unequivocal rejection” of any steps aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians from their land under any circumstances.
The Palestinian foreign ministry said on X earlier today that Israel had “previously used the name Somaliland as a destination for the deportation of members of our Palestinian people, especially from the Gaza Strip”.







Pakistan reaffirmed its unwavering support for the Palestinian people in their just struggle for self-determination and for a sovereign, independent Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Egypt, Turkiye, Djibouti and the African Union have condemned Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, and reaffirmed their full support for Somalia’s territorial integrity.

 

Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held phone calls yesterday with his counterparts from Somalia, Turkiye and Djibouti to discuss what they described as dangerous developments in the Horn of Africa.
Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.</p><small>2025-12-27 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27180426eed595c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963565/security-forces-kill-4-terrorists-during-ibo-in-balochistans-panjgur-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 4 terrorists during IBO in Balochistan’s Panjgur: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed four terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Panjgur district, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the security forces conducted an operation on December 26 on the reported presence of “Khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khawarij”.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added during the conduct of operation, “own forces effectively engaged the Khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored Khawarij were sent to hell”.
The statement further said that weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Following the skirmish, a sanitization operation was initiated in the area to “eliminate any other Indian sponsored Khawarij present in the area”.
“Relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces for the successful counter-insurgency operation.
“We’ll foil the nefarious designs of terrorists, who are enemies of humanity,” he said, adding that the entire nation stands with the security forces in the fight against terrorism.
In an X post by the state broadcaster, the PM was quoted as saying the government is determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.







Earlier this month, 12 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Balochistan’s Kalat.
Last year, the federal government, in a meeting comprising top civilian and military leaders, announced a comprehensive, nationwide anti-militant operation codenamed ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ to mitigate a rise in attacks on security forces by militant groups.</p><small>2025-12-27 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2715373259eea97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963562/dar-hails-pakistans-success-in-may-conflict-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Dar hails Pakistan’s success in May conflict with India</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed Pakistan’s success over India during the military escalation between the two countries earlier this year.
“A strong message was sent to the world,” he said while speaking to the media in Islamabad, where he gave an overview of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts in 2025.
“Our international standing has […] improved due to principled, proactive and result-oriented diplomacy,” Dar said, reflecting on the past year. He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year.



Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation.
“We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted.
He recalled that Pakistan shot down seven jets of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for intercepting 79 out of 80 drones sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours.
The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the Pulwama and the Pahalgam incidents.
“This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said.
Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10.
“The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s retaliatory operation.
“After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that.
Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.”
Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’.
“Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled.
He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire.
“It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said.
“Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons.
“Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.”

 

The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”.
Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir.
On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others.
Ice breaks with Bangladesh
The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived.
Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had visited Bangladesh in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there.
“My 36-hour visit to Bangladesh was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed.
“During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls.
“Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said.
Positive ties with US
Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire.
“That is why on June 11, we nominated [President Donald] Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026. The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said.

 

“President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped.
“Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-27 12:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2715375165bc0f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963563/dialogue-not-deadlock-pml-n-leaders-assail-pti-for-mixed-signals-over-talks-with-govt' target='_blank'><strong>‘Dialogue not deadlock’: PML-N leaders assail PTI for mixed signals over talks with govt</strong></a><br><p>PML-N leaders on Saturday said PTI had been sending mixed signals regarding talks with the government, stressing that democracy could only be advanced through “dialogue and not deadlock”.
On Friday, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that PM Shehbaz would decide on talks with PTI once the opposition party clarifies its stance on negotiations. PM Shehbaz on Tuesday extended an offer for talks with the opposition.
The PTI outright rejected talks with the government on the directions of party founder Imran Khan, but Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), of which the PTI is a part, stated its openness to negotiate with the government.
PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, made the remarks while speaking to the media in Sukkur. The delegation is headed to Garhi Khuda Bakhsh for the 18th death anniversary of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
“On one hand, they (PTI) say we should hold dialogue and then on the other hand, Aleema Khan says anyone in favour of dialogue can not be a part of the party,“ Chaudhry said.
While Sanaullah — in response to a question about the talks and speculation surrounding the PTI founder being moved to Balochistan — maintained: “As a political party, we believe that democracy is advanced through dialogue, not deadlock, which is why both PML-N and PPP have always tried to ensure that all political parties sit down and resolve their political issues through dialogue.”
However, he continued, “the PTI founder has had this attitude since 2011 and then from 2018-2022 and now in 2025 […] he does not believe in political dialogue”.
Addressing the issue of restrictions on visitation, Sanaullah said, “No one can be allowed to plan chaos and anarchy in the country,” alleging that the PTI founder had been doing so through his “meetings, messaging and tweets”.
He said the party founder was “badmouthing the political leadership,” adding that the ban on meetings was “in accordance with the law”.
“As for dialogue, we have always remained ready; we still are. If they want to talk, that’s fine; if they don’t, it’s their decision,” he said.
He further added that during court proceedings on the visitation issue, PTI’s Salman Akram Raja had assured the court that after every meeting, the party would not hold any press conference or engage in any “political messaging”.
“But now they are going against their own statement,” he said.
He also said that the PTI founder’s trials were being held in jail rather than in court, as his “protection remained a top priority for the government”.
On the matter of talks, Sadiq recalled that the PM has “repeatedly said that we are ready for dialogue“.
“In my capacity as the NA speaker, I have also said that the office of speaker is available whenever you want to come and talk, but it seems they will have to make a decision”.
He hoped that “once the PTI agrees […] some way forward can be found”.
“They tell the media that they want to talk; there is an office available, they should come, and we will welcome them,“ he added.
The speaker also stated that the ruling coalition (PPP and PML-N) “intended to play a long innings” in their partnership and aimed to “work towards the betterment of Pakistan.”
The NA speaker, in response to a question regarding the speculation surrounding a 28th Constitutional Amendment, said that he had “no knowledge of such a plan”.
“There is no discussion or debate in the house about it,” he said.
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance TTAP, the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.</p><small>2025-12-27 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/271514444b7d112.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963559/benazir-bhutto-and-the-moment-she-chose' target='_blank'><strong>Benazir Bhutto and the moment she chose</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: History does not always announce itself with thunder. Sometimes it arrives as a decision — taken calmly, consciously and against fear.
“I am returning to Pakistan on October 18 to coalesce the forces of moderation against extremism,” Benazir Bhutto said in Washington in 2007. “Our goal, quite literally, is to save democracy in Pakistan.”
She made that statement on September 25, 2007, at meetings hosted by the Middle East Institute and later at the Russell Senate Building. It was not a slogan, it was a commitment — one she fully intended to honour.
I had met Benazir countless times over the years — in Pakistan, in London and in Washington — across different phases of her political life. She could be warm and disarming, cautious and guarded, sharply analytical and politically defiant, sometimes all of the above within the same conversation. But on that September day in Washington, there was a particular clarity about her. She had already decided.
As she was leaving the Middle East Institute, I asked the question many were asking quietly but few were prepared to voice aloud.
“Big announcement, Bibi — are you sure the time is right for your return?”
She stopped, looked at me and replied without hesitation: “We cannot always wait for the right time. There comes a moment when you have to take certain decisions — and now is that time.”
I asked her for an interview. She said she was leaving immediately and could not promise anything but would see what she could do.
The next day — or perhaps the day after — my phone rang.
“This is Benazir Bhutto,” the voice on the other end said. “I am at JFK [airport]. Let’s do the interview now.”
I told her she must be busy at the moment and suggested we do it later.
“No,” she said. “Let’s do it now.”
That conversation, conducted while she was at the airport, became her last media interview in the United States.
She kept the promise she made in Washington. Less than a month later, she returned to Pakistan. It was her third homecoming — and her last. On December 27, 2007, she was assassinated at a rally in Rawalpindi.

 

Her return came less than a year after she and Nawaz Sharif signed the Charter of Democracy in London, a document shaped by experience, reconciliation and political maturity. Signed on May 14, 2006, it sought to end the destructive cycle of confrontation that had repeatedly destabilised democratic processes.
Many argue, with justification, that this understanding between the PPP and the PML-N laid the groundwork for the restoration of democratic rule in Pakistan — albeit within constraints.
Throughout 2007, Benazir’s message in Washington was steady, confident and principled. She insisted that Nawaz Sharif had as much right to return to Pakistan as she did. She warned that excluding mainstream political forces weakened national cohesion.
And she emphasised that sustainable stability required political participation, legitimacy and public trust. Every word she spoke carried the weight of experience, the eloquence of a stateswoman, and the courage of someone who had survived exile, imprisonment and threats to her life.

By then, the Bush administration had begun to reassess its approach to Pakistan. It was exploring ways to combine political legitimacy with counterterrorism efforts, and in that recalibration, Benazir increasingly emerged as a central and credible figure — a leader whose resolve and moral authority commanded attention even in the highest corridors of power.
Her reception during that final visit reflected the shift. At the US Senate, flanked by her husband Asif Ali Zardari and former senator Khwaja Akbar, she received a standing ovation from lawmakers, diplomats, academics, and journalists — a marked contrast to earlier visits when she was treated with caution and reserve.
Her international stature had long been evident.
On October 20, 2006, Pakistani guests attending an iftar at the US State Department in Washington were struck by a large photograph at the entrance: a smiling Benazir. It underscored her place in history as the first Muslim woman prime minister. Beside her was Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman Nobel laureate; next to her, Megawati Soekarnoputri, Indonesia’s first female president. It was a quiet but powerful tableau of Muslim women who had reshaped political history.
During her final Washington visit, the late congressman Tom Lantos, then chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, facilitated a telephone conversation between Benazir and the late ex-military ruler Pervez Musharraf. Media reports suggested she sought assurances about her return and addressed concerns about the political transition.
On October 8, 2007, former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice telephoned both Musharraf and Benazir, reportedly to ensure that understandings had been reached. The following day, the government announced it would drop criminal cases pending against her.
These diplomatic efforts unfolded amid real danger. A day before Rice’s call, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) leader Baitullah Mehsud publicly threatened to target Benazir Bhutto upon her return. The threat was known. The risk was understood. She returned anyway — not out of recklessness, but out of unwavering courage, a deep sense of duty and love for her country.

Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan during that turbulent period, died in Dubai on February 5, 2023. With the passage of time — and with both principal figures now gone — that chapter has now become a part of history books.
What remains are the consequences of choices made at a decisive moment — particularly Benazir’s decision to return despite clear and present danger, because, as she told me in that final interview, “that’s where I belong”.
Her September 2007 visit to Washington was her most consequential. She was everywhere in the media, met senior officials, engaged lawmakers and shaped the narrative. The signals of support were unmistakable.
In the weeks following her return to Pakistan, Washington increased its emphasis on democratic processes. The White House spoke of strengthening popular political resistance to extremism and US lawmakers moved to link assistance with democratic outcomes.
A decade after her assassination, her name was invoked again on the world stage. On September 22, 2017, at the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, British Prime Minister Theresa May paused her address to remember Benazir.
“This year is the tenth anniversary of the death of the woman who introduced me to my husband and who was well-known to many of us in this United Nations,” she said at the time. “Benazir Bhutto was brutally murdered by people who actively rejected the values that all of us here in this United Nations stand for.”
She reminded the Assembly that no country had suffered more at the hands of terrorists than Pakistan.
Benazir did not live to see the democratic transition she helped set in motion, nor the long and uneven struggle that followed. But she understood something elemental: that history rarely offers safe moments and that waiting for perfect conditions is often another way of surrendering to fear.
She chose to return — fully aware of the threats, conscious of the risks and certain of the moment. In that return, in that final act of leadership, she showed the world what it means to lead with courage, to persist with vision and to embody the highest principles of service.
For many across the globe, she remains a symbol of resilience, of hope and of the unwavering commitment to her country and its people. That choice, more than any office she held or speech she delivered, defines her place in history.

The DOJ began releasing records last week from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking underage girls for sex.
The latest disclosures on Tuesday contain numerous references to Trump, including documents detailing flights he took on Epstein’s private jet.
Trump was once a friend of Epstein but distanced himself after his crimes came to light, and has appeared reluctant to discuss the case despite strong support in the Republican party for fuller transparency about the deceased man’s associates.
“Now 1,000,000 more pages on Epstein are found. DOJ is being forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday.
“The Dems are the ones who worked with Epstein, not the Republicans. Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country!” Trump said.



“The Radical Left doesn’t want people talking about TRUMP & REPUBLICAN SUCCESS, only a long ago dead Jeffrey Epstein — Just another Witch Hunt!!!”
Trump did not say which Democrats may be named in the files.
The DOJ missed a December 19 deadline to release the files in full despite a law compelling it to do so.

 

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche previously blamed the delayed release on a need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein’s victims.
The DOJ has defended Trump, saying the files contain “untrue and sensationalist claims” against him that were submitted to the FBI before the 2020 election, which landed him a second term in office.
The department has not specified which allegations are false.
“If they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the department added at the time.</p><small>2025-12-27 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27102642e2fc667.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963547/pti-deletes-x-post-of-provocative-bradford-demonstration-says-it-does-not-endorse-unlawful-behaviour-of-any-kind' target='_blank'><strong>PTI deletes X post of ‘provocative’ Bradford demonstration, says it does not endorse unlawful behaviour of any kind</strong></a><br><p>The PTI’s UK chapter has deleted a post on X which showed a video of “provocative” statements against Pakistan’s military leadership, saying it did not endorse unlawful behavior of any kind and advised “independent citizens” to “measure their remarks to avoid any misunderstandings”.
On Friday, the Foreign Office (FO) had summoned Acting British High Commissioner Matt Cannell to receive a demarche over the “provocative” statements and “incitement to violence” against the military leadership.
Informed sources said the British government had formally been asked to identify, arrest, investigate and prosecute those who used UK soil to “issue direct threats” against Pakistan’s military leadership.
Sources said that a video posted on PTI UK’s official X account on Dec 23 showed demonstrators — outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford — openly threatening the military leadership while surrounded by people holding PTI flags. The post has since been deleted.
In a post on X early on Saturday, PTI UK said it had removed the post featuring a citizen’s “metaphorical remarks” against the military leadership.
“Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding, and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights,” it said.
It alleged that Pakistanis at home and abroad were facing “unprecedented repression”, calling on the government to prioritise investigations into these cases.
“Public frustration is high due to Imran Khan and Bushra Khan’s prolonged isolation in inhumane and undignified prison conditions, as endorsed by the UN special rapporteur on torture,” it said.
“Concerns about their health and well-being are real and the cause of anxiety and anguish for his family, party members and millions of supporters all around the world,” it added.
“While this global concern is understandable and completely valid, PTI does not endorse unlawful behavior of any kind. Independent citizens are also advised to measure their remarks to avoid any misunderstandings,” it added.
“PTI remains firmly committed to non-violence and the rule of law, in accordance with the guidance of Imran Khan,” it said.
“It is also pertinent to state that we hope that this citizen in question will not be subjected to any act falling under transnational repression and the British government will ensure her safety, well-being and her right to due process,” it added.
Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, who is part of the National Dialogue Committee (NDC) attempting to lower political temperatures, hailed the PTI’s move as “undoubtedly a positive step and a wise decision”.
“It will greatly contribute to de-escalating tensions among all parties involved. With such constructive measures, we can pave the way for a conducive atmosphere for dialogue,” he wrote on X.
“Let us foster an environment of mutual respect and resolve our differences in a manner befitting a great nation like Pakistan,” Chaudhry added.
Pakistan demarches UK
On Friday, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andarabi confirmed that a demarche had been issued to the acting British high commissioner, demanding action against all those involved.
“The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. He urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”.
Subsequently, the UK advised Pakistan to share evidence with its police.
“Where a foreign government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation,” the spokesperson for the British High Commissioner said.
Earlier in the day, two ministers of state from the PML-N said the Pakistani government had written to UK authorities seeking action against what they described as “provocative” statements, particularly in reference to the video circulating online.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani had spoken to Geo News, with the latter specifically mentioning that the “head of the armed forces had been threatened” in the video.
Kayani had also named the opposition PTI for its “involvement” in the matter, unlike Chaudhry. He had termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”.
“We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” he added.
Separately, former PTI leader Imran Ismail, who is also part of the NDC, had called on the party to issue an “unequivocal condemnation of the highly irresponsible and inflammatory remarks”.
“Such statements, which appear to incite violence and terrorism, are utterly unacceptable, deeply damaging to Pakistan’s national interests, and risk escalating an already tense political environment both at home and abroad. They also expose Pakistani diaspora communities to unnecessary scrutiny and jeopardize bilateral relations with host countries like the UK,” he said in a post on X on Friday.
“A prompt, clear, and unified condemnation from the party’s central leadership would not only uphold responsible political discourse but also demonstrate PTI’s commitment to non-violence and constructive opposition. Silence or ambiguity on this issue would be misinterpreted and counterproductive,” he said.
The development comes weeks after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions.
On Dec 4, the interior minister, in a meeting with the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, submitted extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja, who Naqvi said were involved in spreading “anti-Pakistan propaganda” online.</p><small>2025-12-27 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/271300307cbb268.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963554/police-say-wanted-terrorist-commander-killed-in-lakki-marwat-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Police say wanted terrorist commander killed in Lakki Marwat operation</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: District police said on Saturday that a wanted terrorist commander was killed during an ongoing operation in the Lakki Marwat district’s Takhtikhel area.
On Friday, six terrorists were reportedly killed and several others injured in an intense exchange of fire with police backed by Counter-Terrorism Department commandos, armed villagers and members of peace committees.
In a statement released on Saturday, district police said that a major success had been achieved in the ongoing joint operation with the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) against Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
Police said terrorist commander Nusratullah, alias Nusrat Wazir, was killed during the operation conducted in Takhtikhel. Police said the terrorist was wanted by the Bannu CTD in relation to 28 cases registered on terrorism charges.
“Nasratullah was among the most wanted on the terrorism list in the region,” police said, adding that the government had set a bounty of Rs2.5 million on his head.
The statement added that the search and clearance operation was still underway so that the “remaining miscreants can be eliminated”. The police termed the development a “morale booster“, stating it was an “important step” towards establishing peace in the region.
In a separate press release, the district police said that at least one police constable — identified as Umar Jan — was martyred in the operation.
“A brave son of the motherland sacrificed his life in the line of duty during the operation against Fitna al Khawarij,” the statement said, adding that his funeral prayers were offered at Police Lines Lakki Marwat.
Lakki Marwat District Police Officer Nazir Khan, who was present at the funeral, was quoted as saying that personnel who sacrificed their lives to protect the beloved homeland “are our real heroes”. He vowed that their sacrifices “will not go in vain”.
“Lakki Marwat police is fighting against terrorists, anti-social elements and Fitna al Khawarij with full strength, determination and unity,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-27 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/12/5a3f19c78d756.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1378556/who-killed-benazir-bhutto' target='_blank'><strong>WHO KILLED BENAZIR BHUTTO?</strong></a><br><p>This piece was originally published on December 24, 2017.

Sarwar Khan struggled to breathe as he opened his eyes in the suffocating darkness. Only a few hours earlier he had been at his desk in Islamabad finishing up an ordinary day’s work. Now the Ahmadi businessman was nailed inside a coffin, gasping for air. His captors had injected him with sedatives and were attempting to transport him out of the city in an ambulance, disguised as a corpse — but the dose was wearing off, giving way to Sarwar’s blood-curdling screams. As the kidnappers stopped to subdue their human freight, a taxi driver on the highway witnessed the suspicious activity and called the authorities.
The police action that followed that day in February 2009 led to the capture of one of the most influential AlQaeda strategists and ideologues in the organisation’s history. Major Haroon Ashiq was arrested from the outskirts of Peshawar while trying to smuggle Sarwar Khan into the tribal areas. A former Special Services Group (SSG) commando, Haroon had left the army after 2001 and joined hands with the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) before graduating to the highest ranks of Al Qaeda’s network in Pakistan. Major Haroon, it emerged, had been a mastermind of the Mumbai attacks the previous year and also a key player in some of the most spectacular militant operations in Pakistan in living memory. These included a sustained campaign of attacks on Nato supply lines, the murder of a former head of the elite SSG Major General Faisal Alvi, as well the kidnapping of Karachi-based filmmaker Satish Anand.
Haroon’s role in Al Qaeda was not merely operational but also strategic and visionary. He was one of the only Pakistanis to be elected a member of the organisation’s shura (council) and is credited with reviving its flagging fortunes after 2003 in a massive overhaul of the group’s organisational structure and tactics. Kidnapping for ransom was also a new tactic developed under him to help Al Qaeda out of a severe financial crunch.
Major Haroon admitted his role in all these acts but one of the most important pieces of information he gave to interrogators was about a case in which he claimed not to have been involved at all: the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.

December 27 marks a decade since one of the most traumatic events in Pakistan’s recent political history. A 10-year investigation into the masterminds behind the assassination of the former prime minister of Pakistan has yielded some breakthrough revelations, that are being presented here for the first time…


The morning after the assassination 10 years ago, as the country convulsed with grief and chaos, the government of Gen Musharraf announced that secret agencies had intercepted a phone call to Baitullah Mehsud, the amir of the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which indicated that the former prime minister had been assassinated by Mehsud’s men.
The disclosure was met with severe criticism and incredulity by an angry public. Doubts focused on the speed at which the government had produced the intercept, only fueling speculation about who killed her. News that the crime scene was hosed down minutes after the attack led to accusations of official complicity in the murder. The failure to conduct an autopsy compounded the situation and reinforced suspicions. Over the course of 10 years, these events have chronically overshadowed the case and ensured that the investigation into Pakistan’s most controversial murder would always remain limited in scope.
In August 2009, the Benazir murder investigation was transferred from the Punjab Police to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on the wishes of President Asif Ali Zardari. The Punjab Police inquiry under Additional IG CTD Chaudhry Abdul Majeed had been severely criticised for its incompetence by the UN Inquiry Commission among others. The new probe under DIG Khalid Qureshi of the FIA was able to piece together a much more detailed picture of what happened at the lower level of the plot.
According to investigators, there were at least five tiers in the planning hierarchy of the assassination. At the top of the pyramid were the masterminds, then came the planners, followed by the facilitators, then the handlers and lastly, the bombers themselves. In all, at least nine people are thought to have been involved. Another three people are accused of having knowledge of the plot. The perpetrators at each stage did not know the conspirators higher up and were only in touch with the cell directly above them. “You have to understand these people are the best in the world,” says an FIA official who worked on the investigation. “Many of them have been trained in clandestine operations and know the protocols. There are natural ‘cut-outs’ built into the plan.”
According to the official charge sheet, a key part of the attack was planned in Madrassa Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khattak by former students of the seminary: Nadir alias Qari Ismail, Nasrullah alias Ahmed and Abdullah alias Saddam. It is alleged that these facilitators were being run by a senior planner Ibad-ur-Rehman alias Farooq Chattan who also provided the suicide jackets. The Haqqania trio collected the suicide bombers, Bilal and Ikramullah, from South Waziristan and brought them back to Akora Khattak. Nasrullah then took the boys to Rawalpindi where they linked up with the handlers, locally based cousins Hasnain Gul and Muhammad Rafaqat, who were later arrested.

The most crucial piece of evidence linking Al Masri to the assassination was recovered from Osama Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad after the raid. The document seen by Eos, contains a memo delivered to Bin Laden just two days after the assassination.

Copies of the sworn confessions of Hasnain and Rafaqat obtained by Eos reveal details of how the two 15-year-old bombers were transported to Liaquat Bagh and how the handlers conducted the reconnaissance of the venue earlier the same day. Forensic analysis of call data records of the accused, corroborated through mobile tower geofencing, confirm Hasnain and Rafaqat’s accounts of their movements on 27th December.
‘The Long-necked one’: A Third Bomber?
According to the official investigation there were two bombers present in Liaquat Bagh on 27th December. Bilal alias Saeed and Ikramullah. These names are corroborated by the confessions of the handlers Hasnain and Rafaqat. The bombers were placed at alternative exits to ensure success in the event that Benazir took a different route out of the venue. In the end, investigators maintain that only one individual detonated his explosives and that this was Bilal alias Saeed. The other would-be suicide bomber, Ikramullah, escaped from the scene and has been declared a proclaimed offender.
DNA reports, however, appear to contradict the claim that there was only one assailant. Personal effects of the bomber recovered from the house of handler Hasnain Gul including a shawl, cap and pair of joggers, were tested against the remains of three individuals found at the crime scene. The DNA profiles of two individuals found on the shawl and in the joggers match the remains of two individuals from the crime scene. In effect, this means that another individual who came into contact with the shawl and joggers found from Hasnain’s house, perished in the blast. Eos has obtained exclusive access to DNA reports that prove the existence of this possible third attacker. The report was prepared by the FBI’s DNA laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, at the request of the FIA-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT). Its findings were originally included in an initial version of the challan submitted to the court, but this was later dropped without explanation. This version of the charge sheet states: “Comparison report of FBI Lab has corroborated Hasnain Gul’s confessional statement by confirming that 02 terrorists who left shawl and pair of joggers and cap in Hasnain Gul’s residence were killed in the blast on crime scene in Liaquat Bagh on 27-12-2007.”
Sources close to the investigation say the report lost evidentiary value because representatives from the FBI refused to come to Pakistan to testify before the court, rendering the report inadmissible under Pakistani law of evidence. Another reason it became untenable was because Pakistani investigators could not establish a ‘chain of custody’ relating to the human remains which were first collected by officials of another agency, who were later untraceable by the FIA. “It is possible that the identity of Bilal and Saeed, has been collapsed into one individual,” said one journalist who has followed the case closely. Evidence for the existence of a third bomber comes from two other sources. The phone call between Baitullah Mehsud and one Maulvi sahib, intercepted by the security agency, contains a reference to three bombers:
Baitullah Mehsud: Who were they?
Maulvi Sahib: There was Saeed, there was Bilal from Badar and Ikramullah.
BM: The three of them did it?
MS: Ikramullah and Bilal did it.
The conversation makes a clear distinction between Bilal and Saeed. Elsewhere, in a document prepared by the Interior Ministry, Saeed is referred to as Abdullah alias Saeed ‘the long-necked one’. The document claims that Abdullah alias Saeed, along with Bilal, Ikramullah and Nasrullah was also part of a failed plan to kill Benazir Bhutto in Arbab Niaz stadium in Peshawar on the 26th of December, a day before the assassination. The assailants were not able to get close enough to Ms Bhutto’s vehicle because of tight security and decided to move overnight to Rawalpindi where they were picked up by local handlers Hasnain Gul and Rafaqat. The account relating to an attempt in Peshawar the previous day is corroborated by Hasnain Gul’s confession who says he was told by Nasrullah that they had tried to launch but failed in Peshawar. However, there is no mention of Abdullah alias Saeed in any of the confessions in which the handlers admit to receiving only two bombers. The ‘long-necked one’ appears to vanish from the face of the earth. Some speculate that a third, hitherto unknown, terrorist cell could have been used to transport the third bomber to Liaquat Bagh.
The other men standing trial are Aitzaz Shah, Sher Zaman and Rasheed Ahmed Turabi, all three accused of having knowledge of the conspiracy. Aitzaz Shah, then a 15-year-old boy, was arrested from Dera Ismail Khan in January 2008. Police say he admitted to knowing about the plot to kill Benazir Bhutto and was prepared as a suicide bomber to target her if the first plan failed. He also identified the voice of Baitullah Mehsud on the phone call intercepted by the security services in which he (Mehsud) is told of the successful operation by one Maulvi sahib. Though not made part of the challan, intelligence sources believe that Maulvi sahib is a man called Azizullah, also a prominent upper-tier planner. Another individual, Maulvi Naseeb, a former teacher at Madrassa Haqqania, was also involved in ‘preparing’ the boys ‘for jannah’ in Akora Khattak. His role has also not been established in the challan. Both Azizullah and Naseeb have been reported killed.

Eos has obtained exclusive access to DNA reports that prove the existence of this possible third attacker. The report was prepared by the FBI’s DNA laboratory in Quantico Virginia at the request of the FIA-led JIT. Its findings were originally included in an initial version of the challan submitted to the court, but this was later dropped without explanation.

“There are many things we will never know now,” said one investigator involved in the prosecution. “The links are broken forever.” He was referring to the fact that virtually every single person of interest in the assassination conspiracy has been killed in mysterious circumstances. Only the lowest level operatives have been brought to trial.



Nasrullah and Qari Ismail were killed at a check post in Mohmand agency, on the 15th of January, 2008, as they tried to flee from police. They were transporting a 15-year-old suicide bomber who blew himself up in the car. Qari was killed instantly and Nasrullah died a few days later in hospital. Investigators say he (Nasrullah) was a key figure in the conspiracy with Al Qaeda links who knew the identities of people higher up in the chain. Analysis of call data records from Nasrullah’s phone show he was constantly in touch with a number that was used in the ransom negotiations of Karachi-based businessmen Satish Anand and Aqeel Haji. Major Haroon Ashiq and his close comrade Ilyas Kashmiri were involved in these kidnappings.
Ibad-ur-Rehman alias Farooq Chattan, the alleged chief planner, was killed in a drone strike in Khyber agency on 15th May, 2010. Officials says his case is particularly confounding as he always remained a step ahead of police despite solid intelligence about his location. It is also pointed out that he was killed in the first-ever drone strike in Khyber Agency.
Abdullah alias Saddam was killed while handling an explosive device on 31st May, 2008 at Mamad Gatt, Mohmand Agency and he was buried in his native village Lakaro in Mohmand Agency.
Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike on 5th August, 2009 in South Waziristan during a conjugal visit with his second wife.
Baitullah’s Denial


TTP chief Baitullah Mehsud (right) was immediately accused of orchestrating Benazir Bhutto’s assassination

Soon after Benazir Bhutto’s assassination Baitullah Mehsud denied he had any role in it saying it was against Pakhtun customs to kill a woman. His spokesman Maulvi Omar said: “We are sad over Benazir Bhutto’s death. We do not have any enmity with Pakistani leaders and are only opposed to the US.” Officials close to the investigation are not convinced by the denial. “Baitullah only denied it later after the backlash came,” says one investigator. “He had to backtrack after the Sindhis started burning Mehsud trucks and tankers in Sindh. 90% of the trucks are run by the Mehsuds. It’s a huge source of revenue for him. He said we don’t kill women in our culture but that’s obviously false. They have no such qualms. They have killed countless women.”

Investigators have been able to piece together a fairly comprehensive picture of the lower sections of the plot, and also establish a prima facie case against Baitullah Mehsud. But the question of who was behind him has always remained elusive.
Eos has been able to obtain evidence that another hitherto unknown mastermind was behind the plot. The story begins with Major Haroon’s confession.
Haroon told his interrogators that the assassination of Benazir Bhutto was ordered by Osama bin Laden and that Baitullah Mehsud had been tasked to carry out the plan. Haroon claimed the emissary between Bin Laden and Mehsud was a militant called Abu Obaidah Al Masri who was in charge of Al Qaeda’s Pakistan operation.
Haroon said he was given this information by Ilyas Kashmiri. Kashmiri, himself a former SSG officer surged through jihadi ranks to become one of Bin Laden’s closest lieutenants and was also tipped by US counterterrorism experts to replace him as leader of Al Qaeda after the Abbottabad raid. Kashmiri and Major Haroon were the principal architects of the Mumbai attacks and worked closely together on a number of operations. Eos has obtained a confidential FIA document containing details of Haroon’s confession in which he confirms that the October 18th assassination attempt on Benazir Bhutto was also masterminded by Abu Obaidah al Masri and carried out through Baitullah’s men. The same network succeeded in assassinating Bhutto two months later in Rawalpindi.
In the document, Haroon also comments on the ‘superb’ planning and execution of the attack from an operational point of view and says he knew she would be vulnerable based on his assessment of her public rallies. “Benazir Bhutto was daring and bold lady and he (Haroon) was confident that she would definitely give chance to the assailants and that what she did [sic],” reads the report. Major Haroon is currently incarcerated in a special security block in Adiala Jail where he is considered one of the prison’s most fearsome inmates.
These revelations did not come as a surprise to officials close to the investigation who had long suspected an Al Qaeda link in Benazir’s murder, but were unable to establish it as part of the official investigation because of lack of evidence. Investigators who eventually brought the case against eight accused in the Benazir murder readily admit they were unable to prosecute the masterminds of the assassination, only nab the low level operatives.
“By the time the investigation came to us the evidence was destroyed, links broken,” says a senior member of the FIA-led JIT that worked on Benazir’s murder case speaking on condition of anonymity. “But the conspiracy began even before she set foot in Pakistan. The intelligence chatter was loud and shattering. It was the Arabs in the northwest…the Mirali/ Miranshah group who were entrenched there. The TTP was working for them.” The investigator is convinced that there was a strong Al Qaeda link. “I believe Beitullah did [it] at the behest of the Arabs.”
Al Qaeda’s Target Pakistan Operation
Al Qaeda’s dominant presence in the tribal areas post 9/11 and its role in reshaping centuries-old local dynamics there has been well documented by local and western scholarship. In particular, its ability to decapitate the vanguard of traditionally pro-establishment tribal leaders in favor of a younger group of ruthless but malleable anti-state warlords, such as Baitullah Mehsud, changed the region forever.
Al Qaeda’s power came from its ability to harness the potential and reach of local actors by introducing sophisticated techniques and improving the capacity of militant groups in Fata. From bomb-making and fundraising, to information operations and guerilla tactics, the organisation’s foreign fighters turned the TTP into one of the most deadly insurgent groups on earth. In 2005, Al Qaeda was also able to convince the Taliban to accept the use of suicide bombing as a strategic weapon, a massive game changer.
Despite insistence from senior Al Qaeda ideologues such as Ayman Al Zawahiri, Bin Laden was at first reluctant to attack Pakistan — partly to maintain it as a sanctuary and recruiting ground, but mostly because he long believed the real war was against the ‘far enemy’ which was to be routed in the Afghan theatre.
A new book The Exile (Bloomsbury), about Bin Laden’s years in hiding by award-winning journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy, argues that Ilyas Kashmiri played an instrumental role in putting Pakistan in Al Qaeda’s crosshairs. At a top leadership meeting, Kashmiri argued that in addition to punishing its pro-western leaders, creating domestic chaos in Pakistan would ensnare the Pakistani security agencies who would then be less able to come after them. The argument was clinched after the siege of the Al Qaeda-linked Red Mosque in Islamabad which was to prove a watershed moment. The group’s decision to take the war to Pakistani cities in 2007 was a turning point which ushered in an era of unprecedented carnage.
Bin Laden needed an experienced and dedicated head of operations in Pakistan to lead the new strategy. He appointed an Egyptian called Sheikh Abdul Hameed as Ameer-e-Khuruj [Leader of the Revolt] to direct the war inside Pakistan. Sheikh Abdul Hameed is an alias for Abu Obaidah al Masri, the man mentioned in Major Haroon’s confession as the planner of Benazir Bhutto’s assassination.
Al Masri was already the head of Al Qaeda’s external operations and responsible for the London bombings as well as the near-successful attempt to blow up 18 transatlantic airliners mid-flight. It was now time to turn their guns on their host country. In the months that followed, Al Qaeda was to shake Pakistan to its foundations.
The Menace of Al Masri

Despite a career in militancy spanning three decades, relatively little is known about the man who would lead Al Qaeda’s revolt in Pakistan. No photograph of Abu Obaidah exists, but disparate pieces of information come together to form a clearer picture. Al Masri was originally from the Sharqia governorate in the Nile Delta in Egypt, but is thought to be a Sudanese citizen. Described as a ‘journeyman fighter’ from the first generation of jihadis, he was a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Chechnya. Al Masri was a seasoned operator in Pakistan. According to intelligence sources, he was a key planner in the bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad in November 1995 which killed 17 people. His mentor Ayman Al Zawahiri masterminded the attack. Benazir Bhutto was prime minister at the time and said the attack was “retribution for the extradition of Ramzi Yousef”, an Al Qaeda militant who had been handed over to the US. Twelve years later, Al Masri would be back in Pakistan to kill Benazir Bhutto.
The Abbottabad Memo
The most crucial piece of evidence linking Al Masri to the assassination was recovered from Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad after the raid. The document seen by Eos contains a memo delivered to Bin Laden just two days after the assassination. The memo from Al Masri, delivered via courier, refers to the ‘special task’ and informs Bin Laden of the successful “operation in ‘Pindi”, confirming it was his men who murdered Benazir. “More good is to come in revenge for our brothers and sisters in Hafsa and Lal mosques,” reads the memo. Benazir was not directly involved in the Red Mosque siege, though she was the only politician who had openly supported the operation against it. In this context, however, the reference to the Red Mosque is a wide-ranging pretext for all operations against the Pakistani state and its leaders.
The courier goes onto discuss operational issues and conveys Al Masri’s concern about a shortage of funds. The message asks for Bin Laden’s permission to open a local branch in Pakistan. This is most likely a request to offer the franchise to a local group. The courier makes a supplication on behalf of Al Masri saying he is: “already taking care of the two jobs and his productivity would undoubtedly be higher should he be dedicated to one job only.” Analysts who have looked at the memo believe this a reference to the fact that Al Masri was simultaneously running Al Qaeda’s external operations and the organisation was suffering from an increasing dearth of leadership after the loss of a number of senior operatives.
The existence of this document was first revealed by investigative journalist Azaz Syed in his book The Secrets of Pakistan’s War on Al Qaeda. According to Syed, the document was among the material that American Navy Seals were not able to take with them from the compound and which was later catalogued by Pakistani investigators. “The most striking feature of this memo is the timing, delivered only two days after the assassination,” says Syed. “The general impression about Osama in Abbottabad is that he was completely isolated, but this proves he was very much in touch with key figures of his network and getting updated virtually in real time.”
An Arabic-language expert who was shown the memo is of the view that it was written by someone who knows Arabic but was not a native speaker. Syed believes this was most likely Abu Ahmad Al Kuwaiti, Bin Laden’s trusted courier and one of the few people who had access to him in the last days. Kuwaiti was actually a Pakistani whose real name was Ibrahim Saeed. A speaker of Arabic and Pashto, Saeed lived with Bin Laden for a number of years in the Abbottabad compound and was his only link to the outside world. It was Saeed’s phone calls that inadvertently led the US to Bin Laden’s lair, where Saeed was also killed alongside his master.

Bin Laden’s final years in Abbottabad, as revealed through the memo and a treasure trove of similar evidence collected by the Americans from the compound, reveal an astonishingly resilient picture of the Al Qaeda leader. Despite his isolation, and periods of great depression and scarcity, Bin Laden appears to have been deeply engaged with his network, issuing directives, confirming appointments and also monitoring developments in the region closely, particularly in Pakistan, which was of special interest.
Yet more evidence suggests he had monitored Al Qaeda’s assassination program most closely. A secret security agency document leaked to Eos suggests that he personally oversaw the assassination of Benazir and attempts on other political leaders. The document dated 19th December, 2007, states that the agency has ‘reliably learned’ that Osama bin Laden has issued orders for the assassination of President Musharraf, Benazir Bhutto and Maulana Fazlur Rehman. According to the information, Bin Laden planned to send the explosives through a Pakistani national called Musa Tariq who was en route to Dera Ismail Khan. Citing the intelligence, the document also claims that “Osama bin Laden is personally supervising the operation and for this purpose has moved to Afghanistan.”
Former Interior Minister Rehman Malik told Eos that after his party took government, he looked more deeply into the source of this information. “It came from an informant in Miranshah,” he said. “There were reports that six people had been sent down from Fata to carry out the attack. That corresponds to the information we were subsequently able to gather about the bombers and their handlers.”
In April 2008, US intelligence sources reported that Abu Obaidah Al Masri was dead. A US official told the BBC that Masri had apparently “died within the last two months, probably of hepatitis.” Assassinated journalist and terrorism expert Saleem Shahzad wrote about Al Qaeda’s disappointment at not being able to capitalise on the chaos in Pakistan in the post-December 27 situation because of Al Masri’s demise.
Shahzad had previously reported the only claim of responsibility in the Benazir assassination when an Al Qaeda spokesman contacted him by phone. “We terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat (the) mujahideen,” he quoted Mustafa Abu Al Yazid as saying. Yazid, also known as Sheikh Saeed al Masri was known as Al Qaeda’s chief paymaster since the 1990s but rose to greater prominence in 2008, after the death of Abu Obaidah al Masri. Yazid was also involved in the financing of the 9/11 attacks, though it is said he was initially against the plan. He was killed in a drone attack in May 2010.
On August 31 this year, an Anti Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi announced a verdict in the 10-year long Benazir Bhutto murder case. The judgement acquitted the five TTP-linked suspects and handed down 17-year jail terms to two police officers for criminal negligence in ordering the hosing down of the crime scene and their failure to provide Ms Bhutto security. The ATC also declared retired Gen Pervez Musharraf an absconder in the case. The confessions of the five accused militants were declared inadmissible by the judge on procedural bases. The police officers who are out on bail have appealed against the verdict, whereas the prosecution has appealed against the acquittal of the five accused militants. While the appeals play out in court, there now seems little chance that this judicial inquiry will advance the public’s knowledge about the larger conspiracy to eliminate Benazir Bhutto.

The pumped-up tourists dismissed Australia for 132 soon after lunch in front of a bumper 92,045 crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, following the 20 wickets that tumbled on day one.
It left them chasing 175 to win, with Harry Brook unbeaten on 18 and Jamie Smith on three seeing them home for the loss of six wickets to huge roars from their travelling “Barmy Army” of fans.
Jacob Bethell contributed 40 and Zak Crawley 37.
“A good feeling, a tough tour up to now,” said England skipper Ben Stokes.
“After the build-up to the Test, a lot thrown our way, to put in a performance on the back of all that, and beat a very good Australian team, a lot of credit has to go to players, staff and management for keeping the focus on cricket.
“Very proud. We showed bravery and were courageous.”
England crashed in the first three Tests and came to Melbourne under enormous pressure amid questions about their limited preparations and allegations of excessive drinking during a mid-series beach break.
But they finally came good and will head to Sydney for the fifth and final Test brimming with confidence.
England had not won a Test in Australia since January 2011 at Sydney, losing 16 and drawing two since, and openers Crawley and Ben Duckett had a clear objective to snap the streak — play ultra-aggressive “Bazball” style.
Duckett hit a boundary off Mitchell Starc in his first over while Crawley slammed Michael Neser for a six and a four in successive balls.
They brought up a whirlwind fifty opening partnership but next ball Duckett was bowled by a Starc yorker for 34.
Fast bowler Brydon Carse then strode to the middle as a surprise number three in place of Bethell.
But England’s pinch-hitting experiment failed as Carse lasted only eight balls before skying Jhye Richardson to Cameron Green.
Crawley fell lbw to Scott Boland after a gritty knock and Bethell was caught by Usman Khawaja from the same bowler.
Richardson trapped Joe Root lbw for 15 and Starc accounted for Ben Stokes for two, but by then only 10 runs were needed and Brook and Smith completed the job.
“It was a tricky one, a quick game,” said Australia captain Steve Smith.
“If we had got 50-60 more in both innings then things might have been different. The wicket played as expected, but once the ball softened, it didn’t quite behave the way I’d hoped.
“When you see 36 wickets fall in two days, that probably tells you it did a bit more than intended,” he added of the MCG pitch.
Pitch criticised
Australia resumed on 4-0 in their second innings after an explosive opening day of searing pace saw 20 wickets fall with the hosts dismissed for 152 and England just 110.
It was the most wickets to tumble on the first day of an Ashes Test since 1909, and eclipsed the 19 on day one of the series opener in Perth.
With 10 millimetres of grass on the track it was a bowler’s dream, but a host of former greats criticised the pitch for “doing too much” and being “unfair for the batters”.
Nightwatchman Boland edged Gus Atkinson to wicketkeeper Smith but the bowler left the field soon after clutching his left hamstring.
Josh Tongue came into the attack on a hat-trick after bagging the last two Australia wickets on day one, but Jake Weatherald whipped his full ball for three.
Weatherald needed a decent knock to cement his spot at the top of the order, but he failed again, bowled by Stokes for five leaving a delivery that nipped back.
Travis Head was joined by Marnus Labuschagne but he only made eight, caught by Root in the slips off Tongue.
Head was in good touch before being bowled on 46 by a peach of a delivery from Carse that beat the outside edge, and when Khawaja (0) and Alex Carey (4) departed in the space of nine balls the momentum was back with England.
After reaching lunch at 98-6, Green (19) became the seventh wicket to fall with the score on 119, edging a rising Stokes ball to Harry Brook at slip.
Carse bagged Neser and Starc without scoring and Richardson fell to Stokes with the last four wickets tumbling for 13 runs, leaving Steve Smith unbeaten on 24.</p><small>2025-12-27 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2023/12/658b68b75a536.jpg?r=095845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1801058/remembering-benazir' target='_blank'><strong>Remembering Benazir</strong></a><br><p>This piece was originally published on Dec 27, 2023.

SIXTEEN years ago this day, Benazir Bhutto became the highest-profile victim of terrorism. The wound inflicted by the assassination of one of Pakistan’s most charismatic leaders has not yet healed.
With the country facing what is perhaps the most difficult and testing time in its history, the loss of Benazir Bhutto is felt more than ever. The long shadow of despotism is hanging over the country yet again.
Benazir galvanised a people wary of a long period of authoritarian rule and gave voice to the dispossessed and disenfranchised masses. Even her bitterest political opponents gave her credit for her courage and defiance, which may have ultimately cost her her life.
The controversy over how Benazir was killed exposed the chasm of trust between the Pakistani state and its people. It is still not known who plotted her assassination.

 

Benazir undoubtedly had her weak points but her sincerity to the cause of democracy was beyond doubt. I was a witness to the era that marked her epic struggle. As a journalist, I was privileged to be with her at various stages of her political struggle.
During that period, I had numerous on- and off-the-record conversations with her, giving me a rare insight into her political evolution. She was a fighter all the way.
She began her political career as the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but turned out to be a leader in her own right. She had the intellectual capacity to engage with even her strongest critics, a quality rarely found in our political leaders. Her loss is more than that of a political leader. She came to symbolise the unity of an uneasy federation. Her death exacerbated political divisions and polarisation.
Benazir served twice as prime minister but both her terms were short-lived. Her first stint came after the PPP swept the polls in 1988 following the death of Gen Zia in an air crash. It was apparent that the generals conceded reluctantly to the people’s verdict. The handing over of power to the PPP was not unconditional.

Sixteen years after the death of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan once again finds itself at a crossroads.

It was fairly obvious that the powerful generals had never reconciled with the idea of a Bhutto government. But she accepted the challenge. “I am a fighter and fighters don’t give up,” she told me in her first interview as prime minister. And that she was.
The generals waited for an opportune moment to strike. After just one and a half years in power, the PPP government was removed in August 1990 in what was described as a constitutional coup.
Benazir was implicated in a number of cases. Every effort was made to rig the elections. Against this backdrop, the 1990 election results did not come as much of a surprise. “Elections have been stolen,” a shocked Benazir said as the elections results were being announced on television. She was in tears.
That was darkest period for Benazir. She spent her time going from one court to another. It was, perhaps, the most testing of times for the former prime minister with demoralisation gripping her party. There was also a move to disqualify her and force her to leave the country. However, all that failed to break her determination.
Her triumphant return to power in November 1993 marked the culmination of another period of struggle. With a majority in the National Assembly and a president from her own party, she felt comfortable. She also seemed to have learnt from her past mistakes and was much more chastened. She wanted to move forward and leave behind the treatment meted out to her.
There was a much better environment for her new government to function in. She was more familiar with the system of government. But the challenges were no less. Despite an extremely favourable political situation, the second Benazir government started floundering midway through her term.
The fate of her fledgling government was sealed when her brother Murtaza Bhutto was killed in September 1996 at a police shootout outside his house. The tragedy shook Benazir. She believed that her brother’s murder was the result of a larger conspiracy to destabilise her government.
It summarily brought to an end the three-year-long second Benazir Bhutto government. There was a sense of déjà vu as an elected prime minister was sent packing yet again. She was implicated once more in multiple cases and she left the country to escape persecution.

 

Benazir finally returned to Pakistan on Oct 18, 2007. As her procession proceeded, suddenly, in quick succession, two huge blasts struck her truck. Mayhem ensued, with mutilated bodies littering the street. It was the worst terrorist attack in the nation’s history. Benazir survived. But the assassins pursued her. On Dec 27, 2007, a second attack on Benazir in Rawalpindi succeeded. She became a victim of the same terrorism she had vowed to fight.
Pakistan is once again standing at a crossroads as it observes the 16th anniversary of her death today. It is a nation maimed, its very existence threatened by growing internal fissures and rising extremism. Social and cultural divides have become more pronounced, with growing economic disparity, and increasing discontent in the ranks of the new underclass.
A major question before us now is whether the country can continue on a democratic path or whether it will be ruled by the forces of authoritarianism. The country needs political reconciliation. It needs another charter of democracy on the lines of the 2006 document that Benazir Bhutto signed with her arch-rival and another former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. There has to be a charter of economy to take the country out of the present crisis as well as a new social contract recognising the democratic rights of all nationalities in order to keep the country united under a federal system.
But the main question is whether such reconciliation is possible with the widening political divide. The security establishment is now far more deeply entrenched in all aspects of the country’s power structure, turning Pakistan into a quasi-military dispensation. The challenge to democracy today is no less than what it was when Benazir was alive.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.
In a statement, he congratulated Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, praised his leadership and invited him to visit Israel.
Netanyahu said the declaration “is in the spirit of the Abraham Accords, signed at the initiative of president Trump”.







The 2020 accords were brokered by Trump’s first administration and included Israel formalising diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, with other countries joining later.
Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Somaliland’s president signed a joint declaration of mutual recognition, the Israeli statement said.
Abdullahi said in a statement that Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, calling it a step towards regional and global peace.
He said Somaliland was committed to building partnerships, boosting mutual prosperity and promoting stability across the Middle East and Africa.
But Somalia’s government condemned Israel’s move as an “unlawful step” and a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty, rejecting any recognition of Somaliland, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.
“The federal government affirms its determination to pursue all necessary diplomatic, political, and legal measures, in accordance with international law, to defend its sovereignty, unity, and internationally recognised borders,” the statement said.
Egypt said Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held phone calls on Friday with his counterparts from Somalia, Turkey and Djibouti to discuss what they described as dangerous developments in the Horn of Africa following Israel’s announcement.
The ministers condemned Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, reaffirmed their full support for Somalia’s unity and territorial integrity, and warned that recognising breakaway regions posed a threat to international peace and security, Egypt’s foreign ministry said.
The African Union also rejected any recognition of Somaliland, reaffirming its “unwavering commitment” to Somalia’s unity and territorial integrity and warning that such moves risked undermining peace and stability across the continent, the AU Commission chair said.
Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.
Over the years, Somalia has rallied international actors against any country recognising Somaliland.
The former British protectorate hopes that recognition by Israel will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to international markets.

For the next fiscal year (FY27), markup payments are estimated to drop further to 5.9pc of GDP, to be followed by 5.2pc of GDP in FY28, 5.1pc in FY29 and finally settling at 4.8pc in FY30 amid falling policy rates and resultant lower debt payments.

 

In absolute numbers, interest payments are estimated to slightly decline to Rs8.225 trillion during the current year, down from Rs8.88tr at the close of FY25. This would remain almost static around Rs8.2tr in FY27 and FY28 and then increase to Rs8.8tr and Rs9.3tr in FY29 and FY30.

Lender projects interest payments to ease through FY30 as policy rates fall

The national economy, measured by nominal GDP, has been estimated at Rs126tr for the current year, Rs140.7tr next year, Rs156.5tr in FY27, Rs174tr in FY29 and then Rs194tr in FY30.
But despite these improving debt servicing-to-GDP indicators, PSDP would continue to struggle both in absolute numbers and as a share of GDP.
Based on detailed interactions with the government as part of the second review of its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility, the IMF said the PSDP expenditure, originally estimated at 0.9pc of GDP in FY25, had been contained to 0.7pc to make up for the revenue shortfalls. The PSDP has been estimated to stay uncha­nged at 0.7pc for the current year.
Alarmingly, the PSDP has been projected to fall further to 0.6pc of GDP next year and then stay unchanged through FY30.

 

Even in absolute terms, the IMF has worked out PSDP spending for the current year at Rs873bn for the current year against its original estimate of Rs1.065tr. It would remain around the same level, ie Rs885bn, in FY27 and slightly improve to Rs984bn in FY28, Rs1.1tr in FY29 and Rs1.2tr in FY30.
Conversely, the size of defence expenditure would make a comeback both in absolute terms and as a share of the national economy.
The IMF said the defence budget had declined from 2.4pc of GDP in FY21 to 1.8pc in FY24 and then slightly recovered to 1.9pc last year. For the current fiscal year, the defence expenditure has been projected to increase further to 2pc of GDP this year and then maintain this share all along until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the defence budget has been on an upward journey — rising from Rs1.3tr in FY21 to Rs2.2tr in FY25, showing a cumulative increase of 67pc in four years.
This will keep growing to Rs2.57tr during the current year, followed by Rs2.87tr next year and Rs3.2tr in FY28. The defence expenditure would further go up to Rs3.56tr in FY29 and then Rs3.96tr in FY30, showing a cumulative increase of more than 80pc against FY25 spending.
The government has been restructuring the PSDP portfolio on the IMF prodding to improve project selection, but even the Fund has been unable to restrict allocations for parliamentarians’ constituency schemes under the so-called Sustainable Develop­ment Goals (SDGs) Achie­vement Programme (SAP) that has claimed Rs70bn for the current year.
The government has given a commitment to the IMF to continue to improve project selection criteria and streamline the project pipeline to “better focus PSDP on long-term capital spending”.
“With careful reprioritisation, we have streamlined the PSDP pipeline by Rs2.5tr (around 25pc of the total). We will cap new project allocations to 10pc of the total in the FY27 budget,” the finance minister said in a written undertaking.
He also pledged further improvements to a scorecard-based system for project selection, including reducing overlapping criteria, introducing negative marking for projects with negative externalities and increasing the weight for climate-related criteria.
The IMF also noted that the government would reduce or postpone spending in response to lower revenues linked to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy. “As in the past, contingent and development spending are most likely to be affected,” it said.
This, it added, explained low development spending in the first five months of the current fiscal year (July-November), with utilisation at 9.2pc of the Rs1tr annual allocation amid fiscal rationing to meet IMF contingency measures against growing revenue shortfalls.
Development spending of Rs92bn in the current year was 20pc lower than last year’s Rs115bn for the same five-month period.
“PSDP utilisation in the current year remained low due to a significant reduction in expenditure by provinces, special areas and the Ministry of Railways,” the Planning Ministry said last week. “Development spending remained modest, with Rs92bn utilised against Rs196bn sanctioned, led mainly by infrastructure,” it added.

In a statement released late on Friday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan was closely following recent developments in Yemen.
“Pakistan expresses its full support for the diplomatic efforts being undertaken by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for ensuring peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen. We also commend the efforts of the United Arab Emirates in this regard,” it said.
“We underscore the need for upholding the unity and territorial integrity of Yemen, and express the hope that the Yemeni stakeholders will avoid any unilateral steps that may result in further escalation of the situation,” it said.
“We also call on all Yemeni parties to engage constructively and in good faith towards an inclusive, negotiated political solution based on the agreed parameters,” the FO said.
“Pakistan expresses its hope that the ongoing diplomatic efforts will result in concrete steps towards achieving lasting peace in the country, and in bringing an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people,” it added.







Yemen’s main southern separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south earlier this month.
On Friday, the UAE’s foreign ministry said it welcomed Saudi Arabian efforts to support security and stability in Yemen and remained committed to backing stability in the country.
Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that Yemeni separatists should return the territory seized recently, adding that it sought to de-escalate tensions within the government camp.

“﻿﻿﻿Both sides agree to maintain current troop deployments without further movement,” their defence ministers said in a joint statement on the ceasefire.

 

“Any reinforcement would heighten tensions and negatively affect long-term efforts to resolve the situation,” according to the statement released on social media by Cambodia’s Defence Ministry.
The agreement, signed by Thai Defence Minister Natthaphon Nakrphanit and his Cambodian counterpart Tea Seiha, ended 20 days of fighting that has killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides.
The clashes were re-ignited in early December after a breakdown in a ceasefire that US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of fighting in July.

 

For more than a century, Thailand and Cambodia have contested sovereignty at various undemarcated points along their 817 kilometre land border — a dispute that has occasionally exploded into skirmishes and fighting.
The latest ceasefire will be monitored by an observer team from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional bloc as well as direct coordination between both countries, Natthaphon said.
“At the same time, at the policy level, there will be direct communication between the minister of defence and chief of the armed forces of both sides,” he told reporters.
Trump intervention
Simmering tensions between the two countries came to a head in July this year, when the neighbours clashed for five days along some parts of the frontier, leaving at least 48 people dead and 300,000 displaced before Trump intervened to bring about a truce.
That ceasefire broke down in early December with the two sides accusing each other of moves that led to clashes.

 

Since the conflict restarted, neither Anwar — currently ASEAN chair — nor Trump was successful in stitching together another ceasefire, as fighting spread from forested regions near Laos to the coastal provinces on the Gulf of Thailand.
The renewed parleys came after a special meeting on Monday of Southeast Asian foreign ministers in Kuala Lumpur, followed by three days of talks between the warring sides at a border checkpoint, where the two defence ministers met on Saturday.
In their joint statement, the ministers agreed on the return of people displaced from affected border areas, while also underlining that neither side would use any force against civilians.
Thailand will also return 18 Cambodian soldiers in its custody since the July clashes if the ceasefire is fully maintained for 72 hours, according to the agreement.
Saturday’s pact, however, made clear that it will not impact any border demarcation activities underway between both countries, leaving the task of resolving disputed areas along the frontier to existing bilateral mechanisms.
“War and clashes don’t make the two countries or the two people happy,” Thailand’s Air Chief Marshal Prapas Sornjaidee told reporters.
“I want to stress that the Thai people and the Cambodian people are not in conflict with each other.”</p><small>2025-12-27 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/27082446be1d0e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963462/conviction-under-child-marriage-law-doesnt-invalidate-nikkah-karachi-court-rules' target='_blank'><strong>Conviction under child marriage law doesn’t invalidate nikkah, Karachi court rules</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A sessions court has ruled that any conviction under the provision of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 does not render the marriage void or invalidate the nikkah.
“It is making clear that any conviction under the provision of Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 does not render the marriage void or invalidate the Nikkah from a personal law perspective. The Act is a restraint and penal statue and it does not contain provisions for annulment,” observed Additional District and Sessions Judge Zahoor Ahmed Chandio while sentencing a man to two years in prison for marrying an underage girl.
“The validity of the marriage contract (Nikkah) is a separate issue to be determined by the appropriate forum under the relevant personal law or the family courts and this court’s jurisdiction is limited to determining criminal liability under the penal sections cited,” observed the judge, who is also the presiding officer of Gender-Based Violence Court (South).

 

The court found Zulqarnain, alias Cheeko, guilty of the offence punishable under Section 3 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 and sentenced him to two years in prison.

Judge sentences man to two years in prison for marrying underage girl; observes that validity of marriage is a separate issue

He also imposed a fine of Rs25,000, on default the convict would serve additional imprisonment.
Regarding the co-accused, Qazi, and witnesses of the marriage, the court ruled that the file remained dormant against the absconding accused until their arrest or appearance.
According to state prosecutor Irfana Qadri, the accused was charged on three counts for offences under Sections 365-B (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage etc), 376 (3) (rape with minor) and Section 3 of the Sindh Marriage Act, 2013.
The prosecutor claimed that the accused had abducted the underage girl on April 26, 2023, and solemnised forcibly marriage (nikkah) and then committed rape with her.
However, the court exonerated the accused from two counts including abducting and raping the girl as the prosecution failed to prove charges against him.
Refereeing to the cross-examination of the complainant — mother of the girl — the court noted that she had admitted that when she met her daughter at the police station she (the girl) told her that no one had kidnapped her.
The girl also negated the prosecution version during her cross examination that “nobody abducted her and that her Nikkah with the accused was performed with her own will and consent, without any pressure”.
The court also mentioned that the prosecution also failed to prove that the accused had committed rape with the girl as it noted that “the victim (the girl) throughout the proceedings does not inspire confidence in the prosecution story. She voluntarily went to meet the accused, remained with him, executed a Nikkah [and] produced a freewill affidavit and did not raise any allegation of force or coercion before both the investigating officers. Even before the magistrate, it was established that she moved the application for recording her statement through her own counsel. Such conduct is wholly inconsistent with the version of forcible abduction and rape. The medical evidence also does not support the allegation of rape.”
Regarding the age of the girl, the court observed that she submitted that she was 18 years old while she had been married, however, as per medical evidence, the girl was between 14 to 15 years old and more towards 15 years.
“This is a professional scientific evidence strongly indicates that at the time of the test in May 2023, the victim was a child under 18,” the court noted, adding that the victim’s assertion in cross examination that she was 18 or 19 years old at the time of Nikkah which contradict to the medical evidence.

The five-year tenure of the GB Assembly was completed on Nov 24, and caretaker Chief Minister Yar Muhammad was sworn in on Nov 26.
Addressing a press conference in Gilgit, CEC Raja Shahbaz Khan said the polling day for the GB Assembly elections had earlier been announced for Jan 24 next year and that of LG polls for Feb 14.
“However, on the demand of political parties, and in view of the harsh weather conditions in the region, the polling days for both the GB Assembly and LG elections have been delayed, and a new election schedule will be issued accordingly,” he added.
CEC Khan said the revised schedule for both elections would be issued in April or May 2026, both elections would be conducted simultaneously during this period. He said that according to rules, once the election schedule is formally issued, no federal minister and the prime minister would be allowed to visit the region without prior permission from the GB Election Commission.

Says long-delayed local bodies’ elections will be held on party basis

The CEC said that local bodies’ elections in GB had not been held for the past 21 years, depriving the people of their democratic right. He stressed that LG elections would be conducted at all costs to ensure the people’s right to elect their representatives, hoping that the elected bodies would address local and civic issues in the region.
“Under the GB Order 2018 and election laws, the authority to conduct assembly and local government elections rests with the GB Election Commission,” he said, reiterating that both elections would be held on a party basis.
CEC Khan said that according to the latest census, GB has a total population of 1,709,049.
He said the region has 163 union councils, 10 district councils, five town committees, eight municipal committees and three municipal corporations.
The total number of local government representatives in GB stands at 1,719, including 1,303 general members and 416 women members.
He said the Local Government Act was enforced in the region on July 18, 2023. Reiterating the commission’s commitment, he said the elections would be conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner, and appealed to the people to exercise their right to vote to elect their representatives.

Archaeologists carry out excavation at Bhir Mound remains on Friday.—Dawn

• Evidence pushes civilisation timeline beyond 6th century BC• Uncovered ruins reveal advanced streets and drainage systems• Pottery, seals, other items indicate thriving commerce before arrival of Greeks
TAXILA: An excavation team working at the ancient remains of Bhir Mound, recognised as the first city of the Taxila Civilisation, has made a major archaeological breakthrough, uncovering compelling evidence of a well-organised urban settlement that predates the sixth century BC.
This significant discovery holds the potential to rewrite the early history of civilisation in the region, suggesting that Taxila was a thriving city centuries earlier than scholars previously belie­ved, existing even before the emergence of Achaemenid or Greek influence.
Mr Dogar described the current discovery as one of the most important in recent decades. He said the evidence confirms Taxila’s role was not merely that of a centre of learning or military activity, but as a fully developed urban civilisation that flourished in the region’s earliest historical phases.
Officials from the Punjab Department of Archaeology, who are currently conducting the extensive excavation at the ancient site, told Dawn on Friday that the newly unearthed remains point definitively to continuous human habitation.
The findings reveal a sophisticated civic structure, placing Taxila among the earliest known urban centres of South Asia.
Archaeologists at the site have uncovered specific remnants such as stone and mud-brick walls, carefully planned stre­­et and an advanced drainage system. These structural findings clearly indicates an organised and forward-looking society.
Aasim Dogar, the deputy director of the Punjab Department of Archaeology, said that the current evidence points towards a much older timeline than traditional historical accounts suggest.
“Evidence of second century, fourth century and sixth century culture de­­p­o­sits are found, and the further deep tre­n­­ch may lead to discovery beyond the sixth century,” Mr Dogar said.
He explained that pushing deeper into the stratigraphy may rewrite the history of the first city of Taxila beyond the sixth century BC, creating a historical profile “resembling it to Harappa and Gandhara grave culture”.
Beyond the structural discoveries, a significant number of physical artifacts have been recovered from the site.
Mr Dogar revealed that the team has found finely crafted pottery bearing int­ricate designs, ancient coins, and seals dating back to the second century B.C. These items reflect established trade networks and include stone and metal tools used in construction and daily life.
These findings collectively demonstrate that the settlement supported a complex social and economic system long before the period traditionally associated with Taxila’s rise.
Mr Dogar noted that the site flourished during the periods of Achae­m­e­nid, Greek, and Mauryan influence and was occupied at the time of Alexander the Great’s arrival in 326 BC.
The deputy director provided a detai­led history of the exploration at Bhir Mou­­nd to contextualise the current success.
He noted that the first extensive archaeological investigations were conducted by Sir John Marshall between 1918 and 1934, work that formed the basis for the original chronological and cultural interpretation of the site. A later excavation was led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1944-1945.
According to Mr Dogar, Wheeler focused on stratigraphic clarification and introduced modern excavation techniques to the region. These methods heavily influenced subsequent archaeological work in Pakistan.
After a hiatus of nearly two decades, renewed archaeological work is now being carried out by the Punjab Department of Archaeology..
Mr Dogar believes the breakthrough will draw international scholarly attention and significantly enhance Taxila’s standing on the global archaeological map.
Mr Dogar said that for the first time in excavations in Taxila, the latest Japanese and Chinese software and hardware technology are being utilised. This includes advanced GPS technology and scanners, alongside the geo-mapping of the city through the use of drone technology.
“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Mr Dogar said. “There are likely many more layers of history buried beneath Bhir Mound waiting to be uncovered.”

PUTRAJAYA: Jailed former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was convicted on Friday on all charges of abuse of power and money laundering, in the biggest trial yet tied to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, a ruling with political repercussions for both him and the current government.
Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah found Najib, 72, guilty on all four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering.

 

The verdict addresses the al­­leged embezzlement of massive sums from 1Malaysia Deve­lopment Berhad (1MDB) while Najib served as prime minister, with the court ruling that the evidence overwhelmingly pointed to his culpability.
“The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him,” Sequerah said in his verdict.
“It pointed towards the ac­­cused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him.”
Najib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, alongside fines up to five times the value of the misappropriated funds. He has been imprisoned since August 2022 after Malaysia’s top court upheld a conviction in a separate corruption case involving a 1MDB subsidiary.
Prosecutors successfully argued that Najib illegally received billions traceable to the fund. During the proceedings, the defence maintained Najib was misled by fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, into believing the funds were donations from the Saudi royal family.
Judge Sequerah dismissed this defence as “implausible.” He characterised letters allegedly proving the Arab donations as probable forgeries not corroborated by evidence, calling the narrative a “tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights.”
“The irresistible conclusion is that the Arab donation narrative is not meritorious,” Judge Sequerah said. “The evidence pointed unmistakably to the fact that the monies were, in fact derived from 1MDB funds.”
The judge added that testimony revealed Najib had an “unmistakable bond and connection” with Low, rejecting the claim that the former premier was a victim of rogue subordinates. Instead, the court found Low acted as Najib’s proxy in running the fund’s affairs.
Origin, plunder of 1MDB
The saga began with the cr­­eation of 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Berhad (1MDB) in 2009, a sovereign fund designed to bolster economic development, co-founded by Najib soon after assuming office.
He chaired its advisory board until 2016. However, US and Malaysian investigators allege the fund became a vehicle for industrial-scale theft.
Between 2009 and 2013, 1MDB raised billions of dollars in bonds ostensibly for inv­estment projects. In what the US Department of Justice des­cribed as its largest-ever kleptocracy investigation, auth­­orities say at least $4.5 billion was diverted to offshore bank accounts and shell companies.
Investigators say the siphoned funds were used to purchase high-end real estate, a private jet, a superyacht, jewellery and to finance the 2013 Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street.
At least six countries, including the US, Singapore and Switzerland, launched financial probes implicating high-ranking officials and global financial institutions. In 2020, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $3.9bn to settle investigations into its role in underwriting bond sales for the fund.
A tangled legal web
This conviction is the latest in a series of legal battles for Najib. In July 2020, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for criminal breach of trust and money laundering involving roughly $10 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit. A pardons board halved that sentence to six years in 2024.
Separately, Najib was acqu­itted in March 2023 of tampering with a 1MDB audit report.
In November 2024, a court granted him a discharge not amounting to an acquittal re­­garding the alleged misappropriation of funds meant for Abu Dhabi’s International Pet­roleum Investment Company, though prosecutors may recharge him later.
The ruling adds strain to Prime Minister Anwar Ibra­h­im’s governing alliance, which relies on the United Malays Na­­­­­­tional Organisation (UMNO), Najib’s party. Tensions have ris­en recently after a court denied Najib’s bid to serve his remaining sentence under house arrest.

A FEDERAL judge on Thursday temporarily barred the US government from detaining or deporting a British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke the residency of a critic accused of pressuring social media platforms to censor Americans.
According to BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick granted a temporary restraining order sought by Center for Countering Digital Hate’s Founder Mr Ahmed.
The ruling prohibits federal officials from detaining Ahmed, a US permanent resident, without a hearing while his legal challenge proceeds.
A complaint was filed by Mr Ahmed on Wednesday against Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pamela Bondi regarding the decision to sanction him.
The lawsuit challenges a State Department move to block the visas of Ahmed and four others over accusations that they sought to “coerce” technology companies into restricting free speech.

 

“I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online,” Mr Ahmed said.
Mr Rubio defended the administration’s decision online, saying the individuals were blocked due to concerns they organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and “punish American viewpoints they oppose”.
The sanctions sparked a backlash from European leaders, who argued the administration was targeting organisations dedicated to monitoring online hate speech and disinformation.
Ahmed, who holds a green card and lives in the US with his American wife and child, argued that deportation would forcibly separate him from his family.
His attorney, Roberta Kaplan, said the court’s swift intervention underscored the lack of legal footing for the administration’s actions.
“The federal government can’t deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn’t like what he has to say,” Mr Kaplan said.
The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC. However, a State Department spokesperson told the AFP that the US retains broad authority over entry.

His legal team has finalised a constitutional petition to contest the IHC’s December 18 verdict that declared his appointment unlawful on the basis of an allegedly invalid LL.B. degree, the sources said.
A division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan had issued a short order directing the law ministry to de-notify Justice Jahangiri. President Asif Ali Zardari subsequently approved the de-notification on the advice of the prime minister, and Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website.

 

Sources indicate the upcoming petition will argue that the IHC verdict was premature and violated principles of judicial propriety. A key contention will be that the Sindh High Court (SHC) had already suspended the Karachi University (KU) notification cancelling Justice Jahangiri’s deg­ree. The petition will assert that the IHC could not have delivered a final judgement on the validity of his appointment while the foundational issue regarding his degree remained sub judice before another high court.
The challenge is also expected to reiterate grave allegations of bias against Chief Justice Dogar. A day before his removal, Justice Jahangiri had filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against the chief justice. He accused CJ Dogar of violating the judicial code of conduct by discussing the pending case with him and suggesting that a post-dated resignation could help “prorogue” the proceedings. His application seeking the recusal of CJ Dogar and two other judges, citing a history of litigation between them, was rejected by the bench hours before the final verdict.
The IHC proceedings were marked by sharp controversy. During arguments in the degree case, Justice Jahangiri’s counsel, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, had strongly objected to the bench’s composition. He pointed out that Justice Jahangiri had earlier challenged CJ Dogar’s transfer to the IHC before the Supreme Court, creating an adversarial relationship that, he argued, disqualified the chief justice from hearing the case.
Justice Jahangiri’s legal team further contended that a superior court judge could only be removed through a reference to the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution.
The IHC bench, in its order, distinguished proceedings relating to misconduct from those concerning eligibility. It stated that “ample opportunity” had been provided for a response, which was not furnished. The bench concluded that without a valid LL.B. degree — a prerequisite for enrolment as an advocate — Justice Jahangiri was never eligible for elevation under Article 175-A of the Constitution, rendering his appointment “without lawful authority.”
Islamabad High Court Bar Association former president Riasat Ali Azad said that Justice Jahangiri had a strong case. He criticised the order as “tainted with malice” and questioned the bench’s composition. “It is unprecedented in judicial history that an unconfirmed judge was included on a bench examining the appointment of a judge who was third in seniority,” he said, referring to Justice Azam Khan, who is an additional judge.

LAHORE: Although Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi managed to reach Liberty Roundabout on Friday night, he was unable to deliver a planned speech at the venue as a heavy contingent of police had blocked all roads leading to area by setting up pickets.
Videos posted by PTI on social media showed a large number of party supporters, including Imran Khan’s sisters, Aleema Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi, present near Liberty Chowk.







The chief minister, who was due to launch the PTI’s street movement from Lahore, had earlier spent the day greeting and addressing PTI supporters, who met him at different points en route to Lahore.
His convoy eventually entered Lahore around 4:30pm, from where he made a bee-line for the Punjab Assembly. The visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Addressing PTI lawmakers at the Punjab Assembly, he thanked the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighted his treatment at the hands of police during the journey to Lahore.
“Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.”
CM Afridi assailed the federal government for failure to handle the economy, brain drain and declining industrial growth.







“Farmers are being driven to suicide. And what are their priorities? Making sure the PTI cannot hold rallies, stopping Imran Khan from meeting his sisters and arresting our workers,” he stated.
He also met with Punjab parliamentarians at the Punjab Assembly and visited the residences of party leaders Latif Khosa, Advocate Haider Majeed and Nadeem Bara.
‘Oppression is about to end’
Earlier, speaking to the media, CM Afridi said that “oppression is about to end” and that PTI founder Imran Khan would soon be among the people of Pakistan due to what he described as a massive public struggle since the alleged regime change operation in 2022.
Mr Afridi said that he was in Lahore to launch a mass street movement on the instructions of Imran Khan, urging the masses to prepare themselves and confront oppression and fascism without making mistakes. “We will take Imran Khan’s ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ (real independence) movement to its logical conclusion, restore the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and revive an independent judiciary and independent media,” he asserted.







The KP chief minister lambasted the Punjab government for what he termed the unleashing of fascism against PTI workers and their families, claiming that hundreds of workers and supporters had been detained in a police operation that began on Thursday evening.
Lambasting the PML-N leadership, he said those who once claimed they would sell their clothes to serve the people were now selling Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) at throwaway prices.
In a separate media interaction, Mr Afridi said major industries had left Pakistan and that skilled and educated youth were feeling insecure and migrating abroad, resulting in a severe brain drain. He regretted that industrial growth had turned negative.
Azma welcomes Afridi
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari welcomed Mr Afridi to Lahore, saying he was free to see the lights, enjoy local cuisine and explore the city. She remarked that former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur had previously been shown “the lights of Lahore”, and now CM Afridi should also witness Punjab’s progress and replicate its positive aspects in KP.
Ms Bukhari said Lahore was “the Europe of Pakistan” and added that if conditions in Peshawar were poor, visiting Lahore for learning and recreation was welcome. She said the KP chief minister had permission for tourism — political or informative — but would not be allowed to use abusive language, create unrest or spread chaos.
Foolproof security
The Punjab government has directed authorities to ensure foolproof security for visiting KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi during his stay in Lahore.
In a letter marked “most immediate”, the Punjab Home Department instructed the inspector general of police, inspector general of prisons, Lahore division commissioner and deputy commissioner to make comprehensive security arrangements for the KP CM during his three-day visit.
Today’s engagements
The PTI has shared the KP chief minister’s engagements scheduled at the Lahore High Court today (Saturday) from 1pm to 5pm.
According to the programme, CM Afridi will hold a meeting in the Lahore High Court meeting room with the family members of party workers currently languishing in military custody.
At the same venue, he will also meet party workers who, the PTI claims, faced torture and oppression after being arrested in cases related to May 9.
The chief minister will later participate in a lawyers’ convention organised by the Insaf Lawyers Forum.

Speaking at the graduation ceremony at the Kabul Police Academy, Haqqani announced that the doors for negotiations were open.
He said that his government continues to adhere to the commitments made under the Doha Agreement, not allowing Afghanistan’s soil to be used against any country, the Afghan Taliban’s official media reported.
However, despite earlier promises and the commitments made in the Doha Agreement, cross-border infiltration and attacks by militants continue in Pakistan.
Haqqani said that Afghanistan posed no threat to any country or region and that the Taliban leadership continued to strive to find ways for reasonable and durable solutions to end mistrust and misunderstanding of the international community. “The doors for negotiations to resolve current issues are not closed,“ he said.
Although Haqqani did not mention Pakistan by name, he appeared to refer to Pakistan’s long-standing demand from Kabul to rein in the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Relations between the two neighbours are strained following border skirmishes, which led to the closure of borders between the two countries since October 11, 2025.
Attempts by Turkiye and the UAE to broker an agreement between the two sides failed to break the ice, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of refusing to give a written undertaking to control the TTP, whose fighters, it says, continue to infiltrate through its 2600-km-long porous borders to launch attacks inside the country.
The remarks by Haqqani are significant in that the TTP owes its allegiance to him and has been operating from areas in Afghanistan that have been under his control since long.
It was precisely for this reason that Haqqani’s younger brother, Anas Haqqani, was part of the Afghan Taliban team negotiating with their Pakistani counterparts in Qatar and Turkiye.</p><small>2025-12-27 02:10</small></div><hr>
