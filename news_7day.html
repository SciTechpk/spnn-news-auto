The participants of the rally, led by PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal and Dr Hamid Achakzai, gathered in Quetta Metropolitan Corporation compound before the rally. They chanted slogans against the deportation of Afghan refugees and Peca Act.
They marched on various streets of the provincial capital carrying party flags, placards and banners inscribed with their demands.
The rally after reaching Manan Chowk converted into a public meeting which was addressed by Mr Ziaratwal, Dr Abdul Hamid Khan Achakzai, Abdul Haq Abdal, and others.
The speakers told the protesters that Afghan refugees came to Pakistan through UNHCR and spent over 40 years in the country. They made social relations with local people, established their business along with the people of Pakistan and now the government is sending them back to Afghanistan forcibly instead of giving them citizenship, the gathering was told.
They said that the West granted citizenship to those people who spend five years while the Pakistan government sent them after 40 long years. They demanded that Afghan “Kadwal” should not be repatriated rather be given Pakistani Citizenship and as Pakistani citizens will spend their lives peacefully according to the constitution and law of the land.
They condemned the treatment being done with the Afghan refugees while sending them to their country as said that their three generations during their stay as refugees obtained medical, engineering and other disciplines in Pakistani universities. They said that Afghan refugees should be recognized Pakistani citizen and issued citizenship certificate.

The warning was issued on World Malaria Day, as both WHO and Pakistan  called on all stakeholders to urgently intensify efforts to contain the  growing threat to the country and the region.
“Malaria is a major global threat, and we are seeing firsthand how  climate change is increasing both the risk and the cases in our  country,” said Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal. “Despite  challenges, Pakistan is fully committed to end this disease. It is not  just a health imperative — it is an investment in a healthier, more  equitable, safer, and more prosperous future for every nation.”
Under the international theme, “Reinvest, reimagine,  reignite,” WHO urged all stakeholders to join the big push to end malaria and support Pakistan’s efforts so that the response is not  undermined by a lack of resources.

Floods and rising temperatures have been identified as major factors to the surge in cases, with a reported peak of 2.7 million cases in 2023

The catastrophic 2022 floods triggered 6.6 million additional cases  over the 2022–2024 period — including a peak of 2.7 million cases in  2023, compared to 399,097 cases in 2021. As a result, the malaria burden  in WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region surged to an estimated 10.2  million cases in 2023 — a 137 per cent increase compared to 2015.
Despite the challenges, significant progress has been made over the  past decade in prevention and treatment. In partnership with WHO and  with support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  Malaria, Pakistan screened more than 11.4 million suspected cases in  2024 and treated 2 million confirmed malaria patients.
Additionally, 7.8m insecticide-treated nets were distributed  in 22 high-burden districts, contributing to a reduction in cases from  2.7m in 2023 to 2m last year.
“WHO is proud to partner with Pakistan to continue saving lives by  preventing and treating malaria,” said Dr. Dapeng Luo, WHO  Representative in Pakistan. “We have proven that investing in malaria  response saves lives, but we are also seeing how climate change is  hampering progress, posing a threat not only for Pakistan, but also for  the region and the world. We know how to end malaria, and we can do it  if all stakeholders invest and work together to reinforce the response  and adapt to the new risks triggered by climate change.”
According to data from 5,575 medical facilities across 80 endemic  districts, climate change and related impacts such as rising  temperatures and frequent flooding have led to an upward trend in  malaria cases and heightened risk of outbreaks.
Other contributing  factors include increasing poverty, limited access to quality  diagnostics and treatment, deteriorating security in Balochistan, tribal  areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and health care access issues in Sindh.
Evidence  shows that malaria control efforts are effective, but sustained and  coordinated action will be essential to mitigate the effects of climate  change, save lives and secure a healthier future for Pakistan.

The rallies organised by religious parties, civil soc­iety organisations, and po­­litical parties took place in various cities, including Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Dia­­mer, Ghizer, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Khar­mang and Nagar, on Friday and Saturday.
Elected members of the GB Assembly, religious leaders, civil society members, and students participated in the rallies.
The marchers announ­ced their unflinching support to Pakistan’s armed forces to defend the country from any misadventure from India. They also carried placards inscribed with slogans such as “GB will never allow illegal occupation of water”.

ISLAMABAD: As the fallout of the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians continues to reverberate across the region, Pakistan on Saturday called for an independent investigation into the deadly attack while also criticising India for leveling “baseless allegations” without a credible investigation or evidence.
“Continuing with its role as a responsible country, Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent, and credible investigation,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said during the passing-out parade of cadets at the Pakistan Military Academy.
PM Shehbaz emphasised Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying, “Pakis­tan has always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as the world’s frontline state against terrorism.” He also criticised India for what he described as a “pattern of exploitation” by leveling “baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence.”
He also drew a hard line on the issue of water resources, stressing continued water flow under the Indus Waters Treaty as a red line. “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline,” he said. “Any attempt to stop, reduce, or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus River Treaty would be responded to with full force and might.”
![](https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan
He vowed that Pakistan would not be deterred from supporting the Kashmir cause, stating, “Let there be no doubt Pakistan shall continue to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people till they achieve their rights through their great struggle and sacrifices.”
New Delhi did not immediately respond to Pakistan’s offer.
The offer by the prem­i­­er came as several count­ries, including Iran, Saudi Ara­bia, China and the Uni­­­ted Kingdom, intensified diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
The Chinese and British envoys met with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday, while Mr Dar also spoke to his counterparts from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Egypt. All these discussions were dominated by the Pahalgam attack.
Tensions between the two countries soared in the aftermath of the attack as India took a series of harsh measures, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty, downgrading diplomatic relatio­­ns, revoking visas for Pakistani na­­­tionals — including those und­er the South Asian Associa­tion for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) visa exemption scheme — and halting bilateral trade. Security measures were also heightened.
Pakistan mirrored India’s steps and went further by banning Ind­ian airliners from using its airspa­­ce and warning it could suspend all bilateral agreements, including the landmark Simla Agree­ment, which underpins rela­­tions between the two countries.
While India has stopped short of directly blaming Pakistan, officials have hinted at cross-border involvement, a claim Islamabad has firmly denied.
UNSC slams attack
The UN Security Council also condemned the “terrorist” attack in the Indian occupied Kashmir, as the 15-member body also released Pakistan’s statement outlining its retaliatory countermeasures to New Delhi’s “reckless” steps announced in the wake of the April 22 incident.
 
 

In a press statement cited by the state-run APP, the council members called for accountability and international cooperation to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice.
They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governments of India and Nepal, extending wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured in the attack.
Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, the council members reaffirmed. They underscored that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed.
The council members urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities.
They reaffirmed the need for states to combat by all means threats to international peace and security resulting from acts of terrorism, in accordance with the UN Cha­rter and other obligations under international law.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council released the press statement issued at the conclusion of Pakistan’s National Security Committee meeting, which was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday, as an official document. The Pakistani statement contained the retaliatory decisions taken during the NSC’s deliberations.
In a letter, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to the UN Security Council President for April, Jerome Bonnafont of France, on Friday.
“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the agenda item ‘India-Pakistan Qu­­estion’,” the council president told the members.
Separately, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the UN chief was paying “very close attention” to the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.
“I don’t agree with your comment, (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation bet­ween India and Pakistan,” Spok­esperson Stephane Duja­rric told a New York Post reporter at the regular noon briefing at UN Hea­dquarters in New York.
Following a question from APP whether the UN chief planned to speak to the leaders of India and Pakistan on his return from Rome, Mr Dujarric said that he hoped to have something on it later. At this, the Post reporter commented, “Amazing, by the way, two nuclear countries … might go to war may merit such little attention…?” “I don’t agree with your comment (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation between India and Pakistan,” Mr Dujarric responded.

Speaking at a news briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, at the conclusion of his visit to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group, Mr Aura­ngzeb disclosed that Pakistan has asked China to augment its existing currency swap line by an additional 10 billion yuan (approximately $1.4bn).
Pakistan currently mainta­ins a 30bn yuan swap line with China. “From our perspective, getting to 40bn renminbi would be good,” the minister said.
Explaining Islamabad’s priorities, Mr Aurangzeb emphasised that addressing the trade imbalance with the US was more important for Pakistan than the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs. He noted that President Trump was determined to boost US exports to trading partners as part of his broader trade agenda.

Aurangzeb requests China to boost yuan swap line

Currently, Pakistan exports approximately $5.2bn worth of goods to the US, while imports from the United States stand at around $2bn, creating a surplus of about $3.2bn in Pakistan’s favour. “We are looking at the possibility of addressing this imbalance by importing more goods such as American cotton and soybean,” he said.
The minister added that following President Trump’s ann­ouncement of new tariffs, Pak­istan’s ambassador in Washing­ton contacted the United States Trade Representative (USTR) the very next day. “Now a delegation will come for formal talks. The date of the visit will be decided after I return to Islamabad,” he said.
Indus Waters Treaty dispute
Asked if Pakistan had sought the World Bank’s intervention after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty last week, Mr Aurangzeb responded: “If required, we will come to it when it’s appropriate.”
The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank, governs the use of rivers shared by India and Pakistan and recognizes the Bank’s arbitral role in resolving disputes. So far, both nations have eng­aged with the World Bank to address differences under the treaty.
Mr Aurangzeb said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet have already deliberated on the issue and were prepared to move forward. “We condemn terrorism wherever it happens. We want good relations with all our neighbors but it takes two to tango,” he remarked.
He added that tensions between India and Pakistan were “a part of life” and stressed the need to “move with it and move on”.
Asked about the potential economic fallout from the recent tensions following the killing of 26 people at a tourist site earlier this month, the minister acknowledged that it was “not going to be helpful.”
Diplomatic sources told Dawn that due to the busy schedule of World Bank officials during the Spring Meetings, Pakistani diplomats could not immediately raise the issue. “We are also waiting for instructions from Islamabad to proceed,” the sources said.
China commitments, Panda Bond plans
During his meetings in Washington, Mr Aurangzeb also engaged with Chinese officials, including Finance Minister Lan Fo’an, to seek extensions in Pakistan’s debt repayment schedules and additional financial support.
He confirmed that Pakistan has asked China to extend the repayment period for its guaranteed debt and to increase the existing $4.3bn currency swap arrangement, aiming to bolster Pakistan’s critically low foreign exchange reserves. “He was assured that China would roll over Pakistan’s $4bn cash deposit with the IMF,” officials said.
Discussions with China also included the rescheduling of debt owed to the Chinese Export-Import (Exim) Bank during the duration of Pakistan’s ongoing IMF programme. Pakistan is seeking to reschedule debt maturities until September 2027. Aurangzeb noted that a similar request had been made to China last year, but formal approval was still pending.
Pakistan has also made significant progress in preparations to issue its first “Panda Bond” — a bond issued on China’s domestic market, denominated in yuan. Talks with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Develop­ment Bank (ADB) for providing credit enhancements for the bond issue had been “constructive”, Mr Aurangzeb said.
“We want to diversify our lending base and we have made some good progress around that — we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print,” he added.
China has been actively promoting currency swap arrangements with emerging economies like Argentina and Sri Lanka in recent years as part of its broader strategy to internationalize the yuan.
Progress with IMF
Mr Aurangzeb said he also expects the IMF Executive Board to approve, in early May, the staff-level agreement for a new $1.3bn arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
Approval from the board would trigger the disbursement of a $1bn tranche under the programme, which Pakistan secured in 2024. The IMF programme has played a critical role in stabilising Pakistan’s fragile economy, providing much-needed external financing and boosting market confidence.

Talking to the media on Saturday, the minister said that Pakistan’s stance on the Indus Waters Treaty was “clear and firm”. He said the treaty could only be revoked through mutual consent between Pakistan and India and could not be unilaterally suspended.
He said that Pakistan has an undeniable right over every single drop of water under the treaty. He further said that India’s baseless statement only damaged its credibility on the global stage, highlighting India’s involvement in terrorist activities across various countries, including Canada.
 
 

Pakistan would not allow even a single drop of water from its rivers to be diverted unlawfully, he said.
“No one can steal the water of our rivers,” he said, adding that international bodies are already engaged in the matter to ensure a fair resolution.
Speaking at the second convocation of Ghazi University in Dera Ghazi Khan, Mr Leghari said terrorism remained a national challenge and vowed that the government fully supported all efforts to eradicate it.
He said he supported a public Jirga recently held by Mir Badshah Qaisrani in support of law enforcement agencies, saying, “We endorse every measure taken in the defence of the country.”
The federal minister affirmed that Pakistan was fully capable of defending itself.
He also reiterated that the fight against terrorism would continue until its complete eradication, emphasising the unflinching resolve of the country’s armed forces and law enforcement agencies. However, he criticised former prime minister Imran Khan for allegedly allowing the return of 40,000 terrorists from Afghanistan, stating that Pakistan was still dealing with the consequences of that decision.
Meanwhile, a letter purported to be from India’s water resources ministry — circulating on social media — appeared to officially convey New Delhi’s wish to suspend implementation of the IWT.
Dawn could not immediately verify the authenticity of the letter, written by India’s Jal Shakti ministry secretary Ms Debashree Mukherjee to Pakistan’s ministry of water resources secretary Syed Ali Murtaza on April 24.
Neither the minister for water resources nor the Indus Water Commissioner responded to Dawn’s requests for confirmation and comment on the letter’s contents.

Although the cause of the blast was not immediately clear, the port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state TV that it probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazmat and chemical materials storage depot.
State media reported a “massive explosion” at Sh­a­hid Rajaee, the country’s largest commercial port, located in Hormozgan province on the southern coast.
Footage on state TV showed thick columns of black smoke billowing from the port where many containers are stored, with helicopters deployed to fight the flames.
Citing local emergency services, state TV reported that at least 516 people were injured and “hundreds have been transferred to nearby medical centres”.
“Unfortunately, at least four deaths have been confirmed by rescuers,” the head of the Red Crescent Society’s Relief and Rescue Organisation, Babak Mahmoudi, earlier told the broadcaster.
Three Chinese nationals were “lightly injured”, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing its Bandar Abbas consulate.
Iranian President Mas­oud Pezeshkian expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly blast, adding he had “issued an order to investigate the situation and the causes”, sending Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni to look into the incident.
Images from the official IRNA news agency showed rescuers and survivors walking along a wide boulevard carpeted with debris.
Flames engulfed a truck trailer and blood stained the side of a crushed car.
Containers stacked at the port appeared to have buckled in the blast.
Shahid Rajaee, more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) south of Tehran, is Iran’s most advanced container port, according to IRNA.
It is located 23km west of Bandar Abbas, the Hormozgan provincial capital, and near the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of world oil output passes.
Containers exploded
Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of the province’s crisis management authority, told state TV that “the cause of this incident was the explosion of several containers stored in the Shahid Rajaee Port wharf area”.
“We are currently evacuating and transporting the injured to nearby medical centres,” he said.
The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard about 50km away, Fars news agency reported, with residents saying they could feel the ground shake even at a distance.
“The shockwave was so strong that most of the port buildings were severely damaged,” Tasnim news agency reported.
The state-owned National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company said in a statement carried by local media that “the explosion at Shahid Rajaee Port has no connection to refineries, fuel tanks, distribution complexes or oil pipelines”.
It added that “Bandar Abbas oil facilities are currently operating without interruption”.
The rare explosion comes several months after one of Iran’s deadliest work accidents in years.
The coal mine blast in September, caused by a gas leak, killed more than 50 people at Tabas in the east of the country.
Saturday’s explosion also came as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
PM Shehbaz grieved
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday expressed deep sorrow over the losses caused by the explosion at the Iranian port.
In a message of condolence, he extended heartfelt sympathies to the government and people of Iran. He also offered prayers for swift recovery of those injured in the tragic incident.  “In this hour of grief and sorrow, we stand firmly with the Iranian government and the brotherly people of Iran,” the PM stated.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran during this difficult time.

Rehman, in the video, could be seen “driving his vehicle with the help of his feet, showing extreme carelessness and recklessness”, the FIR read.
It added that the actions of the YouTuber not only endangered his own life and property, but also of the other people travelling on the motorway.
The FIR said that the suspect had committed vandalism against whom the prosecution has filed the case.
According to the FIR, the case against the YouTuber was registered under Article 67 (driving recklessly or dangerously) of the National Highway Safety Ordinance (NHSO) 2000, and Section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26225252fde14f3.jpg?r=225458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906740/mahrangs-sister-seeks-cjps-urgent-intervention-against-alleged-mistreatment-of-detained-byc-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Mahrang’s sister seeks CJP’s ‘urgent intervention’ against alleged mistreatment of detained BYC leaders</strong></a><br><p>Nadia Baloch, sister of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch, on Saturday wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi requesting “urgent intervention” against the alleged mistreatment of her sibling and other leaders of the group in prison.
On Friday, Mahrang and other BYC leaders launched a hunger strike to protest alleged “torture” by jail staff, as well as the transfer of activist Beebow Baloch to District Jail Pishin.
“Dr Mahrang Baloch has said that the hunger strike was launched to protest the torture by CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) officials inside the district jail and the transfer of Beebow Baloch to District Jail Pishin,” Mahrang’s lawyer Imran Baloch told Dawn.com.
According to the letter, which has been seen by Dawn.com, Nadia alleged that Mahrang “is subjected daily to mental torture and coercion to abandon her peaceful movement”.
“Upon her refusal, an attempt was made to move her to an undisclosed location, and when she resisted, she was physically assaulted by officials on 23.04.2025,” she alleged.
She also informed the CJP about the transfer of Beebow to District Jail Pishin, alleging that the activist’s whereabouts were unknown for an entire day.
“It was subsequently discovered that she had been shifted to District Jail, Pishin, under constant surveillance, including the installation of cameras compromising her privacy even within washroom areas,” Nadia alleged.
Nadia also lamented the detention of Sibghatullah Shah, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch and stated that the treatment of the BYC leaders violates Articles 4 (guarantee to be treated in accordance with law), 9 (protection of life and liberty) and 14 (inviolability of dignity and protection against torture) of the Constitution.
She added that Rules 939, 940 and 1065 of the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978 were also violated.
“[The provisions] mandate the humane and impartial treatment of all detainees. These provisions place a clear duty on the superintendent to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety, dignity, and protection of prisoners under their custody.”
Nadia added that under Sections 167(5) and 167(7) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (CrPC), female prisoners could not be transferred between detention facilities without court approval.
“Any attempt to remove the detainees from District Jail Quetta to another jail within the province, therefore, would constitute an arbitrary and unlawful exercise of authority,” she wrote.
“Regrettably, despite the above legal safeguards, government officials are actively pursuing such transfers. In fact, Ms Beebow Baloch has already been forcibly moved to District Jail Pishin while in custody, following the use of physical force,” Nadia alleged.
In the letter, Nadia urged the CJP to “take urgent notice of the physical and mental torture inflicted upon these detainees; prevent any further unlawful transfer or removal without due legal process; direct that their fundamental rights be fully protected in accordance with law and that their safety be ensured during their confinement”.
“This intervention is not only necessary but urgent, as the continued inaction
threatens their fundamental rights, personal safety and well-being,” Nadia wrote.
“Such an intervention would be in line with the reform efforts Your Lordship has undertaken for the betterment of prisoners.”
Mahrang and other BYC activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Her arrest under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordnance drew widespread condemnation from Baloch rights activists and international rights bodies.
The Balochistan National Party-Mengal started a “long march” from Wadh to Quetta on March 28 to protest the arrests of BYC leaders and activists, including Mahrang and Sammi Deen Baloch, who was released on April 1. The sit-in concluded on April 16, with the party announcing it would launch a public outreach movement instead.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26230747bba75cc.png?r=230815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906741/2-soldiers-martyred-15-terrorists-killed-in-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>2 soldiers martyred, 15 terrorists killed in KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Two soldiers have been martyred and 15 terrorists killed in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.

“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Lance Naik Usman Mohmand (age: 28 years, resident of Charsadda district) and Sepoy Imran Khan (age: 26 years, resident of Kurram district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR said.
It added that troops “successfully neutralised” three more terrorists in another encounter in South Waziristan district’s general area of Gomal Zam.
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists who were actively involved in numerous terror activities.
It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the areas. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26214643a68e6d0.jpg?r=214720' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906737/two-year-old-us-girl-deported-to-honduras-judge' target='_blank'><strong>Two-year-old US girl deported to Honduras: judge</strong></a><br><p>A two-year-old American girl has been deported with her undocumented mother to Honduras, a federal judge in Louisiana has said, but United States President Donald Trump’s administration contends that the woman asked for her child to be sent with her.
The case is the latest to pit the US judiciary against Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, as the administration pursues mass expulsions of undocumented migrants from American soil.
Federal District Judge Terry Doughty has set a May 16 hearing in the case “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”, according to a court order dated Friday.
“The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her. But the court doesn’t know that,” wrote Doughty, recalling that it is illegal to deport a US citizen.
The girl has only been identified by the initials VML.
Attorneys for her father filed an emergency request for a temporary restraining order aimed at obtaining the girl’s return.
The Trump administration has butted heads with federal judges, rights groups and Democrats who say he has trampled or ignored constitutional rights in rushing to deport migrants, sometimes without the right to a hearing.
On Friday, federal agents arrested a US judge in Wisconsin for allegedly shielding an undocumented migrant.
The White House has defied the Supreme Court’s ruling that the administration must “facilitate” the return of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador.</p><small>2025-04-26 16:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26204234a7aa1ba.jpg?r=213923' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906732/trump-backed-crypto-venture-partners-with-pakistan-crypto-council-to-boost-blockchain-adoption' target='_blank'><strong>Trump-backed crypto venture partners with Pakistan Crypto Council to boost blockchain adoption</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Saturday partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by United States President Donald Trump, to advance cryptocurrency applications and boost blockchain adoption.
Trump and his affiliates hold a 60 per cent stake in WLF, which launched last year. The US president has promised to regulate the industry favourably and his administration has eased enforcement actions against several big industry players.
A press release from the finance ministry said a WLF delegation visited Islamabad today and signed a letter of intent with the PCC. The delegation comprised Zachary Folkman, Chase Herro and Zachary Witkoff, the son of Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff.
“[The] WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the press release reads.
It added that the delegation met the prime minister, chief of army staff, deputy prime minister, information and defence ministers to formalise cooperation, “marking a major step toward positioning Pakistan as a global leader in the digital finance revolution”.
The statement said the government has signalled plans to announce comprehensive crypto legalisation policies soon, to bolster “Pakistan’s position as one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world”.
The letter was signed during a meeting between the WLF and the PCC, which was attended by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb via video link. PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the State Bank governor were also present.

“The scope of cooperation between [the] PCC and WLF outlines collaboration in key areas including: launching regulatory sandboxes for blockchain financial product testing; facilitating the responsible growth of DeFi (decentralised finance) protocols; exploring [the] tokenisation of real-world assets like real estate and commodities; expanding stablecoin applications for remittances and trade; and providing strategic advisory on blockchain infrastructure and global regulatory trends,” the press release reads.
Aurangzeb was quoted as saying, “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation and global leadership in the blockchain economy.”
Saqib, meanwhile, said the agreement was “more than just a partnership, it’s a strategic move to empower our young population and integrate Pakistan into the future of global finance”.
The statement said the WLF leadership praised Pakistan’s dynamism, stating that Pakistan’s energy, vision and talent made it one of the most exciting places in the world to build the future of decentralised finance.
The finance ministry stated that Pakistan, with 64pc of its population under the age of 30, offered one of the world’s most promising digital economies.
“The country ranks among the top in global crypto adoption, with an estimated $300 billion in annual crypto transactions and 25 million active crypto users,” the press release said.
“With rising mobile penetration, a vibrant freelance economy, and strong government interest in blockchain, Pakistan’s youth are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of Web3 innovation.”
Last month, Saqib said that the country planned to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan.
In an interview with Bloomberg, Saqib said Pakistan aimed to create “a clear regulatory framework for governing digital-asset activities to boost the local ecosystem”.
“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” he said, adding that they wanted to attract international investment because the country was a low-cost high-growth market with 60pc of the population under 30.</p><small>2025-04-26 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26153039a989f5a.jpg?r=154735' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906709/businesses-across-country-remain-closed-in-solidarity-with-palestinians' target='_blank'><strong>Businesses across country remain closed in solidarity with Palestinians</strong></a><br><p>Various cities across the country on Saturday observed a shutter-down strike called by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) against the ongoing Israeli assault in Gaza and to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
The strike was announced by JI central chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, as he delivered a fiery speech to the party’s ‘Palestine Solidarity March’ in Islamabad. The demonstration protested against the Israeli atrocities in Gaza and took place on the Islamabad Expressway.
The Israeli offensive, which began in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attack on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and hospital infrastructure in the enclave. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands still missing under the rubble.
A strike was observed today in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta.  Other parts of Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan also remained shut. Shops and markets remained closed and vehicles largely stayed off the roads.

In Karachi, several leaders of the trade bodies participated in the protest, including All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir, Cooperative Market General Secretary Aslam Khan, Paper Market Syed Liaquat Ali etc.
Other than Karachi, the strike was observed in other cities of the province including Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, Ghotki, Nawabshah, Thatta, Jacobabad, Kandhkot, and Shikarpur.

Meanwhile, solidarity rallies were also taken out by JI and other religious parties from morning to evening.
The rally in Larkana was led by Sindh JI Ameer Kashif Saeed Sheikh and Ameer District Advocate Nadir Ali Khosa.
In Punjab, a shutter-down strike was observed by the business community across the province. All business centres and shops were closed in Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Jhelum.
JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that he was not the one to take credit for the countrywide strike, rather, he would appreciate the efforts of the traders and business owners.
“There could not be a greater portrayal of unity than this [strike],” the JI chief said at a protest in Lahore.
Rehman said that people had gathered in support of Palestine in large numbers in all four cities, adding that there was “no colour, race, language or sect” among the people. “Everyone is standing up for the oppressed people and are against the oppressors,” he said.
A similar strike was observed in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan as markets, shops, and other commercial centres there remained closed.

Balochistan JI provincial chief Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch thanked the people for making the strike peaceful and successful, adding that if “we unite against oppression, coercion and lawlessness, we will become a great force”.
The shutter-down strike was also observed across KP.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi are again leading the discussions, which this time include a technical-level meeting between experts from both sides.
The talks are aimed at striking a new deal that would stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons — an objective Tehran denies pursuing — in return for relief from crippling sanctions.
US President Donald Trump pulled out of an earlier multilateral nuclear deal during his first term in office.
Araghchi has expressed “cautious optimism”, saying this week: “If the sole demand by the US is for Iran to not possess nuclear weapons, this demand is achievable.” But if Washington had “impractical or illogical demands, we will naturally encounter problems”, he added.
Michael Anton, the State Department’s head of policy planning, leads the US expert-level delegation, while deputy foreign ministers Kazem Gharibabadi and Majid Takht-Ravanchi will lead Tehran’s, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.
Iranian state TV reported that the talks started at around midday Omani time (0800 GMT/1pm PKT).
Iran’s state news agency IRNA said that while only one day of talks was scheduled, “given that the negotiations have entered technical and expert-level discussions and the examination of details … [they] may be extended if necessary”.
Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said Iran’s defence capabilities and missile programme were not part of the discussions. “The question of defence capacities and the country’s missiles is not [on the agenda],” he told state TV.
Trump would ‘prefer deal’
Trump, in an interview published on Friday by Time magazine, reiterated his threat of military action if a deal fell through. But he added that he “would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped”.
Baqaei said on Friday that the new talks, like the previous rounds in Muscat and Rome on the previous two Saturdays, would be mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi.
The negotiations are the highest-level engagement between the long-time foes since 2018, when Trump withdrew from the landmark 2015 accord that gave Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has reinstated his “maximum pressure” policy of sanctions against Tehran.
In March, he wrote to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing talks but also warning of potential military action if diplomacy failed.
On Tuesday, Washington announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil network — a move Tehran described as “hostile” ahead of Saturday’s talks.
Western nations, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons — an allegation Tehran has consistently denied. Iran maintains that its nuclear programme is strictly for peaceful purposes.
On Wednesday, UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi called on Iran to explain tunnels built near its Natanz nuclear site, seen in satellite imagery released by the Institute for Science and International Security. The Washington-based think tank also noted the construction of a new security perimeter.
“We’re asking them, what is this for? They are telling us, it’s none of your business,” Grossi told reporters.
Tehran had no immediate comment.
‘Non-negotiable’ right
In an interview released on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated Washington’s firm stance against Iran’s uranium enrichment.
“If Iran wants a civil nuclear programme, they can have one just like many other countries in the world have one: and that is they import enriched material,” he said on the Honestly podcast.
Iran currently enriches uranium up to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit imposed by the 2015 deal but still below the 90pc threshold required for weapons-grade material.
Araghchi has previously called Iran’s right to enrich uranium “non-negotiable”.
He said in the text of a speech posted to X this week that Iran sought “to build at least 19 more reactors”.
Tehran recently sought to reopen dialogue with Britain, France, and Germany, which are also signatories to the 2015 deal, and held several rounds of nuclear talks ahead of the US meetings.
Last week, Rubio urged the three European states to decide whether to trigger the “snapback” mechanism under the 2015 agreement, which would automatically reinstate UN sanctions on Iran over its non-compliance. The option to use the mechanism expires in October.
Iran has warned that it could withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if the snapback is triggered.</p><small>2025-04-26 14:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2617394741c82e6.jpg?r=184710' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906718/shooter-in-wazirabad-pti-rally-attack-sentenced-to-life-for-murder-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Shooter in Wazirabad PTI rally attack sentenced to life for murder, terrorism</strong></a><br><p>A Gujranwala anti-terrorism on Saturday sentenced to life the primary shooter in a gun attack on a PTI march in Wazirabad — that left former prime minister Imran Khan injured — over murder and terrorism charges.
On November 3, 2022, during the PTI’s long march in the Wazirabad area of Punjab, a gunman opened fire, injuring Imran, Senator Faisal Javed, and several others, while one worker lost his life.
The PTI founding chairman had accused the then-coalition government and some military officials of involvement in the attack. However, a case of the incident was registered on behalf of the police. The case was lodged on November 7, and a joint investigation team (JIT) was formed under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.
 
 

ATC Judge Muhammad Naeem Saleem pronounced the verdict in the case after a hearing today in which two co-accused, Tayyab Jahangir Butt and Waqas, were acquitted after being granted the benefit of the doubt.
According to a warrant of commitment of sentence issued today to the superintendent of the Gujranwala Central Jail, Naveed Bashir was sentenced to life imprisonment separately under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Section 302b (premeditated murder) and Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) Section 7a (punishment for acts of terrorism).
Under the two sections, he was also ordered to pay compensation of Rs500,000 to the legal heirs of slain PTI worker Moazzam in the form of arrears of land revenue, with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of failure to pay, and to pay a fine of Rs500,000, with further imprisonment for six months in case of default.
As restitution for Areeb, who suffered injuries in the attack, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of three years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fiii (mutafahimah to any person).
As restitution regarding Meer Umar Farooq, another man who injured in the incident, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of five years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fv (hashimah to any person).
As restitution regarding Imran Yousaf, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of three years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fiii (mutafahimah to any person).
As restitution regarding Muhammad Liaquat, the convict was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under PPC Section 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default;  rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for causing injury under ATA Section 7b and 7c along with a fine of Rs100,000 with further simple imprisonment for six months in case of default; and to pay daman of Rs100,000 and rigorous imprisonment of three years for causing injury under PPC Section 337-Fiii (mutafahimah to any person).
The warrant said the sentences would run concurrently and the convict could avail the benefit of the Criminal Procedure Code Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment).
The lawyer for the convict, Advocate Mian Dawood, announced that the sentence would be challenged in the Lahore High Court, citing alleged irregularities in the prosecution’s arguments and evidence pertaining to the accused.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.  Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
Addressing a passing-out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, PM Shehbaz said: “The recent tragedy in Pahalgam is yet another example of this perpetual blame game, which must come to a grinding halt. Continuing with its role as a responsible country, Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation.”
The premier criticised India for continuing with a “pattern of exploitation, levelling baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence”.

Speaking on India’s recent move to suspend the IWT, PM Shehbaz said: “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline […] Let there be no doubt at all [that] its availability will be safeguarded at all costs and under all circumstances.
“Therefore, any attempt to stop, reduce or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty would be responded to with full force and might. Nobody should remain under any kind of false impression and confusion,” the prime minister warned.
“Our valiant armed forces remain fully capable and prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity against any misadventures, as clearly demonstrated by our measured yet resolute response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019,” he added, referring to ‘Operation Swift Retort’.
Expressing his “fullest confidence” in the armed forces, PM Shehbaz said, “This nation of 240 million people stands united by and behind our brave armed forces and ready to safeguard every inch of our homeland Pakistan.”
He stressed: “Peace is our preference but must not be construed as our weakness.”
During his address, the prime minister also reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.
“As Founder of the Nation Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah rightly said, Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan. Unfortunately, this globally recognised dispute remains unresolved despite multiple UN resolutions.
“Let there be no doubt, Pakistan shall continue to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people till they achieve their rights through their great struggle and sacrifices,” he added.
Hours later, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi echoed the PM’s demands during a press conference.
“There is Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan,” Naqvi said. “Pakistan is making progress in terms of the economy and stability, so an incident like this (Pahalgam attack) harms us.”
He warned that, “If anyone tries to harm us or our rights, all 240 million people are ready to fight to their last breath.”
Naqvi stated that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all of its forms and added that the country had done so at every international forum.
Reading out a statement on the Indian stance in English, the interior minister officially demanded a “transparent and impartial investigation” on the Pahalgam attack.
“Given the current situation and historical context, Pakistan has serious reservations regarding Indian credibility in conducting a fair inquiry,” he read.
“We call for a neutral and independent body to lead this inquiry. Pakistan is fully prepared to cooperate with any neutral investigators to ensure that the truth is uncovered and justice is served,” Naqvi said.
The interior minister added that while Pakistan was committed to peace and stability, it “will not compromise on its sovereignty”.
Naqvi said that Pakistan wanted the truth to come out and to “expose this drama”.
“The ball is now in India’s court,” he said.
 


Among India’s aggressive measures announced on April 23 against Pakistan was the unilateral move to suspend the 1960 IWT, which was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
 
 

India also shut its borders and downgraded diplomatic ties over what its government and media claimed — without offering any evidence — was Islamabad’s alleged support for cross-border terrorism.
The next day, the National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad announced Pakistan’s response — putting all trade, bilateral pacts and flights off-limits for its eastern neighbour. It also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
The full text of the NSC statement can be read here.
As tensions rose between the nuclear powers, voices from across the world, including the United Nations, called on both countries to exercise restraint. While Saudi Arabia and Iran offered to mediate, United States President Donald Trump said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
In an interesting remark, Trump said: “There have been tensions on that border for 1,500 years so, you know, it’s the same as it has been.” Since the attack, Trump and other US officials have offered India “full support” in hunting down the perpetrators of the violent incident.
PM raises issue of terrorism from Afghan soil, stresses better ties
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz once again raised Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism with Afghanistan, emphasising the desire for improved ties.
“It is our earnest desire to live in peace with them (Afghanistan) for all times to come. Unfortunately, despite our best and sincere efforts, terrorist activities continue to emanate from Afghan territory,” he said during his address in Kakul.
Recalling Deputy PM Ishaq Dar’s recent visit to Kabul, the premier asserted: “We shall continue our efforts to have better relations and understanding with our brotherly and neighbourly country Afghanistan.
“However, we have also delivered a strong and clear message to the interim Afghan government that while we desire peaceful neighbourly relations with Kabul, this cannot happen as long as the Afghan soil is being used by Fitna-Al-Khawarij to attack Pakistanis,” he added.
 


The prime minister asserted that Pakistan had “always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”.
“As the world’s frontline state against terrorism, we have endured immense loss, with our 90,000 casualties and economic losses beyond imagination, exceeding $600 billion,” he highlighted.
“[…] we would not tolerate any kind of terrorism, of any hue and colour, and that has been demonstrated beyond any ray of doubt,” the premier added.
Khawaja Asif calls for international probe, warns of ‘all-out war’
PM Shehbaz’s statement comes a day after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the New York Times in an interview that Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” with “any investigation which is conducted by international inspectors”.
The minister said India had used the aftermath of the militant attack as a pretext to suspend the IWT and for domestic political purposes. India was taking steps to punish Pakistan “without any proof, without any investigation”, he added.
“We do not want this war to flare up, because flaring up of this war can cause disaster for this region,” Asif told the publication.
 
 

Asif rebutted India’s allegations by asserting that the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was “defunct” and had no ability to plan or conduct attacks from Pakistan.
“They don’t have any setup in Pakistan,” he told the NYT.
“Those people, whatever is left of them, they are contained. Some of them are under house arrest, some of them are in custody. They are not at all active,” the minister said.
According to NYT, Asif said the attack could have been a “false flag” operation carried out by the Indian government to provoke a crisis.
The defence minister asserted that for the last decade, India had been trying to get out of the treaty, which has been a source of stability in the region.
“They were creating excuses. They were creating problems that were not there,” he was quoted as saying. “They have now found an excuse to get out of this arrangement.”
In a separate interview with Sky News, Asif had warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
“If there is an all-out attack or something like that, then obviously there will be an all-out war,” Asif said, adding that the world should be “worried” by the prospect of a full-scale military conflict in the region.
 


Fire exchange at LoC for 2nd day
As ties plummeted in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, there were reports of Indian and Pakistani troops exchanging gunfire for a second straight day on Saturday across the Line of Control (LoC).
Yesterday, Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Kashmir, had told AFP that troops exchanged fire along the line separating the two countries. “There was no firing on the civilian population,” he added.
There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani military. India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms.
According to Reuters, the Indian army today claimed its troops responded to “unprovoked” small arms fire from multiple Pakistan Army posts that started around midnight on Friday along the 740-kilometre LoC.
No casualties were reported from the Indian side, it said.
UNSC slams Pahalgam attack, calls on members to cooperate
In a related development, the UN Security Council (UNSC) yesterday condemned “in the strongest terms the terrorist attack” in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
In a press release issued, UNSC President Jérôme Bonnafont stated: “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.”
The UNSC members underlined the “need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
 
 

They urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSC resolutions, to “cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard”.
The UNSC reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed”.
Extending their condolences to the bereaved families, the members reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law.
The UNSC also released Pakistan’s statement issued after Wednesday’s NSC meeting, which detailed the country’s decisions taken in response to Indian measures, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to Bonnafont, the UNSC president for April, on Friday, according to APP.
“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the Agenda Item ‘India-Pakistan Question’,” Bonnafont was quoted as telling the UNSC.
CJCSC Gen Mirza discusses regional security with SCO official
Separately, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza discussed regional security and counterterrorism with Major General Ularbek Sharsheyev, the executive director for the Regional Anti Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, during the meeting at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, CJCSC Mirza and Gen Sharsheyev “discussed evolving security dynamics in the region and collaborative measures to enhance counterterrorism cooperation”.
Gen Mirza acknowledged the efforts of SCO (RATS) in promoting regional cooperation to fight the menace of terrorism and reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment to ensuring sustainable peace at the regional and global levels.
The SCO official lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, Radio Pakistan added.</p><small>2025-04-26 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26161128e9c3d3b.jpg?r=161716' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906711/at-least-four-killed-500-injured-in-iran-port-explosion-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>At least four killed, 500 injured in Iran port explosion: state media</strong></a><br><p>A massive explosion was reported at the Shahid Rajaee Port in southern Iran, local media reported on Saturday, leaving four people dead and over 500 injured.
“Unfortunately, at least four deaths have been confirmed by rescuers,” the head of the Red Crescent Society’s Relief and Rescue Organisation, Babak Mahmoudi, told state TV.
State television, citing emergency services, reported that “516 people have been injured as hundreds have been transferred to nearby medical centres” in the southern province of Hormozgan, where the Shahid Rajaee port is located.
The explosion was reported at around 12:30am local time (2100GMT/2am PKT) on Saturday.
The strategically important port, located in the southern Hormozgan province, lies around 15 kilometres southwest of the port of Bandar Abbas on the northern shore of the Strait of Hormuz.
 


The explosion was likely caused by poorly stored chemical materials detonating, according to Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for Iran’s crisis management organisation.
“The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,” he told Iran’s ILNA news agency. “Previously, the Director General of Crisis Management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger.”
The explosion occurred as Iran began a third round of nuclear talks with the United States in Oman, but there was no immediate indication of a link between the two events.
According to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency, it could have been caused by the explosion of a fuel tank, however, there has been no official statement on it so far.
The report said rapid response teams were immediately dispatched to the site of the incident, with port operations suspended temporarily to allow security and emergency forces to restore order.
The semi-official Fars News Agency quoted local officials in Hormozgan as saying the explosion occurred at a section of the Shahid Rajaee Port dock, adding that efforts are underway to extinguish the fire.</p><small>2025-04-26 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26165209320dc3d.jpg?r=170537' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906717/trump-and-ukraines-zelensky-have-very-productive-meeting-in-rome-says-us-official' target='_blank'><strong>Trump and Ukraine’s Zelensky have ‘very productive’ meeting in Rome, says US official</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky had a “very productive” meeting on Saturday in Rome, a White House official said, as both leaders attended the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican.
Zelensky said his meeting with Trump could prove historic if a peaceful end to Ukraine’s war with Russia that they discussed is achieved.
“Good meeting. One-on-one, we managed to discuss a lot. We hope for a result from all the things that were spoken about,” Zelensky wrote in a post on social media platform Telegram.
He said those topics included “the protection of the lives of our people. A complete and unconditional ceasefire. A reliable and lasting peace that will prevent a recurrence of war.”
Zelensky added: “It was a very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic if we achieve joint results. Thank you, President Donald Trump!”
A spokesman for Zelensky’s office said the two leaders, in an encounter in St Peter’s Basilica that lasted about 15 minutes, had agreed to have a second meeting later on Saturday, and that their teams were working on arrangements for that.
The meeting at the Vatican, their first since an angry encounter in the Oval Office in Washington in February, comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to fighting between Ukraine and Russia.
“President Trump and President Zelensky met privately today and had a very productive discussion. More details about the meeting will follow,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director.

Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, described the meeting as “constructive” in a post on social media.
Zelensky’s office released photographs of the Rome meeting. In one, the Ukrainian and US leaders sat opposite each other in a large marble-lined hall, around two feet apart, and were leaning in towards each other in conversation. No aides could be seen in the image.
In a second photograph, from the same location, Zelensky, Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were shown standing in a tight huddle. Macron had his hand on Zelenskiy’s shoulder.

Trump, who has been pressing both sides to agree to a ceasefire, said on Friday that there had been productive talks between his envoy and the Russian leadership, and called for a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow to close a deal.
Trump had previously warned his administration would walk away from its efforts to achieve a peace if the two sides do not agree a deal soon.
Differences over territory
After a round of shuttle diplomacy this week, differences have emerged between the position of the White House on peace talks and the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, according to documents from the talks obtained by Reuters.
 
 

Washington is proposing a legal recognition that Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, is Russian territory, something that Kyiv and its allies in Europe say is a red line they will not cross.
There are also differences on how quickly sanctions on Russia would be lifted if a peace deal is signed, what kind of security guarantees Ukraine would have, and how Ukraine would be financially compensated.
Trump and Zelensky have had a rocky personal relationship. At their Oval Office meeting, Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of “gambling with World War Three”.
Since then, Kyiv has tried to repair relations, but the barbs have continued. Zelensky has said Trump was trapped in a “disinformation bubble” that favoured Moscow, while the US leader accused Zelensky of foot-dragging on a peace deal and making “inflammatory” statements.
But the two men need each other. Trump requires Zelensky’s buy-in to achieve his stated ambition of bringing a swift peace between Russia and Ukraine, while Kyiv needs Trump to pressure Moscow into diluting some of the more onerous conditions it has set for a truce.
At the Oval Office meeting in February, a reporter from a conservative US news network accused Zelensky of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit.
Zelensky, since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, has eschewed suits in favour of military-style attire, saying it is his way of showing solidarity with his countrymen fighting to defend Ukraine.
In Rome on Saturday, Zelensky again decided against a suit, and instead wore a dark shirt, buttoned up to the neck with no tie, and wore a dark military-style jacket over the top of that.</p><small>2025-04-26 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26164136fcafa4d.jpg?r=164236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906702/pope-francis-funeral-draws-thousands-cardinal-says-his-legacy-must-survive' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Francis’ funeral draws thousands, cardinal says his legacy must survive</strong></a><br><p>Presidents, royalty and a multitude of simple mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at his funeral, where a cardinal said the pontiff’s legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment must not die with him.
On one side of Francis’ coffin in the vast St. Peter’s Square sat US President Donald Trump, who had clashed with the pope on those issues.
“Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today’s challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time,” said Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral Mass.
The Argentine pope, who had reigned for 12 years, died at the age of 88 on Monday after suffering a stroke.
The crowd, who crammed the square and the roads around, broke into applause when Re spoke of Francis’ care for immigrants, his constant pleas for peace, the need for negotiations to end wars and the importance of the climate.
They clapped loudly again at the end of the service when the ushers picked up the casket and tilted it slightly so more people could see, the church bells tolling in the background.
The coffin was placed on an open-topped popemobile and driven through the heart of Rome to St. Mary Major Basilica, with thousands of people lining the route.
Francis, who shunned much of the pomp and privilege of the papacy during his 12-year reign, had asked to be buried there rather than in the crypt of St. Peter’s, which is the traditional resting place for popes.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you,” one woman in the crowd shouted.
Aerial views of the Vatican during the funeral showed a patchwork of colours — black from the dark garb of the world’s leaders, red from the vestments of some 250 cardinals, the purple worn by some of the 400 bishops and the white worn by 4,000 attending priests.
Choirs sang Latin hymns and prayers were recited in various languages, including Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabic, reflecting the global reach of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church.
The Vatican estimated more than 250,000 people attended the ceremony, which lasted two hours.
Among the heads of state who flew into Rome were the presidents of the United States, Ukraine Argentina, France, Gabon, Germany, the Philippines and Poland, together with the prime ministers of Britain and New Zealand, and many royals, including the king and queen of Spain.

Francis’ death ushered in a meticulously planned period of transition, marked by ancient ritual, pomp and mourning. Over the past three days, around 250,000 people filed past his body, laid out before the altar of the cavernous basilica.
The faithful hurried to the Vatican from the early hours while many camped out to try to secure spots at the front of the crowd.
“When I arrived at the square, tears of sadness and also joy came over me. I think I truly realised that Pope Francis had left us, and at the same time, there is joy for all he has done for the Church,” said a French pilgrim, Aurelie Andre.
Breaking tradition
 
 

Francis, the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries, battled to reshape the Roman Catholic Church, siding with the poor and marginalised, while challenging wealthy nations to help migrants and reverse climate change.
“Francis left everyone a wonderful testimony of humanity, of a holy life and of universal fatherhood,” said a formal summary of his papacy, written in Latin, and placed next to his body.
Traditionalists pushed back at his efforts to make the Church more transparent, while his pleas for an end to conflict, divisions and rampant capitalism often fell on deaf ears.
The pope carried his desire for greater simplicity in the papacy into his funeral, having rewritten the elaborate, book-long funeral rites used previously.
He also opted to forego a centuries-old practice of burying popes in three interlocking caskets made of cypress, lead and oak. Instead, he was placed in a single, zinc-lined wooden coffin, which was sealed closed overnight.
In a further break with the past, he will be the first pope to be buried outside the Vatican in more than a century, preferring St. Mary Major, some 5.5 kilometres from St. Peter’s.
His tomb has just “Franciscus”, his name in Latin, inscribed on the top. A reproduction of the simple, iron-plated cross he used to wear around his neck hangs above the marble slab.
Italy mounted one of the biggest security operations the country has seen since the funeral of John Paul II. It closed the airspace over the city and called in extra security forces, with anti-aircraft missiles and patrol boats guarding the event.
As soon as Francis is buried, attention will switch to who might succeed him.
The secretive conclave to elect a successor is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.</p><small>2025-04-26 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906681/a-wise-decision' target='_blank'><strong>A wise decision</strong></a><br><p>GOOD sense seems to have finally prevailed, with the federal government deferring the planned canal projects, including the controversial Cholistan canal, for now. Following a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday, the government said it will undertake the projects only if a consensus among the provinces is achieved. A meeting of the Council of Common Interests will be convened next week regarding the issue. “…[W]e unanimously decided that no new canal will be constructed till the decision of the CCI,” Mr Sharif told a joint press conference along with Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
Given the sensitivities of interprovincial water distribution, a wiser political leadership would have pre-empted the public outcry over the canal projects by taking the contentious Cholistan scheme to the CCI for a consensus decision even before initiating the work on its feasibility. That it took months of protests across Sindh against the Cholistan canal, the complete blockade of industrial and other supply chains to and from Punjab for the last week and a half, and the PPP’s ‘threats’ of quitting the coalition before the government took a step back shows that the actual decision-making powers regarding the project lie somewhere else.
That the matter has been referred to the CCI, the highest constitutional forum empowered to decide disputes that involve the provinces, indicates that the doors to an arbitrary decision on the scheme may have been closed. So far so good. But the pause does not necessarily guarantee that the project has been cancelled altogether. Still, the canal plan is unlikely to move forward anytime soon, at least not unless a solid, independent technical study of the proposed water channel is carried out and the buy-in of all the provinces, especially Sindh, achieved.
This development should be enough to reassure the protesters who should lift the blockade of the national highway to allow smooth cargo and passenger movement between Sindh and Punjab. No doubt the episode has left a bad taste in the mouth and had added to the federation’s strain. However, the PM’s word on the issue should be respected. One also hopes that the PML-N will do better and avoid such controversies in the future.

The Punjab government had floated the idea of Air Punjab in November 2024 after the federal government’s failed attempt to sell the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Bokhari said: “Pakistan is ready to operate its first provincial airline, Air Punjab.
“The approval for it was given by [Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz] sahiba in a meeting a few days ago,” she added.
“This service would begin in a minimum of eight months and at the most, a year.”
Sharing further details, the information minister said four aircraft will be acquired on lease immediately for Air Punjab.
Noting that airlines in Pakistan were required to operate domestically for a year before initiating international routes, Bokhari said Air Punjab would be “ready to provide its services in a few months”.
The Punjab chief minister has ordered the completion of the formalities of licensing and leasing, according to Bokhari.
“No one had even thought of launching their own provincial airline,” she added.
Bokhari noted she wanted to share two “major good” developments about Punjab with the public for many days but the recent situation in the wake of the Pahalgam attack had delayed it.
Announcing the second plan, she said, “Pakistan’s first bullet train, which will operate from Lahore to Rawalpindi, will take the [travellers there] in two hours and 20 minutes.”
The minister added that CM Maryam had accorded approval for the bullet train as well.
The Punjab government would collaborate with the Pakistan Railways for the bullet train, Bokhari elaborated.
“Chief minister sahiba has also sought a plan for a high-speed train for six other routes in Punjab, including Lahore to Shahdara and Narowal; Lahore to Raiwind and Kasur; Pakpattan to Lodhran; Sheikhupura to Shorkot; Shorkot to Sargodha via Jhang; and Lala Musa to Sargodha via Malakwal,” she explained.
“The Railway department would be completely revamped in Punjab.”
Pakistan had been looking to offload a 51-100 per cent stake in debt-ridden PIA to raise funds and reform state-owned enterprises but a sole bid of Rs10 billion for a 60pc stake — much below the government-set minimum price of Rs85bn — stalled the privatisation process.
 
 

Subsequently, on Nov 1, 2024, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government ruled by the opposition PTI said it was ready to purchase the loss-making national flag carrier.
A day later, former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif stated his daughter, CM Maryam, had sought his counsel on whe­ther the Punjab government should acquire the PIA or establish a new airline.
Nawaz had suggested the airline could also be purchased and rebra­nded by the provincial government as Air Punjab.
However, the Punjab government had immediately clarified that it had “no intentions” of being party to the highly publicised bidding process to acquire the PIA.</p><small>2025-04-26 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26143701194ca0c.jpg?r=143814' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906707/hamas-official-says-group-open-to-freeing-hostages-five-year-truce-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas official says group open to freeing hostages, five-year truce in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Hamas is open to an agreement to end the Gaza conflict that would include the one-time release of all remaining hostages and a five-year cessation of hostilities, an official from the Palestinian group said on Saturday.
“Hamas is ready for an exchange of prisoners in a single batch and a truce for five years,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, as a delegation from his group was set to meet mediators in Cairo later in the day.
On April 17, Hamas, which opposes a “partial” ceasefire agreement, rejected an Israeli proposal that included a 45-day truce in exchange for the return of 10 living hostages.
The group has consistently demanded that a truce agreement must lead to the end of the conflict, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a prisoner exchange, and the immediate and sufficient entry of humanitarian aid into the war-battered Palestinian territory.
Israel, for its part, demands the return of all hostages and the disarmament of Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza — the latter being a “red line” for the the Palestinian group.
 
 

The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the death of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on official figures.
Of the 251 people taken hostage that day, 58 are still being held in Gaza, including 34 who are dead, according to the Israeli army.
A truce from January 19 to March 17 allowed the return of 33 hostages to Israel, including eight who were deceased, in exchange for the release of about 1,800 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
According to figures published by the enclave’s health ministry, at least 2,062 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli offensive resumed on March 18, bringing the total death toll in Gaza to 51,439 since the start of the conflict.</p><small>2025-04-26 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26133506bcbafd1.jpg?r=133830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906603/pm-shehbaz-seeks-saudi-help-amid-crisis-over-private-haj-quota' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz seeks Saudi help amid crisis over private Haj quota</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reprimanded officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs for their alleged negligence that jeopardised the departure of 67,000 potential Pakistani pilgrims this year and assured that he will take up the matter with Saudi government to resolve the issue.
The premier made the ass­urance during a meeting at PM House with fed­eral minister for religi­ous affairs, Senate stan­d­ing committee on religi­ous affairs and representatives of private Haj operators.
According to media rep­orts, private Haj operators have failed to meet Saudi Arabia’s requirements that may deprive 67,000 intending pilgrims of performing Haj this year.
However, private Haj operators have blamed the Saudi government for the delay, claiming they had sent the payments before the deadline, but the Saudi software system crashed.
 
 

The final date for issuing visas was April 18, as per the Saudi deadline, leaving the fate of the 67,000 pilgrims uncertain.
The Pakistan Ulema Council has also urged the Prime Minister Shehbaz to take notice of the issue and appeal to the Saudi government for special consideration.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Hajj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Hajj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
A source in the prime minister’s office told Dawn that the delegation  requested Mr Sharif’s assistance in sending the affected pilgrims for Haj.
Federal Minister Sardar Yousaf, Senate Committee Chairman Maulana  Ataur Rehman, and Committee Member Bushra Butt asked the prime minister  to seek permission from the Saudi government for the private quota  pilgrims.
Prime minister assured the delegation of his full cooperation on the matter.
“This  issue has caused embarrassment for the country,” the prime minister  said, according to the source. “The government will do whatever is  possible to resolve the issue. Saudi authorities will be contacted for  private scheme Haj pilgrims.”
The source said Mr Sharif also  expressed dissatisfaction over the Ministry of Religious Affairs’  performance and reprimanded its officials for not pursuing the matter  proactively with Saudi authorities.
It has been learned that the departure process for Pakistani pilgrims will begin within the next 72 hours.
PIA’s privatisation
In a separate development, amid reports that Pakistan International  Airlines (PIA) has begun generating profit after years of losses, Prime Minister Shehbaz directed authorities to ensure the national carrier’s privatisation is completed within the designated timeframe.
Chairing a meeting to review the ongoing privatisation efforts, Mr Sharif emphasised transparency in the process.
 
 

“Transparency must be central to the procedure for the privatisation of PIA,” the prime minister said, adding that future privatizations of state-owned enterprises should also be broadcast live on television and  digital platforms.
He also underscored the importance of investor engagement and roadshows as part of the outreach strategy.
Officials briefed the prime minister on the investor outreach  strategy, developed with the help of a consultant, and shared details of  the bidding criteria, timeline, and conditions for participation.
Sensitive Price Index
Earlier in the day, Mr Sharif expressed satisfaction over the  significant drop in the annual rate of the Sensitive Price Index,  which fell to -3.52 per cent in April 2025, compared to 26.94pc in the same  month last year.

Ajay Banga was interviewed by AFP at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s Spring Meetings, which have been held this year under a cloud of uncertainty about President Donald Trump’s stop-start tariff rollout.
The Bank has been advising developing countries to get a deal done quickly with the United States, and to then focus attention on cutting trade barriers and boosting regional flows of goods, Banga said.
“You need to negotiate trade systems with the US at the earliest possible (opportunity),” he said. “If you delay, it hurts everyone.”
 
 

Trump’s tariffs have roiled financial markets, sent volatility surging and spooked investors and consumers.
Since returning to office in January, the US leader has imposed a “baseline” 10 per cent tariff on most countries, with much higher duties on China, and 25pc sector-specific levies on areas including steel, aluminium, and automobiles not manufactured in the United States.
He also introduced much higher tariffs on dozens of countries — which have since been temporarily paused — accusing them of having an unfair trade balance with the United States.
Bessent ‘not wrong’ on China
Banga also addressed the criticism levelled by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Bank earlier this week.
Bessent criticised China’s “absurd” developing country status and called on Banga and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to “earn the confidence of the administration”.
“I don’t think he’s wrong,” Banga said of Bessent’s comments on China.
“A country that is the size of China and the capability of China, at some point, should no longer be taking money from IBRD,” he said, referring to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development — an arm of the World Bank that lends largely to middle-income countries.
Such a move would require the support of the World Bank’s executive board, which is made up by member states.
 
 

China, Banga said, borrowed around $750 million from the IBRD last year, while paying billions of dollars to the institution in repayments and donations.
“My view is, I’ve brought it down to 750 (million), and I’m trying to figure out a way to deal with China to bring it down further,” he said. “I want to get it done. And that’s what I’m talking to the Chinese about.”
Banga said the Trump administration’s criticisms of the World Bank, which included “expansive policy overreach,” were not unusual, citing newly elected governments in countries including France, Japan and Korea.
“I keep telling people this is a perfectly constructive request, to say, tell me and show me that you guys are the kind of people that advance the interests of my taxpayer, of my country,” he said.
“I take it in that spirit,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with it.”
Energy at ‘lowest possible cost’
Since taking the helm of the Washington-based development lender in 2023, Banga has pushed to streamline operations and encourage private sector participation, while focusing on job creation and electricity connectivity.
Among the Bank’s current priorities is a push with the African Development Bank to connect 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa to electricity by 2030 — a process that will require a vast amount of new energy to be brought online.
“You should try and get (energy) in the best, accessible way and the lowest possible cost,” Banga said, suggesting that in addition to renewable power, nuclear and gas could help provide a base load — two energy sources the World Bank is currently hesitant to finance.
The Bank’s executive board is set to discuss its energy strategy in June, Banga said, adding that funding for both nuclear and gas would likely be on the agenda.
Banga said the Bank is also pushing to encourage private sector job creation in developing countries — beyond simply outsourcing jobs from advanced economies.
“Because then you end up with challenges in (advanced economies), and you can see that people are speaking about them with their votes,” he added.</p><small>2025-04-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/260743324969820.jpg?r=074510' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906597/trump-to-offer-riyadh-100-billion-arms-deal-sources-say' target='_blank'><strong>Trump to offer Riyadh $100 billion arms deal,  sources say</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The United States is poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth well over $100 billion, six sources with direct knowledge of the issue told Reuters, saying the proposal was being lined up for announcement during US President Donald Trump’s visit to the kingdom.
The offered package comes after the administration of former President Joe Biden unsuccessfully tried to finalise a defence pact with Riyadh as part of a broad deal that envisioned Saudi Arabia normalising ties with Israel.
The Biden proposal offered access to more advanced US weaponry in return for halting Chinese arms purchases and restricting Beijing’s investment in the country. Reuters could not establish if the Trump administration’s proposal includes similar requirements.
The White House and Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 
 

A US defence official said: “Our defence relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is stronger than ever under President Trump’s leadership. Maintaining our security cooperation remains an important component of this partnership and we will continue to work with Saudi Arabia to address their defence needs.”
The US has long supplied Saudi Arabia with weapons. In 2017, Trump proposed approximately $110 billion of sales to the kingdom. As of 2018, only $14.5 billion of sales had been initiated and Congress began to question the deals in light of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In 2021, under Biden, Congress imposed a ban on sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi killing and to pressure the kingdom to wind down its Yemen war, which had inflicted heavy civilian casualties.

The Karachi commissioner has imposed a complete ban on operation of all types of rickshaws on I.I. Chundrigar Road and Sharea Faisal for a period of two months.
He also imposed similar restrictions on operation of One-Plus-Four rickshaws on nine other main roads — Shahrah-i-Quaideen (from Numaish to  Sharea Faisal Nursery), Sher Shah Suri Road (from Matric Board Office to  Nagan Chowrangi), Shaheed-i-Millat Road (from Jail Chowrangi to  Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway), Abdullah Haroon Road (from Do Talwar to  Hashoo Centre via Hoshang, Khayaban-i-Iqbal), Do Talwar to  Shahrah-i-Firdous and Abdullah Shah Ghazi Mazar, Stadium Road (from  Millennium Mall to New Town Police Station), Sir Shah Suleman Road (from  Sir Habib Ibrahim Rehmatullah Road to Hasan Square and Karsaz), Rashid  Minhas Road (from Drigh Road to Sohrab Goth), and Mauripur Road (from  Gulbai to ICI Bridge) — across the city.
On Friday, a large number of rickshaw drivers, from the platform of the All Karachi Rikshaw Ittehad Union, staged a protest demonstration at Fawara Chowk near Sindh Governor House.

Commuters face hardship amid shortage of buses; officials claim curbs will improve traffic flow in city

They parked their tri-wheelers on the main road causing suspension of vehicular traffic on the key road link for quite some time. It was their demand that the authorities withdraw the ban on all types of rickshaws on the 11 roads across the metropolis.
The disappearance of an important mode of transportation from roads amid severe shortage of public buses sparked criticism and disapproval from the people as a large number of them, mostly women, suffered due to disruption in transport facilities.
The authorities claimed that the ban was imposed to ease out traffic congestion in certain strategic tracks where public transport was available while the people said that the decision had led to a great deal of hardship for those who travelled short distances to reach their destinations by the two- or four-seater rickshaws.
The worst affected are the ones who have their offices located on the major arteries of the city, including Sharea Faisal, which has been closed for operation of both One-Plus-Two and One-Plus-Four rickshaws.
Similarly, the restriction on two-seater and four-seater rickshaws on Shaheed-i-Millat Road from Jail Chowrangi to Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway also piled miseries on people going to their offices in the neighbourhood.
Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi told Dawn that the basic reason of imposing the ban was to discourage the exponential growth of uncontrolled and unregistered rickshaws.
He claimed that operation of rickshaws was banned on only a few strategic tracks where public transport was available keeping in view the underdeveloped mass transit systems and public needs.
The ban, enforced under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC), was recommended by the DIG-traffic and it would remain effective from April 15 to June 14.
Officials sources said that the traffic police had reported to the city administration that the number of unauthorised and self-established illegal routes and rickshaw stands in different parts of the city were the main contributors to traffic congestion on certain roads.
They said that the ban on operation of rickshaws on certain roads would help end the unauthorised and self-established illegal routes and improve the traffic flow.
