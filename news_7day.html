This was not unexpected, given how extensively the regime has managed to abase the judiciary. How can principled individuals who have dedicated a lifetime to their profession be expected to continue as part of an institution whose credibility is now in question? Perhaps the judges realised that it was futile to expect different results in the prevailing environment.
 
 

Just a few years ago, one would have expected an uproar over what the International Commission of Jurists has decried as “a flagrant attack on the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law”. Today, such ideals do not seem to matter, not even to those expected to uphold them. Sadly, many believe the nation’s social, moral and political conscience is on the decline.
Senior justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah gracefully resigned once it became clear that the deeply contentious 27th Amendment would now be considered law. Critics say the amendment, which has reconfigured the country’s justice system to place a new Federal Constitutional Court above all other forums of justice, has reduced the Supreme Court to no more than a glorified district court. Given the extensive powers handed over to the FCC, that assessment is not off the mark.
Rather than be rendered second-class judges, they may have thought it fit to depart with their prestige intact. It would also have been clear to the judges, given the precedent set with the Constitutional Bench, that the regime would not be interested in picking independent-minded judges for the new court.
Some have criticised their decision, asking why they did not exit at the time of the 26th Amendment, which set the foundations for the 27th. The judges may answer that eventually, but one cannot fault them for not having tried to effect change from within their institution. Over time, it has become clear that no rule applies in the present set-up. Without rules, no change can ever be possible.
 
 

The 27th Amendment was designed to be the end of the line for such judges. This brings us to the civilian role in this coup. This is not the first instance when the powers that be have sought to subjugate the judiciary, but it is the first time a civilian dispensation has so extensively facilitated the effort.
The lack of courage and commitment shown to democratic ideals from those who, till yesterday, would not tire of speaking about the supremacy of the will of the people has only highlighted the hypocrisies of our political system. This lack of conviction in the idea of a fair system of governance will have grave consequences. That much is inevitable.

• JUI-F’s Younis Zehri terms the bill ‘against Islamic teachings’
• CM Bugti cites Shariat Court’s judgement in response
• Opposition vows to challenge legislation in court
QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Friday adopted the Child Marriage Prohibition Bill with majority votes amid strong protests by opposition members.
The presentation and passage of the bill triggered heated scenes in the House, with opposition lawmakers shouting slogans and creating a ruckus. During the chaos, opposition members encircled the speaker’s dais and tore copies of the bill.
The session, chaired by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, began with the draft law on banning child marriage being presented to the House.
Speaking on the bill, Leader of the Opposition Younis Zehri of the JUI-F said the legislation was against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah and was being introduced merely to please a non-governmental organisation. Responding to this, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said that the Shariat Court was the highest authority on such matters and its judgement had already been conveyed.
Mr Zehri tore up the agenda documents in protest. As the bill was being presented, opposition members continued their agitation, tearing copies of the bill and throwing them in the air. Despite the uproar, the Child Marriage Prohibition Bill was approved by the assembly.
Opposition MPA Asghar Tareen stated that although the bill had been passed, the opposition would challenge it in court. Heated exchanges also took place between government and opposition members during the session.
During the session, issues regarding the delay in laptop distribution for students in Panjgur, sports activities and funding in Gwadar, and various points of order and departmental questions were addressed. However, three resolutions could not be presented due to disruptions during the approval of the Child Marriage Prohibition Bill.
Condolence
The House also condoled the deaths of Senator Irfan Siddiqui and Agha Siraj Durrani, and members paid tribute to those martyred in recent terrorist incidents.
Leader of the Opposition Younis Zehri criticised the Planning and Development Department for providing incorrect information on its projects, saying it undermined both his and the assembly’s privileges.
The speaker ruled that a proper response would be provided in the next session and that accountability would follow in case of negligence.
Speaking to the media after the session, CM Bugti reaffirmed the provincial assembly’s constitutional right to legislate following the passage of the child marriage bill.
“Legislation is the constitutional right of the government, and the provincial assembly exercised that right today,” he said.
 






He noted that the bill had been passed with majority votes, calling it a symbol of the strength of the democratic process.
CM Bugti emphasised that protest was the democratic right of the opposition, which the government respected. He assured that dialogue and negotiation would remain open.
He underlined that while dissent is part of democracy, legislation is always carried out in the best interest of the people.
 
 

He clarified that the bill had been under committee review for six months and was approved by the Balochistan Cabinet before being passed in the Assembly.
He stressed that the government prioritises consensus-based legislation, ensuring every bill undergoes extensive consultation and transparent procedures.
CM Bugti assured the public that the government was working with sincerity and responsibility for the development and welfare of Balochistan, and that the legislative process would continue without interruption.
Later, the speaker adjourned the session until November 17.

In a statement issued at the UN Headquarters, Pakistan, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye and the United States expressed their joint support for the UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution currently under consideration, drafted by the US after consultation and in cooperation with council members and partners in the region.
“The historic Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, announced on Sept 29, is endorsed by the resolution and was celebrated and endorsed in Sharm Al Sheikh,” it read.
 






“We are issuing this statement as the member states that gathered during High-Level Week to begin this process, which offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.

Joint statement endorses process that offers pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood

“We emphasise that this is a sincere effort, and the Plan provides a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region,” the endorsers said, while expressing the hope for the “resolution’s swift adoption”.
The United States, in an earlier statement, urged the UNSC to formally endorse its draft resolution aimed at strengthening President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, warning that the ceasefire in Gaza remains “fragile”.
Russia’s resolution
The appeal came as Russia introduced its own resolution on Gaza in the 15-member council, directly challenging the US draft. The council’s five permanent members — the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France — retain the power to veto any resolution.
“Attempts to sow discord now — when agreement on this resolution is under active negotiation — have grave, tangible, and entirely avoidable consequences for Palestinians in Gaza,” the US mission to the UN said in a statement.
It added that the ceasefire was fragile and “we urge the Council to unite and move forward to secure the peace that is desperately needed.”
The mission informed council members that in mid-October, the US began drafting a UNSC resolution with input from its partners in Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and the United Arab Emirates. “The simple, straightforward point of this resolution is to bring to fruition President Trump’s historic 20-point comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict, as supported by over 20 countries in Sharm Al Sheikh on Oct 13, 2025,” the mission added.
It recalled that in the week of Nov 3, the United States began “good-faith negotiations” on this draft in New York, working closely with members of the Security Council and its partners. The purpose of these talks was to “reach consensus on a draft that would stand up the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and begin a stable, secure, peaceful and prosperous future for Palestinians in Gaza, free of Hamas”, it stated.
‘Two-year mandate’
The mission assured the UNSC that this effort built on President Trump’s widely accepted historic 20-point peace plan endorsed by parties at Sharm al Sheikh. “We urge the Security Council to seize this historic moment to pave a path towards enduring peace in the Middle East by supporting this resolution,” it stated. If adopted, the US resolution would authorise a two-year mandate running until the end of 2027 for a transitional governance body in Gaza — known as the “Board of Peace” — that President Trump would chair. It would also authorise member states to form a temporary ISF tasked with the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, protecting civilians, and securing humanitarian aid corridors in Gaza.
Trump has ruled out sending US troops into Gaza as part of the proposed 20,000-strong force.

• India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh fared better
• China, Iran and Russia at bottom
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked 27th out of 100 — ‘Not Free’ — in terms of internet freedom by a global democracy watchdog in a recent report, which cited government measures to expand censorship practices.
During June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025, the report issued by the US-based Freedom House noted that the authorities threatened to block virtual private networks (VPNs) and adopted amendments to the country’s cybercrime law that rights groups said could be abused.
On the other hand, countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are markedly more open, classified as ‘Partly Free’, with much higher freedom scores of 51, 53, and 45, respectively. The watchdog was unable to track Afghanistan’s score.
The countries placed at the bottom are China, Myanmar, Iran and Russia with scores of 9, 9, 13¸and 17, respectively.
The watchdog noted that governments in the countries that suffered the most extreme declines over the 15 years of global deterioration in internet freedom — Pakistan, Egypt, Russia, Turkiye, and Venezuela — intensified their control over the online environment in response to challenges to their rule.
 
 

Between 2011 to 2015, Pakistan’s internet freedom deteriorated sharply, plunging from 55 to 69.
From 2012 onwards, the status moved from ‘Partly Free’ to ‘Not Free’, reflecting increasing restrictions.
“Pakistanis reported periods of poor internet quality and disruptions to their access to WhatsApp, Signal, and other platforms throughout the coverage period,” the report noted.
“Researchers found that the connectivity disruptions were likely linked to the deployment of new website monitoring and blocking technology,” it added.
It noted that in November last year, the authorities restricted internet services across Islamabad as widespread protests in support of former prime minister Imran Khan took place. “[Imran] Khan was imprisoned throughout the coverage period.”
It continued that the platform became accessible during a four-day military conflict between Pakistan and India, which followed a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
It maintained that “the military establishment sought to curtail the influence” of the PTI founder and his party.
VPNs
The report noted that in May this year, Pakistani officials unblocked X (formerly Twitter), which had been restricted since February 2024.
“Authorities repeatedly threatened to block VPNs operating in Pakistan without registration. Registration requirements released in Nov 2024 required the disclosure of information identifying customers; however, at the end of the month authorities said they would not block unregistered VPN connections,” the report noted.
 
 

“The development reportedly came after the law ministry found that the government lacked legal standing to block VPNs.”
The watchdog noted that amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) signed into law in January 2025 contained ambiguous language rights groups said could be used to remove online speech deemed undesirable by authorities.
It added that at least five people were sentenced to death during the coverage period after being convicted of blasphemy in connection with material posted online.
The report noted that Pakistan held regular elections under a competitive multiparty system.
“However, the military exerts enormous influence over the conduct of elections, government formation, and policies; intimidates the media; and enjoys impunity for indiscriminate or extralegal use of force,” it added.
Of the 72 countries assessed in Freedom on the Net 2025, conditions deteriorated in 28, while 17 countries registered overall gains.
“The authorities often impose selective restrictions on civil liberties. Militants conduct terrorist campaigns against the state and also regularly carry out attacks on members of religious minority groups and other perceived opponents.”
Global situation
Overall, it noted that the global internet freedom decli­ned for the 15th consecutive year.
Kenya experienced the most severe decline of the coverage period, after authorities responded to nationwide protests over tax policy in June 2024 by shutting down internet connectivity for around seven hours and arresting hundreds of protesters.

• Service strategic commands to be unified under National Strategic Command
THE wiring diagram of national security establishment has been rewritten through the most sweeping overhaul of the country’s Hig­her Defence Organisation (HDO) since 1976.
The proponents of the restructuring, introduced through Amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislations governing Army, Air Force and Navy, call it modernisation, while its critics warn about centralization.
At the centre of this redesign sits a single office, which is that of the Chief of the Army Staff, who would soon also be the Chief of the Defence Forces. The dual title has conferred new powers to this office with regards to multi-domain integration, restructuring, and creating jointness of the armed forces. The open-ended wording of the legislative amendment raises question as to who would shape the CDF’s role, from joint force integration to structural reforms, which apparently wouldn’t require parliamentary approval.
 
 

The legislation also abolishes the Chai­rman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces in view of the lessons learnt from 1971 War when Navy came to know about the war through news on radio and navy’s ship Khyber was lost after being hit by Indian missile, a retired four-star general recalled while discussing HDO restructuring with Dawn. The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making at least during war time.
The new command architecture has been projected by the government and the military as a functional necessity. Modern wars move at digital speed. Cyber, space, drones, and information operations don’t respect the boundaries of traditional services. But Pakistan has lived for decades with an HDO that was regularly described by experts as “anachronistic” and “structurally hollow.” In that sense, reform was overdue.
But how reform is done matters as much as why.
Rather than dispersing authority across a joint command or empowering a neutral coordinating chief much like what the United States did through Goldwater-Nichols Act or India with its Chief of Defence Staff, the restructuring has concentrated the logic of ‘jointness’ in the office of the army chief.
“Jointness is not being created between the services, its being created above them,” a retired army general who extensively studied HDO said.
Former PAF Chief Air Chief Marshal Abbas Khattak, while talking to Dawn said, “Historical experience bears testimony to the efficacy of the independent status of the land, sea and air forces, which was achieved after much debate and analysis within the advanced western armed forces decades back.”
“Are we then rejecting the globally accepted and practiced approach and regressing to the previous configuration without what should have resulted from a meaningful debate amongst our senior veterans and serving officers,” he added.
The new system virtually makes almost every top armed forces’ appointment contingent on the recommendation of the CDF-cum-COAS. It has been legislated that the newly created position of CNSC, an office overseeing nuclear forces, would be appointed, reappointed, and his service may be extended solely on the CDF’s recommendation and the process would be shielded from judicial review.
This does not mean hierarchy behind the nuclear controls has drastically changed. The National Command Authority remains civilian-led and structurally intact, but it does tilt the institutional balance inside the military in favor of the Army even though the delivery systems are spread across the three services.  The existing service strategic commands will be unified under new National Strategic Command.
“With new appointments of CDF and possibly Commander National Strategic Command becoming part of the NCA, both of whom would be from the Army, and CDF being senior to the other two services chiefs, it is not yet clear how the delicate balance between the three services, and between military and civilian components of the NCA would be maintained,” worried Dr Adil Sultan, dean of Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies at Air University. Dr Adil is former PAF officer and has also served in the Strategic Plans Division.
Section 8E(2) has drawn immediate attention for its sweeping exclusion of judicial review. It states that “the appointment, reappointment or extension of the CNSC… shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever.” This unprecedented ouster clause looks to shield CNSC appointments and extensions from any legal challenge.
Legal experts warn that such language contradicts with Articles 4, 9, and 199 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality before law and judicial recourse.
Military law expert Col (retd) Inam-ur-Rahim noted: “It has been held by the apex court in a number of cases that any action of the military authorities, if taken without jurisdiction, coram non judice or in bad faith, can be challenged in the high courts as well as in the Supreme Court.”
Although the amended legislations do not link the appointments and extension in services of Air Force and Navy chiefs to the recommendation of CDF, but observers say that the way the system has been designed, it looks that all four-star appointments would be done in consultation with CDF, whereas three star and below promotions and transfers would continue to be done by the respective services chiefs.
Pakistan Army Act
A subtle but significant change in Section 176C of Pakistan Army Act gives the CDF-cum-COAS decisive control over how his own powers are delegated. The amendment allows the federal government to authorize vice or deputy chiefs of army staff to exercise COAS functions, but that has been linked to the recommendation of the CDF-cum-COAS himself. Earlier it was the executive’s prerogative to make such appointments, though they were rarely made by political government. Military rulers, Zia and Musharraf, appointed VCOAS to run the army, while they ruled the country.
A military source, speaking on the background, however, said the current chief does not intend to appoint a vice chief of army staff, for now.
Moreover, an amendment in Section 176A of Pakistan Army Act preserves constitutional primacy for the person with the rank of Field Marshal. It specifies that where inconsistencies arise, Article 243 of the Constitution, which governs command of the armed forces, will prevail.
Military law expert Omar Farooq Adam, while explaining the amendment said: “If there is any inconsistency between the provisions of Section 176A of the Army Act as to the service of Field Marshal then Article 243 of the constitution will be relied on mainly with regards to terms and conditions of service.”
Section 176A of the Pakistan Army Act empowers the federal government to make regulations for the governance, command, discipline, recruitment, terms of service, rank, precedence, and administration of the Pakistan Army, as well as for any other purposes of the Act beyond those covered by rules under Section 176.
The government defends the reforms as “clarity, not concentration”. They argue the position of Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee had long become ceremonial, that duplication needed to be eliminated, that global best practices demanded a single strategic integrator. And in fairness, much of that is true. CJCSC had neither the influence nor the required operational command. The services often behaved more like parallel bureaucracies than components of a joint war-fighting machine.
But modernisation means reducing the power of individual service chiefs and strengthening joint institutions that dilute single-service dominance. This model does the opposite by pulling more levers upward into a single office and lengthens its tenure to at least 2030 and potentially beyond to 2035. Therefore, instead of producing a system that could streamline decision-making the restructuring is risking becoming overly dependent on the personality, preferences, and politics of whoever occupies that seat.
The role of Navy and Air Force in decision making looks diminished precisely at the moment when their roles should be expanding due to maritime competition and emerging airspace threats.
ACM Khattak argues that “modern air forces cannot work well when treated as an ancillary and under some other entity or command”. He further said: “The question before us is not about institutional pride, but whether Pakistan chooses to align with globally proven models or revert to older arrangements that other nations ultimately abandoned after hard experience.”
This is not an argument against jointness. The country’s armed forces need jointness desperately. It needs integrated command structures, a strong civilian led defence ministry, and clear oversight mechanisms that bring coherence to national security planning. It needs what all modern militaries need, which is institutions stronger than individuals.
“I share the general opinion that institutions and traditions are stronger than individuals and must take precedence,” former army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani had said at the time of his retirement.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Consti­tutional Court (FCC) formally commenced on Friday after its chief justice and four judges took oath, though the proceedings were overshadowed by a boycott from five senior judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and questions are being raised over what principle, if any, guided these appointments.
Critics point out that if seniority was the yardstick, none of the appointees — except Justice Aminuddin Khan, who has been elevated as chief justice of the FCC — is senior to members of the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court, several of whom have been ignored.

This, they argue, is done in contrast to the spirit of the 1996 Al-Jihad Trust case, which ruled that appointments to the superior courts should be transparent so that litigants and the people at large retain faith in the independence of the judiciary.
If constitutional expertise was the criterion, none of these judges is known for pursuing constitutional matters in their practice as lawyers or has to their credit any significant constitutional judgements, again, except for Justice Amin­uddin, who, as a CB member, decided a number of constitutional matters.
“People have every right to know the transparent criteria on the basis of which these judges were picked to create history by becoming judges of the FCC, and on what basis other CB judges were sidelined,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity, adding that the resignation of two Supreme Court judges before these appointments had already made the FCC controversial.
According to a notification issued on Friday, Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah were appointed FCC judges by President Asif Ali Zardari under Article 175A(3), read with Article 175C, of the newly amended Constitution through the 27th Amendment.
Soon after taking the oath, the FCC chief justice appointed retired district and sessions judge Muhammad Hafeez Ullah Khan as registrar of the new court for a period of three years and Mazhar Bhatti as the chief justice’s secretary. Their terms and conditions will be determined later.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, who in the morning was sworn in as FCC chief justice by the president at the Presidency, later administered the oath to Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi in the courtyard of the IHC.
During the IHC ceremony, none of the judges of the Supreme Court, most conspicuously Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, were present. Five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Babar Sattar and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — also did not attend.
However, Justices Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Moh­ammad Asif, Mohammad Azam Khan and Raja Inam Ameen Minhas were present. IHC Chief Justice Sardar Sarfraz Dogar was also present on the podium where the FCC judges were seated.
Earlier in the morning, seven seats had been placed on the podium, but four were later removed. The ceremony also began behind schedule.
Justice Aminuddin Khan hinted that more judges may be administered the oath in a day or two and that the FCC may eventually have a total strength of 13 judges. At the Presidency, both the CJP Yahya Afridi and Justice Aminuddin Khan arrived together for the oath-taking.
Whether the judges were selected for competence or on a subjective assessment of loyalty to the government and a perceived willingness to “toe the government’s line” was a matter of concern, the senior counsel said, warning that the impartiality of the FCC risked being compromised from the outset.
“If impartiality is suspected, no court has any ground in the eyes of the public,” he regretted, adding that the government should have moved to allay such perceptions when two Supreme Court judges resigned over making the apex court subordinate to the FCC.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar described Friday’s oath-taking as an event that would be remembered “not as the commencement of a new judicial chapter, but as the death rites for the nation’s existing constitutional order and judicial independence”.
It had, he said, become a flashpoint for “intense nationwide criticism and public outrage” over its implications. An unelected executive, he argued, had moved an unelected legislature to enact a constitutional amendment, circumventing the Supreme Court by establishing the FCC and effectively empowering the latter by disempowering the former, with the FCC usurping the Supreme Court’s constitutional jurisdiction.
The amendment allows the executive to appoint FCC judges and to order non-consensual transfers of high court judges, he bemoaned.
Former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muneer A. Malik, who earlier spearheaded the 2007 lawyers’ movement, said he would oppose the controversial 27th Amendment “tooth and nail” and questioned the criteria under which the new judges had been elevated to the FCC.
“This is court-packing of the FCC to gain particularised judgements,” he alleged, asking what significant background some of the appointees possessed that justified their elevation.
At the very least, the names of those under consideration for the FCC should have been floated in advance so that the public could understand the criteria behind the selections, he said.
Mr Malik also questioned whether the chief justices of the respective high courts had been consulted before some of their judges were elevated, terming the entire appointment process “totally non-transparent and absolutely a joke”.
Full court
Despite popular belief, the scheduled full court meeting, presided over by CJP Afridi, did not take up for discussion the resignations of the two Supreme Court judges — Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah — nor the appointment of judges to the FCC or the situation arising after the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Instead, a Supreme Court press release said, the full court gave its final approval to the newly adopted Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
 
 

According to the statement, the participants “unanimously updated the Rules on the recommendation of the committee, comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, constituted under Rule 1(4) of Order I of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, for removal of difficulties arising in giving effect to its provisions”.
The full court also unanimously approved the grant of the status of senior advocate of the Supreme Court to Muhammad Munir Paracha — an advocate of the apex court until now — in terms of Rule 5 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
FCC begins work
Separately, the FCC formally commenced on Friday after its chief justice and four judges took the oath.
The newly formed apex constitutional forum has begun work under makeshift arrangements, as its permanent premises have yet to be finalised.
The Ministry of Law and Justice issued notifications appointing six judges to the FCC following presidential approval.
Besides Justices Rizvi, Farooq and Najafi, the appointees include Sindh High Court’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech. Arshad Hussain Shah has also been appointed after Justice Musarrat Hilali declined to join the FCC, according to sources.
Sources said Justice K.K. Agha’s oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for Saturday (today) at the IHC. The remaining two judges have not yet confirmed their availability, but if they appear on Saturday, they too will be administered the oath.
Initially, the FCC was proposed to be housed in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building, but FSC judges strongly resisted relocation to the third floor of the IHC building. Another proposal suggested accommodating the FCC temporarily within the IHC premises; however, sources said the FCC chief justice is seeking to retain courtrooms inside the Supreme Court until a permanent building is allocated. If the Supreme Court administration refused to accommodate the FCC in its premises, the Cons­titutional Court would resume its functions from the IHC from Monday.
Resignations accepted
Meanwhile, President Zardari on Friday accepted the resignations of Supreme Court judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah.
The two judges had handed in their resignations a day earlier, hours after the contentious 27th Amendment was signed into law by the president, describing the legislation as an affront to the judiciary and the 1973 Constitution.
In a separate development, 14 prominent lawyers — including Muneer A. Malik, Makhdoom Ali Khan, Faisal Siddiqui and Salahuddin Ahmed — issued a joint statement expressing regret over the resignations.
They declared that Justice Shah and Justice Minallah had “permanently etched their names in the short list of national heroes who prized principles over expediency, but at the demise of the Supreme Court and the extinguishment of the last members of an independent judiciary”.

• Floods in Pakistan affected 9m people, destroyed crops on large scale
ISLAMABAD: Disasters have caused an estimated $3.26 trillion in agricultural losses worldwide over the past 33 years — an average of $99 billion annually, or roughly four per cent of global agricultural GDP — according to a new report released by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) on Friday.
The report, titled Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2025, highlights how digital technologies are transforming the way farmers, governments and communities monitor risks, anticipate impacts and protect livelihoods.
“The global agricultural sector stands at a critical juncture, facing an unprecedented convergence of disasters, while simultaneously witnessing remarkable advances in digital technologies that offer new possibilities for understanding, predicting and managing disaster risks,” it added.
Between 1991 and 2023, disasters wiped out 4.6bn tonnes of cereals, 2.8bn tonnes of fruits and vegetables, and 900m tonnes of meat and dairy. These losses translate to a daily per capita reduction of 320 kilocalories — 13-16pc of average energy needs, the report estimated.
 
 

The FAO report said Asia accounts for the largest share of global losses of 47pc, totaling $1.53tr, reflecting both the scale of agricultural production and the region’s high exposure to floods, storms and droughts.
In Pakistan, monsoon floods affected over 9m people and destroyed 849,000 hectares of crops, coming just one year after the catastrophic 2022 floods from which the country is still recovering. The consecutive flooding events have fundamentally altered Pakistan’s agricultural landscape, with soil erosion, salinisation and infrastructure destruction creating long-term challenges for agricultural recovery.
The report identified digital transformation as a game-changer for agricultural disaster risk reduction. Emerging tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, mobile connectivity, drones and sensors are now enabling hyperlocal, real-time insights that improve early warning, advisory services, risk transfer mechanisms and anticipatory action.
“Digital technologies are already revolutionising how we monitor risks, deliver early warnings and support farmers’ decision-making. From the 9.1m farmers now accessing parametric insurance through digital platforms to the communities using our early warning systems to evacuate 90pc of at-risk populations before disasters strike, we are witnessing a fundamental shift from reactive response to proactive risk reduction,” said FAO Director General QU Dongyu.
Losses in production resulting from disasters correspond to a reduced availability of 320 kcal per person per day globally, with iron losses corresponding to 60pc of requirements for men and critical shortfalls in essential vitamins and minerals that have the potential to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.
According to the report, disaster impacts on agriculture extend far beyond immediate production losses to include infrastructure damage, market disruptions, financial system failures and ecosystem service degradation that can persist for years after initial events. Current assessment tools must be extended to systematically capture both direct and indirect impacts and take into consideration non-economic values, differentiated effects on vulnerable groups, biodiversity losses and long-term ecosystem disruptions, it said.
Marine heatwaves alone are estimated to have caused $6.6bn in fisheries losses (1985-2022), with 15pc of global fisheries affected and production losses exceeding 5.6m tonnes, demonstrating the severe yet largely unmeasured impacts on aquatic food systems.

The former Pakistan skipper, under intense scrutiny after 83 innings without a three-figure score, struck eight boundaries in a 119-ball innings that blended patience with poise.
He reached his milestone in the 47th over, pulling pacer Pramod Madushan to midwicket for a single, before collapsing to his knees in prostration and embracing Mohammad Rizwan at the non-striker’s end. The Rawalpindi crowd erupted, having waited long for this moment.
Reaching the milestone, Babar equalled former opener Saeed Anwar’s record for the most ODI hundreds for Pakistan — 20 centuries.
Rizwan played the ideal supporting role, remaining unbeaten on 51 off 54 balls, hitting five fours and a six. The pair added an unbroken 112 for the third wicket, guiding Pakistan across the finish line two balls into the 49th over.
 






The chase began explosively. Openers Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman raced to 77-0 in the Powerplay. Saim smashed 33 off 25 balls (five fours and a six) before holing out to mid-off off pacer Dushmantha Chameera in the 10th over.
Fakhar, dropped thrice, anchored with 78 off 93 balls (eight fours and six) before falling to a superb low catch by Janith Liyanage at short midwicket off Chameera in the 31st.
Sri Lanka’s fielding lapses proved decisive. Fakhar survived a skier spilled by substitute Pavan Rathnayake, a miscued loft dropped by Asitha Fernando at long-off off Charith Asalanka, and an earlier edge. These errors allowed Pakistan to maintain momentum on a pitch offering little after early swing.
Chameera was Sri Lanka’s only wicket-taker, finishing with 2-58 in 10 overs. The rest struggled: Asitha Fernando leaked 66 in 8.2 overs without success, Pramod Madushan conceded 62 in eight, while Wanindu Hasaranga, usually a threat, went wicketless for 35 in 10. Captain Asalanka’s part-time spin and Janith Liyanage’s medium pace offered no control.
 






Babar, initially cautious, grew in confidence. He reached fifty off 66 balls with a short-arm jab through point, then accelerated with trademark cover drives and pulls. Rizwan, joining at 177-2, rotated strike expertly before raising his fifty with a steer to deep midwicket.
The winning runs came off Asitha in the 49th over — Babar guiding a low full toss to cover. The pair walked off grinning, series sealed.
Earlier, having starred with the ball in the opener, Haris Rauf was at it again as Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 288-8.
The pacer, who finished with 3-66, responded each time when called upon, especially when Sri Lanka were threatening to post an even bigger total where he picked up two quick wickets to snuff out their hopes.
Haris’ spell at the end came after leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (3-41) had ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order; their exploits giving Pakistan a good chance of wrapping up the series despite a valiant half century by Liyanage and a counter-punching 44 by Kamindu Mendis.
The match, initially scheduled for Thursday, was pushed back to Friday after the terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday, when Pakistan had won the opener at the same venue.
Salman Ali Agha, standing in place of flu-stricken skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi, had opted to bowl after winning the toss and it needed work from fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Mohammad Waseem Jr in the deep to get Pakistan their first breakthrough.
Pathum Nissanka (24) had been looking good, having hit four boundaries, but was run out attempting a risky third run, with his departure bringing to an end a 51-run opening stand.
Fellow opener Kamil Mishara (27) followed soon after; Rizwan’s quick glovework helping complete a stumping off Abrar, who sat out the first game due to illness and was returning to the playing XI after a match-winning performance against South Africa last week.
Abrar had been difficult to read for Sri Lankan batters and struck again when Kusal Mendis (20) holed out to Mohammad Nawaz inside the circle on the leg-side.
Abrar was hit for the first boundary of his spell when Asalanka swept him away but the leg-spinner hit back on the next ball, trapping the left-hander lbw with a ball that spun away after pitching.
Sri Lanka reached 100 in the 23rd over and the first six of their innings came on the first ball of the 24th when Liyanage came down the track and hit Abrar over the long-on fence.
Abrar was pulled out of the attack and that gave Sri Lanka the breathing space they needed and Liyanage and Sadeera Sameerawickrama (42) settled soon after.
When the latter got his third boundary with a flick off Nawaz in the 29th, Salman felt Pakistan needed to change tact. Haris was called into action and the pacer, fresh from picking up four wickets in the opening ODI, responded by cleaning up Sameerawickrama, who also hit a six, with a length ball that hit the top of his off-stump and ended a 61-run stand.
The incoming Kamindu launched Haris for a six and with the more sedate Liyanage took Sri Lanka to 200 in the 38th over. Pakistan turned to Abrar once again but Kamindu swatted him away for four as Sri Lanka set themselves up for a late charge.
Spinner Nawaz was plundered for 14 in the 41st over where Liyanage raising his half-century off 56 deliveries and Kamindu getting his second six. But Haris broke the 73-run partnership when he had Kamindu, who hit four fours during his 38-ball stay, caught at the square leg fence.
Liyanage fell in the next over, hitting Waseem to Nawaz at midwicket before Haris trapped Chameera lbw. Hasaranga’s unbeaten 37 in the end ensured Sri Lanka set Pakistan 289 to win.</p><small>2025-11-14 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1423582517fcc1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955083/kp-government-to-withdraw-appeal-against-action-in-aid-of-civil-power-regulation' target='_blank'><strong>KP government to withdraw appeal against Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulation</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government on Friday declared the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations, 2011, to be a law that violates basic human rights and approved a resolution passed by the KP Assembly to withdraw its appeal against the law from the apex court.
In 2019, the then Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) provincial government extended the law to the entire province; however, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) nullified the move, terming the law a violation of basic human rights. The government, however, later obtained a stay order from the Supreme Court against the PHC verdict.
On September 8, the KP Assembly passed a resolution recommending that the provincial government withdraw its appeal. “This House recommends that the provincial government declare the implementation of the law in KP and the merged districts to be against basic rights and withdraw its appeal against it from the Supreme Court,” the resolution read.
On Friday, the chief minister’s aide on information and public relations, Shafiullah Jan, told the media that the most important decision made in the cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, concerned the Action in Aid of Civil Power regulation.
Jan, while briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, said that the law was being misused and that the government had expressed its concerns. He added that the cabinet also approved an inquiry commission to investigate the attack on the Radio Pakistan building on May 9 during what he described as a “false flag operation”.
He said that the commission formed to probe the Radio Pakistan Peshawar attack would collect all available evidence, including CCTV footage, and submit its findings to the cabinet. He added that the names of the commission members would be finalised in the next cabinet meeting.
“The KP government believes that the May 9 operation was against PTI, to dismantle the party and to send its founder, Imran Khan, behind bars. PTI achieved nothing from May 9,” he said, and questioned who benefited from May 9 since it was used against PTI.
The chief minister’s aide also criticised Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for speaking against Pashtuns, adding that an entire Pashtun generation had laid down their lives. He said that the federal government should be asked how the explosives entered Pakistan since the federal government controls the border.
Jan said that the provincial government brought together the entire political leadership in KP under one roof and that the draft finalised after the peace jirga would be discussed in the security committee, followed by a provincial action plan. He also said that the TORs would be finalised and the details shared with the corps commander, adding that the final decision would be made by the chief minister.
The aide also said that they would enhance the police’s capacity so that the department could counter militancy in the province. Jan added that the cabinet decided not to spend taxpayers’ money on publicity of individuals, adding that PTI believed in transparency and that the cabinet had decided there would be zero tolerance for corruption.
He elaborated that the provincial government released a Rs4 billion grant for displaced persons since they had left their homes during Operation Zarb-e-Azb, but the federal government, even after promising financial assistance to the displaced families, never fulfilled its promises during the last three years.
The chief minister’s aide informed that a package of Rs6 billion had been announced for the provision of missing facilities in schools across the province, adding that the chief minister had ordered the release of Rs1.20 billion. He said that 0.745 million children would be enrolled and a stipend would be paid to their parents. Additionally, funds were approved for roads in Swat and South Waziristan.
Jan maintained that the cabinet members and the bureaucracy stressed the need to improve the law and order situation and governance, adding that further decisions would be made to bring visible changes over the next three years. The provincial government thanked all the political parties, tribal elders, and other participants for taking part in the peace jirga.</p><small>2025-11-14 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14235252ab99c6f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955081/epsteins-emails-reveal-network-of-powerful-contacts' target='_blank'><strong>Epstein’s emails reveal network of powerful contacts</strong></a><br><p>The latest batch from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s emails illustrates the extraordinary scope of his contacts with powerful people, ranging from a top Trump adviser to Britain’s ex-prince Andrew.
The United States House of Representatives is expected to vote next week on trying to force the release of evidence gathered on Epstein by law enforcement over the years, including the identities of the men suspected of participating in his alleged sex trafficking ring.
However, a slew of emails released this week has already opened new windows on the extent of Epstein’s network.
These include multiple references to President Donald Trump, who is angrily calling the push for more transparency a “hoax”, while simultaneously demanding a probe of Epstein’s links to others, including former president Bill Clinton.
Documents already released by Democrats in Congress include email exchanges running from 2009 to 2019, when Epstein died in detention while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
His death was ruled a suicide.
These are just three of the prominent men, and one woman, found in the email threads.
Andrew, fallen prince
One exchange in the typo-strewn emails confirms that contact between Epstein and Andrew, who was stripped of his royal title in October, did not definitively end in late 2010, as his brother King Charles has stated.
As late as March 4, 2011, Epstein wrote to Andrew with several questions addressed to long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking after Epstein’s death.
“Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am not involved and that I knew and know nothing about any of these allegations. I can’t take any more of this my end,” Andrew wrote.
Two days later, Epstein wrote back: “You ok? These stories are complete and utter fantasy.”
Bannon, former Trump adviser
Epstein had a long email correspondence in 2018 with Steve Bannon, an adviser to Trump in his first term and a chief ideologue of the hard-right Make America Great Again movement.
That July, Epstein suggested that he help Bannon spread his far-right ideas in Europe.
Epstein: “It’s doable, but time-consuming, there are many leaders of countries we can organise for you to have one-on-ones.”
“Agree 100 per cent. How do I do that???” Bannon asked.
“We can talk about [it] at your convenience,” Epstein said.
Former treasury secretary Summers
“How is life among the lucrative and louche?” asked Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretary under Barack Obama, in an email to Epstein on October 27, 2017, during Trump’s first term.
“When we meet I will endeavour to mesmerise you with stories of DC so wild!!!” Epstein replied.
Epstein asked what people attending a conference with Summers think of Trump.
“Hard to tell. General view [is] Donald is a clown, increasingly dangerous on foreign policy,” Summers said.
Epstein in December 2018: “Trump  — borderline insane.”
Former Obama adviser Ruemmler
Epstein also traded emails with Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as an adviser to Obama until 2014. Their exchange began that year and ran until 2019.
“I am about to go on stage. The first part of my presentation is about Trump,” Ruemmler wrote in May 2016.
“Con man, says it all,” Epstein replied.
In August 2018, he wrote to her: “I know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea [sic].”
That December, Epstein wrote: “You might want to tell your dem friends that treating Trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power.“</p><small>2025-11-14 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1423145482fc53a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955080/trump-demands-doj-probe-into-epstein-links-to-bill-clinton-other-democrats' target='_blank'><strong>Trump demands DOJ probe into Epstein links to Bill Clinton, other Democrats</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday he wants the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate links between the late alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and former Democratic president Bill Clinton.
Seeking to turn the tables after a new trove of Epstein emails reignited questions over his own ties to the disgraced financier, Trump also demanded a probe into US bank JPMorgan Chase, ex-Harvard president Larry Summers and others.
Republican Trump accused rival Democrats of “using the Epstein Hoax” to distract from the party’s recent compromise to end a record US government shutdown, and said the scandal involved “Democrats, not Republicans.”
“I will be asking AG Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, JP Morgan, Chase and many other people and institutions,” Trump said on Truth Social.
“Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘island’.”
Clinton has long faced scrutiny over his ties to Epstein and flew on his private plane, although he has never been accused of wrongdoing in the scandal.
Epstein said that Clinton had “never ever” been to his notorious private island in the Caribbean, according to several emails in the latest trove dating from 2011 and viewed by AFP.
There was no immediate comment from Clinton, Summers, LinkedIn founder Hoffman or JP Morgan Chase, which in 2023 agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought by victims of Epstein, its former client.
Trump’s message broke two days of silence over the scandal, with the emails released on Wednesday renewing questions over the 79-year-old’s long, close relationship with Epstein.
Epstein died in prison in 2019 — by suicide, authorities ruled — before he could face trial on federal sex charges. But questions over his alleged masterminding of a sex ring where powerful men were provided with underage girls only grew.
‘A country to run’
Trump himself has not been accused of any wrongdoing, yet the scandal has dogged Trump since his return to the White House in January, despite his attempts to put a lid on the issue.
Trump and some of his close allies, including his FBI chief Kash Patel, had in the past promised his right-wing base they would seek the release of all the evidence against Epstein, including details of his alleged clients.
 
 

But there was a furious MAGA backlash after Trump’s Justice Department, in a July memo, reaffirmed he died by suicide, and that a “client list” Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed to have been reviewing did not in fact exist.
The scandal peaked again on Wednesday with the release of emails subpoenaed by Congress from Epstein’s estate.
The email traffic between Epstein and friends said Trump “knew about the girls” and had spent “hours” with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims and the main accuser.
The White House says Giuffre, who herself died by suicide in April, had declared that Trump “couldn’t have been friendlier”.
Now the House of Representatives will vote as early as next week on demanding release by the Justice Department of its materials on Epstein, after a rebellion by a handful of MAGA lawmakers provided sufficient votes.
Those materials could include far more damning evidence than has been previously seen on the links between Epstein and his circle, which over the years ranged from Trump to Britain’s ex-prince Andrew.
Trump made clear he does not want the effort to proceed.
“Don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a country to run!” he said on social media.</p><small>2025-11-14 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1422194106073d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955055/no-confidence-moved-in-ajk-assembly-ppp-nominates-rathore-for-pm' target='_blank'><strong>No confidence moved in AJK Assembly; PPP nominates Rathore for PM</strong></a><br><p>A resolution for a vote of no confidence was submitted to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Legislative Assembly’s special secretary, Amjed Latif Abbasi on Friday.
On October 27, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira announced that his party and the PML-N had agreed on bringing a no-confidence motion against the government in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members, and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members.
Earlier today, the PPP put forward the name of Faisal Rathore as their nominee for the position of the prime minister of the territory, its AJK party president said.
The resolution was handed over to Abbasi by PPP lawmakers Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Sardar Javed Ayoub, Malik Zafar Iqbal and Chaudhry Ali Shan Soni.
Assembly Secretary Chaudhry Basharat Hussain — a relative of AJK PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq — did not attend office on Friday.
The resolution signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N — its regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir and his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider — accused Haq of having “lost the trust of the Legislative Assembly”.
“We, the undersigned members of the Legislative Assembly, in accordance with Article 18(4) of the Interim Constitution, hereby submit a no-confidence motion, holding that the current Prime Minister [Chaudhry] Anwarul Haq has not only lost the trust of the Legislative Assembly but has also inflicted serious damage upon the constitutional, ideological, and democratic framework of the state, through his style of governance, political narrative, and confrontational conduct,” it read.
“We, the proposers, recognise Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the nominee for prime minister and call for the earliest completion of the electoral process in accordance with constitutional and democratic requirements, so that the continuity of government formation remains intact,” the resolution added.
The resolution had left the section naming the proposed new leader blank while signatures were being collected. Rathore’s name was later handwritten into the document before submission.
Additionally, 19 of the 25 signatories were members of Haq’s own cabinet, and none resigned even after filing the no-confidence motion.
When a reporter asked Malik Zafar Iqbal as to why they had not resigned, he said: “Our decisions are taken by our central leadership, and as yet no such directive has been issued.”
Meanwhile, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar summoned the Legislative Assembly to meet at 3pm on Monday to vote on the resolution.
PPP AJK President Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, while speaking to the media earlier today outside Zardari House in Islamabad, along with PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf, said, “Our chairman has decided … that Faisal Rathore, who is the general secretary of our party in AJK, will be nominated for the position of PM.”
He detailed that “we are going to table the vote of no confidence today, so god willing, in the next few days, PPP will have its government in AJK.”
“The voting will begin on Monday,” he later said in response to a question.
“Faisal Rathore is an educated young man; he has a lot of experience and has been part of the assembly before,” Ashraf said.
Before announcing the nomination, Ashraf told the media that the party had taken an “excellent decision”, reaffirming that the PPP “remains committed to the people of Kashmir”.
“Right now, we want to ease their hardships and pave the way for the next elections,” he said.
Chaudhry echoed similar thoughts, stating that the generations of party leaders had “always taken a strong stance on Kashmir”.
Before making the announcement, Chaudhry said, “We have the required number (in the legislative assembly), I feel that we have the golden number.”
Ashraf told the media that PPP was the “largest parliamentary party (in the legislative assembly) and we have the support of our allies.”
He expressed confidence that his party “is in the position to form the government,” noting that they had the required “strength.”
He continued: “PPP will bring peace to Kashmir and ease their hardships; the promises made to the Action Committee will be fulfilled as well.”
On October 28, sources had told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Rathore and Sardar Yaqub were under consideration for the top slot.
Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister.
Who is Faisal Rathore?
A senior figure in PPP’s AJK chapter, Rathore has long been associated with the region’s politics.
Born on April 11, 1978, in Rawalpindi, he is the son of the late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, a former AJK prime minister who also served as senior minister, leader of the opposition and speaker of the Legislative Assembly at various stages of his political career.
His mother, Begum Farhat Rathore, belonged to a migrant family from Indian-occupied Kashmir; she was a member of the state legislature and headed the PPP Women’s Wing.
The Rathore family, based in AJK’s remote Haveli district, is regarded among the founding political families of the PPP in Azad Kashmir.
Rathore completed his early education in Rawalpindi and graduated from the University of the Punjab. After the death of his father, his elder brother Masood Mumtaz Rathore was elected to the AJK Legislative Assembly in 1999 for the remainder of the term.
He first entered electoral politics in 2006 from LA-17 Haveli Kahuta. He won his first assembly seat in the 2011 general elections on a PPP ticket and later served in the cabinet of then prime minister Chaudhry Abdul Majeed as minister for AJK Logging and Sawmills Corporation and minister for electricity.
In 2016, he was arrested in what was widely viewed as a politically motivated case but was subsequently exonerated.
The politician was appointed secretary general of the PPP AJK chapter on March 23, 2017, a position he continues to hold.
In the 2021 elections, he returned to the assembly and remained an active voice on the opposition benches.
In 2023, Rathore joined the coalition government led by Haq as minister for Local Government and Rural Development and was also tasked with heading the government’s negotiation committee with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee.
Known for his soft-spoken, conciliatory and non-controversial disposition, he is seen as a figure who maintains working relationships across political and administrative circles.
He has also worked in national media, hosting a regular programme on a private TV channel.
Within the PPP, he is considered a trusted confidant of Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Faryal Talpur and is viewed as a representative of the party’s ideological and middle-class cadre.</p><small>2025-11-14 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14202312a658856.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955074/ptis-jhagra-claims-he-was-stopped-from-travelling-to-us-at-peshawar-airport' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Jhagra claims he was stopped from travelling to US at Peshawar Airport</strong></a><br><p>The PTI’s Taimur Saleem Jhagra claimed on Friday that he was barred from clearing immigration and boarding his flight to the United States at Peshawar Airport.
The former KP finance minister said in a post on X that he was travelling to Washington, DC, to attend a debate at the Pakistan Conclave at Georgetown University, but could not clear immigration.
“At the airport, I was told my name was on the PNIL (Provisional National Identification List), and hence that my passport was inactive,” Jhagra wrote. “The FIA staff said they would have been unable to even comply with court orders, unless the computer system they had was updated with the status.”
He said there was a lack of transparency with the PNIL and questioned who can add and remove names from the list and for what purpose.
 






“I had written to [the] secretary [of] interior on November 4, anticipating this, and personally delivered the letter to the ministry. In ten days, I received no response,” Jhagra added.
“I also went to court, and even had a hearing in Peshawar High Court today, to highlight the absurdity of individuals buying tickets and booking travel, and then not being allowed to travel at a whim.”
According to Jhagra, the deputy attorney general was present at the hearing and when asked why Jhagra’s name was on the PNIL, he replied that the interior ministry could only explain in writing.
“At court, I saw at least two other MNAs also attempting to clear their names off the no-fly list, including [Sher Ali Arbab],” he wrote. “He was going to travel as part of a parliamentary delegation to COP30 in Brazil. Think of the amount of time wasted in courts on issues like this.”
“Ironically, I have exited the country and reentered at least six times since June 2024, without any issue, since I consult part-time. Since I last returned, I have not even violated a red light or a motorway speed limit,” he noted.
Jhagra added that while he was allowed to travel on a prior trip, his 18-year-old daughter had been unable to fly abroad for her studies as her name was added to the PNIL. In his post, he noted that the PHC stepped in, and her name was taken off the list.
“Certainly hoping that the future of democracy in Pakistan is bright at some point of time, but with all these muppets around, the present fate of democracy is pretty dark! And that is why we must fight for it!” he concluded.
Earlier this month, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was barred from travelling to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite directives from the Lahore High Court (LHC) allowing him to travel abroad.
According to an October 30 court order, the AML leader’s name had been removed from the Exit Control List (ECL), following involvement in several May 9 cases. The court had directed relevant authorities to allow him to travel.
However, in a video message posted on the social media platform X, Rashid alleged: “Today, I was stopped from going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite having permission from LHC’s Rawalpindi bench under Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan.”

The spokesperson was asked about the incident after a video of the interaction began circulating on social media. It was filmed during the World Travel Market event in London, which took place from November 4 to 6, 2025.
In the clip, Ilyas could be seen shaking hands with and conversing with an individual later identified as the Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Tourism, Michael Izhar-Kov.
A translation of Israeli journalist Rai Kais’ X post in Hebrew said: “As you may recall, Pakistan was recently mentioned as one of the countries that may join the international force in Gaza.”
 






However, London-based journalist Murtaza Ali Shah claimed in a post on X that “a group of individuals from Israel visited the Pakistan Pavilion unannounced and met the Pakistani delegation without introducing themselves.”
 






Asked during a weekly press briefing about the interaction, the FO spokesperson, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, said: “I have no information on this meeting. The gentleman you referred to is a public figure. I would request you to ask him about the meeting. I have no information on this.”
In a subsequent question on the matter, he said: “I have not seen the report or any information on a meeting of the adviser to the prime minister or any public figure with an Israeli representative. I can assure you that if such a meeting or interaction took place, it was, certainly, without authorisation by the government.”
The FO spokesperson was later asked about previous reports of alleged visits by Pakistani delegations, to which he said: “I can tell you with a certain assurance that they were not authorised or under information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If these individuals have violated any passport regulations pertaining to travel to a country disallowed on Pakistan passport, our authorities ought to look into it. I have no information, and I can tell you that these visits or these interactions with Israel are not authorised.”
 






Reacting to the video, former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan wrote on X, “Shaking hands with the killers of Palestinians is a betrayal of Al-Aqsa, Gaza, and the Palestinians. The handshake, meeting, and conversation during the international exhibition in London between Sardar Yasir Ilyas, Advisor to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Tourism, and Michael Izhar-Kov, Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Tourism.”
He added: “The visit of the Israeli director-general of tourism to the Pakistani pavilion — this is shameful, it is rubbing salt into the wounds of Pakistanis.
I condemn this in the strongest terms; the nation will not forgive the traitors of the Palestinian people.”
 






Renowned writer Fatima Bhutto chimed in: “Disgusting treason. Shaking hands dripping with the blood of Palestinians.”
 






Meanwhile, PTI leader and ex-human rights minister Shireen Mazari questioned: “It is not when it happened but how it happened!”
 






‘No decision on participation in Int’l Stabilisation Force’
The FO spokesperson was also asked about Pakistan’s participation in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. Last month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said that a decision on sending Pakistani troops for the Gaza peace force was still being finalised and was “in process”.
Today, the spokesperson said that “no decision has been taken as yet on Pakistan’s participation.”
“The exact role or mandate of the International Stabilisation Force itself is under discussion at the UN Security Council. I do not think a decision has been taken by the Security Council yet. So, this is an evolving process,” Andrabi clarified.
He continued: “We are engaged with it in a sense that Pakistan is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and is undertaking these negotiations as a Security Council member. So, we await the Security Council’s decision.
And as indicated earlier, Pakistan’s participation in the stabilisation force will be decision taken at the highest level, including through participation of the Parliament.“
Last month, Pakistan, in a joint statement with 14 other nations, condemned Tel Aviv’s attempt to impose “Israeli sovereignty” over the occupied West Bank, after the Israeli parliament passed bills on annexing the West Bank, according to FO.
A few days later, the information ministry had also denied claims of the country removing the clause from its passports that makes it invalid for travel to Israel.
Pakistan continues to maintain that it does not recognise Israel and steadfastly supports the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p><small>2025-11-14 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1422170493e5041.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955077/several-killed-as-stockholm-bus-slams-into-pedestrians' target='_blank'><strong>Several killed as Stockholm bus slams into pedestrians</strong></a><br><p>Several people were killed and others injured when a bus rammed into a bus stop queue in central Stockholm during Friday’s afternoon rush hour, police said.
Shortly after the crash, images in Swedish media showed a swarm of police, ambulances and emergency vehicles at the scene, with rescue crews crouched down along the underside of the double-decker bus, appearing to help people trapped underneath.
“There are both injured and deceased people in the incident. Police are for the moment not commenting on the number, gender or ages of the victims,” said a police statement.
Health authorities spokeswoman Michelle Marcher told AFP that two seriously injured people had been transported to the hospital.
Police spokesperson Nadya Norton said the cause of the accident was still unknown.
“The investigation will have to determine what happened. It’s too early to say and I don’t want to speculate,” she told AFP.
She said the bus driver had been arrested and a manslaughter investigation had been opened as a matter of routine.
“We need to question him, then we’ll see if he’s going to be released or detained,” Norton said.
Police received the first reports of the accident at 3:23pm (1423 GMT).
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.
“I have received the tragic news that several people have died and been injured at a bus stop in central Stockholm,” he wrote on X.
“People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones.”
 


‘Chaos’
A woman identified as Michelle Mac Key told the daily Expressen she stepped off another bus at the scene just after the accident happened.
“I crossed the road and saw the double-decker bus that had mowed down an entire bus stop queue,” she said.
People were screaming and trying to help the injured.
She said she saw both injured and dead people lying on the ground.
“There must have been more people under the bus,” she said.
A nurse by profession, she and another man, who was a doctor, offered their help to the police when they arrived.
“They told us to stand next to the dead bodies,” she said.
“I thought it was an exercise at first. That maybe they were dolls. It was so unreal. Chaos.”
Another woman who lives in the neighbourhood told daily Aftonbladet she heard a loud crash.
“I was lying in bed in my room, heard a loud crash and I heard several people scream. I ran to the window and saw a bus that had crashed and several people lying on the ground,” said the woman, who was not identified by name.
Two hours after the crash, a section of the busy Valhallavagen avenue was still blocked off.
Police technicians were working at the scene but emergency vehicles had left.</p><small>2025-11-14 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14201749971f620.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955073/health-ministry-who-warn-1-in-3-adults-are-affected-by-diabetes' target='_blank'><strong>Health ministry, WHO warn 1 in 3 adults are affected by diabetes</strong></a><br><p>The health ministry and the World Health Organisation warned on Friday that one in three adults in the country was affected by diabetes.
In a press release issued on World Diabetes Day, both warned that “diabetes affects 34.5 million people in Pakistan, including one in three adults. Pakistan has the highest diabetes burden globally — in percentage terms — and hosts more than 40 per cent of the total estimated cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.”
They said they were partnering to organise special diabetes screening activities in medical facilities, urging people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and encouraging the early detection of a “silent killer that can affect people of any age”.
 
 

The press release said that four in 10 people affected by diabetes in the region were not aware of it, increasing their risk of serious health complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
It added that Type 2 diabetes could be prevented and the consequences of all types of diabetes minimised or delayed by maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, detecting the disease early, seeking treatment when needed, avoiding tobacco and reducing sugar intake.
“Today, we observe World Diabetes Day to highlight the rising burden of diabetes in Pakistan. The Ministry of Health, through the Prime Minister’s Diabetes Programme, is promoting early detection, free screening and healthier lifestyles. I urge all citizens to know their risk, get tested and take simple steps like healthy eating and physical activity,” Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal was quoted as saying in the press release.
Meanwhile, WHO representative and Head of Mission in Pakistan Dr Luo Dapeng said: “Diabetes is a silent killer, but we can all do our part to protect ourselves and our families by adopting a healthy lifestyle and regular medical checkups.
“Prevention is always the best cure, and WHO will stand with Pakistan and its people to combat a disease that can be prevented or minimised through early detection and timely treatment.”
The press release concluded that globally, the number of people living with diabetes rose from 200m in 1990 to 830m in 2022, adding that the disease was rising more rapidly in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.</p><small>2025-11-14 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14214217a9151d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955075/rna-recovered-from-siberian-mammoth-that-died-39000-years-ago' target='_blank'><strong>RNA recovered from Siberian mammoth that died 39,000 years ago</strong></a><br><p>Scientists have recovered the oldest-known RNA, a molecule necessary for most biological functions, from a woolly mammoth that inhabited Siberia about 39,000 years ago, showing it can last longer than previously known and promising a new path for studying organisms that lived long ago.
The RNA, successfully isolated and sequenced, was extracted from muscle tissue in the left front leg of a juvenile male mammoth, perhaps five to 10 years old, whose carcass was discovered in 2010 in the Siberian permafrost in the Russian Far East along the Oyogos Yar coast bordering the Laptev Sea.
The mammoth, given the name Yuka, represents one of the best-preserved frozen carcasses of this extinct species. Its RNA, among other things, revealed which genes had been “turned on” in Yuka’s tissue around the time of death, showing signs of cell stress.
Most knowledge about prehistoric organisms comes from studying skeletal fossils, but there is a limit to what these can reveal about their biology. The growing ability to recover telltale biomolecules from ancient remains, however, has offered new ways to understand such organisms.
The new RNA achievement complements advances in recent years in the study of ancient DNA, the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for all living organisms, and ancient proteins, the molecules that build and run much of a cell’s machinery.
RNA, short for ribonucleic acid, serves as the messages sent from an organism’s genome to its cellular machinery, telling cells which genes to activate or deactivate, how and when to regulate their function and which proteins to make.
“With RNA, you can access the actual biology of the cell or tissue happening in real time within the last moments of life of the organism,” said Emilio Mrmol, a geneticist, veterinarian and bioinformatician at the University of Copenhagen’s Globe Institute, lead author of the study published on Friday in the journal Cell.
“This gives us direct access to the functional landscape of the cell metabolism of woolly mammoths when they were alive, something that is not possible, at least not in the lengths we report, just by using DNA or proteins. Adding this layer of information provides a more comprehensive view to the biology of woolly mammoths,” Mrmol said.
RNA is more fragile than DNA and proteins. The oldest DNA recovered to date was from animals, plants and microbes dating to about 2 million years ago from sediment in Greenland. The oldest proteins came from dental remains of a hornless rhinoceros that lived about 23 million years ago in the Canadian High Arctic.
Until now, the oldest RNA recovered was from a wolf cub that lived in Siberia about 14,000 years ago.
“I think the key finding is that we can recover RNA from such an old sample. It’s a proof of principle that opens the door for much more detailed analyses of gene expression patterns in Ice Age megafauna,” said geneticist and study co-author Love Daln of Stockholm University and the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden.
Yuka experienced trauma before death, with deep cuts on its hide indicating an attack by a cave lion, an extinct species that was a cold-adapted and bulkier cousin of today’s African lion.
“None of the marks are severe enough to have caused the death, so it is still a bit unclear why Yuka died,” Daln said.
The researchers detected RNA molecules in Yuka that code for proteins involved in muscle contraction and metabolic regulation under stress, possibly but not necessarily stemming from this attack.
Scientists long thought RNA degrades mere minutes or hours after death, but this study and others showed that under the right circumstances, it can survive much longer. The frigid conditions of Siberia were particularly conducive to RNA preservation.
Yuka’s DNA has also been sequenced by these researchers and others previously. Previously thought to have been female, the genetic data showed that Yuka, which stood about 5-1/4 feet (1.6 meters) at the shoulder, was male, with an X and a Y chromosome.
The researchers believe that under the right conditions, RNA can be recovered from even older remains, noting that ancient RNA offers numerous possibilities.
“We hope our work elicits a renewed interest in exploring RNA in other old remains, not necessarily from the Ice Age or extinct species, but also from medieval or historical remains of both extinct and extant organisms,” Mrmol said.</p><small>2025-11-14 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/141517507571a1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955058/no-mention-of-27th-amendment-in-sc-full-court-meeting-called-after-judges-letters-to-cjp-yahya' target='_blank'><strong>No mention of 27th Amendment in SC full court meeting called after judges’ letters to CJP Yahya</strong></a><br><p>There was no discussion on the 27th Amendment in a full court meeting called by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Friday, according to a Supreme Court (SC) press release.
It was reported a day ago that after a series of letters seeking a full court meeting on the contentious amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday, the CJP called one today.
According to the press release issued after the meeting, the participants “unanimously updated the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 on the recommendation of the committee, comprising Hon’ble Justice Shahid Waheed, Hon’ble Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Hon’ble Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Hon’ble Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, constituted under Rule 1(4) of Order I of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 for removal of difficulties arising in giving effect to its provisions”.
It said the meeting extended “sincere appreciation to each member of the committee individually for undertaking such a massive task of meticulously reviewing the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, drafting the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 and addressing the suggestions thereon for removal of difficulties”.
“The updated Supreme Court Rules, 2025, are to improve service delivery and ensure inexpensive and expeditious administration of justice,” it added.
Moreover, the full court meeting also unanimously approved the grant of the status of senior advocate of the Supreme Court to Muhammad Munir Paracha — who was an advocate of the SC until now —  in terms of Rule 5 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
Letters by SC judges
Yesterday, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar became the third judge SC to request a full court to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary.
“From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”.
Before the bill for the constitutional amendment was passed, Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah — both of whom tendered their resignations yesterday following the enactment of the 27th Amendment — had written separate letters to the CJP, asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference to discuss the constitutional tweaks.
In a six-page letter, Justice Shah described the amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges.
“You (CJP) act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance.
Separately, in a seven-page letter, Justice Minhallah said: “I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.
“A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning.”
He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”.
Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, in a letter endorsed by ex-judges, had also asked the CJP to take a stand on the matter.</p><small>2025-11-14 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14172530f1ecfb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955063/ttap-vows-vigorous-protest-for-restoration-of-constitution' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP vows ‘vigorous protest’ for restoration of Constitution</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday vowed to vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution to its original form in the wake of the passage of the contentious 26th and 27th amendments.
President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Thursday, enacting it into law. The TTAP had already ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the am­­end­ment since Sunday and urged the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
While the 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their vote as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) had also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
In a post on X today, the TTAP said it was holding an emergency meeting at the residence of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.
In attendance were Qaiser, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and others, including Zain Ali Shah, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Ali Asghar Khan, Hussain Akhwandzada, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Shaukat Basra.
 






The members of the meeting later gathered and chanted slogans against the post-amendment Constitution and dictatorship and in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan and democracy.
 






In a press release issued after the meeting, the alliance said: “TTAP reiterates its resistance and struggle against these unconstitutional amendments and will vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution in its original form and demands that the Constitution be restored in its original form.”
 






It said the amendments were against the basic structure of the Constitution and an attack on a fundamental pillar of democracy — the judiciary — that had subordinated the judiciary to the executive and “destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution” while introducing person-specific changes.
The TTAP said its leaders rejected the amendments and demanded that the Constitution be restored to its original form.
“These controversial constitutional amendments have completely destroyed the judiciary and limited the authority and existence of the Supreme Court,” the TTAP said.
It also hailed the resignations of Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah as resistance to the “robbery of the Constitution” and paid tribute to judges who upheld their constitutional oath.
Outlining the moves against the 27th amendment, the TTAP said MNAs and senators would march from the National Assembly to the Supreme Court on Monday, a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th amendment and MPAs would march from the Punjab Assembly to the Lahore High Court on Monday with lawyers participating as well.
The TTAP further announced observing next Friday as a ‘black day’ across the country.
In other announcements, the TTAP said it fully supported the declaration of the KP Peace Jirga and demanded its implementation; demanded the immediate release of Imran, his wife and incarcerated PTI leaders and workers, as well as the leadership and members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee.
The PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee previously suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, also voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Contentious bill
The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution took shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved.
In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that the government had sought his party’s support for the amendment.
Subsequently, the prime minister also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.</p><small>2025-11-14 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14185206427bec0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955072/pakistan-saudi-arabia-military-leaders-discuss-advancing-mutual-defence-pact' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia military leaders discuss advancing mutual defence pact</strong></a><br><p>Chief of General Staff (CGS) Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met his Saudi counterpart, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al-Rowaily, in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “matters of mutual strategic interest” were discussed during the meeting, including strengthening bilateral defence cooperation, enhancing interoperability and advancing collaboration under the mutual defence agreement.
“Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further deepening the long-standing fraternal ties between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, contributing towards regional peace, stability and self-reliance,” the ISPR said.
The ISPR added that a special meeting of the Pakistan-KSA Bilateral Defence Industrial Forum was also held in Riyadh. Pakistan’s tri-services delegation was led by Lt Gen Raza, while Khalid Al Biyari, Assistant Minister of Defence for Executive Affairs, led the Saudi delegation.
“During the bilateral meet, both sides reviewed the progress of ongoing defence cooperation projects and discussed new avenues for joint ventures in emerging technologies in line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030,” the statement read.
“CGS reaffirmed Pakistan’s continued support for the capacity building of the Royal Saudi Defence Forces,” the ISPR added. “[The] Saudi leadership appreciated Pakistan’s commitments, achievements and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and vital contributions to regional peace and stability.”
In mid-September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.”</p><small>2025-11-14 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/142000002619b0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955065/president-zardari-accepts-resignations-of-sc-judges-mansoor-ali-shah-and-athar-minallah' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari accepts resignations of SC judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari has accepted the resignations of Supreme Court judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, a post on the President’s official X account said on Friday.
 






The two judges had handed in their resignations yesterday, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by the president, describing the legislation as an affront to the judiciary and the 1973 Cons­titution.
 
 

“I therefore resign as the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, in full awareness of the reasons that compel it and in loyalty to the Constitution that has guided every step of my judicial life,” Justice Shah wrote in his 13-page resignation letter, issued in both English and Urdu. The letters were addressed to the president.
Justice Shah had described the amendment as a “grave assault on the Constitution” and said the 27th Amendment dismantled the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugated the judiciary to executive control and struck at the “very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
 
 

The amendment, he said, made justice “more distant, more fragile and more vulnerable to power”.
Justice Minallah, in his resignation letter, had regretted that the Constitution he had sworn to uphold and defend was “no more”.
“Much as I have tried to convince myself otherwise, I can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave,” he bemoaned.
Both judges had recently written to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, requesting a full court meeting to consider the amendment.
 
 

There was no discussion on the 27th Amendment in today’s full court meeting called by CJP Afridi, according to a Supreme Court (SC) press release, which also said that the meeting gave its final approval to the SC Rules, 2025.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif criticised the two Supreme Court judges today for tendering their resignations, saying their “consciences only awakened after their monopoly was curtailed”.</p><small>2025-11-14 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1418154122e9577.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955069/indias-modi-celebrates-as-party-set-for-big-win-in-bihar-state-vote' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi celebrates as party set for big win in Bihar state vote</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed a “resounding” victory for his party and its allies in a key local election in the country’s poorest state of Bihar.
The eastern state of 130 million people was widely seen as a bellwether and a test of Modi’s ability to translate New Delhi’s booming economy into gains for its poorest citizens.
Counting is still ongoing and the final tally may not be out until Saturday, but the election commission said partial results and projections suggested a solid majority for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies in the state assembly.
Modi called the win a “victory of good governance”.
“This resounding public mandate will empower us to serve the people and work with new resolve for Bihar,” he said in a post on social media.
 






Bihar is the only state in the Hindi-speaking north where Modi’s party has never ruled alone.
This time too, it is unlikely to secure a majority by itself but appears set to emerge as the single largest party ahead of its alliance partner, Janata Dal (United).
Together with smaller allies, they are on course to secure at least three-quarters of
the state legislature’s 243 seats, according to figures from the election commission.
The election outcome can boost Modi and his party ahead of other key regional polls next year, analysts say.

The Jordanian monarch’s last visit to Pakistan was at the invitation of former president Mamnoon Hussain. Two memoranda of understanding were signed by both nations, with one related to cooperation in civil protection and defence and the other to cooperation in the housing sector.
According to the FO, Saturday’s high-level visit reflects the “longstanding, fraternal relations” between Islamabad and Amman.
“It will serve to further strengthen the strategic direction of Pakistan–Jordan relations and place them on a higher trajectory, encompassing a comprehensive and broad-based partnership in the political, economic, and cultural spheres,” the statement read.
 






“During his visit … King Abdullah II … will hold important meetings with the president and the prime minister of Pakistan,” the statement added. “The full range of bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries will be discussed.”
The FO further said that a special investiture ceremony to confer the highest civilian award upon the king will also take place at the Presidency.
“The visit of … King Abdullah II … will further consolidate the longstanding Pakistan–Jordan relationship and contribute to expanding the scope and spectrum of bilateral cooperation between the two brotherly countries,” the statement concluded.
In late October, King Abdullah II lauded the Pakistani military’s contributions to regional peace and security in a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, according to the military’s media wing.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief was on an official visit to Jordan and called on the Jordanian king for a meeting, with Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II also present.
“His majesty appreciated the professionalism and contributions of the Pakistan Armed Forces towards regional peace and stability and expressed his desire to further strengthen defence collaboration between the two brotherly countries,” the ISPR said, adding that the army chief conveyed warm regards from Pakistan’s people, government and military.</p><small>2025-11-14 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14144721fba3782.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955057/pakistan-will-not-hold-talks-with-any-terrorist-group-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not hold talks with any terrorist group: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi asserted on Friday that Pakistan had never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul but would not hold talks with any terrorist groups.
The spokesperson’s speech came in the context of the third round of talks that concluded on November 7 in Istanbul between Pakistan and Afghanistan, aimed at ending cross-border terrorism and consolidating a fragile ceasefire that was initially agreed upon after border clashes last month.
Since the skirmishes, representatives of the two countries held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement could not be achieved. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that a ceasefire, however, was still in place “for the time being”.
“Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul. However, Pakistan will not hold dialogue with any terrorist groups, be it Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA),” he said while addressing his weekly press briefing.
“The third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime concluded on November 7 in Istanbul,” he said, expressing appreciation for the “sincere efforts” of mediating countries Qatar and Turkiye.
“Since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil on Pakistan. Throughout these years, Pakistan — despite suffering military and civilian casualties — exercised maximum restraint and did not escalate,” he said.
He added that Pakistan expected that with the passage of time, the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the banned TTP.
He said that during this time, Pakistan also tried to positively engage with the Afghan Taliban regime, offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan, the response from the Taliban regimes has only been hollow promises and inaction,” he regretted.
He said that the TTP and the BLA were declared enemies of Pakistan.
“Anyone harbouring, abetting or financing them is not considered a friend and a well-wisher of Pakistan and its people,” he said.
“Pakistan is determined to take every possible action to safeguard its security and the security of its people. We regret that the Taliban regime is constantly trying to misrepresent the issue of terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“Taliban regime is also trying to portray TTP and BLA as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee crisis but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees,” he said.
“Pakistan is ready to receive any Pakistani living in Afghanistan … provided they are handed over at the border crossing … and not hurled across the border fully equipped with sophisticated weapons and equipment,” he said.
The FO spokesperson also stated that some elements in the Afghan Taliban did not want confrontation with Pakistan, but there was a “strong lobby” with monetary support from foreign actors that had been tasked to “stoke tension”.
“These elements have been engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan, and in doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had,” he said.
“Some elements in the Taliban regime are also trying to propagate that there is some disagreement within Pakistan over its Afghan policy. This is misleading. There is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that ordinary people are the biggest victims of terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan,” he said.
“The armed forces of Pakistan are making sacrifices to safeguard the lives and properties of the people of Pakistan. Therefore, the entire nation stands with its armed forces to safeguard the interests of Pakistan and the lives of the people,” he said.
Andrabi also said that some elements within the Afghan Taliban regime were “trying to instigate Pashtun nationalism in Pakistan.”
“It is a historical fact that Pashtuns in Pakistan are a vibrant part of society and state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of public life and civil society. More Pashtuns live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan; therefore, instead of instigating Pashtunism in Pakistan, it would be wise for the Taliban regime to look into its own credentials,” he said.
The FO spokesperson added that with the “evidence-based and well-documented sharp rise in terrorism emanating from Afghanistan into Pakistan after August 2021, the Taliban regime can neither deny the reality nor absolve itself of its responsibility”.
“While the Afghan Taliban declare terrorism and Pakistan an internal issue, they fail to mention that there are people within Afghanistan who have issued fatwas, legitimising terrorist attacks against Pakistan. Moreover, terrorist groups operating inside Pakistan now comprise a large no. of Afghan nationals.
He said that Pakistan remained committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue; however, Pakistan’s core concerns, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needed to be addressed “first and foremost.”</p><small>2025-11-14 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1410004555d3f5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955036/us-announces-new-military-operation-in-latin-america' target='_blank'><strong>US announces new military operation in Latin America</strong></a><br><p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Thursday a military operation to “remove narco-terrorists,” amid growing concerns that a US naval build-up in Latin American waters could presage land strikes and a wider conflict.
“Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth posted on social media platform X.
“This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,” he said.
 






The post gave no details of what the operation would entail or how it might differ from military actions already being undertaken.
President Donald Trump’s administration is conducting a military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, deploying naval and air forces for what it calls an anti-drugs offensive.
US forces have carried out strikes on about 20 vessels in international waters in the region since early September, killing at least 76 people, according to US figures.
Asked for clarification on the precise nature of Operation Southern Spear, a Pentagon spokesperson simply referred inquiries back to Hegseth’s post on X.
CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land.
Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region.
Caracas fears the deployment, which also includes F-35 stealth warplanes sent to Puerto Rico and six US Navy ships in the Caribbean, is a regime change plot in disguise.
New US strike on alleged drug boat kills four in Caribbean
US forces have struck another alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, upping the death toll in the contentious anti-narcotics campaign to 80, US media reports said on Thursday.
This week’s reported strike took the toll to 80 deaths in 20 strikes in international waters.
 


The timing of the strike was not clear, with broadcaster CBS reporting the boat was destroyed on Monday and The New York Times reporting the strike took place on Wednesday, both citing an unnamed Pentagon official.
The Pentagon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-11-14 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14161201a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955060/phc-bars-kp-govt-from-employing-official-vehicles-for-personal-or-political-use' target='_blank'><strong>PHC bars KP govt from employing official vehicles for ‘personal or political use’</strong></a><br><p>The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday imposed a ban on the use of government resources, such as vehicles, by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for personal or political use.
According to a court order available with Dawn, the provincial administration was banned from using official vehicles without authorisation, stating that it amounted to “misconduct and abuse of authority”.
“This court is of the view that the use of official vehicles, machinery, or any other government resources for participation in, or facilitation of, political gatherings, protest rallies, or long marches constitutes a blatant misuse of public property and authority,” the PHC ruled.
The order added that this practice was not only violating public trust but also undermining the concept of neutral governance.
“Public resources, including official vehicles and heavy machinery, are procured and maintained from the public exchequer for the sole purpose of performing official duties and providing services to the citizens in accordance with law,” the order read.
“Their diversion for political or extraneous purposes, whether directly or indirectly, undermines the sanctity of the public office and shakes public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the administration,” it added, further stating that nobody holding public office can employ government resources for partisan or personal use.
The PHC ruled that Articles 4 (right of individuals to be dealt with in accordance with law), 5 (loyalty to state and obedience to Constitution and law) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution imply that public resources cannot be used by any one party or individual  “to the disadvantage of others”.
“In a democratic system governed by the rule of law, the state must maintain strict separation between official functions and political activities,” the order read. “The use of government vehicles or personnel in political events conveys an impression of state endorsement or complicity in partisan matters, which is impermissible.”
The PHC ordered the KP government to ensure that “no official vehicle, machinery, or manpower under their control is deployed, used, or permitted to be used for any protest, long march, rally, or political activity of any nature”.
Last November, a petition was filed against the KP government, led by then-chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, against the use of government vehicles like fire engines during the PTI’s long march to Islamabad.
The petition stated that the provincial government had used government resources such as fire engines and heavy machinery from the local government department that government officials had been mobilised to join their march.
During the march, protesters gathered at D-Chowk to demand PTI founder Imran Khan’s release, among other things, amid reports of intense tear gas shelling by security forces to curtail the large crowds. Clashes between party supporters and police ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone.

Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah handed in their resignations, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday.
Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly today, Asif accused the judges of having “selective amnesia”, saying that they had “forgotten their past” and were now becoming “guardians of democracy”.
“Four to five years ago — in fact, eight to 10 years ago — when the process to remove Nawaz Sharif from his post started, I want to tell you about the history of our SC judges at that time. The conspiracy created against Nawaz before that and the role our judiciary played in turning that conspiracy into reality,” Asif said, amid chants of ‘kon bachayega Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan’ [who will save Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan] by the opposition.
“The entire process started with the Panama case when Chief Justice Saqib Nisar formed two benches that deemed Nawaz ineligible to hold office,” Asif said, adding that the bench included Justices Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Ejaz Afzal, Gulzar Ahmed, and Ijazul Ahsan.
“After Nawaz was declared ineligible, another bench was created to decide the duration of the ineligibility,” the defence minister said.
He highlighted that under the supervision of Justice Nisar, a bench comprising Justices Umar Ata Bandial, Ijazul Ahsan, and Sajjad Ali Shah, decided that ineligibility will be life-long.
“Then another bench was formed, also supervised by Justice Nisar, which declared that no ineligible person can become the leader of a political party,” Asif added. He said in almost every political lawsuit, the same few judges were witnessed thereafter.
“When these kangaroo courts were being formed, Nawaz was being victimised, and an agenda was being implemented that he would not remain a leader and would be expelled from politics forever; at that time, no one felt any shame,” the minister said, referring to the resignations of Justices Shah and Minallah following the passage of the 27th Amendment by the parliament.
“These judges from yesterday were serving in SC and high courts back then; now they’re writing poetry and issuing political statements,” referring to a poem Justice Shah added to his resignation letter.
According to Asif, the judges’ “conscience awakened because their monopoly in SC was curtailed.”
The minister added that the amendment in question sought to establish the superiority of the Constitution.
Referring to the opposition, he said that they chant ‘Khan nahi tou Pakistan nahi’ [if there is no Khan, there is no Pakistan], which was proof that they don’t stand with the Constitution of Pakistan but instead with a single person.
“These people have become protectors of terrorists; people who come from across the border and do murder and destruction here,” Asif said, assailing the opposition for not condemning the attacks in Wana and Islamabad.
Resignation letters
In his letter to the president yesterday, Justice Shah had assailed the 27th Amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
“By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote.
“As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed — but not before leaving deep institutional scars.”
The judge had stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation.
On the other hand, Justice Minallah had stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order.
“I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added.
Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”.
“What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote.
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation had come hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had said 64 votes were cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate yesterday to consider the latest changes.
The 27th Amendment promised, on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.
At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters</p><small>2025-11-14 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1412243913983fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955041/govt-says-4-ttp-terrorists-arrested-for-involvement-in-islamabad-suicide-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says 4 TTP terrorists arrested for involvement in Islamabad suicide attack</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were arrested for their involvement in the suicide blast in Islamabad earlier this week, the government said on Friday.
“In a joint operation conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Division and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), four members of the TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij terrorist cell involved in the suicide attack at the Judicial Complex G-11, Islamabad have been apprehended,” the government said in a post on social media platform X.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
 






The government said that during the investigation, the handler of the suicide bomber, identified as Sajidullah alias Sheena, confessed that TTP Commander Saeedur Rehman alias Daadullah contacted him through the Telegram app to carry out a suicide attack in Islamabad to cause maximum casualties of law enforcement agencies.
The government said that the TTP commander sent pictures of the suicide bomber, identified as Usman alias Qari, for Sheena to recieve him. It further said that on the directives of the TTP commander, Sheena collected a suicide jacket from a graveyard in Peshawar and brought it to Islamabad.
On the day of the blast, the handler “set the suicide jacket” on the suicide bomber, the government added.
“The network was handled and guided at every step by the Fitna al-Khawarij/TTP high command based in Afghanistan. The entire cell involved in the incident, including its commander and three other members, has been arrested,” the government said.
“Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it added.
At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured as a bomb blast ripped through the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on Tuesday. The blast occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the sixth Margalla Dialogue.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said earlier that the bomber was “not a Pakistani national”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the blast was “related to Afghanistan”.
The incident in Islamabad had come the same week as an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.</p><small>2025-11-14 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14130304477fa06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955044/following-na-approval-senate-also-passes-bill-for-resetting-coas-munirs-tenure-after-appointment-as-cdf' target='_blank'><strong>Following NA approval, Senate also passes bill for resetting COAS Munir’s tenure after appointment as CDF</strong></a><br><p>The Senate swiftly passed four bills related to the recently approved contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Friday, including one that seeks changes to the Army Act and resets the tenure of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir after his appointment as the chief of the defence forces (CDF).
As explained by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly (NA) yesterday, this means that the five-year tenure of the chief of the defence forces would commence from the date of his notification of the appointment.
The four bills were passed by the Senate today — a day after their hurried passage in the National Assembly — without debate and with little resistance from the opposition.
Apart from the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025, the bills also included the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025, the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025, and the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar tabled the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif until he joined the session.
Asif presented the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025 when he arrived in the house. After him, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Law Minister Tarar.
As Dar began presenting the bills, he explained that the bill sought changes to the relevant laws in line with the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday.
The passage of the Amendment, which has paved the way for the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and changes to the military leadership structure, has been heavily criticised by the opposition.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the Amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
But, little resistance by the opposition to the passage of the four bills in the Senate was witnessed today.
What are the changes?
The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill seeks to replace the expression “chief of the army staff” with “chief of the defence forces” as per the 27th Amendment. Similarly, it suggests replacing the “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee” (CJCSC) with the “commander of the Natio­nal Strategic Command”.
Another important amendment to Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act 1952 says that “provided that for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces under paragraph (a) of Clause 4 of the Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
Another amendment regarding the appointment of commander of the National Strategic Command says, “The prime minister may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces, appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command, from amongst generals in the Pakistan Army, for a tenure of three years.”
The proposed amendment also authorises the prime minister to “reappoint the commander…for additional tenure of three years and/or extend the tenure(s)…up to three years” on the recommendations of the chief of the defence forces.
It further says that “the appointment, reappointment or extension of the commander of the National Strategic Command, or the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.
Another amendment reads that “the federal government may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces and by order in writing, authorise the officer appointed as vice chief of the army staff or deputy chief of the army staff to exercise and perform such of the powers and functions vested in the chief of the army staff under any law, rules, regulations, orders or instructions for the time being in force as may be so specified”.
Meanwhile, amendments to the air force and navy laws include the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.
The amendment to the Supreme Court law paves the way for the elimination of the Constitutional Bench, which was formed under the 26th Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:38</small></div><hr>
