The application said the Adiala Jail authorities, particularly the superintendent, have consistently violated IHC’s earlier orders to provide facilities to Mr Khan in accordance with the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.
Filed through counsels Chaud­hry Zaheer Abbas and Muhammad Usman Riaz Gill, the petition stated despite IHC’s directives and the Punjab government’s notification, jail officials have failed to ensure better facilities based on Mr Khan’s social and political standing.
The petition detailed various grievances, including the denial of visits by family, friends and legal counsel, disconnection from electronic and print media, restriction of phone contact with his sons abroad, and hindrance in accessing personal medical care and clothing.

Local judge issues notice to Adiala SP for not allowing ex-PM’s calls with sons

It also alleged deliberate electricity cuts to Mr Khan’s jail cell and instances of solitary confinement, describing them as tactics to pressure him politically.
Mr Khan, 73, claimed he served Pakistan as an international cricketer, philanthropist and as the country’s 22nd prime minister. Therefore, the denial of his lawful entitlements was not only unconstitutional but also a violation of human dignity and natural justice.
The petition requested the high court to appoint a gazetted officer to oversee the implementation of better facilities and submit weekly reports to ensure transparency and accountability.
The Islamabad High Court is expected to take up the matter in the coming days.
Adiala SP put on notice
In a related development, Spe­cial Judge Shahrukh Arjumand has issued a notice to the Adiala Jail superintendent.
The notice was issued in a contempt of court case for allegedly defying orders regarding WhatsApp call facilities and medical examinations of detainees.
During the hearing, lawyers Zaheer Abbas, Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry and others appeared before the court on behalf of Mr Khan.
They claimed the jail authorities had “blatantly violated” the court’s directives.
The petition stated the court had earlier ordered medical check-ups and permission for WhatsApp calls between Mr Khan and his sons. But the jail administration didn’t comply with the orders.
The lawyers argued the jail authorities’ refusal to conduct Mr Khan’s medical examinations amounted to “deliberate disobedience of judicial orders”.
The counsel contended the actions of the jail superintendent amounted to contempt and fell under Sections 177 and 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which deal with disobedience to lawful orders of public servants and furnishing false information, respectively.
“The jail authorities did not merely delay the implementation of the court’s order, they refused it outright, thereby challenging the authority of the judiciary,” the counsel argued.
Taking notice of the alleged violation, the court ordered the jail superintendent to submit a written response and adjourned the hearing till July 24.

According to the PM Office, the Mr Sharif spoke to the Balochistan CM on Monday, stressing that no one was above the law and instructed that those responsible should be brought to justice.
Meanwhile, a number of PPP lawmakers have submitted an adjournment motion to the National Assembly Secretariat on Monday, seeking a debate on the brutal killing of a man and woman  in Balochistan, in the name of so-called ‘honour’.
The motion demanded that the regular business of the House be adjourned for the purpose of discussing the barbaric killing .

PM, National Party condemn double murder, seek action against those responsible

Such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life, it said.
The motion urged the House to condemn the crime in the strongest possible terms and urged the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government to obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested and prosecuted without delay.
The adjournment motion carried the signatures of MNAs Shazia Marri, Raja Pervez Ashraf, Shahida Rehmani, Mehreen Razzaq Bhutto, Agha Rafiullah and others.
Meanwhile, the National Party has also condemned the killing  and demanded the government to take strict measures to prevent such incidents in future.
In a statement, Ayub Malik, president of the party’s Punjab, said it was very unfortunate that the incident happened weeks ago and authorities turned a blind eye to this.
“The way they were executed clearly indicates that there is the rule of jungle in parts of Balochistan, and it also shows that the culprits have a strong sense of impunity,” the statement said.
Mr Malik demanded that all those involved in these heinous killings should be arrested and punished in accordance with the law.
“In addition to that, the government should strictly implement the ruling of the Supreme Court that declared the Jirga system illegal in the past,” the NP leader said.
He said the government should also ensure that the culprits do not invoke the articles of law related to blood money to avoid punishment. In many such cases, blood money law is invoked, or culprits are simply pardoned.

Khan administration bans night travel to Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>DERA GHAZI KHAN: The district administration of Dera Ghazi Khan on Monday imposed a new security measure under which all traffic is prohibited from entering Balochistan at night, with all public and private veh­icles halted at border che­ckpoints from 5pm ­­till next morning.
From now on, traffic will only be allowed to cross into Balochistan during daylight hours to prevent any untoward incidents, officials said.
The directive by Deputy Commissioner and Chair­man Regional Transport Authority Muhammad Us­­man Khalid’s applies to the major border crossings at Sakhi Sarwar and Bawata.
“The protection of citizens’ lives and property is the top priority, and security measures are being made more effective and comprehensive,” he said.
 
 

The move comes as part of a broader security enh­ancement in the region following the killing of ni­­ne bus passengers, all from Punjab, in Balochistan.
In addition to the nighttime travel ban, a formal notification outlined several other protocols.
Officials will conduct video recordings of drivers and passengers on all public transport vehicles at bus terminals before they depart.
Furthermore, vehicles will travel under strict se­­cu­rity in protected convoys.
The directive also mandates that all public transport vehicles be equipped with active CCTV cameras, GPS tracking, and emerge­ncy panic alarms to ensure a swift response in any crisis.
Mr Khalid said that officials have been instructed to provide all necessary facilities to passengers and transport operators who will have to wait overnight at the checkpoints.

It’s what the party does, in or out of power — when Imran Khan is free and available to all his followers, or when he is locked up and his access is controlled by those who are wishing for an implosion. But this time around, the fight is less in the second tier, which appears to be stuck forever in the Mean Girls film, and has brought the party’s workers in direct confrontation with the bullies in the schoolyard.
The party workers include Irfan Saleem, who was nominated for a Senate ticket when the elections were to be held first. Back then, the PTI had clawed an election victory from what it assumed was the jaws of the establishment, and was in the mood to celebrate its workers and their spirit. But once the party won power in KP, it embarked upon a quick journey to cynical power politics.
A year later, with the party comfortably ensconced in Peshawar — with cars, offices, homes and some modicum of safety — no one wanted to rock the boat. This included ensuring that those who make it to the Senate were also in the mood for enjoying the boat ride. So began the effort to put together a less offensive list, with bland names and a few fat cats.
While the party kept telling the aam awam that Khan would make the final decision, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and those around him scrounged around for a few new names. The former may roar and dash across mountains in the pitch dark, but he is helming the boat everyone is cruising in. He isn’t going to risk the ire of those who matter. Khan can be handled.

The KP CM isn’t going to risk the ire of those who matter. Imran Khan can be handled.

Enter vanilla would-be senators such as Faisal Javed and Noor ul Haq Qadri and (drum roll) Mirza Afridi, who had quit the party after May 9 but has been accepted back with open arms — at a time when Fawad Chaudhry’s return is not possible because ‘he quit when the party was in trouble’ and Zubair Umer can’t be welcomed. But for Afridi, anything is possible.
As an aside, none of the parties need any debate or discussion over the fat cats. Talha Mehmood switched sides from the JUI-F to PPP, with little clarity about why he left one and why the other embraced him. The likes of Dilawar Khan are loved universally like Shahrukh Khan — parties, politicians and the ones whose advice he is rumoured to heed. And we have become so used to this phenomenon that no one wonders why it is terrible for individual parliamentarians to sell their votes but not for a party to shun people such as Farhatullah Babar or Irfan Saleem and award tickets to Richie Rich.
To prove this, Gandapur took the parliamentary party to a dinner at Afridi’s place in Lahore and the party followed him, apparently as clueless as the JUI-F MPAs who voted for the mines and minerals bill in the Balochistan Assembly. Parliamentarians in Pakistan are generally so innocent and Peter Pan-like that they can be herded to dinners and convinced to vote for unread bills. No wonder the country is witnessing a governance mess.
The dinner didn’t go down that well with the workers, though, and the chief minister, who now enjoys as much credibility in the party as does Prince Andrew in the royal family, needed more than a free meal to make the new list more palatable to the party. As a result, Barrister Saif was sent to Adiala, where doors opened smoothly — just as the cave opened for Ali Baba. The man, who will surely be minister for defence or interior when the PTI returns to power, was able to convince Khan of the importance of the new list and get his approval.
But then, Saif has even less credibility than the chief minister, and the workers who had the original tickets refused to back down till most of them were pressured to do so on Sunday evening. This included Irfan Saleem, whose dedication to the party has made him a household name even outside KP.
The entire incident has once again highlighted the growing disconnect between parliament and the people. Neither the political parties nor the ones controlling from behind the scenes realise that a completely hostage parliament, which is not interested in even pretending to represent the people, will not help stablise matters but aggravate it. Every party and every party man or woman who has made it to parliament (and this includes the PTI) is now desperate to avoid being targeted and is willing to do the establishment’s bidding.
No one wants to face jail, cases or worse. This fear is what Gandapur has been using to suppress dissent in the PTI in the absence of Imran Khan; no one wants to get on the wrong side of the KP chief minister because the rest of the country is even more of a threat and in Peshawar, there are comfortable official residences one can shelter in.
In turn, this allows the powers that be to manage the country without as much suppression as they would have to use otherwise.
But on the flip side, it is also creating instability at a level where it may not be too obvious. Fighting for their own survival, the politicians no longer care for easing the burden on the people — be it in terms of better economic policies (rather than backbreaking taxes) or allowing genuine party representatives to make it to parliament. And if parliament or the political process will not allow any space to the people, the latter will be left with no choice but to turn to demonstrations, agitation or worse.

This trio, Pew said, was an anomaly in a 24-nation study that spanned Western democracies and selected Asian and African nations, most of which expressed widespread disapproval of the Israeli state. Such surveys are almost always conducted in a language or a format that leans on the middle classes to provide what passes for national opinion almost always without consulting any segment of the masses.
The survey says the prevailing global sentiment was largely shaped by the Israeli military assault on Gaza. “India’s relatively positive perception of Israel is not merely a geopolitical fluke but rather the outcome of a deepening strategic and ideological alignment.” Israel, the survey says, has consistently stood by India in moments of crisis, most notably voicing unequivocal support for New Delhi in the recent war with Pakistan. Let’s also add that a good reason for the prevailing ‘Indian opinion’ lies in the country’s notoriously self-regarding and increasingly communal middle classes.
An earlier Pew survey during George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq showed how the US president was put in the doghouse by almost the entire world, including the US, Europe, Asia and Africa. The exception was India. So, it’s not just about Israel, rather it may have much to do with a resurfacing of a colonial mentality, with the middle classes orphaned by the demise of the Soviet Union. Bush was never so lionised by anyone, and he naturally looked overwhelmed when his host in New Delhi, prime minister Manmohan Singh, who, with a wave of his wand, created the post-Cold War middle classes, told him how much Indians loved him. In a word, the phenomenon of courting Israel and the US is an aspect of the middle class’s newfound love of Hindu nationalism.
That nationalism, embodied in the worldview of Hindutva, would be facing a decisive moment soon; not at home, but on the international stage. As it turns out, India will play host to the BRICS summit next year, for whose success it needs China’s unalloyed support. Many BRICS members are wary of India’s aloofness from the group’s major interests. They also detect its excessive yearning to keep the US in good humour come what may. As luck would have it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to be visiting China to attend the two-day 25th summit of the SCO, the increasingly powerful Shanghai club, which starts on Aug 31. Modi would be in a big quandary here, not least because Pakistan too would be there, as well as Iran. Words are going to be said about Israel as well as America, and Modi would be looking on helplessly. The thought of Pakistan and China in one group too would be a discomforting sight after the recent military stand-off in which China stood with Pakistan, and Israel with India.

That nationalism, embodied in the worldview of Hindutva, would be facing a decisive moment soon.

BRICS is a close cousin of SCO, and its Brazil summit saw a resolution strongly condemning Israeli brutalities in Gaza plus the war on Iran, issues on which Modi has mostly offered a studied silence. The world knows his loyalty lies with Benjamin Netanyahu even as it pretends there’s scope for change. However, ever since Netanyahu made the mistake of taking on Iran frontally in a 12-day war, the wreck it left Israeli cities in should be troubling Modi personally and Hindutva generally, if not making them see the world more objectively.
Modi’s unceasing discomfort with the anti-West perspective at BRICS is one thing. At the Brazil summit, India’s preference to name Pakistan in the context of terrorism was also summarily ignored. The quandary was not eased by the fact that within the rival group too, Donald Trump chose to invite Pakistan’s army chief for lunch and so shortly after he led Islamabad’s challenge to Modi’s Operation Sindoor. The lunch was naturally seen as a snub to India, given that Operation Sindoor was launched against Pakistan with expectations of changing the facts on the ground. That didn’t happen. The world condemned the terror outrage in Pahalgam but kept studiously aloof during the 12-day war.
Worse, Modi is already finding it difficult to convince his countrymen why India agreed to a ceasefire if, according to it, Trump did not bring it about. If the Indian objectives were not met in the war, why the ceasefire. And if they had been met, why the unending interval? These are some of the questions Indians are beginning to ask. They also want to know the truth of Trump’s latest claim that India lost a bunch of aircraft in the short, swift air battle against Pakistan. The issue has been grudgingly billed for discussion in the Indian parliament.
Will Modi’s balancing act between China-led BRICS and the US-led G7 survive the escalating heat? Despite Trump’s insults, Modi’s voluble foreign minister is seen as speaking more for Washington, D.C., than for an independent country’s independent foreign policy. There could be compelling factors at play in the quagmire, not least the corruption cases slapped by US agencies on tycoon Gautam Adani, in whose plane Modi had arrived in Delhi to take the oath of office in 2014. Is Trump using it to coerce India? Is Modi taking India into a diplomatic trap to placate Trump? The fact is that Donald Trump’s America is misbehaving with everyone in the world and India is no exception. The pressure on Modi to stay in the Western camp is compounded by the fact that men and women considered members of his charmed circle are likeliest the ones who have made their millions or billions in US dollars. Imagine their plight with BRICS promising to challenge the dollar’s hegemony.
Yet, Modi has to make a success of the BRICS summit too, which he hosts next year, with China keeping a close watch on the script.

The most despicable form of gender violence is seen when a woman dares to love and, in doing so, violates family pride. She and her partner face death as a consequence.
A harrowing video depicting the execution of a young couple last month in Balochistan’s Jaffarabad district recently went viral on social media and sent shockwaves across Pakistan. In the gruesome footage, a young woman is shot down as several men look on. A terrorism case has been registered on behalf of the state, and a dozen suspects, including a tribal elder who allegedly ordered the killing, are under arrest.
The case has been transferred to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing, while the Quetta judicial magistrate has ordered that the woman’s body be exhumed. Two men in Attock also decided to restore family ‘honour’ with bloodshed: a mother of an infant took multiple bullets over doubts about her ‘character’ by both her husband and father-in-law. In Lower Dir, communal honour devoured a couple suspected of having illicit relations.
The persistence of such a scourge has sparked outrage about parallel justice systems and the fragile state of women’s liberties in Pakistan. These acts should be stripped of all traditional context that valorises them. In 2016, the government moved to plug loopholes that made it easy for ‘honour’ killers to walk free: Section 311 of the PPC, which addresses ‘fasad fil arz’, ensures that the state can intervene when ‘honour’ killing occurs and if the complainant forgives the perpetrator. Despite the amendments, punishment for murder, including ‘honour’ killings, can be set aside by the victim’s legal heirs.
Courts rarely exercise the discretion to overrule settlements between perpetrators and the kin, thereby perpetuating a culture of impunity. The state must show resolve to protect its citizens from the cancer of patriarchy.
The path to stem the rise in such murders over the last two years — HRCP data from January to November 2024 shows that 346 people were killed for ‘honour’ — lies in reforms to uphold justice, constitutional guarantees, and accountability. It does not help that activists focus on the courage of a woman facing the barrel of the gun. No life should be lost to toxic control. Women are not the family’s social currency.

“We urge the parties and the international community to unite in a common effort to bring this terrible conflict to an end, through an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire,” the grouping added in a joint statement.
“Further bloodshed serves no purpose. We reaffirm our complete support to the efforts of the US, Qatar and Egypt to achieve this.” The signatories, which also included Japan, several EU countries, Switzerland and New Zealand, added they were “prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire”.
The statement branded the controversial Israeli-supported aid in Gaza as “dangerous” and said it deprives people of ‘human dignity’. “We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food,” the statement said.

In a joint statement, 25 states say denial of essential assistance to people is ‘unacceptable’

“The Israeli government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable,” it added, urging Israel to “comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law”.
The statement called for the Israeli government “to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and to urgently enable the UN and humanitarian NGOs to do their life saving work safely and effectively”.
The UN said last week that it had recorded 875 people who had been killed in Gaza while trying to get food via the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
The 25-nation statement also condemned the continued detention of Israeli prisoners by Hamas, demanding “their immediate and unconditional release” and noting that a negotiated ceasefire “offers the best hope of bringing them home”.
Meanwhile, the signatories said they “strongly oppose any steps towards territorial or demographic change in the Occupied Palestinian Territories” and said an Israeli plan to shift Palestinians into a so-called “humanitarian city” was unacceptable.
 
 

“Permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law,” they warned.
The statement was also signed by EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib.
Israel sends tanks into Deir al-Balah
Israeli tanks pushed into southern and eastern districts of the Gazan city of Deir al-Balah for the first time on Monday, an area where Israeli military claimed Israeli prisoners may be held.
The area is packed with Palestinians displaced during more than 21 months of war in Gaza, hundreds of whom fled west or south after Israel issued an evacuation order, saying it sought to destroy infrastructure and capabilities of Hamas.
Tank shelling in the area hit houses and mosques, killing at least three Palestinians and wounding several others, local medics said.
To the south in Khan Younis, an Israeli airstrike killed at least five people, including a husband and wife and their two children in a tent, medics said.
In its daily update, Gaza’s health ministry said at least 130 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded by Israeli gunfire and military strikes.

“A trilateral consultation” with Russia and China would be held in the Iranian capital to discuss nuclear issues and the potential reimposition of sanctions, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei told a news conference on Monday.
He accused the West of failing to respect the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “The European parties have been at fault and negligent in implementing” the nuclear agreement, Mr Baqaei said.
The three European countries have warned that sanctions could be reimposed on Iran if it does return to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme.

Blames Western powers for not respecting 2015 deal

Iran confirmed fresh talks with European powers will be held on Friday in Istanbul.
Iranian diplomats will meet counterparts from Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3.
“In response to the request of European countries, Iran has agreed to hold a new round of talks,” said the foreign ministry spokesperson.
A German diplomatic source said on Sunday the E3 were in contact with Tehran.
“Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. That is why Germany, France and the United Kingdom are continuing to work intensively in the E3 format to find a sustainable and verifiable diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear programme,” the source said.
Kremlin meeting
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a surprise meeting in the Kremlin with Ali Larijani, top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader on nuclear issues.
Larijani “conveyed assessments of the escalating situation in the Middle East and around the Iranian nuclear programme”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the meeting.
Putin had expressed Russia’s “well-known positions on how to stabilise the situation in the region and on the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear programme”, he added.

He expressed condolences over the loss of lives and property during the floods, triggered by heavy monsoon rains in Pakistan.

• ICC not a signatory to UN Sports for Climate Framework, but Cricket Australia and ECB implementing heat policy guidelines, sustainability strategies
KARACHI: The Pakistan Super League has overcome several barriers to become the country’s most lucrative cricket product. But it will not escape the effects of climate change.
Experts have warned that rising global temperatures will impact future editions of the PSL, at least if it is scheduled in the same time as the last one.
Findings from Hit for Six: The Danger Zone, a report compiled by the British Association for Sustainability in Sport (BASIS) and other organisations, show that 17 out of 34 matches of the last edition of the PSL were played in conditions that could, at the very least, result in heat-related fatigue.
The first nine of editions of the PSL were held between February and March, but with Pakistan hosting the Champions Trophy this year, the glitzy T20 event was moved to the summer months of April and May, making it clash with the Indian Premier League.
The brief India-Pakistan skirmishes in May halted the PSL, eventually forcing it deeper into the summer once it restarted.
Initially due to climax on May 18, the season eventually ended a week later on May 25, and next year’s edition is likely to be held in the same time period.
“Estimates show that out of the 34 PSL matches played in 2025, half were played in conditions classified as either meriting ‘Caution’ or ‘Extreme Caution’ on the Heat Index — a measure that combines air temperature and humidity to assess heat-related risk,” said the findings shared with Dawn.
There were 15 days of ‘Caution’ and two days of ‘Extreme Caution’ — including the playoff between eventual champions Lahore Qalandars and Islamabad United.
According to the Heat Index, conditions meriting ‘Caution’ can result in fatigue due to prolonged exposure, while the impact of playing in ‘Extreme Caution’ conditions can lead to sunstroke, muscle cramps or possibly heat exhaustion.
“From match 27 [on May 17] onwards, all matches (including the playoffs) were played under conditions that met the ‘Caution’ or ‘Extreme Caution’ parameters of the Heat Index,” the findings of the report add.
March ‘not an option’
However, the report says that going back to March won’t be an option as the global climate shifts.
“Whilst PSL matches avoided conditions that fell inside the ‘Danger’ categorisation, as the report outlines, rising global temperatures will continue to make weather events like last year’s 50 degree temperatures increasingly likely, with extremes of heat like the 2022 March heatwave over 30 times more likely because of climate change,” it says.
While cricket may not be the most physically intense game, it is among the longest, with 50-over matches lasting up to eight hours. The intense weather conditions mean direct exposure to the sun for long hours.
T20 is the game’s shortest format, but the report’s findings mean it will also have to be played while keeping the climate in mind.
“Like many aspects of our lives and communities, climate change may necessitate changes in cricket in the future as the planet warms,” Dr Kristina Dahl, the vice-president of Climate Central, one of the organisations involved with the study, told Dawn.
“It is dangerous to both players and fans to hold matches when it is extremely hot and humid, so the sport could consider options like holding matches during times of the day or times of the year when it tends to be cooler, or gameplay could be moved to indoor stadiums that can be air conditioned.
“The countries around the world where cricket is typically played tend to be hot places, so the PSL won’t be the only league facing these challenges.”
The proliferation of T20 leagues around the world, which have become financial drivers for their cricketing boards, means a balance has to be found. The carbon footprint of these leagues — emissions from travel, stadium operations, and other activities — remains unknown.
“Carbon pollution is carbon pollution no matter who emits it and where, so the more we can do to reduce personal, institutional, national, and international carbon pollution, the less warming we’ll experience in the future,” adds Dr Dahl. “And the less warming we see, the less disruption we’ll have to sports like cricket.”
Problems across the border
Across the border, the Indian Premier League faces even greater climate danger. Unlike the PSL, it has marked a permanent place in the calendar between March and May.
“More than 36pc of 2025 IPL games took place under ‘Extreme Caution’ conditions, where heat exhaustion becomes a serious threat, with a further 12pc reaching a ‘Danger’ classification where the risk of heatstroke becomes significant,” the report states.
While the International Cricket Council isn’t yet a signatory to the UN Sports for Climate Framework, Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board have been active in implementing new heat policy guidelines and planning sustainability strategies.
Dr Dahl believes more directions from world cricket’s governing body to its members on how to better deal with the impact of climate change. “Measures put in place for players and fans would help to protect them both now and in a warmer future,” she said.
“If, for example, there was a heat index threshold or an air quality threshold above which matches were postponed or cancelled, the number of events that were affected might be small today, but larger in the future as extreme heat conditions become more frequent. But having those measures in place now would prepare the sport for further warming in the years ahead.”

The horrific video of the incident went viral on Sunday, prompting a countrywide outcry. Baloc­histan Police chief Moa­zzam Jah Ansari told Dawn the woman’s family and her tribe members were allegedly involved in the murder as they killed her and her partner for allegedly having a relationship out of wedlock. The man who shot and killed the woman was her brother, the IGP said.
On Sunday, it was reported that the woman and the man had contracted a love marriage, and they were invited by their families on the pretext of a feast, where they were informed about the decision of the jirga.
Separately, a court ordered the police to exh­ume the bodies and conduct an autopsy, while an anti-­t­errorism court granted physical remand of Sardar Sher­baz Satak­zai to police for two days.
Balochistan High Cou­rt Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech also took notice of the double murder in Quetta’s Digari area, summoning the province’s top security officials.
 
 

According to a statement, the CJ summoned the additional chief secretary for home and the police chief to appear before the court on Tuesday.
‘Justice to be served’
In a press conference at the Chief Minister’s House, CM Sarfraz Bugti said over a dozen people, including tribal elder Sherbaz, had been arrested over the past 24 hours in connection with the incident. “Over a dozen suspects were present at the site of the killing, and police are conducting raids for more arrests,” CM Bugti said, adding that all those involved in this barbaric act would be brought to justice.
“We will make sure that all of them are prosecuted,” CM Bugti said at the presser. The chief minister claimed the man and woman were not married to each other, adding that the woman had five children and the man had four or five children from separate marriages. The CM said “a wrong impression” had been created in other parts of the country that they were killed on the order of a tribal jirga for getting married of their own choice.
“No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then film it on video,” he said, adding, “It is a crime and murder and the people involved in this act must be punished.”
The chief minister said the government had suspended the DSP of the Special Branch for not relaying information about the incident, which occurred three days before Eid. The victims’ families did not inform anyone about the incident, he said, adding that when police and law enforcement agencies went to the village to make arrests, the men fled while the women pelted the police with stones.
The CM said jirgas were part of the tribal society, but it was the job of the government to fulfil its responsibilities in such cases and discourage such decisions.

GILGIT: At least four tourists were killed, two others injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Babusar area in Diamer district on Monday.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in Gilgit-Balt­istan as a cloudburst-induced flood wreaked havoc across the region.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said the flood washed away eight tourist vehicles in the Thak area. He confirmed that at least 15 tourists are missing, with four bodies, including that of a woman from Lodhran (Punjab), recovered so far. The injured and deceased have been shifted to a local hospital.
The spokesperson said that the Babusar Highway was also blocked.
Communication and electricity infrastructure have been disrupted in the area. Mr Faraq said hundreds of stranded tourists have been rescued, while many have been given shelter by local residents.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told Dawn that the situation is alarming due to the high intensity of the flood. He said the flood’s path stretched about seven kilometres. At least three tourist vehicles were seen being washed away.
He estimated that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.
Rescue teams are working to trace them, though operations are hampered by continued mudflow.
The flood also damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides. Meanwhile, Gilgit-Baltistan chief minister has directed authorities to utilise all available resources to rescue and assist those affected. Agricultural land, crops, trees, public and private property, and infrastructure have suffered extensive damage.
Floods hit Ghizer
On the other hand, flash floods caused by cloudbursts also created disasters in multiple areas of the Ghizer district. Local administration officials reported that the villages of Kanche and Salpi were particularly hard-hit, with over a dozen homes, agricultural lands, standing crops, and basic infrastructure destroyed.
In Yasin’s upper Thui area, brief rainfall on Saturday night triggered a flash flood that severely damaged residential houses and a private educational institution.
 
 

Six homes were completely destroyed, and several others — including a school run by the Aga Khan Education Service — were partially damaged. Large areas of wheat fields, as well as apricot and cherry orchards, were also ravaged.
Flood victims have appealed to the government for immediate assistance.
In Skardu, Rescue 1122 has placed Gamba station on high alert due to the rising flood threat in Bargi and Sadpara nullahs.
The floods damaged public and private property, agricultural land, and roads, and entered residential homes.
Drinking and irrigation water channels were also damaged.
Baltistan Commissioner Kamal Khan visited the area and mobilised machinery for restoration of water supply and roads.
Administration officials said rising water levels in the Khunjerab river have damaged the KKH at Passu in Gojal, threatening to sever upper valleys from rest of the region and cut off Pakistan’s only road link to China via Khunjerab Pass.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEP) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that Gilgit-Baltistan has experienced record temperature this year.
“High temperatures and humidity have persisted for over a month and a half. These conditions are triggering frequent cloudbursts across the region,” he said.
He explained that cloudbursts are causing severe flash floods in the mountainous terrain, where mud and rockslides intensify downstream destruction.
Rains lash Mansehra
In the meantime, the monsoon downpour, which began in the afternoon, continued across Mansehra, Torghar, Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai-Palas for the rest of the day.
Link roads in Kaghan, Siren, and Konsh valleys of Mansehra and various parts of Torghar were blocked due to landslides triggered by the rains.
PDMA alert for Punjab
Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday issued a flood alert for the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers, warning of medium to high-level flows due to heavy rainfall expected between July 21 and 23.
According to PDMA’s latest Daily Situation Report, the Indus River at Taunsa is currently at a medium flood level with inflows of 429,200 cusecs.
PDMA has directed the commissioners of Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Lahore, Sahiwal, and Bahawalpur, along with the deputy commissioners of multiple districts including Jhelum, Gujrat, Lahore, and Faisalabad, to take immediate action and implement precautionary measures.

• KP lawmakers allege ‘vote-swapping’ by party leadership to keep members in line
• PML-N nominee bags Punjab seat in by-election
PESHAWAR: After more than 17 months, the Senate finally became whole on Monday as Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Asse­mbly, following the oath-taking of lawmakers on reserved seats, elected 11 members to the upper house of parliament under a seat-sharing formula inked between the PTI government and the opposition alliance.
As per the arrangement which had been initially opposed by several PTI lawmakers, six seats went to the ruling party and five to the opposition parties, including two each to the PPP and the JUI-F and one to the PML-N.
The election witnessed a 17-month delay due to litigation over reserved seats, which was finally settled with the decision of the Constitutional Bench last month, followed by the ‘controversial’ oath-taking of members on Sunday. The final result was in line with the seat adjustment deal, agreed between the PTI government and the opposition parties.
For the election, six PTI nominees, five opposition picks, and one PTI dissident were in the running. Initially, five disgruntled PTI candidates were vying for the Senate seats, but Irfan Saleem, Mohammad Waqas Ora­kzai, Syed Irshad Hus­sain, and Aisha Bano withdrew after the party leadership convinced them that their candidacy would harm the party.
According to Form-58 released individually to the winning candidates by the returning officer, the ruling PTI won six seats: four general seats and one seat each for women and technocrats. Similarly, the opposition got five senate seats: three general and one each reserved for women and technocrats. PTI winners on the general seats included Murad Saeed with 26 votes, Mirza Afridi with 21 votes, Faisal Javed with 22 votes, and Noorul Haq Qadri with 21 votes. Azam Swati and Robina Naz won the reserved seats with 89 votes each.
PPP’s Talha Mehmood, Niaz Ahmed of the PML-N, and JUI-F nominee Attaul Haq received 18 votes each on general seats, while the technocrat and woman seat respectively went to PPP’s Robina Khalid and Dilawar Khan of the JUI-F. Ms Khalid got 52 votes and Mr Khan got 54 votes.
Vote-swapping allegations
The polling was scheduled to start at 11am; however, it started at 11:26am and ended at 5pm. All 145 members of the KP Assembly polled their votes in an exercise inside the assembly, which was restricted to media persons. Out of 145 polled votes for the general seats, two were declared invalid. Similarly, four and two votes were also declared invalid for seats of women and technocrats, respectively.
Several ruling and opposition members, on the condition of anonymity, told Dawn that their leadership allegedly relied on ‘vote-swapping’ to keep their members in check. This involves the party heads, or their nominees, marking the ballots for them in return for a blank ballot, to ensure that their members do not vote against party lines.
The MPAs, before they went in to cast their vote in the polling booth, received a ballot paper already marked, while leaving behind their own unmarked ballot paper, to be marked and polled by the next person. The practice was in blatant violation of the election rules and transparency, but not the first time such a procedure has been adopted. Both the treasury and opposition lawmakers followed the same process.
This is not the first time such a procedure has been adopted in the Senate election. During the tenure of Perviaz Khattak as the CM, the ruling PTI engaged in this practice, but not the opposition. Before that, the ANP would use covert tactics to keep its lawmakers in check. However, the way this practice had been deployed in Monday polls was unprecedented.
Punjab by-poll
In Punjab, PML-N leader Hafiz Abdul Kareem secured the vacant Senate seat in a by-election held to fill the seat left vacant after the death of Sajid Mir.
Out of 368 total votes, 345 were cast. Hafiz Abdul Kareem emerged victorious with 243 votes, while opposition candidate Mehr Abdul Sattar received 99 votes. Three votes were rejected.
Rana Muhammad Arshad, PML-N’s chief whip, highlighted the unity among government allied parties, stating that members fully adhered to their leadership’s directives.
Rana Arshad said that their 16 MPAs were abroad, so they could not use their right to franchise; otherwise, the ruling coalition’s vote tally would have been even better.

“Today, I discussed with [Ukrainian Security Council chief] Rustem Umerov the preparations for the exchange and another meeting in Turkey with the Russian side. Umerov reported that the meeting is scheduled for Wednesday,” Zelensky said in his daily address on Monday.
He added that more details would be released on Tuesday.
The rival sides met in Istanbul on May 16 and June 2 amid US pressure to agree on a ceasefire. Despite the urging of US President Donald Trump, no breakthrough was made.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have so far only agreed to hold prisoner exchanges. And Russia has since launched intense air attacks on Ukraine and seized more frontline territory.
Russia has demanded that Ukraine give up four regions, on top of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine give up any idea of joining the Nato military alliance.
Ukraine has rejected the demands and expressed doubt that Russia wants a ceasefire.
After Trump last week gave Russia 50 days to negotiate a deal or face heavy sanctions — and also renewed arms supplies to Ukraine — the Kremlin said it was ready for more talks.
The two sides exchanged ideas at the earlier talks on what a peace deal could look like, but remain far apart.
“A lot of diplomatic work lies ahead,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier on Monday, commenting on the prospects for a breakthrough.</p><small>2025-07-21 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21162932330c05e.png?r=163020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645/at-least-20-killed-171-injured-as-bangladesh-air-force-plane-crashes-into-college-campus' target='_blank'><strong>At least 20 killed, 171 injured as Bangladesh air force plane crashes into college campus</strong></a><br><p>At least 20 people were killed and 171 injured as a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital, Dhaka, on Monday after experiencing a technical problem shortly after take-off, according to a military statement.
The F-7 BGI jet took off at 1:06pm (0706 GMT) from the Bangladesh Air Force base in Kurmitola, Dhaka, as part of a routine training mission, but encountered a mechanical failure, said the spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Sami Ud Dowla Chowdhury.
“The pilot … made a valiant attempt to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas. Despite his best efforts, the aircraft … crashed into a two-storey building belonging to Milestone School and College,” he said.
The pilot was among those killed in the incident, the military said, adding that a committee had been formed to investigate its cause.
The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Janes Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
The Chengdu F-7 is the licence-built version of the Soviet MiG-21.
According to the Daily Star, an emergency hotline (01949-043697) was launched at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery following the crash.
The Daily Star further reported that three platoons of the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) were deployed to Uttara to assist in law enforcement and rescue operations, according to the BGB headquarters.
It added that the government has declared a one-day state mourning day tomorrow following the crash. The national flag will be flown at half-mast at all government, semi-government, autonomous institutions and educational establishments, as well as at Bangladeshi missions abroad.
“Special prayers will be held in all religious places of worship throughout the country for the injured and deceased,” it said.
Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, said that “necessary measures” would be taken to investigate the cause of the accident and “ensure all kinds of assistance”.
“The loss suffered by the air force […] students, parents, teachers and staff, and others in this accident is irreparable,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his regret over the incident and said Pakistan stood in solidarity with Bangladesh.
 






Fire, despair at crash site
Videos of the aftermath of the crash showed a big fire near a lawn emitting a thick plume of smoke into the sky, as crowds watched from a distance.
Firefighters sprayed water on the mangled remains of the plane, which appeared to have rammed into the side of a building, damaging iron grills and creating a gaping hole in the structure, footage filmed by Reuters showed.
 


“A third-grade student was brought in dead, and three others, aged 12, 14 and 40, were admitted to the hospital,” said Bidhan Sarker, head of the burn unit at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where some victims were taken.
Images from the scene also showed people screaming and crying as others tried to comfort them.
“When I was picking [up] my kids and went to the gate, I realised something came from behind … I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke,” said Masud Tarik, a teacher at the school.
The incident comes a little over a month after an Air India plane crashed on top of a medical college hostel in India’s Ahmedabad, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p><small>2025-07-21 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21221147aaffa1d.jpg?r=221250' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622/dar-says-pakistan-targeting-60pc-renewable-energy-by-2030-in-line-with-sdgs' target='_blank'><strong>Dar says Pakistan ‘targeting 60pc renewable energy by 2030’ in line with SDGs</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday stated that Pakistan is targeting using 60 per cent renewable energy by 2030 during his address to the General Debate of the Ministerial Segment of the UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
Pakistan assumed the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.
According to the FO, Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and outlined key policy measures driving growth, climate resilience and economic reform in his address.
“The compounding effects of the pandemic, the food, fuel, and finance crises, as well as intensifying climate impacts, have reversed hard-won development gains and deepened inequalities,” the FM said in his speech.
“Despite these challenges, Pakistan remains fully committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda. Our national development strategies, such as Uraan Pakistan, are aligned with the SDGs.”
 






The FM also highlighted initiatives such as the Benazir Income Support Programme and the ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ initiatives for climate adaptation and renewable energy, the FO’s statement read.
Dar also “emphasised the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) in aligning foreign direct investment with Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in sectors critical to sustainable growth”.
“While national efforts are essential, these cannot succeed in isolation. As the Secretary-General has rightly emphasised, deep reform of the international financial architecture is critical for implementing the SDGs,” the FM continued.
“Developing countries need scaled-up access to concessional and grant-based resources, meaningful debt relief, and scaled-up climate finance in order to bridge the SDG Financing Gap.”
Dar meets UN chief, affirms Pakistan’s commitment to multilateralism
During his visit, Dar met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres at the UN headquarters, according to a statement from the FO.
During the meeting, the FM reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering and resolute commitment to multilateralism and the central role of the UN in addressing the most pressing global challenges”, the statement read.
According to the FO, the secretary general appreciated Pakistan’s presence and initiatives at the UNSC.
Dar emphasised that Pakistan was fully committed to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, especially the need to advance peace through dialogue and diplomacy.
He further stated Pakistan’s commitment to peace was underscored by the high-level debate on multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes and the meeting on UN-OIC cooperation, under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UNSC.
 






“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister emphasised issues of critical national and regional importance to Pakistan, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, violation of the Indus Waters Treaty and externally sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” the FO stated.
“He stressed the imperative of a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council. The DPM/FM lauded the secretary general’s leadership and sincere efforts for de-escalation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India.”
Dar also reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for Palestinian statehood, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and firm opposition to Israeli plans for annexation in the occupied West Bank.
The two men also exchanged views on the need for promoting concessional financing to support development and climate goals, especially for developing countries and mobilising enhanced international support for debt relief and liquidity solutions for the Global South.
“The DPM/FM emphasised that the secretary general’s ‘UN80’ initiative offered a critical opportunity to strengthen the three pillars of the United Nations to promote international peace and security, sustainable development and human rights worldwide,” the statement read, referring to the UN marking its 80th anniversary this year.
According to the statement, Dar welcomed the appointment of a UN special envoy on Islamophobia and expressed readiness to support global efforts to combat religious intolerance.
Earlier, the FO reported that Dar arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France,” the FO said.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”
 






It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
According to a July 19 statement issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
The conference was originally planned for June but was postponed due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the rescheduling of Dar’s visit. According to The Guardian, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.
Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.
Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p><small>2025-07-21 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2121151965c518c.jpg?r=220700' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925669/air-india-jet-skids-during-landing-in-mumbai-damaging-aircraft-and-runway' target='_blank'><strong>Air India jet skids during landing in Mumbai, damaging aircraft and runway</strong></a><br><p>An Air India Airbus A320 flight veered off the runway as it landed during heavy rain at the Mumbai International Airport on Monday, briefly shutting the runway and damaging the underside of one of the plane’s engines.
All passengers and crew members have since disembarked, Air India said, without saying whether anyone was injured. Air India flight AI2744 had flown from Kochi in southern Kerala state to Mumbai.
The Mumbai airport said in a statement that there were “minor damages reported to the airport’s primary runway” due to what it described as a “runway excursion”, and a secondary runway had been activated to ensure operational continuity.
The aircraft has been grounded for checks, Air India added.
A Times of India report, citing sources, said three tyres had burst on the aircraft after the landing. TV footage from NDTV and India Today showed the outer casing of the engine damaged, with some apparent cracks.
 


In a separate incident reported by Indian media, an Air India flight from Delhi to Kolkata was aborted moments before takeoff due to a technical issue.
The Times of India reported that Air India flight AI2403 was carrying 160 passengers and experienced a technical fault, forcing the pilots to discontinue the takeoff.
An Air India spokesperson said, “Flight A12403 operating from Delhi to Kolkata on 21 July 2025 has been rescheduled to depart later this evening, necessitated by a technical issue detected during the take-off roll.”
Air India has come under intense scrutiny after a Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed in the Indian city of Ahmedabad last month, killing 260 people.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said earlier this month it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, after Reuters reported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance.</p><small>2025-07-21 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21180851b936d33.jpg?r=181009' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925657/pm-shehbaz-launches-digital-system-for-licensing-registering-medical-devices' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz launches digital system for licensing, registering medical devices</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday launched the Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices, which will accelerate the registration process, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
The registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan became a critical issue earlier this year.
The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) was under scrutiny over “sluggish” and “highly inefficient” operations for the approval and registration of medical devices. According to the chairman of Healthcare Devices Association of Pakistan, the situation was causing heavy financial losses to importers and disrupting patient care in hospitals.
Speaking at the launch ceremony in Islamabad, he said that the process will be completed in the shortest possible time, stating: “Now, decisions will be made swiftly and transparently.”
 






The premier hoped that the applications for registration of medical services and equipment would be decided within 20 days in a transparent and merit-based system, according to APP.
He criticised Drap for inordinate delays in the registration process of medical services, saying. “Drag, not Drap, as it was dragging the process not for months but for years. The reasons were known to all.”
While citing issues in the health sector, he recalled an incident during his tenure as the Punjab chief minister, when Drap failed to properly handle certain drugs — meant to treat malaria — to treat heart patients, causing several deaths in the Punjab Institute of Cardiology.
 






He also discussed that the government allocated a huge budget for the provision of free of cost medicines at the government-run hospitals during 2014-15. He was quoted as saying, “The 60 per cent samples of those drugs proved below standards.”
He added that he ensured provision of quality medicines free of cost and set up laboratories across the province to facilitate the poor and deprived people.
The prime minister said that if they decided to bring about revolution in the health sector, it might be a difficult task, but not impossible.
“There may be mountain-like hurdles, but if we decide with determination to negotiate them and move ahead, then nothing can hamper the way towards progress and prosperity. The hard work does not go in vain,” he stated.
Federal Minister for Health Mustafa Kamal also spoke during the ceremony. He said that they had squeezed the time through an online digitisation system spanning over 20 days, contrary to earlier long periods of registration process.
He was quoted as saying, “The system would be free from any human contact as the certificates would be available online without visiting Drap.”
Kamal said that the government was utilising available resources to overcome issues in the health sector, including population growth and waterborne diseases.
“We are further improving the healthcare system with public-private partnership,” he said, adding the primary healthcare system would be strengthened further to reduce the burden at the main healthcare centres.
“The registration and licensing of everything from wheelchairs to MRI machines would be done online. Citizens could submit online applications from home to obtain registration and licensing of medical devices.”</p><small>2025-07-21 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211105550c20c73.png?r=115224' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925613/11-more-suspects-arrested-in-balochistan-couples-killing-case-transferred-to-sciw-police' target='_blank'><strong>11 more suspects arrested in Balochistan couple’s killing, case transferred to SCIW: police</strong></a><br><p>At least 11 more suspects, including a tribal leader, were arrested on Monday for their alleged involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Balochistan after a video of the murder went viral on social media, with the case now handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing (SCIW), according to the police.
SCIW Superintendent of Police (SP) Syed Saboor Agha told Dawn.com, “Eleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.”
The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti announced on X that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.
According to a first information report (FIR) — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — registered by Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta’s Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.
SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan’s Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.
“The victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,” the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.
Speaking to Dawn.com, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, “Owing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.”
Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‘immoral relationship’ (locally termed ‘Karo Kari’) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.
“The murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,” it added.
According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
One of the main suspects — tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai — was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case. The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.
Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.
In a press release issued by BHC — seen by Dawn.com — it was notified that Justice Barrech “has taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari”. The statement added that, “In this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025”.
The postmortem report on the slain couple has revealed that the woman was shot seven times and the man was shot nine times.
Police surgeon Ayesha Faiz, who conducted the postmortem, told Dawn.com that the graves of the man and woman were exhumed and the postmortem was conducted.
“They were killed on June 4. The woman is around 37 to 38 years old and was shot once in the head and seven times in the chest and stomach.
“The woman’s name was Noor Bano Bibi, written on her arm, and she belongs to the Satakzai tribe — while the man’s name was Ihsanullah, and he is around 35 to 36 years old and was shot nine times in the chest and stomach,” the police surgeon said.
According to Fiaz, the woman’s body was decomposed but recognisable, while the man’s body was in a slightly better condition and also recognisable.
The woman was buried in the Degari Qadir Bakhsh Coal Mines Cemetery, and the man in the Sanjadi Cemetery.
The DNA samples of both bodies have also been obtained and they will be tested if necessary.
The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it “barbaric” and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.
Separately, PPP MNA Shazia Marria moved an adjournment motion in the National Assembly to instead discuss the incident since it was a “matter of urgent national and human importance”.
“This tragic and barbaric act has shaken the conscience of the nation. Such heinous crimes constitute a grave violation of the teachings of Islam, and are in blatant disregard of the Constitution … which guarantees all citizens the right to life, dignity, due process, and equal protection under the law. Furthermore, such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life.
“This House must condemn this crime in the strongest possible terms. I urge the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government of Balochistan, obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested, and prosecuted without delay.”
Marri also said it was “imperative” that the state be made the complainant in the FIR and subsequent legal proceedings to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, reinforce public confidence in the justice system and avoid any compromise or pressure on the victims’ families.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
CM vows justice to be ensured
Addressing a press conference to discuss the details of the case, CM Bugti said he stood with the victims and vowed that justice would be served regardless of tribal affiliation.
He said he immediately ordered the arrest of suspects within 24 hours of the video going viral, adding 12 people had been detained so far, including a tribal chief.
Bugti clarified misinformation circulating on social and mainstream media, rejecting claims that the victims were a newly married couple. “The woman and man weren’t married. The woman had five children, and the man, aged around 45 to 50, also had four or five children,” he said, adding that these details did not justify the killing.
“It is a murder, a crime, no matter what anyone has done. No one has the right to kill a person this ruthlessly and make videos,” he said.
 


He added that the Special Branch deputy superintendent of police (DSP) posted in Dagari were suspended for failing to report the incident to the government.
The chief minister also pointed out the spread of misinformation through social media and the lack of investigative journalism.
“People sitting in Karachi and Lahore don’t know what Dagari is. But still, did anyone do any investigation? No. It was the murderer himself who released the video.”
Bugti said that he had received a call from PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and that operations were underway upon his instructions. He said the government would follow constitutional channels, not tribal jirgas, to resolve the case.
Condemnations
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the murder and contacted CM Bugti, ordering a probe into the incident, according to a press release from the PM Office.
The prime minister directed that people involved in the incident should be punished according to law, as no one was above the law and could not be permitted to violate the law of the land.
He also ordered taking all legal measures to bring the culprits to justice.
Bilawal called the suspects “beasts”, saying that they deserved no concessions. “I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).  “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a post on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”
He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also condemned the murder in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.
“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.
“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”
The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.
Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.
“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.
“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”
She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.

Traders have closed the Karakoram Highway at several places in Hunza and Nagar districts, due to which travellers and a large number of tourists from the two districts have been stranded.
“Traders had blocked the Karakoram Highway by staging a sit-in at two places in the Hunza area, in which the Murtazaabad sit-in ended,” Hunza Deputy Commissioner (DC) Huzaifa Anwar told Dawn.com.
“However, a sit-in is ongoing in the Sost area of the Pak-China border. Talks are being held with the traders there. It is likely that it will be cleared in two to three hours,” DC Anwar added.
He said that three traders were detained at the Sost Dry Port after the announcement of the sit-in, one of whom has been released, but two are in custody.
The DC said that the traders were not arrested and in protective custody. “If they had been arrested, a case would have been registered, but no case has been registered against any trader,” he added.
“At present, the priority is to resolve the issue of the closure of the Karakoram Highway, since there are a large number of tourists in the area who are facing problems in their movement.”
The Silk Route Dry Port was to be closed today and a sit-in was to be held on the Karakoram Highway, according to an announcement from the traders of Gilgit-Baltistan.
However, last night the government cracked down on the active traders. According to the traders, the police took action at night and raided the houses of several traders, including Ali Nazar, Abbas Mir and Farman Tajik, and arrested them.
The traders have pitched tents on the Karakoram Highway at Nagar Rakaposhi and Murtaazabad in Hunza, due to which hundreds of travellers and dozens of nationals and foreigners have been stranded.
Former president of GB Chamber of Commerce and prominent businessman Javed Hussain, while addressing the traders’ sit-in in Nagar, said that the Hunza administration ruined the peaceful protest by arresting traders.
“Now, if the district administration has any power, then keep the traders in custody; otherwise, we will break out our colleagues and show them,” he said, adding that he would not compromise on the interests of GB. “If it means leaving the PML-N for this, I will leave it a thousand times.”
He blamed Hunza’s DC and superintendent of police for the situation. The traders raised strong slogans against the district police chief and the deputy commissioner.
Former president of the Chamber of Commerce, Imran Ali, said that the traders’ demand was against the collection of income and sales tax collected at the Sost Silk Dry Port.
According to him, earlier too, an understanding was reached on some issues regarding the protest of the traders against the aforementioned taxes at the Pak-China border, but the issue arose again because of which the Silk Route Dry Port was closed today. The port was to be locked down and a sit-in was to be held in the border area.
According to DC Anwar, the situation was completely under control. “We are in contact with the traders and negotiations are also taking place,” he said.
Nagar DC Asghar Khan said that the highway was closed for some time due to the Muharram procession in Nagar district, giving the impression that traders had blocked the highway. “However, the highway was not closed anywhere. The Nagar administration has not even arrested any trader,” he said.
In June, local importers and exporters protested against what they called exploitative policies of the Federal Board of Revenue. The protest was led by traders and supported by political parties against the centre’s trade policies.
Local traders involved in Pakistan-China trade via Khunjerab Pass had also launched an indefinite protest sit-in May, blocking the Karakoram Highway at Pissan in Nagar, stranding thousands of local and international travellers on both sides of the route.</p><small>2025-07-21 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21194111f096470.jpg?r=200011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925661/trumps-renewed-interest-in-pakistan-has-india-recalibrating-china-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s renewed interest in Pakistan has India recalibrating China ties</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s lunch meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir prompted a private diplomatic protest from India in a warning to Washington about risks to their bilateral ties while New Delhi is recalibrating relations with China as a hedge, officials and analysts said.
The meeting and other tensions in the US-India relationship, after decades of flourishing ties, have cast a shadow in trade negotiations, they said, as Trump’s administration weighs tariffs against one of its major partners in the Indo-Pacific.
India blames Pakistan, especially the military establishment, for supporting what it alleges is cross-border terrorism and has told the US it is sending the wrong signals by wooing Field Marshal Munir, three senior Indian government officials directly aware of the matter told Reuters.
It has created a sore spot that will hamper relations going forward, they said.
Pakistan has denied accusations that it supports militants who carried out an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and that New Delhi has provided no evidence that it is involved.
US-India ties have strengthened in the past two decades despite minor hiccups, at least partly because both countries seek to counter China.
The current problems are different, said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation think tank.
“The frequency and intensity with which the US is engaging with Pakistan, and seemingly not taking Indian concerns into account, especially after India’s recent conflict with Pakistan, has contributed to a bit of a bilateral malaise.
“The concern this time around is that one of the triggers for broader tensions, that being Trump’s unpredictability, is extending into the trade realm with his approach to tariffs,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office and India’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The foreign ministry has previously said that it had “taken note” of the Trump-Munir meeting.
A US official said they do not comment on private diplomatic communications and that the US enjoys strong relationships with both India and Pakistan.
“These relationships stand on their own merits, and we do not compare our bilateral relationships with one another,” the US official said.
Lunch at the White House
The US seems to have taken a different tack on Pakistan after a brief conflict broke out between the nuclear-armed rivals in May when India launched strikes on what it called terrorist targets across the border in response to a deadly attack on tourists from the majority Hindu community in India-held Kashmir the previous month.
After four days of aerial dogfights, missile and drone attacks, the two sides agreed to a ceasefire.
India and Pakistan have skirmished regularly and fought three full-scale wars since independence in 1947, two of them over the Kashmir dispute.
A few weeks after the May fighting, Trump hosted Field Marshal Munir for lunch at the White House, a major boost in ties with the country, which had largely languished under Trump’s first term and Joe Biden. It was the first time a US president had hosted the head of Pakistan’s army at the White House unaccompanied by senior Pakistani civilian officials.
 
 

Indian leaders have alleged that COAS Munir’s view of India and Pakistan is steeped in religion. “Tourists were murdered in front of their families after ascertaining their faith,” Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in May, referring to the Pahalgam attack.
“To understand that, you’ve got to also see … you have a Pakistani leadership, especially their army chief, who is driven by an extreme religious outlook,” he claimed.
Pakistan says it is Modi who is driven by religious extremism, and that his brand of Hindu nationalism has trampled on the rights of India’s large Muslim minority. Modi and the Indian government say they do not discriminate against minorities.
COAS Munir’s meeting in the White House added to India’s chagrin over Trump’s repeated insistence that he averted nuclear war between the two nations by threatening to stop trade negotiations with them. The comment drew a sharp response from Modi, who told Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between army commanders of the two nations, and not US mediation.
In the days following his June 18 meeting with COAS Munir, people from Modi’s office and India’s national security adviser’s office made separate calls to their US counterparts to register a protest, two of the officials said. The protest has not been previously reported.
“We have communicated to the US our position on cross-border terrorism, which is a red line for us,” said a senior Indian official. “These are difficult times … Trump’s inability to understand our concerns does create some wrinkle in ties,” he added, seeking anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
 
 

Trump and COAS Munir discussed continuation of a counterterrorism collaboration, under which the US has previously provided weapons to Pakistan, a non-Nato US ally, and talked about ways to further strengthen ties, a readout of the meeting from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
That raised concern in New Delhi that any arms Pakistan receives from the US could be turned on India if the neighbours end up in conflict again, two of the officials said.
Harder stance
Despite what used to be public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Modi, India has been taking a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks, while trade discussions have also slowed, the Indian officials and an Indian industry lobbyist said.
Modi declined an invitation from Trump to visit Washington after the G7 meeting in Canada in June.
Earlier this month, New Delhi proposed retaliatory duties against the US at the World Trade Organisation, showing trade talks were not going as smoothly as they were before the India-Pakistan clashes.
India, like other nations, is trying to figure out a way to deal with Trump and is recalibrating ties with China as a hedge, said Harsh Pant, foreign policy head at India’s Observer Research Foundation think tank.
“Certainly there is an outreach to China,” he said. “And I think it is mutual … China is also reaching out”.
Last week, India’s Jaishankar made his first visit to Beijing since a deadly 2020 border clash between Indian and Chinese troops.
 
 

India is also making moves to ease restrictions on investments from China that were imposed following the 2020 clash.
The thaw comes despite India’s prickly relations with China and Beijing’s close ties and military support to Pakistan.
But New Delhi’s concern about Trump’s own engagement with China, which has ranged from conciliatory to confrontational, appears to have contributed to its shift in stance on Beijing.
“With an unpredictable dealmaker in the White House, New Delhi cannot rule out Sino-US rapprochement,” said Christopher Clary, an associate professor of political science at the University at Albany, New York.
“India is troubled by Chinese help to Pakistan and growing Chinese influence elsewhere in India’s near abroad, such as Bangladesh. Yet New Delhi has largely concluded that it should respond to creeping Chinese influence by focusing its pressures on its nearest neighbours and not on China.”</p><small>2025-07-21 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2117051655a67f5.jpg?r=172020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925640/3-terrorists-killed-in-mastung-shootout-says-balochistan-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>3 terrorists killed in Mastung shootout, says Balochistan CTD</strong></a><br><p>Three terrorists belonging to a proscribed militant outfit were killed during an operation in Mastung district, Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Monday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
According to a statement by the CTD spokesperson, “All three suspects, who were killed, were linked to Daesh and were planning future acts of terror.”
Daesh refers to the banned militant Islamic State (IS) group, a globally proscribed terrorist organisation.
The CTD conducted an operation during which a “high-value Daesh suspect”, who was involved in the abduction and murder of a minor, was being taken to identify a suspected hideout in the outskirts of Mastung’s Dasht area, the statement said.
“The suspect had been under CTD custody and was involved in a brutal case of kidnapping for ransom, where the abducted minor was killed in captivity after the ransom was not paid,” it added.
“He was also linked with an operational cell of Daesh, involved in fundraising and terror facilitation across the province.”
The statement further said that armed accomplices present inside the hideout opened fire on the CTD team “in an attempt to secure the release of their associate”.
“CTD officials returned fire in self-defence, resulting in a fierce exchange. A shootout ensued [which] resulted in the killing of held suspect by his group’s fire during the chaos,” it added.
“Two armed terrorists were also neutralised on the spot.”
The statement also read that the group was involved in “targeted killings and extortion networks, using child abductions to fund militant operations”.
The CTD recovered “a cache of weapons, explosive materials, communication devices, and extremist literature from the site”, according to the statement.
A first information report was being registered at the CTD Quetta police station, while more raids were also planned for other areas of Dasht and Spilinji “to nab the remaining members of the group”, it concluded.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
 
 

On Friday, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in Mastung.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, especially in KP and Balochistan, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations.
Last week, the CTD Balochistan killed five terrorists during a joint operation conducted with other law enforcement agencies in Duki district.

Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
On July 12, the IHC expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report is not presented.
Justice Ishaq presided over a hearing for the case today. The judge said in his court order that he had warned the additional attorney general while passing his previous ruling that further inaction on the part of the government would lead to the issuance of a contempt notice.
“The government filed an appeal before the Supreme Court against my earlier decision permitting amendments to the petition for continuation of this case,” the order read. “For whatever reason, the government’s case had not been taken up by the Supreme Court.”
The judge said that since the government had not responded with the reasons despite being directed to do so, it was in contempt, leaving him with no option but to issue a notice of contempt to the federal government.
“Office is directed to initiate a contempt petition accordingly, in which all the members of the federal government will be respondents. The replies of all the ministers, including the prime minister, shall be filed within two weeks from today,” the order said.
At the outset of his order, the judge said: “Ever since the demolition squad was catapulted into this high court after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we have seen one heresy after another hurled at the edifice of justice, maiming it repeatedly and bringing it almost to its last breaths. This is yet another instance. The heresy I speak of now is besieging the dispensation of justice by a judge of the high court by the device of the ‘weekly roster’ controlled by the office of the chief justice. It is both heart-rending and amusing at the same time, a blend of paradox that this high court has become.”
Criticising the government’s actions during the current case, he said, “The machinations of the executive appeared elsewhere, in the form of controlling the proceedings of this court through its roster.”
The judge noted that he was supposed to be on leave this week, but was informed that the cause list would not be issued without the leave of the chief justice, to which he submitted an application. He added that he was informed on Saturday that the chief justice did not sign it.
“I was informed on Saturday that the application was duly moved but the file remained on the table of the chief justice, who did not find even 30 seconds to sign it. Whether that was by design or oversight, I cannot say for sure, but given the manner in which the roster of judges has been used as a tool for the desired outcome in specific cases, and given the government’s stiff opposition to do what is right and to stand by the daughter of the nation at the critical juncture of the motion before a US court, I may be forgiven for thinking that it was the former. The correct legal position is that the office cannot use the shoulder of the chief justice in the exercise of administrative powers to obstruct judicial proceedings ordered by a judge in an ongoing case.”
Justice Ishaq called it “yet another instance of the reproachable use of the administrative power to shackle the exercise of independent judicial authority”, stating that the government’s response, with reasons as to why it would not sign the [amicus brief][4] in the case, would likely be delayed until his leave ended.
“However, the imperatives of justice shall not be defeated by such petty means. To the extent I can, I will exercise my judicial authority to the end of upholding the dignity of the high court and the justice it dispenses.”
The hearing
Lawyer Imran Shafiq appeared in court on behalf of the petitioner, Dr Fowzia Siddiqui. Former senator Mushtaq Ahmed was also present at the court.
Justice Ishaq echoed his discontent with how the hearing had been scheduled for today, despite his being on leave. “Even if a judge wants to, they cannot work during holidays,” he remarked.
“My holidays were supposed to start today. Once again, administrative power has been used for judicial power.”
The judge added that he still heard the case because of its nature and importance.
“The government has filed an appeal against my decision in the Supreme Court,” the judge said.
Shafiq noted that if the government had to take a stay, “they would have formed a new bench by now”.
“We know how the court functions. Your order is there, the case is being heard today,” he added, addressing the judge.
When asked why Shafiq had not filed his case with the Supreme Court, he replied, “Because Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is there.”
“The case will only be filed when the roster of judges changes,” Shafiq added.
“The court has no other option but to issue contempt notices to the federal government,” Justice Ishaq ruled.
He stated that the next hearing of the case would be held on the first working day after he returned from leave.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21181350072fb0f.jpg?r=182750' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925658/air-india-cockpit-recording-suggests-captain-cut-fuel-to-engines-before-crash-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Air India cockpit recording suggests captain cut fuel to engines before crash, source says</strong></a><br><p>A cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the Air India flight that crashed last month supports the view that the captain cut the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines, said a source briefed on US officials’ early assessment of evidence.
The first officer was at the controls of the Boeing 787 and asked the captain why he moved the fuel switches into a position that starved the engines of fuel and requested that he restore the fuel flow, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the matter remains under investigation.
The US assessment is not contained in a formal document, said the source, who emphasised the cause of the June 12 crash in Ahmedabad, India, that killed 260 people remains under investigation.
There was no cockpit video recording definitively showing which pilot flipped the switches, but the weight of evidence from the conversation points to the captain, according to the early assessment.
 
 

India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which is leading the investigation into the crash, said in a statement on Thursday that “certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting”.
It added that the investigation was ongoing and it was too early to draw definitive conclusions.
The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first reported similar information on Wednesday about the world’s deadliest aviation accident in a decade.
The Federation of Indian Pilots, through its Indian law firm APJ-SLG Law Offices, sent a legal notice to Reuters about a July 17 story published by the news agency, which referenced the WSJ article.
The notice asked Reuters to desist from publication of any content “that speculates on the cause of the crash or attributes fault to any individuals, especially deceased pilots, in the absence of official confirmation and final report”.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
A preliminary report released by the AAIB on Saturday said one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel and “the other pilot responded that he did not do so”.
Investigators did not identify which remarks were made by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and which by First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3,403 hours, respectively.
The AAIB’s preliminary report said the fuel switches had switched from “run” to “cutoff” a second apart just after takeoff, but it did not say how they were moved.
 
 

Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.
The London-bound plane began to lose thrust, and after reaching a height of 650 feet, the jet started to sink.
The fuel switches for both engines were turned back to “run”, and the aeroplane automatically tried restarting the engines, the report said.
But the plane was too low and too slow to be able to recover, aviation safety expert John Nance told Reuters.
The plane clipped some trees and a chimney before crashing in a fireball into a building on a nearby medical college campus, the report said, killing 19 people on the ground and 241 of the 242 on board the 787.
No safety recommendations
In an internal memo on Monday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.
The AAIB’s preliminary report had no safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturer GE.
After the report was released, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been assisting with the Air India investigation and its Chair, Jennifer Homendy, has been fully briefed on all aspects, a board spokesperson said.
That includes the cockpit voice recording and details from the flight data recorder that the NTSB team assisted the AAIB in reading out, the spokesperson added.
“The safety of international air travel depends on learning as much as we can from these rare events so that industry and regulators can improve aviation safety,” Homendy said in a statement. “And if there are no immediate safety issues discovered, we need to know that as well.”
The circumstantial evidence increasingly indicates that a crew member flipped the engine fuel switches, Nance said, given there was “no other rational explanation” that was consistent with the information released to date.
Nonetheless, investigators “still have to dig into all the factors” and rule out other possible contributing factors, which would take time, he said.
The Air India crash has rekindled debate over adding flight deck cameras, known as cockpit image recorders, on airliners.
Nance said investigators likely would have benefited greatly from having video footage of the cockpit during the Air India flight.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211657209d0553d.jpg?r=165751' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925646/pti-leader-yasmin-rashids-health-deteriorates-again-in-jail-after-incomplete-treatment-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leader Yasmin Rashid’s health deteriorates again in jail after incomplete treatment: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI leader Yasmin Rashid’s health deteriorated again in jail on Monday after she was discharged from a hospital, according to her lawyer Rana Mudassar.
Rashid has been in prison for almost a year now in connection with multiple cases against her regarding the events of May 9, 2023, when countrywide protests and riots broke out after the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan. Last week, she was moved to a hospital in Lahore after her health deteriorated in Kot Lakhpat Jail. She was hospitalised in May and July of last year as well.
Mudassar, Rashid’s advocate, told Dawn.com that Rashid had a severe infection in her stomach and was also having difficulty breathing.
“Rashid was forcibly discharged from the hospital on Saturday. She underwent various tests, but she was not fully treated in light of the reports.”
He added Rashid was “transferred to jail without informing her family and lawyers” upon being discharged. “Yasmin Rashid has a fundamental right to health and medical facilities,” Mudassar said.
Moeen Riaz Qureshi, deputy opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly, slammed the lack of medical care provided to Rashid, calling it “pathetic” and immoral that the government would deprive “an old lady, a cancer survivor, an ex-health minister” of medical facilities.
“She needs urgent medical attention […] Her sleep is constantly disturbed; she can’t breathe properly. Even when they gave her the [BIPAP] machine, they turned off the electricity at night in the name of load shedding so it couldn’t work,” he said.
He warned against allowing Rashid’s health to deteriorate for the sake of “political stunting”, saying that the government would “regret it”.
The PTI’s US division said Rashid was “being humiliated by the state”. “This isn’t justice. It’s vengeance,” it added.
 






On July 12, an anti-terrorism court reserved its verdict on the bail petitions of former Punjab governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema and Rashid in cases related to the May 9 riots.
The same day, Rashid and four other PTI senior leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat Jail demanded fresh, free and fair general elections in the country in an open letter.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2117173611ff90a.jpg?r=171757' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925647/china-embarks-on-worlds-largest-hydropower-dam-capital-markets-cheer' target='_blank'><strong>China embarks on world’s largest hydropower dam, capital markets cheer</strong></a><br><p>China’s Premier Li Qiang has announced that construction had begun on what would be the world’s largest hydropower dam on the eastern rim of the Tibetan Plateau, the country’s official Xinhua news agency reported — sending stock prices and bond yields higher on Monday.
The commencement of the hydropower project at an estimated cost of at least $170 billion, China’s most ambitious since the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, was seized by Chinese markets as proof of economic stimulus.
Made up of five cascade hydropower stations with the capacity to produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by Britain last year, the dam will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo. A section of the river tumbles 2,000 metres in a span of 50km, offering huge hydropower potential.
India and Bangladesh have already raised concerns about its possible impact on the millions of people downstream.
China asserts that the project has undergone rigorous scientific evaluation and will not adversely affect the ecological environment, geological stability, or water resource rights of downstream countries. Beijing has also emphasised that it will not try to benefit at the “expense of its neighbours”, South China Morning Post reported.
The dam has reportedly prompted India to speed up its own hydropower projects on the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh to assert water resource rights, the Hong Kong-based daily added.
 
 

China’s CSI Construction and Engineering Index jumped as much as 4 per cent to a seven-month high. Power Construction Corporation of China and Arcplus Group surged by their 10pc daily limit.
“From an investment perspective, mature hydropower projects offer bond-like dividends,” Wang Zhuo, partner of Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management, said, while cautioning that speculative buying into related stocks would inflate valuations.
The project will drive demand for construction and building materials such as cement and civil explosives, Huatai Securities said in a note to clients.
Shares of Beijing-listed Hunan Wuxin Tunnel Intelligent Equipment Co, which sells tunnel construction equipment, surged 30pc. So did shares of Geokang Technologies Co Ltd, which makes intelligent monitoring terminals.
Cement maker Xizang Tianlu Co Ltd and Tibet GaoZheng Explosive Co, producer of civil explosive materials, both jumped their maximum by 10pc.
Broader impact
The Chinese premier described the dam as a “project of the century” and said special emphasis “must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Xinhua said on Saturday.
Government bond yields rose across the board on Monday, with the most-traded 30-year treasury futures CTLU5 falling to five-week lows, as investors interpreted the news as part of China’s economic stimulus.
The project, overseen by the newly formed state-owned China Yajiang Group, marks a major boost in public investment to help bolster economic growth as current drivers show signs of faltering.
“Assuming 10 years of construction, the investment/GDP boost could reach 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) for a single year,” said Citi in a note. “The actual economic benefits could go beyond that.”
China has not given an estimate on the number of jobs the project could create.
The Three Gorges, which took almost two decades to complete, generated nearly a million jobs, state media reported, though it displaced at least a similar number of people.
 
 

Authorities have not indicated how many people would be displaced by the Yarlung Zangbo project.
The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra River as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India and finally into Bangladesh. NGOs claim that the dam will irreversibly harm the Tibetan Plateau and hit millions of people downstream.
The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, said earlier this year that such a colossal dam barely 50km from the border could dry out 80pc of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas in Arunachal and neighbouring Assam state.
Some experts also express concerns for a project in a seismically active zone.</p><small>2025-07-21 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2116251206c4b03.png?r=162918' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925644/pakistan-sports-board-takes-steps-to-clamp-down-on-age-fraud-in-junior-level-events' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Sports Board takes steps to clamp down on ‘age fraud’ in junior-level events</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on Monday announced stringent new measures to clamp down on “age fraud” in junior-level (Under-21) sports events, declaring such acts a serious violation of its code of ethics and governance in sports.
“The Pakistan Sports Board has declared age fraud a violation under the Pakistan Code of Ethics and Governance in Sports and any such act is liable to sanctions,” read  a notification issued by the PSB, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“Globally, age fraud in sports, especially in junior categories, poses a serious threat to fair competition, athlete safety, and the integrity of sporting structures,” the notification added.
The PSB said that youth sports worldwide are classified on the basis of chronological age to ensure equal opportunity and fair play, adding, “It is suspected that athletes are participating in age-restricted competitions with falsified or inaccurate age documentation.”
The PSB continued that all athletes under the age of 21 participating in junior events must now submit either a national identity card (CNIC) or a B-Form, along with names of the selection committee members, dental examinations, and radiological tests.
In addition, medical reports verified by the president and secretary general of the respective sports federation, along with all supporting documents, must be submitted to the PSB for verification.
The notification stated that any athlete found submitting fake or suspicious documents will be declared ineligible for participation in training camps, financial assistance, or cash awards. Further disciplinary action might also be taken.
The notification pointed out that some athletes allegedly participate in age-specific categories using forged documents, depriving genuine athletes of opportunities and increasing the risk of injuries due to physical mismatches.
The PSB further noted that the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and other global sports bodies have repeatedly stressed the need for transparency and integrity in sports, calling for a zero-tolerance approach to age falsification.
“Only athletes who submit verified and accurate documentation will now be eligible to participate in PSB training camps and receive financial support or cash awards,” the notification concluded.
Earlier this month, the PSB took serious notice of officials in various sports federations holding positions beyond the permissible two terms, in violation of the National Sports Policy 2005.
The PSB issued warning letters to nine office-bearers from different federations who have exceeded the allowed tenure limits, according to a press release issued by the Board.
In May, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was postponed from its initial dates in May.

The 2015 deal, reached between Iran and the UN Security Council’s permanent members — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — plus Germany imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
But it unravelled when the United States in 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term as president, unilaterally withdrew from the accord and reimposed sweeping sanctions.
The Europeans had pledged continued support for the deal, but the mechanism intended to offset US sanctions never materialised effectively, and many Western firms were forced to exit Iran, which has since faced a deepening economic crisis.
“The European parties have been at fault and negligent in implementing” the nuclear agreement, said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei.
The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country currently enriching uranium to 60 per cent — far beyond the 3.67pc cap set by the 2015 accord.
That is a short step from the 90pc required for a nuclear weapon.
In recent weeks, France, Britain, and Germany have threatened to trigger the UN snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, accusing Iran of breaching its nuclear commitments.
Using this clause “is meaningless, unjustifiable and immoral”, Baqaei told a news conference, arguing that Iran only began distancing itself from the agreement in response to Western non-compliance.
“Iran’s reduction of its commitments was carried out in accordance with the provisions outlined in the agreement,” the foreign ministry spokesman added.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211314098c87a06.jpg?r=131452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925627/evidence-shows-jeju-air-pilots-shut-off-less-damaged-engine-before-crash-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence shows Jeju Air pilots shut off less-damaged engine before crash, source says</strong></a><br><p>The South Korea-led investigation into Jeju Air’s fatal plane crash in December has “clear evidence” that pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after a bird strike, a source with knowledge of the probe said on Monday.
The source said the evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, computer data and a physical engine switch found in the wreckage showed pilots shut off the left engine instead of the right engine when taking emergency steps after a bird strike just before it was scheduled to land.
“The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,” the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because investigators have not released an official report including this evidence.
A government source said examinations of the plane’s recovered engines found that no defects had been present before the bird strike and crash.
The December 29 crash of the Boeing 737-800 jet at Muan Airport killed all but two of the 181 passengers and crew members on board and was the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.
Investigators told victims’ family members at a briefing on Saturday that the right engine had been more severely damaged by a bird strike than the left, and there was circumstantial evidence that pilots had turned off the less-damaged left engine, according to a third source who was at the briefing.
South Korean media outlets including MBN and Yonhap reported that information on Saturday and Sunday.
South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), which is leading the investigation, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Boeing referred questions about the crash to ARAIB. Engine maker CFM International, a joint venture between GE GE.N and France’s Safran, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jeju Air said it was actively cooperating with the ARAIB’s investigation and awaiting the official announcement of the results.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
A preliminary report released in January said duck remains were found in both engines of the Jeju Air plane after the flight from Bangkok crashed at Muan Airport, but did not give details about the extent of remains or damage found in each engine.
Objections from victims’ families
South Korea’s investigation body on Saturday cancelled a planned release to media of an update on what is known so far about the engines.
Families of the crash victims were briefed on the report ahead of its planned release, but objected to its publication, saying that it appeared to apportion blame to the pilots without exploring other contributing factors, lawyers representing the families said.
The Jeju Air flight overshot Muan Airport’s runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment, leading to a fire and partial explosion.
Representatives of victims’ families and the Jeju Air pilots’ union said over the weekend that the investigation needs to also focus on the embankment, which aviation experts have said likely contributed to the high death toll.
 
 

The Jeju Air pilots’ union said the ARAIB was “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine given traces of bird remains were found in both engines.
The union accused the ARAIB of trying to make pilots “scapegoats” by failing to provide scientific and technological grounds that the plane could have landed safely with only the left engine turned on.
Air accidents are complex incidents that occur due to a number of contributing factors, and investigators have not produced evidence so far to support the implication that the accident was a result of pilot error, the union said.
Investigators are so far “silent about organisational responsibility”, the union said.
A body representing bereaved families said in a statement there were some phrases related to the cause of the accident in the planned press release that could be interpreted as if a final conclusion had been reached, and all facts surrounding the incident must be clarified.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:31</small></div><hr>
