<h2>News Archive – Past 7 Days</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041408349ba3ca1.png?r=140924' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928666/pm-shehbaz-chairs-high-level-meeting-in-gilgit-to-review-monsoon-damages' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz chairs high-level meeting in Gilgit to review monsoon damages</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday and chaired a high-level meeting to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June. Situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
Addressing a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains, PM Shehbaz termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.
He hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.
“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the top 10 countries that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” the premier noted.
Recalling the devastating 2022 floods, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”
PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.
Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.
He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.
The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of a Daanish School he had promised to the region. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.
Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.
 






The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.
“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” PTV said. He will also hold meetings with Governor Shah and CM Gulbar.
‘Federal govt cooperation akin to oxygen for GB’
In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.
“GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,” Faraq highlighted.
As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters.
 
 

“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.
Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were rescued today, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.
Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts.
On Friday, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members went missing after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.
Glof alert issued for GB, KP ahead of likely rains
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued an alert for an increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The alert noted that a wet spell was likely to affect both regions in the current week as “scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls”, were expected.
 






As per the PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country from today till Thursday.
 






At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04114532c7d468e.png?r=114715' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/5-family-members-stranded-due-to-floods-in-gb-rescued-after-4-days' target='_blank'><strong>5 family members stranded due to floods in GB rescued after 4 days</strong></a><br><p>Five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in Ghizer district of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) have been rescued and taken to a safe place on the other side of a river, Ghizer’s Rescue 1122 said on Monday.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.
According to Ghizer Rescue 1122’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.
“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told Dawn.com.
“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”
According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.
On Thursday, cloudburst-induced floods in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The next day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had resulted in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-04 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0411465280b75d2.png?r=133526' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928663/trailer-truck-crashes-in-karachis-dha-injuring-2-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Trailer truck crashes in Karachi’s DHA, injuring 2: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>A high-speed trailer truck crashed in Karachi’s upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Monday morning, injuring two people, according to Rescue 1122.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
According to a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Sindh, the trailer was travelling at a high speed when it crashed into a bungalow in DHA Phase 2.
He said that as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the urban search and rescue team, along with two ambulances and one disaster response vehicle, rushed to the scene.
“Two people trapped as a result of the collision were rescued safely,” he said, adding that they were transported to the hospital via ambulance with minor injuries. He added that both of the injured victims were trailer staff.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the two people trapped were the driver and cleaner of the trailer, who were rescued and taken to the hospital “after immediate medical assistance”.
“The police of the bungalow have contacted the owners, who are currently in Islamabad,” the DIG said.
He added that according to initial investigations, the accident occurred as a result of slippery conditions on the road due to rain.
Accidents frequently occur in the metropolis due to violations of traffic rules, with speeding and unsafe overtaking being major contributing factors. Speeding increases the risk of crashes and the severity of injuries, while unsafe overtaking often leads to head-on collisions.
Last month, a 59-year-old man was killed when a dumper truck ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad. The incident angered area residents, who damaged the truck and beat the driver before police intervened.
Earlier in the same week, at least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, while a separate collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p><small>2025-08-04 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0410485358356c1.jpg?r=104927' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928411/the-questions-behind-our-oil-reserves' target='_blank'><strong>The questions behind our oil reserves</strong></a><br><p>The US is cosying up to Pakistan. That is a major policy shift in Washington.
Announcing a trade deal with Pakistan last Thursday, Washington vowed to develop “massive oil reserves” in the country. “We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves. We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India someday!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That was a teasing comment for India, and it took some by surprise.
However, the question that began circulating immediately after was: Where is that massive resource located, and how big is it?
Pakistan has limited domestic energy resources. To meet its energy requirements, Pakistan is dependent on imports. State Bank data indicates that oil is its biggest import item — $11.3 billion in the year that ended June 2025 — accounting for nearly a fifth of the total import bill of the country.
Hitting crude oil and gas reserves in the country has been a long-held dream of Islamabad. Every successive government in Pakistan has aspired to tap the black gold reserves in the country, indeed, if any. Success has been elusive. Lack of incentives, proper policies, and non-availability of foolproof security have been cited as the major reasons behind this lack of success.

Security concerns and the requirement of massive inflows have in the past deterred investments in the country’s possible resources

In the past decade, too, the possibility of reserves was reported. But those were not ‘massive’. In 2015, a US Energy Information Administration report estimated up to 9.1bn barrels of technically recoverable shale oil in Pakistan, primarily in the Sembar and Ranikot formations — but these too remain unproven and speculative, says a source now based in Sicily, Italy.
 
 

According to the source, a more conservative 2017 US Geological Survey (USGS) assessment put the mean technically recoverable oil at only 164 million barrels, along with natural gas estimates; still not considered as proven reserves.
Exploring shale deposits needs considerable investment. To attract that, a secure environment is essential. That has been missing in Pakistan. In the absence of such an environment, oil majors were not interested in looking at the existing possibility and investing in Pakistan. In fact, over the last couple of decades, one could recall global oil majors, including Occidental Petroleum, Union Texas Pakistan, Eni of Italy and a few other smaller ones, exiting Pakistan. That presents a dismal outlook for Pakistan’s oil and gas sector.

But why has there been an abrupt U-turn in the US’s attitude towards Pakistan? After all, until recently, Islamabad was not a priority for Washington

What does the announcement about massive oil reserves in Pakistan mean? Has the security situation changed? Has there been any new interesting finds reported from Pakistan recently?
Late September last year, local and international media were buzzing with reports of a ‘massive’ oil and gas find in the offshore territory of Pakistan. According to some estimates, the find could be the “fourth largest” oil and gas reserve in the world.
The results of the find were made public after three years of extensive geological survey, conducted in partnership with an ‘allied nation’, reports then said. Who that ally was, it was not revealed then and remains a matter of speculation. There are, though, some indications that it could be Saudi Aramco. Some reports, however, felt the Emiratis could be involved in the mapping of this offshore possibility.
Some Pakistani officials were quoted in the media as saying then that the survey results confirmed the presence of massive resources in the Pakistani territory, pinpointing the exact location of the deposits. Similar announcements were also made in March 2019 when the then Prime Minister Imran Khan publicly disclosed the discovery of a massive field in the offshore territory of Pakistan. The possible find was even tipped by some as ‘Asia’s largest oil and gas reserve’.
But the announcement did not turn into a reality, and Mr Khan had to chew his words. Hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that there was a chance of discovering “massive reserves at the site by next week”, the Petroleum Division denied it, saying the drill did not yield the desired results.
“ExxonMobil, ENI, PPL [Pakistan Petroleum Limited], and OGDCL [Oil & Gas Development Limited] were conducting the drill at Kekra-1. More than 5,500-metre-deep drilling was conducted, but oil and gas reserves were not found. The drilling work has now been abandoned,” an official then told DawnNewsTV. In hindsight, it appeared that the announcement was made in haste, apparently for political reasons.
But not all hopes were dashed. In 2021, while Imran Khan’s government was still at the helm in Islamabad, a renewed effort was initiated by the government to pinpoint the presence of the asset in the territorial waters of Pakistan, with the help of an ‘allied nation’.
The efforts bore results after three years of extensive surveys. Last September, a senior, unnamed, Pakistani official told the media that the find was an opportunity to capitalise on the “blue water economy,” adding that proposals for bidding and exploration are under consideration, which could lead to the commencement of exploration activities soon.
But would Pakistan be able to capitalise on this opportunity? After all such explorations required a hefty investment of around $5bn, and it might take four to five years to extract reserves from the offshore location. With oil majors not keen to get back into Pakistan, from where Pakistan could muster such investment, remained a big if.
Oil majors did not appear to be rushing over to Pakistan to obtain a piece of the cake, Alex Kimani said in his September piece in Oilprice.com. The issue was how to bring out the assets from beneath the ground, and not a lack of assets beneath the surface.
Security remained a major concern. Speaking on behalf of the government, the then Petroleum Minister, Musadik Malik, told a parliamentary committee that oil majors were not interested in offshore oil and gas exploration in Pakistan.
It comes down to security and risk versus reward, Mr Malik told the committee, emphasising that the cost of security is a major deal-breaker because “in areas where companies search for oil and gas, they have to spend a significant amount to maintain security for their employees and assets”. And the security, provided by Pakistan, has not been up to the task.
The US involvement could significantly alter the situation. That is a silver lining, for sure. But why this abrupt U-turn in the American attitude towards Pakistan? After all, until recently, Pakistan was not at all a priority in Washington’s scheme of things. For the last couple of decades, Washington has overtly preferred India over Pakistan. Why this change, now?
This entire episode can be looked at differently, too.
Donald Trump is mercurial by nature. Is he using Pakistan as a pawn to increase pressure on India to make it yield to the American demands on opening up the large Indian markets to American goods, arms, F-35s and in the process ditch Russia?
On the part of the US, is this a strategic shift towards Pakistan, or just a tactical move to put pressure on India? That is a point to ponder indeed. After all, history tells us a disturbing story. We have been stung on this front many times in the past. This time could be no different, too.

Early on Sunday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B’Av, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.
“This sacrilege against one of Islam’s holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.
 






He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.
The prime minister said that Israel’s “shameless actions” were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.
“Pakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” PM Shehbaz added.
The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.
“The presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‘the Temple Mount is ours,’ are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‑Aqsa Mosque,” the statement said.
It said that Israel’s expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.
“These provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.”
The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‑Aqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 60,839 and injuring nearly 149,000 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office.
Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Last month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
On July 29, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the UN and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.

Yemeni security officials said 76 bodies had been recovered and 32 people rescued from the shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden. The UN’s migration agency said 157 people were on board.
The accident occurred off Abyan governorate in southern Yemen, a frequent destination for boats smuggling African migrants hoping to reach the wealthy Gulf states.
Some of those rescued have been transferred to Yemen’s Aden, near Abyan, a security official said.
UN agency the International Organisation for Migration earlier gave a toll of at least 68 dead.
The IOM’s country chief of mission, Abdusattor Esoev, told AFP that “the fate of the missing is still unknown.”
Despite the civil war that has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a key transit point for irregular migration, in particular from Ethiopia which itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict.
Each year, thousands brave the so-called “Eastern Route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea route last year, with 462 from boat accidents.
Last month, at least eight people died after smugglers forced migrants to disembark from a boat in the Red Sea, according to the UN’s migration agency.
The vessel that sank off Abyan was carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants, according to the province’s security directorate and an IOM source.
Yemeni security forces were conducting operations to recover a “significant” number of bodies, the Abyan directorate said on Sunday.
On their way to the Gulf, migrants cross the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Red Sea that is a major route for international trade, as well as for migration and human trafficking.
Once in war-torn Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, migrants often face other threats to their safety.
The IOM says tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Yemen and suffer abuse and exploitation during their journeys.
In April, more than 60 people were killed in a strike blamed on the United States that hit a migrant detention centre in Yemen, according to the Houthi rebels that control much of the country.

Here’s how it can win the water war</strong></a><br><p>On the morning of May 31, flow gauges on the Chenab River recorded an alarming decrease in the river flow. The development made headlines in the aftermath of the conflict between India and Pakistan, which broke out on May 7. As with a similar episode at the end of April, it led some to wonder anxiously: Can New Delhi shut Pakistan’s water supply just like that?
The bulk of Pakistan’s water supplies originate from three rivers — Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab — which are allocated under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Two of these western rivers are buffered by large dams on the Pakistani side: Tarbela on the Indus and Mangla on the Jhelum. Each can absorb changes in flow with little effect on irrigation deliveries. The Chenab, however, is different.
Pakistan does not have a Tarbela-sized reservoir here, and upstream on the Chenab River, India operates three modest dams (Baglihar, Salal and Dulhasti). A closure at these structures can therefore look, at first glance, like the country’s tap has been turned off.
 
 

Here, we explain why and how the Chenab River flows can be disrupted (not blocked). Then we discuss what potential disruptions later in the year may look like. And, through this, we illustrate that while Pakistan must press its case against India’s illegal violations of the IWT, it also has room through smarter water management to blunt the impact of any Indian actions.
Pakistan’s vulnerability
Begin with the Indus River, which has an average annual flow of roughly 75 billion cubic metres (BCM) — enough to fill about 30 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Two Indian run-of-river plants on the Indus River can together hold 0.02 BCM when their gates are closed — that is less than 0.03 per cent of the Indus’ annual flow, or only a few hours of discharge even in the low-water season. Once India’s small reservoirs fill, the water must spill onward, and the brief dent disappears inside normal reservoir operations downstream.
The situation on the Jhelum is similar. Mangla Dam on the Jhelum River sees about 27 BCM in an average year; Indian upstream infrastructure can store around 0.06 BCM, barely 0.2pc of the river’s flow. As things stand, and likely in the future, there is virtually no way India can cause any noticeable disruption to irrigation flows managed through the Indus and Jhelum rivers.
The Chenab, by contrast, reaches Marala with no Pakistani reservoir to cushion it. India’s infrastructure on the Chenab has a combined live storage — referred to as water that can be actively withheld or released — capacity of around 0.1 BCM.
This is where Pakistan’s water system is most vulnerable.
The Indian violations
Earlier in May, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) reported an unusual change in average daily flows of Chenab as it entered Pakistan via Marala Barrage. As illustrated in the figure below, the seemingly normal daily average flows of around 50,000 cusecs recorded on May 27 and 28 abruptly increased over the next two days and then drastically decreased on May 31 and June 1, before returning to expected levels on June 2 and onwards.
The average river flows of Chenab can vary significantly at this time of the year due to a combination of glacial melt, rainfall and water management practices. However, day-to-day changes in flows typically do not exceed 5,000 cusecs, and even if they do, they are typically linked to precipitation or snowmelt upstream in the basin and can therefore be predicted.
 


Here, though, the disruptions in Chenab’s daily average flows reported between May 28 and June 2 were induced via upstream reservoir operations, as confirmed by subsequent reports.
The abrupt rise in flows on May 29 and 30 was due to reservoir flushing (emptying) by India on the same days — a process where accumulated sediments are removed from a reservoir by releasing water at high flow rates, which helps restore the reservoir’s storage capacity and improve water quality. It can also help prevent flooding by managing water levels and mitigating the risk of sediment buildup.
The reported live capacity of India’s reservoirs on Chenab is 0.1 BCM, which equates to around 21,000 cusecs of surplus average daily flow across two days. This aptly explains most of the abrupt rise in the river flow on May 29 and 30.
The reservoir flushing was followed by reservoir filling — when water is gradually filled in the reservoir up to its intended operating level — on May 31 and June 1 (see red bars in the above figure for illustration), coinciding with the sharp fall in flows at Marala. Once India’s facilities reached their capacity, the flow returned to normal from June 2 onwards. The total water that reached Pakistan during these five days (May 28-June 2) did not change or decrease; only the timing of it was affected.
The disruption in the flow of the Chenab River always heavily depends on the time of the year and strategies used by India for the flushing and filling of its reservoirs. The IWT has predefined rules for flushing and filling and its abeyance, which means that India could i) flush or fill its reservoirs at will, and ii) choose any strategy to maximise impact on Pakistan.
The figure below illustrates what a hypothetical worst-case scenario may look like in dry winter months (November to January), when average daily flows in Chenab can reduce to 7000 cusecs or lower.
 


This worst-case scenario in Chenab during this time could feature quick flushing (lasting two days) resulting in a huge relative surge in flows at Marala barrage, followed by slow filling (due to naturally low winter flows) resulting in reduction of flows at Marala to a trickle that could last for around a week (as opposed to the two day disruption observed in May). Again, it is worth reiterating that even in this worst-case scenario, the volume of water in Chenab will not reduce. Only its timing would be altered.
How to blunt Indian actions
Can Pakistan manage this level of disruption in flows in Chenab? Pakistani policy makers see the answer in concrete. Last month, the government confirmed it is studying a Rs220 billion Chenab Dam that would add storage on the Chenab. A reservoir of that size could cushion sudden draw-downs, but building a dam is expensive and will take many years. Pakistan cannot afford to wait that long or spend that much before acting.
Fortunately, the most effective countermeasures do not hinge on new megastructures. Real-time telemetry, flexible canal rotations, and coordinated reservoir operations can be deployed within a single irrigation season at a fraction of the cost.
These quicker fixes are not theoretical. Pakistan’s irrigation system is already highly engineered and interconnected. When Irsa noticed these Indian induced disturbances, it released water from the Mangla Dam to compensate for reduced flows on May 31 and June 1 and meet the demands of farms served by canals linked to both Chenab and Jhelum rivers. However, the reduction in flows was preceded by a surge as well.
 
 

Hence, if flow monitoring, operational allocation decisions at various government levels, for example, Irsa provincial irrigation departments, and canal gate operations are managed with synchrony, time efficiency and adaptiveness, disruptions in Chenab can be handled effectively. Pakistan’s water management and operation authorities need to be swift in determining the start of a disruption event and adapting operations accordingly. As demonstrated by the country’s effective military response to Indian aggression, preparation is half the battle.
India’s recent treaty violations (and those in the future) must be contested through diplomatic channels, but Pakistan’s most effective countermeasures lie in the country’s own hands. First, adaptive and coordinated water management using real-time telemetry can allow irrigation engineers to modify crop rotations and reservoir operations as soon as unusual flow patterns are detected.
Second, the 10-day warabandi schedule can be made elastic. Warabandi is a rotational water distribution system used on both sides of the water to ensure equal water access for farmers. It involves preparing a fixed schedule for allocating water to each farm, ensuring that every landholder receives a predetermined share of water based on their landholding size.
Allowing a “floating start”, in which the entire rotation slides forward when an upstream interruption occurs, preserves each farmer’s share over the full cycle even if one day is lost. The change is administrative, not infrastructural, yet it converts a sudden change into a manageable rescheduling exercise.
None of these steps requires new legislation or massive investment. By adopting them while pressing its treaty case, Pakistan demonstrates that measured, data-driven management is the strongest reply to hydraulic theatre.
Violations purely for show
Annual reservoir flushing is not new. Schedule E of the Indus Waters Treaty explicitly allows India to flush its reservoirs to purge sediment, provided two conditions are met: (i) Pakistan receives advance notice, and (ii) the drawdown is timed for seasons when the water flow is high and the impact downstream is low.
For years, this coordination worked. Indian dams were flushed in the high-flow season, briefly dipping Marala’s gauges. The surge of summer meltwater masked the loss, and canal operations scarcely noticed. This is what has changed since India decided to put the treaty in abeyance unilaterally.
Reservoir flushing in late spring yields India little more than routine silt removal, but doing it without notice and unscheduled turns a maintenance chore into a prime-time spectacle for its domestic audience.
 
 

Several Indian television channels framed May’s drawdown as proof that “Pakistan’s water tap can be shut at will”, echoing the same outlets that aired fabricated claims of the Karachi port being destroyed during the recent skirmish. The pattern is clear: limited hydraulic facts are stretched into psychological warfare for domestic ratings. Such behaviour is unbecoming of a state that seeks regional or global leadership.
Violating the Indus Waters Treaty for a little more sediment flushing undermines New Delhi’s credibility far more than it inconveniences Pakistan’s canals. It advertises a willingness to bend rules for symbolic gain while delivering no tangible advantage in irrigation or power.
The temptation to answer theatre with theatre should be resisted. Pakistani media and officials are on firmer ground when they treat the incident as what it is: a violation that disrupts Chenab’s flow for a few days (while the total volume of water stays the same). Understanding and reporting the full context (rather than the hype) denies the tactic its intended psychological payoff.
India’s unscheduled sediment flushes can disrupt canal timetables for a few days, but it does not and cannot strangle Pakistan’s water supply. That reality should guide every response. Islamabad is right to demand that treaty rules on notice and timing be honoured. Yet the most convincing diplomatic brief is one backed by domestic readiness: gauges that speak in real time and a rotation calendar flexible enough to absorb short shocks. By improving its readiness, Pakistan can undercut the psychological edge of future draw-downs and strengthen its standing in any future negotiations. Proactive planning, not alarmist rhetoric, is the surest way to keep the Chenab flowing.</p><small>2025-08-04 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04114649d716364.png?r=114713' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928615/cambodia-pays-the-price-for-thai-internal-political-games' target='_blank'><strong>Cambodia pays the price for Thai internal political games</strong></a><br><p>BORDER clashes between Cambodia and Thailand are not new, but recent events highlight a deeper issue rooted not in territorial disputes, but in Thailand’s internal political conflict.
Since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand has experienced frequent military coups. Although not officially recognised, these coups often receive implicit support from the monarchy, especially when a civilian government becomes popular among the Thai public.
Today, tensions are rising again as the Thai military strategically positions itself to challenge the government of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was himself removed from power in a 2006 coup. To build domestic support for their political ambitions, the military is utilising a powerful force in Thai society: Nationalism.
To fuel this nationalist agenda, the Thai military started border clashes with Cambodia on May 28, killing Cambodian soldier Suon Rorn. Cambodia immediately expressed her intention to file a lawsuit with the ICJ for a peaceful resolution. However, Thai military leader Lieutenant General Boonsin Padklang reje­cted this approach and chose military confrontation over diplomacy.
The situation worsened when Thai soldiers were injured by landmines while patrolling what they claimed as Thai territory.
The mines were remnants from Cambodia’s civil war on Cambodian land that hadn’t been cleared. Instead of admitting their illegal cross-border activity, the Thai military accused Cambodia of negligence, and the Thai civilian government, competing with the military for popularity among Thai people, expelled Cambodia’s ambassador. They also closed access to key tourist sites, including Khmer temples inside Cambodian territory.
The most dangerous escalation occurred when the Thai military opened fire and crossed into Cambodia, damaging the Preah Vihear Temple, a Unesco World Heritage Site. They also targeted civilian sites in Cambodia, including religious sites and a hospital, which is prohibited by international law.
Civilian lives have been lost. Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet has called on Asean, the UN Security Council, and US President Donald Trump to intervene and force a peaceful resolution.

Pakistan won the series opener by 14 runs but dropped the second match by two wickets to set up a Sunday night decider at Lauderhill, Florida.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Pakistan were rewarded with a powerhouse performance by Farhan and Ayub.
 






Pakistan went 189 for four as Farhan hammered the hosts for 74 runs on 53 balls, smashing five sixes and three fours, while Ayub lasted 19 overs, finishing on 66 from 49 balls with two sixes and four fours.
Farhan was caught by West Indies captain Shai Hope at long off from a delivery by Shamar Joseph on the second ball of the 17th over.
Hasan Nawaz entered but was retired after only 15 runs, caught by Romario Shepherd at long off from a delivery by Roston Chase on the penultimate ball of the 18th over.
Mohammad Haris was run out for only two runs by Gudakesh Motie to start the 19th over and Ayub finally exited on the last ball of the penultimate over,
Jason Holder’s delivery grabbed by Sherfane Rutherford at sweeper cover.
Set 190 to win, West Indies struck for 30 runs on the first 10 balls from Hasan Ali and Mohammad Nawaz.
Jewel Andrew was caught by Hasan Ali at long on, bowled by Haris Rauf for 24, the first West Indies wicket falling at 44.
Ayub caught Hope bowled out by Nawaz for seven in the ninth over with the hosts still 116 runs from victory.
Alick Athanaze lasted 13 overs before being taken for 60, caught by Khushdil Shah bowled by Ayub with West Indies on 110, needing 80 runs off the last 42 deliveries.
Chase was retired on the last ball of the 17th over and his replacement, last-ball hero Holder from the win a night earlier, was bowled out by Sufiyan Muqeem two balls later for a duck, leaving the hosts 41 runs shy with 16 balls remaining.
Rutherford smashed a six to reach a half-century with seven balls remaining before exiting on 51 as West Indies couldn’t pull off another last-over comeback.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated the cricket team on its win, praising players’ determination and teamwork.
“Pakistani players won hearts by playing their best game,” he said in a statement. “Hopefully, the national team will continue to achieve successes in the future.”

The additional duties were revised just a day after US President Donald Trump announced on social media that he would help Pakistan develop its ‘vast oil reserves’.
The new trade deal — reached with the US just a day before the extended pause in the implementation of the global reciprocal tariffs was to end on August 1 — gives Pakistan a big duty advantage over India, which is hit with 25pc valorem duties and a slight edge over other competitors like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam who have been slapped with 20pc import duties.
President Trump had announced his higher ad valorem duties  — in addition to a universal 10pc base tariff — on dozens of countries running a trade surplus with America on April 2. In his executive order, he had stated that the “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States”.
Pakistan ran a trade surplus of $5.2 billion in 2024, with its total goods exports totalling $5.1bn and imports $2.1bn. The trade surplus showed an increase of 5.2pc over the previous year.
The additional tariffs were, however, suspended, initially until July 9 and later until July 31, in less than a week of their announcement to give the affected countries time to renegotiate new trade deals with the US.

Some of the peer countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which were at a much higher bracket before, got better treatment by Trump’s tariffs and are almost at par with Pakistan now

Commenting on the conclusion of the trade agreement with the US, Pakistan’s finance ministry said the deal gives the country a major opportunity to expand its footprint in the American market.
“In particular, this tariff level is expected to support Pakistan’s export potential, especially in key sectors such as textiles, which remain the backbone of the country’s export economy,” the ministry highlighted. The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.
The Pakistan government, it went on, “looks forward to further positive engagements and close cooperation with the United States in the areas of investment, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, mines & minerals, energy, and other emerging sectors.”
Trade and investment have to go hand in hand, said the country’s finance minister. He said that the bilateral and strategic partnership has come up prominently, adding, “I think we are in a good place today… in terms of where we have arrived before August 1.”
There is also satisfaction locally that Pakistan’s tariff rate is much lower than arch-rival India’s, CNN noted. Fears in Islamabad that India was trying to isolate Pakistan financially have been somewhat tempered by the 25pc tariff rate that the Trump administration hit New Delhi with after talks bogged down over access to its agriculture sector. On top of that, India also faces an unspecified penalty for its purchases of Russian oil.
Adviser to the finance minister Khurram Schehzad noted that the “deal signals a strategic deepening of economic ties and shared growth. The way Pakistan has been treated compared to different countries in this region, very encouraging and important,” he said, referring to the higher levy imposed on India. He also wrote on X that Pakistan is possibly the only country to which the US has offered its investments, as well as a competitive trade deal.
Nevertheless, some textile exporters like Interloop’s Mus­addiq Zulq­ernain cautioned against attaching too many hopes to the reduced tariff. “It, indeed, is a good development, given the fact that a higher tariff could have hit us. That we got a deal on par with our peers is absolutely an advantage.”
However, he said, “the higher tariff on India will not help us increase our goods exports to the US because Indian industry is way more competitive than ours. If we want to capture India’s market share in the US, we would have to work on enhancing our competitiveness.”
Then, he pointed out, India is still negotiating a new deal with Washington in spite of the initial setback. “What if it succeeds in clinching a better deal than ours, say, in the next few weeks or even a couple of months?” That’s not all.
“We don’t yet know if our agreement is final and aligns with the US on economic and national-security matters (as demanded by President Tru­mp)”. Pakistan falls in the category of countries which, according to the July 31 executive order of President Trump, have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States.
“The order states that the countries failing to reach an agreement on security commitments with the US could face a higher tariff. The situation remains a bit uncertain even if the revised duty structure provides us with some sort of clarity for the next few months,” he argued.
President Trump’s executive order says “… some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in (the previous executive order of April 2), and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.”
It goes on: “other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the US on economic and national-security matters.”
According to the executive order, if a trading partner fails to take “adequate steps” to address the tariffs or retaliates against the US, Washington could take additional action. It says the countries failing to conclude meaningful trade and security commitments with the US could face 10pc and ad valorem duties on top of reciprocal tariffs.
In a note, Topline Security maintains that the trade deal with the US is largely neutral. “Unlike the market vibes and perception after the US president tweeted about the signing of a deal with Pakistan, the pact seems to be less exciting for Pakistan.” It also points out that some of the peer countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which were at a much higher bracket before, got a better treatment and are almost at par with Pakistan now.
Vietnam was initially imposed with tariffs of 46pc and Bangladesh was hit with a tariff of 37pc. Others like Sri Lanka and Thailand have also got better terms than previously proposed.
Textile comprises 75-80pc of Pakistan’s exports to the US, the brokerage said. In textiles and clothing, it said, Pakistan largely competes with China, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. “The duties imposed on China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh were much higher than those on Pakistan initially. However, the revised duties are more or less equal to Pakistan, thus leaving no competitive edge to Pakistan, in our view, except for cheaper labour.
“This deal will nonetheless help the country to remain competitive with direct competitors, without giving it any significant advantage over its peers.” It further states that China’s talks will further determine the competitiveness of Pakistan and other countries facing a deadline of August 12, since Beijing is the US’s largest supplier.
The US is Pakistan’s single largest export market. Recently, Pakistan’s goods exports to the US have consistently increased. In the first 11 months of FY25, exports to the US rose by 11.06pc to over $5.5bn from nearly $5bn a year earlier. In FY24, Pakistan’s textiles exports to the US reached $5bn, representing 92pc of its overall exports to that country.
Khurram Mukhtar, former chairman of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, says the country’s exports to the US are already rising. “The American buyers are very bullish on Pakistan at the moment because we have the entire supply chain here. But if we want to take advantage of the lower tariff than our competitors, we will have to improve our competitiveness by reducing our cost of doing business.”

Rajanpur District Police Officer (DPO) Farooq Amjad told Dawn that Saqlain, son of Ghulam Sadiq, a resident of Muhammad Pur Dewan, had contracted marriage with Ayesha Bibi, a year ago, without the consent of her family.
He said that on Sunday, when the couple was in their house, the armed suspect barged in and opened indiscriminate fire, leaving his sister and her husband dead on the spot.
The DPO said that on being informed of the incident, the police acted promptly and arrested the suspect.
 
 

The police, after collecting evidence from the crime scene, moved the bodies to the hospital for autopsy.
According to initial investigation, the double murder was committed over ‘honour’. A case is yet to be registered.
NOSE CHOPPED OFF: Four assailants chopped off the nose of a man in a brutal attack in the limits of Kot Mubarak police station on Sunday.
According to the police, four men attacked Jumma Oghani, a resident of Jumma Chowk, and after overpowering him, chopped off his nose with a sharp object, leaving him seriously injured.
The injured man was shifted to hospital.
Police sources say that the victim was in litigation with the attackers.
Police are conducting raids to apprehend the culprits.

On the other hand, the railways has earned a record revenue of over Rs7.48bn in the first month (July) of the ongoing fiscal year 2025-26. The revenue is Rs1.46bn more than the July of the last fiscal, Dawn has learnt.
“During the last couple of fiscal years, we did a lot of repair work at the railway track in Sukkur division—the most troubled area in terms of decaying railway track. Due to massive works, wherein we even replaced various decaying stretches of the track (ML-1) with new ones, the number of derailments declined. Now the track in Sukkur division has improved compared to the past,” PR Chief Executive Officer Amir Ali Baloch explained by phone when asked why the PR was not focusing on the track rehabilitation.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn on Sunday, he said that despite meager financial resources, the PR has improved its passenger and freight train operations and other revenue streams. Under the federal government’s Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the FY 2025-26, Rs22bn has been given to the railways. Of these, Rs12bn would be spent only on the infrastructure-related projects including tracks’ rehabilitation and repair of signaling and communication systems.

Targets Rs100bn revenue by the end of fiscal in June next year

Mr Baloch said the PR had succeeded in massively decreasing its dependency on the federal government as the department was meeting most of its expenses with its own financial resources.
“We didn’t get even a single penny from the federal government for refurbishment of passengers coaches, turning Lahore and other major railway stations into modern ones having escalators, state of the art toilets, washrooms, waiting rooms, dining rooms, dining on wheels, provision of WiFi service in trains, vigilance, online booking, track tracking and several other developments,” Mr Baloch said, adding that the number of accidents caused by derailments were declining fast compared to the situation with previous years.
Talking about income of the railways, the CEO said: “While July 2025-26 figure shows that revenue earned this month was Rs1.46bn more than the last year’s July,by end of the ongoing fiscal year on June 30 next year, the department is most likely to touch a figure of Rs100bn”.
 
 

It is pertinent to mention that in the last fiscal that ended on June 30, the railways had earned Rs93bn that included Rs47bn and Rs31bn from passenger and freight trains, respectively. Rs1.5bn were earned through military goods operation through rail, Rs3bn from other coaches’ operations and Rs9bn from other miscellaneous resources.
In the year 2023-24, the PR had earned Rs88bn revenue, Rs15bn more than the target. In 2018-19, the PR’s total income touched the figure of Rs45bn that increased to Rs48.5bn in 2020-21 and Rs63.5bn in 2022-23 fiscal years.
In 2024-25, the railways Karachi division remained on top in passenger revenue with Rs15bn, followed by Lahore with over Rs11bn. In the freight sector, the Karachi division topped with a record earning of Rs28bn, followed by Multan division that earned Rs1bn.
“Though we are already doing our best to improve our operations and revenues, we aim to make our train operations safer and more comfortable for the passengers,” the railways CEO claimed.

“Around 20 armed men attacked the 132kV grid station in the wee hours, causing massive damage to the grid station,” Qesco officials said on Sunday.
The armed men snatched the 12-bore rifle from the security guards and vandalised the premises while holding the staff at gunpoint. They opened fire inside the grid station, damaging the control room, high-power transformer, current transformers, conservator tank, radiator tubes, AC/DC panels, auxiliary panels, and other essential electrical equipment, according to a Qesco spokesperson.
After holding the staff and guards at gunpoint for some time, the attackers reportedly threatened them to vacate the premises immediately or risk losing their life. Subsequently, the staff and guards fled to safety.
Later, Qesco officials submitted a written complaint to the local police station to lodge an FIR against the attackers.
Separately, some men sabotaged the 132kV Yaro industrial transmission line near Kuchlak Bypass by creating a technical fault using ropes.
 
 

During a joint patrolling operation with local administration and police, nearly 700m of conductors and various electrical components were found stolen.
The electric company later filed a written request with the police to pursue legal action against those behind the transmission line theft.
The spokesperson expressed serious concern over the rising number of sabotage and theft incidents targeting power infrastructure in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Dasht, and Sibi in recent weeks. The attacks not only disrupted power supply but also posed a significant threat to public safety and national assets, he added.
The Qesco appealed to all consumers to assist in protecting national infrastructure by reporting any suspicious activity related to theft or tampering of transmission lines.

• Punjab gears up for sixth spell of heavy rains
ISLAMABAD: At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday.
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country.  The dead include 102 men, 57 women and 140 children, while the injured include 239 children, 204 women and 272 men.
The severe weather has also caused widespread destruction, damaging a total of 1,676 houses, according to the agency’s data.
Of those, 562 homes were completely destroyed while 1,114 sustained partial damage.
The floods also led to the loss of 428 livestock, compounding the impact on local communities.
In response, the NDMA said it has carried out 223 rescue operations, successfully evacuating 2,880 people from flood-hit regions.
The authority has distributed more than 13,400 relief items to affected communities. These include almost 2,000 tents, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, and over 1,100 food packs.
Relief teams have also provided 1,282 kitchen sets, 350 life jackets, 1,122 hygiene kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps, among other essential items.
Medical support has been mobilised, with 71 camps set up to treat those affected by the disaster. So far, 577 people have received medical attention.
The NDMA said the crisis has affected multiple regions, with joint relief operations underway in collaboration with provincial and federal agencies.
As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.
Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit-Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.
Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.
Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.
Next spell likely to be heavier
In Punjab, Director General (DG) Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia warned residents on Sunday to prepare for a sixth round of heavy monsoon rains starting Aug 5.
“The ongoing rains could lead to medium to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with the risk expected to begin from Aug 5,” Mr Kathia said.
According to PDMA, monsoon rains in August are expected to be heavier than those experienced last month. Rain is predicted in dozens of districts, including Lahore, Mur­ree, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhu­pura, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Mian­wali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Khanewal, and Rajanpur.
The warning advised of a specific risk of landslides in the tourist destinations of Murree and Galliyat, where weak buildings and mud houses could also be damaged.

• Season comes to a close with climbers returning from K2, Broad Peak ‘empty handed’
FOR mountaineers, the mighty peaks in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Karakoram range became unusually precarious this year due to changing weather patterns, which have brought with them an increase in avalanches, rockfalls and other life-threatening hazards.
The mountains are comparatively dry, having lost much snow cover, and hence prone to avalanches — sometimes several times a day.
Baqir Ali, a mountain guide with four decades of experience, said he had never experienced such conditions on the peaks in his entire career.
A resident of Shigar’s Askole village, Mr Ali was part of Laura Dahlmeier’s team. The German Olympian recently perished after being struck by a rockfall at Laila Peak (6,096m).
“Several days before the incident, a French expedition team had cancelled their plan to attempt to climb Laila Peak due to the unfavourable weather condit­ions at the peak,” the 56-year-old told Dawn.
He said he had asked the German climber to do the same, but she continued her ascent in the alpine style — and at an altitude of 5,700m, she became the victim of falling rocks on July 28.
These precarious conditions made Hungary’s László Csomor abandon his expedition to Broad Peak (8,050 m) after more than a month and return to Skardu on Saturday.
His seven-member team had been at the base camp since June 27, hoping to summit the mountain. They, however, decided to call off the adventure, like more than two hundred climbers who had come to Pakistan to ascend its mighty peaks.
“This year, there was less snow at all mountains; rockfall was unusual; we would hear the sound of rockfall and snow avalanches 10 times in a day while sitting at the base camp,” László said, adding that he climbed to Camp 3 twice, but could not start the summit push due to bad weather. He blamed these conditions on less snow cover, saying that with enough snow, such threats diminish.
He said more than 90 climbers had been waiting at the base camp to summit K-2, while 30 mountaineers had been waiting to begin the Broad Peak adventure for the last month. Both peaks share the same base camp. Most of them have had to return with heavy hearts, as the climbing season for the Karakoram peaks nears its end.
László was also a witness to two accidents during his stay at the base camp – on July 11, Polish climber Waldemar Kowalewski fractured his leg in an avalanche on Broad Peak at 6,500m; while on July 19, porter Iftikhar Sadpara lost his life in a similar incident on K2’s Camp 1, located 500m above the base camp.
At least three people were killed and five were injured in such incidents during this season.
New challenges
“These conditions at the Karakoram range were new, and it was also challenging to climb the peaks because the snow was steep and unstable,” László said, adding that a decrease in snowfall made the slopes and hanging rocks prone to falls and avalanches, while crevasses had become bigger.
High winds also made the climb difficult. The foreign climber believed these changes were linked to climate change.
Mingma G, owner of Imagine Nepal and a renowned climber, also abandoned his Gasherbrum-II summit attempt due to avalanche risks. Traditionally, the climbing season for these peaks spans late June to mid-August. But this year, the risks are unusually high, forcing scores to abandon their summits.
“The weather at the peaks is not normal this year,” said Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator. Mr Qadri told Dawn that K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-II and many other seven-thousanders remained unclimbed in the summer, while a few summits at Gasherbrum-I and Nanga Parbat were recorded.
He said some climbers were still at the K2 base camp, to try their luck. However, the season is over and this summer, none of the climbers could move past Camp 3 on K2.
This year, about 22 climbers, including five Pakistanis, scaled Gasherbrum-I (8,080 m) on July 20 and July 22, whereas at least 24 mountaineers, including foreigners, summited Nanga Parbat (8,126m) in the Himalayas.
Distressing situation
Veteran Russian climber Denis Urubko and his wife Maria Cardell summitted Nanga Parbat in alpine style while also charting a new route for ascent in July. Currently, he is in Skardu and plans to scale K2 via a new route. However, he said the situation in the mountains was distressing.
“Glaciers and snow on mountains are melting fast, crevasses are becoming larger, and rockfall occurrences have become routine in the GB mountains,” Mr Urubko said.
He said the “classical route” to summit Nanga Parbat had also become a dangerous route due to speedy snowmelt, adding that these factors had made risks in the mountains higher than usual.
A senior government expert blamed these conditions on changes in the snowfall patterns induced by global warming. He said the region received snow late in the year, and it could not be converted into ice before the summer and thus remained unstable. In addition to that, the heatwave in June and July exacerbated the situation, leading to an unusual number of avalanches.
Livelihoods in danger
As mountains become precarious for climbers, the livelihoods of those who are linked to the tourism industry have also taken a hit. Out of 400 applications received by the GB tourism department, only over 200 climbers from multiple countries arrived to attempt summits, almost 50 per cent down from the previous year.
Thousands of people, including transporters, shopkeepers, hotel owners, porters, mountain guides, and tour operators, depend on the industry for income. Fida Hussain, a high-altitude porter from Shigar, feared that with the reduction of adventure tourism activities, they would also be left without jobs and income.

The results based on a survey of more than 1,100 leaders from government, industry, civil society and academia across 136 countries, paints a stark picture of mounting vulnerabilities that threaten to overwhelm international institutions and destabilise societies.
Environmental risks, including climate change inaction, large-scale pollution, and biodiversity loss, dominate the list of concerns, with the report warning that these crises are both highly likely and potentially catastrophic.
Yet, the report also highlights a worrying lack of preparedness for emerging threats such as space-based events, pandemics, and the rapid advance of frontier technologies.
The report concludes with a call from UN secretary-general for the immediate creation of a task team to strengthen the organisation’s capacity to address risks in the information ecosystem.

Environmental challenges and disinformation top list of vulnerabilities

The UN Department of Global Communications has already begun work to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the delivery of the UN’s mandate. The report’s authors warn that global vulnerabilities are being exacerbated by weak governance, a lack of political consensus, and the erosion of state sovereignty.
“One thing is clear when looking out on this landscape of global risk: ultimate responsibility lies with today’s leaders,” UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming said.
“They face a stark choice: breakdown, or break through to a better tomorrow — one in which we all live in peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet.”
The survey found that multilateral institutions are least prepared to address five critical risks: outer space, cybersecurity breakdowns, the proliferation of non-state actors, mis- and disinformation, and the erosion of state sovereignty.

• Blames rupee devaluation for hike despite near same fuel prices
ISLAMABAD: The price of electricity is expected to increase by one-fourth over the next eight years, according to a power division forecast, after a 50per cent increase in the past three years due to massive currency devaluation.
The average tariff is projected at Rs29.70 per unit by 2034, up by Rs5.70 from the existing rate of Rs24, said the power division in a working paper shared with stakeholders in the last week of July.
The report said the increase in tariffs over the last three years can largely be attributed to the rupee’s depreciation which led to “second round effects of inflation and a contractionary monetary policy that further escalated overall tariff”.
The average power purchase rates increased by almost 50pc from Rs16.77 per unit to Rs24.88 between FY2022 and 2025.
This included about a 115pc increase in annual capacity charges from Rs971bn to about Rs2.1tr, although energy payments slightly dropped by 11pc from Rs1.43tr to Rs1.27tr.
All in all, power purchase rates increased by almost 250pc to Rs24.88 per unit in FY2025 from Rs7.17 per unit in FY2016 before the induction of mega power projects, mostly under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as capacity charges surged from Rs275bn to Rs2.1tr, an increase of 660pc, according to the power division.
Exchange rate impact
The power division said the average base tariff largely remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY25 in dollar terms ($0.12 per unit).
However, due to exchange rate losses, effective base rate jumped 44pc to Rs35.50 per unit from Rs25 as capacity charges increased by 66pc to Rs18.4 per unit compared to Rs11 per unit.
The energy price was reported at Rs10.94 per unit in FY25 against Rs10.2 in FY23, a nominal change. According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.
The fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.
Therefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.
The overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.
Despite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.
Going forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.
Deindustrialisation
The power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.
“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.
The power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.
Further compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.
The power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.

The party leaders, a maj­ority of whom are in Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), have decided to att­end parliamentary sessions after getting relief from courts.
The Leader of the Opposition in National Ass­e­mbly, Omar Ayub Khan, told Dawn that all legal options would be used to get relief and till that time he and other leaders including Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza and Zartaj Gul Wazir would not attend sessions of the National Assembly and Senate.
“I have asked my lawyer Babar Awan to complete documentation and file a case. Other leaders will also do the same,” he said.
When asked in which courts, application for bails and stay orders would be filed, Omar Ayub said that applications would be filed in different courts. However, he made it clear that they would not come in public before getting bails.
Last week, Omar  Ayub refused to meet the CJP on Supreme Court premises, or in Islamabad, citing the possibility of his arrest due to warrants issued against him. Replying to a question, he said that MNA Abdul Lateef has already sought a stay order and the same will be done by other leaders.
The Peshawar High Court last week stopped the Election Commission of Pakistan from proceeding further on de-notifying a PTI MNA from Chitral Abdul Lateef and declaring his seat vacant.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal issued notices to respondents including ECP and the National Assembly speaker seeking their response to a petition filed by MNA Abdul Lateef challenging the order of the ECP of disqualifying him and subsequent notification of declaring his seat vacant by de-notifying him as an MNA on July 29, 2025. The bench fixed Aug 20 for next hearing of the petition.
Mr Ayub Khan and other PTI leaders, who have been sentenced 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots, have been hoping to get a similar relief.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting against the arrest of party founder Imran Khan, had staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings.
Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including PTI leaders, were arrested.
Out of 185 PTI workers, 108 have been sentenced by the court. PTI’s MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, MNA Zain Qureshi, and former party leader Fawad Chaudhry were acquitted in the cases.

While Comsats currently has a temporary rector, the position at IIUI remains vacant. Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, who had been looking after the affairs of IIUI in his capacity as chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC), completed his term on July 29 and is no longer serving as the rector.
The Ministry of Science and Technology is the line ministry for Comsats, while the Ministry of Federal Education supervises IIUI.
The post of Comsats rector has been vacant since July 2023, following the resignation of Dr Mohammad T. Afzal. Subsequently, the university’s chancellor - the then president Dr Arif Alvi - assigned the look-after charge to Senior Dean Prof Dr Sajid Qamar, who continues to serve in that capacity on an ad-hoc basis. Several other key positions at Comsats, including the registrar’s office, are also being run on a temporary basis.

Posts at public sector universities fell vacant in 2023 and since then permanent heads could not be appointed

Similar is the situation at the IIUI. The post became vacant in November 2023 after the Supreme Court removed then rector Dr Samina Malik and directed that the HEC chairman or a permanent HEC member nominated by him would oversee the rector’s responsibilities until a regular appointment was made.
Following the directive, then HEC chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed assumed additional charge as the IIUI rector. However, with the completion of his term on July 29, the university is again without a rector. Although the prime minister assigned the secretary federal education the additional charge of HEC chairman for three months or until a regular appointment, no steps have been taken to fill the IIUI rector position.
“As of today, there is no rector in our university,” said an IIUI official.
A senior officer from the Ministry of Education claimed that the process was underway to assign the charge of the rector to someone soon. However, university officials have voiced concern over why the position has remained vacant since October last year despite the court’s directive.
Meanwhile, the issue of Comsats’ rector has seen even longer delays. In September 2023, following a competitive selection process, a panel of three candidates was submitted to the President’s Office for final approval. After thorough consideration, President Asif Ali Zardari in his capacity as the Comsats Chancellor approved the appointment of Dr Shahid Munir with the Ministry of Science and Technology issuing a notification on September 23, 2024.
However, Dr Munir did not take charge as Comsats rector as he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, on the same day. Since then, the matter has remained unresolved.
According to a Comsats official, the issue is likely to be resolved soon, as the university’s senate, its supreme decision-making body, was expected to meet in the third week of August to deliberate on the appointment.

Mr Niazi was taken into custody near the shrine of Baba Shadi Shaheed in Bhimber district while returning from Samahni to Bhimber city—constituency of incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq—to lead another rally as part of PTI’s mobilisation campaign for the August 5 protests, called by the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan.
Mr Niazi had spent Saturday night in Mirpur but, anticipating his arrest, left his accommodation via a back exit and used someone else’s vehicle to reach Samahni.
There, he led a rally from Pir Galli to Samahni from 2pm to 4pm, urging people to participate in large numbers in the upcoming protest against both the “unlawful arrest” of Mr Khan and India’s abrogation of occupied Jammu and Kashmir’s special status six years ago.
According to Mr Niazi’s press secretary, Habib Ahmed, a large contingent of police led by SSP Mirpur Khurram Iqbal intercepted his entourage and detained him.
Mr Niazi was among several PTI leaders—including former President Dr Arif Alvi—who were booked on November 24 last year at Karachi Company police station in Islamabad under seven sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, two provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, and one clause of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance.
His nephew, Advocate Sardar Moteeb, told Dawn that Mr Niazi had secured protective bail from the Islamabad High Court on July 13, which was further extended on July 26 until August 17.
“Despite this, Islamabad police had new arrest warrants issued based on additional charges,” he said.
Eyewitnesses said that apart from AJK policemen, the arresting party included nearly 20 plainclothed officials, reportedly from Islamabad police.
However, DIG Mirpur region Dr Liaqat Ali clarified to Dawn that Mr Niazi was taken into custody on the orders of the Mirpur deputy commissioner under Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
“Given his health condition, he has been kept at the Industrial Area rest house in Mirpur, which has been declared a sub-jail by the deputy commissioner,” he added.
The DIG also rejected reports that two PTI activists accompanying Mr Niazi were also arrested.
Soon after news of Mr Niazi’s arrest spread across the region, PTI workers staged protest demonstrations in various areas, blocking roads and burning tyres.
Meanwhile, in a statement issued from the United States, where he is currently on a private visit, PTI regional information secretary and former minister Chaudhry Maqbool Gujjar condemned what he called the “uncalled-for arrest” of Mr Niazi on “frivolous charges,” accusing Prime Minister Haq of betrayal.
“Anwarul Haq owes his return to the AJK Assembly after a decade to PTI’s platform and Imran Khan’s personal campaigning. It’s shameful that the same man is now ordering crackdowns on party workers who are peacefully demanding Khan Sahib’s release,” he said.

They were addressing a joint press conference in their newly-established district office in Shahmansoor Town here on Sunday flanked by various other leaders of the party.
Mr Qaiser said: “With the August 5 rally, we are launching a movement for the release of our leader, securing the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in the country.”
Tarakai said: “The central and provincial leaders and the allied partners have decided that this time, there will be various protests. This is a movement and we will continue it till achieving our goals.”

Qaiser, Tarakai ask govt not to allow military operations in merged areas

He said: “We will not allow military operations in the merged districts in any way. The provincial government should implement Imran Khan’s orders in this regard. We want education and business instead of guns, and we also want good trade relations with Afghanistan.”
He said that August 5 would be observed as a black day, marking the two years since the incarceration of Imran Khan.
He claimed that according to the Constitution, if a person’s case was not decided within a year, then he should be released on bail after that period, but regretted that Imran was being kept behind bars ‘unjustifiably’.
“We want an open trial of Imran Khan and other PTI leaders and workers in the presence of the media in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding, ‘when the judge is yours, the witness is yours, and the testimony is yours, then we don’t accept it’.
Tarakai called for the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the incidents of May 9, with a view to identifying those responsible and ensuring accountability under the law of the land. He said that after the 26th Amendment, judiciary no longer remained independent.
He said that the federal government was responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the merged districts.
The two leaders admitted that there were internal differences in PTI but declared it part of the democratic process and beauty of democracy, claiming that PTI’s leaders and workers followed Imran Khan’s directives.
“Despite all the difficulties, obstacles, internal differences and the punishment of our leaders, PTI leaders and workers will reach Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday,” said Mr Qaiser.
“We are focused on Tuesday’s gathering, which will prove a milestone in securing the release of the party founder,” he said.
Mr Qaiser and Mr Tarakai said though their arrest warrants had been issued they were not afraid of such tactics by the hybrid government, which had ‘stolen’ the PTI’s mandate.
“We have completed our homework for the Lahore rally and the government should not create any obstacles in the way of peaceful protests,” said Qaiser.

Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told Dawn on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional agreement of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.
Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.
“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.

Third round of talks between local elders and terrorists continues for several hours

On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook post also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.
However, in a social media post shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.
 
 

Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.
The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.
ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.
They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, bombing at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.
The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.
JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.
“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.
He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.
The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.
 
 

Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.
The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.
The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.

Pakistan and Iran vowed to further expand their land and rail route linkages. 
The two sides made these commitments when Iranian Minister for Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh, who accompanied the Iranian president on the official visit to Pakistan, participated in the joint meeting held with federal ministers Abdul Aleem Khan, Jam Kamal Khan, and Hanif Abbasi.
According to an official press release, the discussions focused on strengthening the longstanding friendly and bilateral relations between the two countries, particularly by enhancing transportation, connectivity network and road infrastructure.
During the meeting, interest was expressed by Iran in joining the Silk Road initiative with Pakistan and China and discussed expanding of maritime trade via Gwadar-Chabahar route. 
Welcoming the Iranian delegation, Aleem Khan congratulated Iranian minister on Iran’s firm stand against Israel and termed it a matter of pride and solidarity for the entire Muslim World. He said that Pakistan and Iran have always stood by each other while recent regional developments have brought the two nations more close to each other.
Mr Aleem Khan invited the Iranian minister to attend the upcoming ministerial conference in Pakistan on Oct 23-24. 
Speaking on the occasion, Iranian Minister Farzaneh Sadegh expressed her deep appreciation for Pakistan’s support against Israeli aggression and extended sentiments of goodwill to the people of Pakistan.
She stressed the need for increasing the number of vehicles operating between Iran and Pakistan and suggested modernising the current Quetta-Zahedan route. 
The Pakistan side proposed forming of bilateral working groups of the two countries to accelerate the implementation of agreed initiatives.
During the meeting, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan briefed the Iranian delegation on opportunities to expand trade volume and highlighted the significant untapped potential across various sectors. 
He noted that both countries could serve as viable markets for each other.
Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to review the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul Railway Projects, adding that the Quetta-Zahedan railway line would be upgraded and expanded to improve regional connectivity.
Iranian Minister Farzaneh Sadegh thanked her Pakistani counterparts and assured full cooperation from her country.
She described her visit to Pakistan as highly pleasant and memorable.
