The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed by 941.79 points, or 0.82 per cent, to stand at 116,411.13 from the previous close of 115,469.34 at 10:05am.
However, at 1:49pm, selling pressure ensued as the index decreased by 410.08 points, or 0.36pc, to stand at 115,059.26 from the previous close.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, attributed the initial bull run to “stronger-than-expected corporate results from heavyweight companies fuelled a surge in the index at the opening”.
“Meanwhile, the absence of further escalation in tensions between Pakistan and India helped prevent panic selling in the KSE-100,” he added.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted that the country’s monthly current account remained “in a comfortable position”, in addition to corporations “posting strong profits”.
In other positive developments, Farooq added that inflation was at a record low, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) stood at 101.
“The market opened slightly higher today, supported by relief that no major escalation occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend [following the Pahalgam attack],” he added.
“With most market participants expecting interest rate cuts ahead, there is potential for a rerating of the market’s PE [price-to-earning] multiple,” he said.
“However, a significant upward move will likely require de-escalation between India and Pakistan.”
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, also attributed the early positive momentum to “dust settling down” between Pakistan and India after the Pahalgam attack, with  “no major incidents” supporting market recovery.
Last week, the April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations had unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
AKD Securities noted that the market had remained volatile last week due to escalating geopolitical tensions following the Pahalgam attack, and India’s subsequent suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan in the aftermath of the incident, undermining investor sentiment.</p><small>2025-04-28 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28125916afbfcc2.png?r=132128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907114/16-pakistani-youtube-channels-banned-in-india-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>16 Pakistani YouTube channels banned in India after Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>The Indian government has banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels on recommendations from its Ministry of Home Affairs, Pakistani and Indian media outlets reported on Monday.
Tensions have risen between the two Asian nations following a recent attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
The YouTube channels blocked by the Indian authorities include those of Dawn News, Samaa TV, ARY News, Geo News, Bol News, and Raftar.

Journalists whose channels were banned included Irshad Bhatti, Asma Shirazi, Umar Cheema, and Muneeb Farooq.
Dawn.com confirmed that these YouTube channels could not be accessed in India.
No authority or official in Pakistan has commented on the matter so far.
Even renowned former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar’s channel was not spared.
The Pakistan Experience, a podcast channel by content creator Shehzad Ghias, said it was also banned in India.
“Is our minor podcast a national security risk?” it quipped in a [post on X][9, sharing a screenshot of a message by YouTube addressed to the podcast account.
 


“In my opinion, Uzair Younus and I did quite a sensible balanced discussion on the issue. There is nothing in this podcast that warranted us getting banned in India,” Ghias asserted on X, sharing a link to the video titled ‘Are India and Pakistan about to go to war? - The aftermath of the Pahalgam incident’.
The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claimed that these YouTube channels were pushing “false narratives” against India, its army and security agencies.
The Indian authorities further alleged that these channels were spreading “provocative, communally sensitive” content aimed at “inciting communal tensions”.
On April 24, a day after India announced a slew of measures, Indian media reported that the Modi-led regime had blocked the Pakistani government’s X account in the country as tensions escalated between the neighbours.</p><small>2025-04-28 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28131016d8450ef.gif?r=133443' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907120/canada-votes-for-new-government-to-take-on-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Canada votes for new government to take on Trump</strong></a><br><p>Canada elects a new government on Monday to confront annexation threats from the United States and deal directly with US President Donald Trump, whose trade war has defined the campaign.
The Liberal Party, led by new Prime Minister Mark Carney, looked set to lose easily to the Conservatives’ Pierre Poilievre until the US president’s attacks on the country sparked a sudden reversal in poll forecasts.
Carney, 60, has never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month. He had a lucrative career as an investment banker before serving as the central bank governor in both Canada and Britain.
 
 

Carney has argued his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada’s response to Trump’s tariffs.
He has also promised to revitalize internal trade and expand Canada’s economic opportunities abroad to cut reliance on the United States, a country Carney says “we can no longer trust.”
The United States under Trump “wants to break us, so they can own us,” he has warned repeatedly through the campaign.
“We don’t need chaos, we need calm. We don’t need anger, we need an adult,” Carney said in the campaign’s closing days.
Poilievre, a 45-year-old career politician, has tried to keep the focus on domestic concerns that made Trudeau deeply unpopular toward the end of his decade in power, especially soaring living costs.
The Tory leader has argued Carney would bring a continuation of what he calls “the lost Liberal decade,” arguing that only a new Conservative government can take action against crime, housing shortages and other non-Trump issues Canadians rank as priorities.
“You cannot handle another four years of this,” he said over the weekend.
Poilievre has critiqued Trump, but insisted ten years of poor Liberal governance had left Canada vulnerable to a newly hostile United States.
A good pick
Final polls indicate a tight race but put Carney as the favourite.
Surveys have also consistently shown voters view the ex-central banker as the best candidate to deal with Trump.
Jeff Sims, who lives in Quebec near Canada’s capital Ottawa, said he believes Carney has “the pedigree” to be prime minister.
“Two central banks under his belt, I think that’s a good pick,” the 46-year-old told AFP on Sunday.
At a weekend Conservative rally in the battleground city of Oakville, west of Toronto, Janice Wyner rejected the notion that Carney marked a departure from Trudeau.
Trudeau’s “policies stunk and it’s the same party,” she told AFP.
“Canada is just in a mess. I’m 70 years old. It’s not even a country that I recognize and I’m worried for my grandkids.”
Like many voters, Nadine Sokol, a 41-year-old who also lives near Ottawa, listed “the threat coming from the US” as her “number one issue.”
Historic turnaround
If the Liberals win, it would mark one of the most of dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.
On January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, and Poilievre looked on track to be Canada’s next prime minister.
But Carney replacing Trudeau combined with nationwide unease about Trump transformed the race.
Public broadcaster CBC’s poll aggregator on Sunday put the Liberals’ national support at 42.8 per cent, with the Conservatives at 38.8pc.
As with US elections, national polling numbers may not predict a result.
The performance of two smaller parties — the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP) and the separatist Bloc Quebecois — will be closely watched.
In past elections, strong NDP performances in Ontario and British Columbia, and a good showing by the Bloc in Quebec, have curbed Liberal seat tallies, but polls suggest both smaller parties could be facing a setback.
Nearly 29 million of Canada’s estimated 41m people are eligible to vote. A record 7.3m people cast advanced ballots.
In the massive G7 country which spans six times zones, polls open at 8:30am local time (4pm PKT) in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
Canadians will elect 343 members of parliament, meaning 172 seats are needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.</p><small>2025-04-28 08:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28113131dbb3f89.jpg?r=120522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907108/cci-meeting-to-decide-canals-issue-to-be-held-today-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>CCI meeting to decide canals issue to be held today: Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has convened a meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) for today (Monday) to discuss the matter of the much-contested six new canals on the Indus River, according to Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz inaugurated the ambitious Cholistan project to irrigate South Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh.
After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh, the federal government on April 23 announced it was halting the contentious project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the CCI. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) last week.
While the government had earlier decided to convene the CCI meeting on May 2, Memon said today that the huddle had been moved earlier and would be held in the evening today.
“[Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif] has summoned a meeting of the CCI today on the request of the Sindh government,” Memon said in a statement issued by his spokesperson Husain Mansoor.
 


“The CCI meeting chaired by the prime minister will be held in Islamabad in the evening today,” the statement said, adding that a decision on the canals’ matter will be made there.
“Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah will attend the meeting on behalf of Sindh,” Memon confirmed.
“A decision will be made as per the discussion between [PPP Chairman] Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the prime minister, and the issue of canals will end,” he said, referring to Friday’s meeting between the coalition allies.
The scheduling of the meeting earlier comes amid increasing concerns of traders and the business community as protests against the project have paralysed interprovincial traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh.
 
 

The legal fraternity has been staging a sit-in at the Babarloi bypass in Sindh’s Khairpur district since April 18.
Speaking to Geo News, Memon confirmed that the Sindh government had made the request for the meeting to be moved ahead due to the ongoing protests.
The minister noted that the CCI meeting was to be called on May 2, but despite that, “some groups refused to end the protests until the CCI meeting happens and its [decision’s] formal announcement” is made.
“In light of that, the Sindh government requested the prime minister to summon the meeting today, and it is set to take place in the evening in Islamabad,” Memon added.
 


Responding to a query, he said the provincial government had requested earlier as well to call the meeting “soon but considering the state of the country at the moment, it was difficult”.
“We had to appeal again as transport had come to a halt due to the protests, resulting in economic loss for businesses as well as farmers,” the minister stressed.
Asked about the Sindh government’s plan of action if the protests on highways continued even after the CCI meeting, Memon said: “We are hopeful that if we don’t give them an excuse, even though there was no excuse before either, but the government believes in dialogue.”
He highlighted, “The public interest is important to us at the moment as it was creating issues for the business community and the farmers.”
In a statement posted by the Sindh Information Department on X today, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said the government acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but requested the lawyers not to create difficulties for the public.
He asserted that no legal action would be taken against those protesting peacefully and urged the lawyers to “keep an eye on miscreants around them”.
 






Transporters to hold protest outside Sindh CM House today
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance (APGTA) has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House in Karachi at 4pm today (Monday).
Yesterday, Nisar Jafry of the APGTA said he had received a call from Memon — also Sindh’s transport minister — requesting him to call off today’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
Jafry said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded. He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be they meant for import, export or locally produced.
 
 

In his statement, Memon had called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Manufacturers said they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The past few months have seen nationwide protests from political parties, including the ruling coalition ally PPP, and residents against the proposed project. The Sindh Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution against the project in March.</p><small>2025-04-28 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2812450608ed64b.jpg?r=124630' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907112/brics-set-to-meet-over-trump-trade-policies' target='_blank'><strong>Brics set to meet over Trump trade policies</strong></a><br><p>Senior diplomats from Brics countries will meet on Monday in Brazil to present a united front in the face of threats emerging from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies.
The meeting comes at a critical moment for the world economy after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week slashed growth forecasts over the impact of the American leader’s sweeping new tariffs.
Diplomats from the trading bloc that includes current president Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will meet for two days in Rio de Janeiro, as a precursor to a leaders summit in July.
“The ministers are negotiating a declaration aimed at reaffirming the centrality and importance of the multilateral trading system,” Brazil’s Brics representative Mauricio Lyrio told reporters Saturday.
The group has expanded significantly since its inception in 2009 — and now includes Iran, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. It makes up nearly half of the global population and 39 per cent of global GDP.
Trump since returning to the White House in January has hit dozens of countries with a blanket 10pc tariff, but China faces levies of up to 145 percent on many products. Beijing has responded with duties of 125 percent on US goods.
Trump has threatened to impose 100pc tariffs on Brics countries if they undercut the US dollar.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira will host the meeting that will be attended by Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and China’s Wang Yi among others.
It is scheduled to begin at around 11:00am (1400 GMT) with a statement expected in the afternoon.
Climate change is expected to feature high on the agenda ahead of the United Nations COP30 climate summit in November hosted by Brazil in the Amazonian city of Belem.
The group is also likely to discuss the war in Ukraine, as Trump seeks to push Russia and Ukraine toward a peace agreement.
The Brics will be joined for discussions on Tuesday by nine other “partner” countries, including several former Soviet states, as well as Cuba, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda and Nigeria.
China says ‘no phone call’ recently between Xi and Trump
Beijing insisted that “no phone call” took place recently between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, after Donald Trump said he had spoken with the Chinese leader.
The world’s two biggest economies are locked in an escalating tit-for-tat trade battle triggered by Trump’s levies on Chinese goods, which have reached 145pc on many products.
In an interview conducted on April 22 with TIME Magazine and published Friday, Trump insisted Chinese leader Xi called him despite Beijing denying there had been any contact between the two countries over their bitter trade dispute.
The US president did not say when the call took place or specify what was discussed.
Asked about the comments Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said: “As far as I know, there has been no phone call between the two heads of state recently.”
“China and the United States are not conducting consultations or negotiations on tariff issues,” he added.</p><small>2025-04-28 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/680ea76ae40cc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906967/agriculture-crop-sector-from-boom-to-bust' target='_blank'><strong>Agriculture: Crop sector — from boom to bust</strong></a><br><p>In late March 2025, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics released the country’s economic growth figures for the second quarter (October-December) of FY25. The data painted a worrying picture: the agriculture sector grew by just 1.1 per cent. The first quarter was even worse, barely registering a growth rate of 0.74pc (revised figure). That is a massive fall from FY24, when agriculture posted a robust 8.17pc and 5.82pc growth in Q1 and Q2, respectively.
Interestingly, in Q2FY25, the livestock subsector, which accounts for nearly 60pc of the agriculture sector, grew by an impressive 6.51pc — the highest for any quarter over the last 10 years. This performance appears somewhat surprising, as neither the government nor the private sector undertook any significant intervention.
Despite this surge in livestock, what is dragging the agriculture sector down? Crops — long considered the backbone of Pakistan’s agriculture — are in deep trouble. The crop subsector posted a negative growth of 6.57pc in Q1 and 5.38pc in Q2. This stands in stark contrast to last year’s double-digit positive growth in the same quarters — 16.07pc and 10.12pc, respectively.
 
 

Compared to the previous year, cotton plunged by 30.7pc, dropping from 10.22 million bales to 7.08m bales, and maize fell 15.4pc, from 9.74m tonnes to 8.24m tonnes. Likewise, rice dipped slightly by 1.4pc, sliding from 9.86m tonnes to 9.72m tonnes, while sugarcane shrank by 2.3pc, from 87.64m tonnes to 85.62m tonnes.

The wheat crisis has deepened in 2025 due to government policy failures at multiple levels, and without meaningful reforms, another year of poor growth in FY26 appears all but certain

This dramatic reversal from bumper harvests in FY24 to a worrying slowdown just a year later signals more than just statistical fluctuation. It reflects mounting stress from multiple directions. However, what primarily explains this boom and bust? The short answer: liquidity — hard cash in farmers’ hands.
In 2023, wheat, Pakistan’s principal food crop, cultivated on over 23.7m acres by more than 6m farmers, fetched Rs3,900 per 40kg. With solid returns in hand, farmers confidently reinvested in Kharif crops like rice, maize, and cotton. They purchased expensive hybrid seeds, applied optimal fertiliser doses, and operated even high-cost diesel-operated tubewells to meet irrigation water needs. The result: bumper yields.
Then came 2024. The Punjab government, despite announcing a support price of Rs3,900, failed to procure wheat. Farmers were left to sell their crop at distress prices — between Rs2,400 and Rs2,700 — well below the government’s own estimated production cost of Rs3,200. To make matters worse, in July 2024, the Punjab government imposed district-specific price caps ranging from Rs2,800 to Rs3,050 per 40kg.
This policy left farmers cash-strapped, which triggered a domino effect — a chain reaction that affected the subsequent crops. Due to liquidity issues, farmers could not apply inputs, especially fertilisers, in the required quantities at the right time. The impact is now evident in the dismal Q1 and Q2 figures of FY25. Wheat has rightly earned its title as the driving force of Pakistan’s agriculture sector and rural economy, and when it stalls, the entire sector suffers.
The wheat crisis has deepened in 2025 due to government policy failures at multiple levels. Without meaningful reforms aimed at strengthening agricultural credit, building private sector capacity, improving farmers’ grain holding capacity, and ensuring effective regulation of the commodity market, another year of poor growth in 2025-26 appears all but certain.
Crops are becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In 2024, the yields of maize, rice, cotton, and sesame were affected by erratic rainfall, heatwaves, and rising temperatures. Farmers lack both the capacity and access to climate-smart technologies needed to cope with the escalating threat of climate change. As a result, Pakistan’s agriculture sector has failed to adopt even basic adaptation and mitigation measures like high-yielding, climate-resilient seeds.
The widespread availability of substandard and unapproved seeds, particularly for cotton and rice, emerged as a major concern in 2024. These seeds had low germination rates and lacked resilience against pests and the growing impacts of climate change. Collectively, these factors ultimately led to lower yields.
In Q1 and Q2 of FY25, farmers faced irrigation challenges on three fronts. First, canal water availability from April 1 to Sept 30 dropped by 3.4pc — from 61.85 million acre-feet (MAF) in 2023 to 59.75 MAF in 2024. This shortfall was relatively more intense and damaging in some rice- and cotton-growing areas of Sindh. Second, rainfall between September and December 2024 was 40pc below normal, triggering near-drought conditions across much of the country. Third, the electricity tariff for tubewells — effective from July 2024 — rose to a record high, about 20pc above 2023 levels. This sharp increase further constrained cash-strapped farmers’ ability to irrigate.
This year, the water situation is even worse. With declining reservoir levels, farmers are unlikely to receive sufficient water, which will shrink crop acreage and suppress yields further. These impacts will likely be reflected in the agricultural performance of FY26.
In conclusion, Pakistan’s crop sector is gradually losing its competitiveness due to rising production costs, worsening water shortages, and a policy framework that is misaligned with the farmers’ real issues. The government’s piecemeal incentives — such as subsidised equipment — may help a few thousand but will be unable to address the deeper structural challenges of the sector. What’s urgently needed is a long-term, strategic vision aimed at boosting productivity and building a resilient agriculture sector.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, April 28th, 2025</p><small>2025-04-28 07:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906968/finance-the-mounting-pressures-of-a-violent-world' target='_blank'><strong>Finance: The mounting pressures of a violent world</strong></a><br><p>These are turbulent times for global trade. India and Pakistan are struggling with rising tensions due to the Pahalgam attack; the Middle East crisis following Israel and Gaza is growing increasingly complex; and the Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated. Meanwhile, Iran has yet to finalise a nuclear deal with the United States, amid threats of force from President Donald Trump in the event of failure. President Trump’s tariff war with China also remains unresolved, as do his trade disputes with several other nations.
The situation is challenging, especially for Pakistan, where an economic recovery has only just begun and lacks sustainable improvements in the external sector. Continuation of this recovery hinges on a favourable geopolitical environment. Pakistan’s recent external economic gains have largely depended on remittances from overseas Pakistanis, particularly those residing in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and the United States.
While an adverse geopolitical environment may have a moderately negative impact on remittance inflows, it could have a more severe and lasting effect on potential foreign direct investment (FDI). Global trade is already becoming more expensive, with import costs rising and net export earnings taking a hit due to increased shipping and container charges. In this context, it is essential for Pakistan to secure some tariff concessions from the US before the Trump administration finalises new average tariffs for the country.

The government must focus on improving its foreign exchange reserves if it hopes to protect the nation’s hard-earned stability amid rising global tensions

Pakistan’s exports remain heavily reliant on food items for overall growth, as the textile sector continues to struggle — mirroring the difficulties faced by other large-scale manufacturing industries. Meanwhile, the government’s Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) aims to revolutionise the agriculture sector and sustain the momentum in food exports.
However, making the GPI a genuine success requires greater interprovincial harmony on critical issues such as water sharing, the unrestricted movement of final commodities across provincial borders and equal treatment of all federating units by the federal government. It is encouraging to note that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari have finally agreed to resolve the ongoing dispute over canal construction on the Indus River amicably. A meeting of the Inter-Provincial Coordination Council has been convened to address this matter.
Under the current geopolitical situation, Pakistan’s economic managers must focus on a few critical priorities simultaneously and with full vigour. The first is the stability of the external account. If tensions escalate, maintaining sufficient foreign exchange reserves and ensuring the stability of the rupee will become vital.

Pakistan must enhance food trade with neighbouring countries and explore greater opportunities in South and East Asia

The second priority — closely tied to the first — is the need to boost exports, remittances, and foreign investment. Realising the promised inflow of significant FDI from GCC countries in the near future will require making some tough trade-offs, even if the current tensions die down. In this context, building a genuine national consensus on policies aimed at attracting FDI in politically sensitive sectors such as mines and minerals, agriculture, and energy becomes urgently important.
Containing imports through tariff or non-tariff measures remains off the table, as Pakistan is still under an International Monetary Fund lending programme. However, a greater focus on agricultural and industrial development to encourage import substitution is both feasible and urgently needed.
In 9MFY25 of the current fiscal year (July 2024 to March 2025), Pakistan’s goods export earnings rose 7.82 per cent year-on-year to $24.72 billion, while imports grew 6.6pc to $42.69bn, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Unless export growth consistently outpaces import growth, managing the trade deficit will become increasingly difficult — especially given the rupee’s vulnerability. The currency has already come under pressure amid fears of a military clash with India.
Of the $24.7bn in exports during this nine-month period, food exports accounted for $5.75bn —more than 23pc. For a country of 245 million people, such a high share of food in total goods exports is concerning, as it risks exacerbating domestic food shortages and fuelling food inflation.
Moreover, Pakistan must also seek new export markets and deepen its presence in existing ones. It should particularly enhance food trade with neighbouring countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, and China and explore greater opportunities in South and East Asia.

In a letter available with Dawn, Dr Muhammad Aleem Akhter said the prices of medicines were deregulated against public and national interest.
He said that the Drap Act, 2012, clearly empowers the authority to fix prices of all drugs and medicines and this issue was communicated to the PM’s office through a  letter dated Oct 20, 2024, but no action was taken.
On the other hand, he said, the rising cost of medicines was making healthcare unaffordable for many, leading to increasing anger against the government and the state.
For the last several decades, he said, there was a cap on maximum retail prices (MRPs) due to which pharmaceutical companies were bound to keep prices equal or lower than the prices approved by the federal cabinet.
These companies had to apply to Drap for any increase in prices and Drap used to send the request to the federal cabinet for approval, but the previous caretaker government, headed by Anwarul Haq Kakar, removed the cap on MRPs of non-essential drugs and that allowed pharmaceutical companies to fix the prices on their own.
The health ministry had claimed that the decision was made to promote competition among companies and that it will reduce prices of non-essential medicines, but that did not happen.
He appealed to the prime minister to intervene in the matter and provide relief to the masses.

Officials said the attacker, who is on the run, stabbed Aboubakar Cisse, a young Malian in his early 20s, dozens of times and then filmed him with a mobile phone while shouting insults at Islam.
The attack in the village of La Grand-Combe in the Gard region was the latest in a series of deadly stabbings in France in recent years. It shocked the country’s leaders, with Macron finally speaking out on X on Sunday.
“Racism and hatred based on religion can have no place in France. Freedom of worship cannot be violated,” he wrote, offering support to  “our fellow Muslim citizens”.
French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou earlier branded it an  “Islamophobic atrocity” — although the prosecutor in the case emphasised that Islamophobia is just one of the motives being considered. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said in televised comments on Sunday that he had ordered police to tighten security at mosques around the country.
Hundreds also rallied in Paris, where far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon accused the government of nurturing a  “climate of Islamophobia” at a time when immigration is top of the political agenda. Retailleau accused Melenchon’s party of exploiting the attack for political ends.
Investigators said the alleged killer sent the video he had filmed with his phone — showing the victim writhing in agony — to another person, who then shared it on a social media platform before deleting it.
A source close to the case said the suspected perpetrator, while not apprehended, had been identified as a French citizen of Bosnian origin who is not a Muslim. After initially praying alongside the man when they were alone in the mosque, the attacker stabbed the victim up to 50 times before fleeing the scene.
The body of the victim was discovered later.
The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) said it was  “horrified” by the  “anti-Muslim terrorist attack” and urged Muslims in France to be  “extremely vigilant”.
“The murder of a worshipper in a mosque is a despicable crime that must revolt the hearts of all French people,” added the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF).
The attacker has been named only as Olivier A., born in France in 2004 and unemployed without a criminal record. He is  “potentially extremely dangerous” and it is  “essential” to arrest him before he claims more victims, said regional prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini.
But while the motive of Islamophobia is the lead that the 70 investigators are  “working on as a priority… it is not the only one”, Grini said.

But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the strike targeted a building used by Hezbollah to store  “precision-guided missiles” and vowed to stop the Iran-backed group using Beirut’s southern suburbs as a  “safe haven”.
A correspondent saw a plume of smoke rising over the building in the Hadath neighbourhood after the strike. Lebanese television channels broadcast images of a fire around the hangar-like building. The Israeli military had earlier issued a warning to civilians to evacuate the densely populated neighbourhood.
“An urgent warning for those in the southern suburbs of Beirut, especially in the Hadath neighbourhood: Anyone present in the building marked in red on the attached map as well as the surrounding buildings, is near Hezbollah facilities,” said military spokesman Avichay Adraee on X, adding:  “You must evacuate”.
Netanyahu’s office said Israel  “will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger and create any threat against it — anywhere in Lebanon”.

Lebanon president urges US, France to compel Tel Aviv to halt attacks

In a later statement, the military said that  “the storage of missiles in this infrastructure site constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.” But the Lebanese president condemned the strike as a new breach of the November 27 ceasefire and urged its guarantors to put a stop to Israel’s continual attacks.
Aoun called on  “the United States and France, as guarantors of the ceasefire agreement, to assume their responsibilities and compel Israel to halt its attacks immediately”.
The United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, appealed to all sides to halt any actions that could further undermine the ceasefire.
“Today’s strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy,” she said in a post. “We urge all sides to halt actions.”

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels,” a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
“The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” the spokesperson added.
 
 

The State Department spokesperson also said Washington “stands with India and strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”, reiterating comments similar to recent ones made by US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
In public, the US government has expressed support for India after the attack but has not criticised Pakistan. While Saudi Arabia and Iran have offered to mediate, Trump last week said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
India is an increasingly important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence in Asia while Pakistan remains a US ally, even as its importance for Washington has diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for the Foreign Policy magazine, said India is now a much closer US partner than Pakistan.
“This may worry Islamabad that if India retaliates militarily, the US may sympathise with its counterterrorism imperatives and not try to stand in the way,” Kugelman told Reuters.
Kugelman also said that given Washington’s involvement and ongoing diplomatic efforts in Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, the Trump administration is “dealing with a lot on its global plate” and may leave India and Pakistan on their own, at least in the early days of the tensions.
Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to the US and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, also said that there seemed to be no US appetite to calm the situation at this moment.
“India has a longstanding grievance about terrorism emanating or supported from across [the] border. Pakistan has a longstanding belief that India wants to dismember it. Both work themselves into a frenzy every few years. This time, there is no US interest in calming things down,” Haqqani said.
Ned Price, a former US State Department official under the administration of former president Joe Biden, said that while the Trump administration was giving this issue the sensitivity it deserved, a perception that it would back India at any cost may escalate tensions further.
“The Trump administration has made clear it wishes to deepen the US-India partnership a laudable goal but that it is willing to do so at almost any cost.
“If India feels that the Trump administration will back it to the hilt no matter what, we could be in store for more escalation and more violence between these nuclear-armed neighbours,” Price added.
Tensions escalate as troops continue trading fire
Pakistan and India also exchanged gunfire for a fourth night in a row across their de facto border, the Line of Control (LoC), after four years of relative calm.
“During the night of April 27-28… Pakistan Army posts initiated unprovoked small arms fire across the Line of Control”, the Indian army claimed in a statement.
 
 

There were no reported casualties, and Islamabad did not immediately confirm the gunfire.
India’s defence forces have conducted several military exercises across the country since the attack. Some of these are routine preparedness drills, Reuters quoted a defence official as saying.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
 
 

On Thursday, Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to pursue the attackers to the “ends of the earth” and said that those who planned and carried out the attack “will be punished beyond their imagination”.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” in an international probe into the Pahalgam attack, but also warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Hundreds arrested as Indian forces continue crackdown
Meanwhile, security forces have detained around 500 people for questioning after they searched nearly 1,000 houses and forests hunting for the attackers in India-held Kashmir, a local police official told Reuters on Monday.
At least nine houses have been demolished so far, the official added.
Previously, the Kashmir Media Service had put the number of arrests at more than 2,000. It reported that the ancestral homes of seven Kashmiris had been destroyed using explosives by Indian forces in what critics described as “collective punishment”’.
 
 

Political leaders in the state have called for caution to ensure the innocent are not harmed in the government’s actions against terrorism.
“It’s time to … avoid any misplaced action that alienates people. Punish the guilty, show them no mercy but don’t let innocent people become collateral damage,” Omar Abdullah, the territory’s chief minister said on X on Saturday.
Another former chief minister made an appeal to the Indian government “to take care that innocent people are not made to feel the brunt as alienation aids terrorists’ goals of division and fear”.

The sun casts golden shadows over the water as others offload their modest haul from ice boxes.
A small crowd gathers, murmuring with hope, asking for fish to take home. But the replies come tinged with disappointment, echoing in Balochi: “Mahee ady jend nest” (there’s no fish today). Still, a few kaashuk-loojar (sardines) are handed out, small offerings from a sea that gives only just enough. The process takes over an hour, as the sparse catch is finally carted off in qingqi rickshaws to fish trading companies.
As the sun sinks lower, one of the sailors returns to Padi Zer, now seated across Waado Aani Jah — the boat makers’ point — alongside other fishermen sipping their chai ordered from a nearby teashop. The salt still clings to his skin, his clothes still carrying the scent of the sea. You wonder aloud how he’s found the time to return, barely bathed, barely rested. He offers a knowing smile and says:
“I return to remind myself — and my conscience — that we don’t turn to the sea just for a living, we belong to it. No matter the odds and challenges.”
Yet, beyond these shores, new boundaries appear. The same people who have always lived by the sea now find themselves edged out of places they once moved through freely.
 

Where Koh-i-Batil meets the Arabian Sea.

Koh-i-Batil — the heart of Gwadar’s landscape — spans vast across the landscape. From its peak, the entire city stretches out in a breathtaking panorama: sunlit waters, winding roads, the pulse of a city shaped by sea and stone. But today, this landmark is a restricted area. Visitors have to wait, present their IDs, and are often denied access altogether. Even those allowed through are confined to a single section of the mountain.
One can’t help but think: Did the indigenous people of Gwadar ever imagine that “development” would fence them out of their own heritage? Can progress truly uplift a community if it erases their access to the very spaces that gave them meaning?
Enter: CPEC
Gwadar, a dusty city along the arid coastline of the Arabian Sea, has been in the headlines for over a decade as a key player in China’s economic ambitions. Situated in Pakistan’s volatile Balochistan province near the Iranian border, it has been thrust into the spotlight as a key node in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a large-scale infrastructure and economic development project initiated by China in 2013. Amid barren deserts and jagged mountains, this remote city is being fantasised as the next big commercial hub, a gateway for Chinese trade and investment into the region.
Home to an indigenous Baloch fishing community, the city is home to approximately 100,000 residents whose lives are still defined by hardship. Electricity is sourced from across the border in Iran, but it’s erratic at best. And while CPEC’s vision has yet to bring tangible change to Gwadar, the city’s struggles don’t end there. More than the economic exclusion, the sea itself, seems to be slipping away. Clean water is scarce and the once-abundant sea now yields little more than scraps, picked over by industrial deep-sea trawlers before reaching local shores.
It’s no secret that Gwadar is reeling from the impact of deep-sea trawling. As fish disappear from its waters, indigenous fisherfolk are left struggling to sustain their way of life.
The 750km coastline of Balochistan — including towns and cities such as Gwadar, Pasni, Ormara, Ganz, Pishukan, Jewani, Surbandan, along with surrounding fishing villages — has long supported communities that lived in harmony with the sea. However, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) deep-sea trawling has crippled local fish production and inflicted lasting damage on the marine ecosystem.
Saki Baksh, a fisherman from Gwadar, explained the scale of the crisis: “Even 10 days of our hard work at sea can’t match what a single trawler catches in one day.”

Fishing practices: Local fishermen vs deep-sea trawlers
Local fishermen have traditionally followed sustainable fishing practices, aligning their methods with seasonal availability. They adapt their nets based on the type of catch — for example, during the king fish season (September to November), they target only king fish, avoiding other species. The same approach applies to lobsters, shrimps, and other seafood. They mostly use eco-friendly nets with large holes and minimal plastic, allowing vulnerable marine species to escape, thereby preserving the marine ecosystem.
In recent years, however, some local fishermen have begun using harmful gear such as fine plastic mesh nets, small-holed nets, encircling nets, and wire nets — locally known as gujja. These practices pose a serious threat to marine biodiversity and contribute to the depletion of fish production. Hence, such nets are prohibited under the Balochistan Fisheries Ordinance, 1971.
Nako Chakar, an 80-year-old former fisherman, no longer goes to sea but still walks the Gwadar shoreline, listening to the fishermen as they unload their catch. Their conversations tell a different story now — of vanishing fish, changing nets, and a sea no longer as generous.
“When your livelihood depends on something, you treat it with care,” he reflected. “For us, the sea was sacred. I remember waiting for my father’s return with the day’s catch. My sons once waited for me the same way. Now I watch them return frustrated, cursing the trawlers that swept away the fish from their nets.”
“We used to catch fish with ease, each season bringing its own bounty,” he reflected. I would ride a camel to nearby towns to sell our catch. But when the trawlers arrived, we didn’t realise what was coming. We just saw big boats — never imagining they’d end up destroying our coast.“
Local fishermen operate in small, single-engine boats that allow them to navigate carefully without disrupting others or risking collisions. In contrast, deep-sea trawlers — large vessels with around 40 crew members — move at high speeds, often crashing into these smaller boats and causing significant damage.
While local fishermen work 12-hour shifts, trawlers operate around the clock. Equipped with three engines, generators, diesel fuel, and ice storage, they tow massive nets that sweep both surface and deep-sea fish. Their fine-mesh plastic nets, also known as gillnets, trap even the smallest fish, pushing certain species toward extinction.

Unsurprisingly, the actions of deep-sea trawlers have become rather brazen today; they frequently detain, attack, and intimidate local fishermen. On May 28, 2024, an incident in Gwadar saw a trawler crew murder a local fisherman and abduct another. In response, fishing communities and local activists launched protests, blocking major highways. Outraged by the unchecked violence and looting, they decried that deep-sea trawlers operate with impunity under the protection of powerful authorities and remain above the law.
According to one fisherman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, encounters with trawler crews can be dangerous. “They are often armed. If a local boat crosses their path, they don’t hesitate to fire warning shots,” he said.
Aziz Peer Baksh, CEO of Atlantic Seafood Company, a locally owned enterprise in Pasni, also pointed to the destructive practices of large trawlers operating in the region. He said that the trawlers transport their catch to Karachi, where it is processed for export. “They often capture massive bycatches — including turtles, dolphins, sharks, whales, and squid — which they sell to seafood companies at low prices,” he claimed.
According to Baksh, the production of key species such as sardines, Indian mackerel, green mussels, pomfret, mud crabs, sole fish, shrimp, and prawns has plummeted. “This sharp decline has pushed our incomes to the brink of collapse and endangered marine life,” he added. “Local fishermen and sailors who once supplied fish across Balochistan and Karachi are now struggling. The reason is clear: they are bringing in fewer fish than ever before.”
Where does the rest of the world stand?
International legal instruments such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions (61/105, 64/72, 66/68, 71/123), and international guidelines on fishing by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) call for urgent action to conserve and manage vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in the high seas.
Moreover, Goal 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls for the sustainable management and protection of marine ecosystems. As a result, several countries, including the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, have either banned or regulated commercial fishing by deep-sea trawlers in vulnerable areas.
Ellie Hooper, an oceans campaigner at the Greenpeace Aotearoa — one of New Zealand’s largest environmental organisations — explained in an article that bottom trawlers use various types of nets indiscriminately, regardless of the fish’s seasonal availability. This approach threatens marine life, as species are caught regardless of their breeding seasons. Trawlers drag large and heavy nets across the sea floor, plowing through biologically rich and diverse ecosystems, crushing corals, sponges, various aquatic species and their habitats as they go.
For this reason, bottom trawling has a large bycatch impact, with many non-target species being fished in the process. The article further stated that “dragging heavy nets across the seabed disturbs marine sediments, which is the world’s largest carbon sink”, highlighting the practice’s significant contribution to climate change.
In 2021, a groundbreaking study published in Nature, an international journal, revealed that fishing boats using heavy nets to trawl the seafloor — often at great depths — release as much carbon dioxide as the entire aviation industry.
Moreover, according to the Second World Ocean Assessment (WOA II), “fishing, especially bottom trawling, constitutes the greatest current threat to seamount ecosystems”.

The official stance
As per the Balochistan Sea Fisheries Ordinance of 1971, the Secretary of Fisheries and Coastal Development has imposed a ban on all types of fishing in Balochistan’s territorial waters from June 1 to July 31 each year, to protect marine life during the breeding season.
Ahmad Nadeem, an official from the Marine Fisheries Department in Balochistan, explained that fishing is strictly prohibited during this period to allow fish populations to breed and replenish. “However, even during this period, many fishermen continue to sneak into the waters, and one month is simply not enough for the sea to recover,” he added.
Overfishing has led to a sharp decline in fish populations, with many fish being caught before reaching maturity. “Like all living creatures, fish need time to grow, but they’re often caught at the larval stage,” he explained.
He noted that fishing practices have drastically changed over time. In the past, small-scale fishermen would spend only three to four hours at sea, while larger boats stayed out for seven to 10 days. Today, smaller boats are staying out for as long as eight hours, with some even making multiple trips within a 24-hour window.
“The pressure to earn quick profits has placed an immense burden on the sea,” he added.
According to him, fishing techniques have also changed significantly, with modern nets featuring smaller mesh sizes and stretching over much longer distances — ranging from five to 30 kilometres (km) — compared to the larger, shorter nets used in the past. He added that previously, fishermen targeted specific species based on season and demand. Today, they catch whatever they can find, driven by market needs. “Every size and type of fish is now bought, further worsening overfishing,” Nadeem said.
“Deep-sea trawlers are to be blamed for the use of fine mesh nets, rampant overfishing, increasing number of boats, destructive fishing techniques, and the disregard for seasonal restrictions. These practices have caused irreversible damage,” the official acknowledged.
Though legal frameworks such as the Sindh Fisheries Ordinance of 1980 and the Balochistan Sea Fisheries Ordinance of 1971 are in place to protect vulnerable marine species — including various types of sharks — their enforcement remains largely ineffective. For instance, the Marine and Fisheries Department in Gwadar confirmed that the Karinj (Mobula) is now extinct, with only 17 recorded sightings between 2021 and 2022. The sawfish has disappeared entirely.

The impact on Gwadar’s fisheries and fisherfolk
Shamsi, a resident of Gwadar, sat cross-legged with a small pile of sardines in her lap. Her trembling, wrinkled hands moved slowly as she cleaned the catch of the day.  “Sardines have lost their shape,” she muttered. “They were always tiny, full of thin, nearly invisible bones — but they had taste. Now, they’re even smaller, and when we fry them, there’s no flavour.”
Her 19-year-old son, Sameer, is a fisherman — one of the many who brave the unpredictable sea each day. “He risks his life out there,” she says, “and comes back with nothing but disappointment and a few measly fish.
Like countless other families along the coast, Shamsi’s household relies on the sea for survival. But as fish stocks shrink, the entire community is at the brink of poverty and hunger. “The fishermen return with empty nets and fading hopes,” she lamented. “Indian mackerel and Hilsa fish — locally known as Palwar — were once plentiful. Now, most of our favourite fish have disappeared. The real culprit is the deep-sea trawlers that are ruthlessly stripping our waters bare.”
Her story mirrors that of Nako Shambay, a fellow coastal dweller grappling with a similar struggle. For over 45 years, he has navigated the waters off Gwadar’s coast. As a seasoned sailor, he’s faced fierce winds and the unforgiving pull of the sea. “There were days I thought I wouldn’t make it back,” he reflected. “The reality of this life is that it’s harsh, unyielding, but the only source of income we’ve known.”
Shambay recalled his childhood, casting nets beside his father who steered the boat. “Back then, Hilsa fish were so plentiful that even children could catch them with bare hands. As the years have passed, I have gone from being a fisherman to a boat nahuda (sailor) but there’s no trace of Palwar anymore.”
He claimed that the growing number of deep-sea trawlers over time has pushed several marine species to the brink of extinction. Among those that have disappeared are the Pishik (a small shark), Soli (sole fish), Gallow (sea catfish), Soro (king soldier bream), and various shark species.
“I remember when sharks were always around,” the sailor added. “Sometimes they tore through our fishing gear. But we never hunted them — our elders taught us to respect and protect certain sea creatures. Now, even those are gone. What we see instead are massive trawlers, wrecking our boats and emptying the sea.”
Another fisherman Chakar reminisced about a simpler time when fishing was more than just an industry. “We fished according to the time of the day. We would leave at shab rech (night) and return in the morning, relaxed and content. Life was tough, but the sea was alive. We fished to feed our families, not for profit. Now, the sea feels empty.”
“Today, Palwar, Garme pagas, Kail, Guthol, Warok, Gorchok, and Kalgon are rarely seen. It’s been over 15 years since I last saw a Soleeg. Even Kir is so scarce now that catching one is considered a stroke of luck,” he added.
Deep-sea trawlers from Karachi and other parts of Sindh routinely encroach upon the Makran coast, despite not being local to the region. Their activities are not only unwelcome but also illegal. By law, they are prohibited from operating within 12 nautical miles of a country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and larger vessels must remain at least 35 miles from the shoreline. Yet, these regulations are routinely flouted.
“There is an entire chain of officials who take bribes from the trawler mafia, turning a blind eye to these violations,” said KB Firaq, a Baloch educator and social activist from Gwadar. “Anyone standing on the shore can see trawlers openly fishing in Gwadar’s waters.”
A local fish trader Rasheed from Pasni echoed this concern, alleging that the Fisheries Department receives substantial bribes from deep-sea trawler operators, which is why they are able to operate freely without any restrictions.
Nadeem, director of the said department, acknowledged that while the department is large and it’s possible that some individuals may be involved in corrupt practices, there is no confirmed evidence to support such claims.
He further elaborated on the difficulties in enforcing fishing regulations, particularly when it comes to monitoring vast stretches of the sea. “The sea is huge — it can’t be monitored like a road. By the time we receive information and reach the spot, the deep-sea trawlers have usually fled. In today’s social media age, fishermen often post videos online instead of informing local fisheries coordinators, which delays our response. These posts sometimes alert the trawler operators as well, giving them time to escape. If we’re properly informed and fail to act, we can be held accountable,” he stated.
His words, however, hold little solace for Nahuda Khuda Dost Wajo, a sailor and president of the Mahigeer Ittehad — which fights for the fisherfolk’s rights. “The trawlers have already destroyed other seas, and now they are doing the same to ours. At this rate, we’ll have no catch left in two years.”
The impact of overfishing has also changed the economics of the industry. The value of fish — once determined by size, weight, and shine — has diminished. “Fish don’t get a chance to grow or mature anymore. Their size has shrunk, their luster has faded,” Wajo lamented.

Local grievances unheard
According to Wajo, the issue of deep-sea trawling is not new — it is a longstanding problem that continues to threaten Balochistan’s coastal communities and marine ecosystem. “In the past, international deep-sea trawlers respected the boundary,” he stated.
Hafeez Kiazai, General Secretary of Haq Do Tehreek (HDT), noted a turning point when both the Sindh and Balochistan governments began issuing licenses to Pakistani trawlers from Sindh. These vessels started encroaching into Balochistan’s territorial waters, violating the ordinance and exacerbating tensions with local fishing communities.
“When the government realised the lucrative potential of trawling, they prioritised revenue over regulation,” Kiazai alleged. “They began accepting money from trawler owners and expanded their access to the sea.”
As frustration mounted, local communities began to resist. Between 2005 and 2006, a grassroot movement called Trawler Bhagao, Choola Jalao (remove trawlers, light your stoves) emerged in protest but failed to halt illegal trawling, which has continued unchecked till date, added Khuda Dost.
The latest wave of protests began in Gwadar and has since spread to Lasbela district, underscoring the growing anger and desperation among coastal residents.
Kiazai blamed the inefficiency of the Balochistan Fisheries Department for the ongoing crisis. “The department has never taken effective action against trawlers. When a vessel is seized, its catch is sold off, but the trawler is often returned to its owners after legal action. There’s no deterrence — trawling just continues,” he explained. “Why, then, should the government even issue licenses for these larger boats to exploit the province’s waters?”
Khuda Dost voiced a deeper concern: “The law forbids trawlers from entering the 12 nautical mile zone, but our demand goes beyond that. We oppose all forms of trawling. If there is nothing left in the sea, there is nothing for the people living near it.”

The way an animated Mohammad Amir trapped Zalmi captain Babar Azam in front of the wicket as his team looked to chase 179, showed how well prepared Gladiators were for the game. If their top five batters made useful contributions, their fast bowlers, particularly Faheem Ashraf (5-33), were spot on.
The win lifted Gladia­tors, who recorded their second consecutive win of this PSL season, to third in the six-team league while Zalmi slid to fifth spot.
 


Saim Ayub’s cracking shot over cover on the very first ball of the opening over bowled by Amir signalled that Zalmi were ready and positive for the challenge. However, that was not to be.
Saim (five) was caught by wicket-keeper Kusal Men­­dis off fast bowler Faheem Ashraf in the second over as the batter tried unsuccessfully to play a fast rising delivery. Zalmi were 17-1.
Babar’s departure in the next over delivered by Amir proved a massive setback for Zalmi. The former Pakistan captain failed to negotiate a typical swinging ball from the left-armer that came in sharply. The batter opted for DRS that showed ball would have hit top of middle-stump.
When pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr disturbed the timber behind Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who missed the line of the delivery while trying to play through the onside, it made 33-3 in the fifth over. Mohammad Haris started his cameo with a six on the very first ball he faced from Amir.
A dismal 41-3 at the end of powerplay asked for a solid rescue mission by Zalmi that never came as they kept losing wickets.
Faheem jolted Zalmi further with a double strike in the eighth over.
First, he induced Haris (17 off 16) to hole out to Rilee Rossouw at long-on and two balls later forced Abdul Samad (two) to get a very faint edge as Mendis took another catch to leave Zalmi tottering at 50-5.
After reaching 76-5 in 10 overs Zalmi needed a significant boost. Though Hussain Talat and Mitchel Owen (15 off eight) added 31 off 18 balls to give their team some hope but those were ended by fast bowler Khurram Shahzad with a double blow in the 11th.
Owen was caught nicely by Wasim at sweeper cover and when Khurram on his very next ball sent Alzarri Joseph, caught down the leg-side by Mendis, back to the pavilion, a big defeat started staring Zalmi in the face. They were now 81-7.
Luke Wood (eight) hit Fah­eem for a six  in the 12th over but the batter was und­one on the very next ball.
Hussian Talat, who made a 34-ball 39, was the ninth wicket to fall, as the left-hander was caught by Rossouw off spinner Abrar Ahmed in the 15th over.
Sufyan Muqeem became Faheem’s fifth victim in the next over when Ros­souw took his fourth catch of the innings.
Khurram took 2-9 in his three overs while Amir claimed 1-18 and Wasim 1-21 in three.
Earlier, captain Saud Shakeel and Finn Allen gave Gladiators a brisk start of 46 in 4.2 overs after Zalmi invited them to bat first before the latter misjudged a short ball outside off and was caught by Saim at point off Joseph. Allen made 31 off 16 with four fours and a couple of sixes.
Incoming Rossouw (27 off 18) kept the momentum going alongside Saud as the former cracked four fours in the sixth over bowled by pacer Ali Raza to help Gladiators end the powerplay at 67-1. Rossouw, was cleaned up by Saim in the 10th over as Gladiators were now 91-2. Gladiators reached 100 in 10.2 overs.
Saud’s innings (32 off 26, five fours) was ended by Saim in the 12th over as the southpaw played a slog sweep only to be caught by Samad just inside the mid-wicket boundary. The scoreboard now read 105-3.
Mendis smashed five boundaries in his 27-ball 32 before he was caught by Haris off Joseph.
Ali’s last over, 18th of the innings, produced 17 runs for Gladiators, who in the process reached 150 in 17.3 overs, as Mark Chapman (33) collected three fours.
Faheem (one) skied a short-pitched delivery from Joseph who himself took the catch. Hasan Nawaz (eight), after being hit by a Joseph bouncer, struck him for a six. He was eventually run out in the last over bowled by pacer Wood after a mix-up with Chap­man.
Wood dismissed Chap­man who, trying to play a big shot, was caught by Owen nicely at long-on as Gladiators lost their seventh wicket at 173.
Saim gave away only 24 runs for his two wickets while Joseph claimed three wickets for 33 in his four overs. Ali conceded 48 without a wicket while left-arm wrist spinner Sufiyan remained wicket-less for 33.

Senior PPP leaders Nasir Shah, Saeed Ghani, Waqar Mehdi, Sohail Siyal and others arrived at the temporary headquarters of the MQM-P in Bahadurabad.
During the meeting, both sides discussed political cooperation, urban development issues in Karachi and future coordination between the two parties.
The session was marked by an atmosphere of goodwill with leaders on both sides recognising the importance of continued dialogue.

Nasir Shah-led delegation visits MQM-P headquarters

Later, speaking to the media after the meeting, PPP’s Nasir Shah confirmed that the party leadership had sought support for Mr Mehdi for the Senate seat that fell vacant after the death of senior PPP leader Taj Haider.
“We are thankful to MQM for their cooperation, especially on the canal issue,” he said. “We are hopeful that MQM will support our candidate in the upcoming by-election.”
MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar emphasised the need for continued political engagement. “Politics is all about dialogue. PPP is our ally in the federal government, and we were also partners during the PDM-led government,” he said.
“There should be flexibility in our approach, and we must move discussions forward,” he said.
Dr Sattar also highlighted the need to revisit the past agreements between the PPP and the MQM.
He stressed the importance of continued informal dialogue on key issues such as water scarcity, constitutional amendments and the local government act. “Karachi’s issues require collective focus, and we must sit together regularly to find solutions,” he said.
He told reporters that the MQM-P filed nominations of Nighat Shakeel and Mujahid Baig for the Senate by-election. “We have received a formal request from the PPP. Our central committee, under the leadership of Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, will deliberate and finalise this matter,” he said.
To a question, Nasir Shah said: “If the decision regarding the six canals project on the Indus River is not reversed at the May 2 meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), the PPP will consider parting ways with the federal government.”
“We are not in the coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz by choice, but out of necessity for the sake of Pakistan. The  canals issue is highly sensitive and that the party cannot back down on this matter,” he said.
He reiterated that PPP had always advocated for development and cooperation. He acknowledged the visible progress in development work.
He also thanked MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal for acknowledging that Karachi received federal funding during Asif Ali Zardari’s tenure. “This meeting is a gesture of goodwill and a step toward strengthening ties between our two parties,” he said.

• Metropolitan Police say at least one person held
• Tarar accuses New Delhi of sponsoring the attack
LONDON: As tensions between Pakistan and India rise in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistani diaspora protesters came face to face with their Indian counterparts outside the missions of both countries in central London, over the weekend.
The scenes outside the Pakistan High Commission in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, on Saturday and the Indian High Commission in Aldwych on Sunday showed that emotions are running high, with both sides chanting derogatory slogans and making offensive gestures against each other.
Met Police confirmed in a statement that officers were called at 5:03am on Sunday to reports of a man smashing windows at the Pakistani High Commission and that a 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of criminal damage and remains in custody. Eyewitnesses said eggs and saffron dye were also thrown at the embassy walls.
On Sunday, a handful of Pakistani protesters countered a sizeable number of Indian protesters, who were also joined by pro-Israel protesters who chanted anti-Pakistan slogans.
 
 

Outside the Pakistan mission, Pakistani protesters set up a chai stall in reference to the viral line by Indian pilot Abhinandan, who in 2019 was held captive by the Pakistan army when his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory and later repatriated. One gentleman stood on the balcony of the Pakistan mission and waved a cup of tea.
One eyewitness said that a pro-BJP group decided to initiate the anti-Pakistan protest outside the Pakistan mission, calling on scores of protesters. To counter the protest, PML-N’s UK chapter staged a counter-protest and used a sound system to drown out the anti-Pakistan slogans.
At both protests, Met Police officers stood forming a protective line between the two sides as anger and derogatory slogans were chanted. Indian protesters carried “I am Hindu” placards and waved empty water bottles, saying “do you want water”, referring to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.
Music was also blared by both sides, with the Pakistani protesters saying “Pak Fauj Zindabad” and “ISI Zindabad”. Anti-Modi and anti-Hindu slogans were also shouted, with Palestine flags and Pakistan flags waved together.
A pro-India protester was detained after making rude gestures and reportedly making racist comments. Indian protesters claimed that Met Police officers were being racist and that they pushed the protester “without listening”, adding that no one was arrested.
One Indian protester said the Met Police sides with Pakistan during the protests. Another said, “They have challenged Modi openly, now they will see the consequences.”
‘India responsible for attack’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar has accused India of being responsible for the attack on the Pakistan High Commission in London.
Speaking to reporters about the Pahalgam incident in Islamabad, Mr Tarar accused India of using its “extremist ideology” to encourage people to attack Pakistan’s foreign missions.
“A very unfortunate incident took place in London. Our high commission was attacked twice, and stones were thrown,” the minister said. “The people who are responsible are being sponsored by Indian agencies and the Indian state.”
Mr Tarar said that suspects had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police but highlighted that the incident was a product of the “kind of mindset that the Indian state has”.

The FIR accused Ms Haider of attempting to “create anxiety in the society” and “weaken the state” through the spread of misinformation.
Ms Haider, while confirming the FIR, rejected the allegations levelled against her and said she has been facing harassment since 2018 for raising her voice for human rights.
According to Ms Haider, she criticised the arrest of Dr Baloch and pointed out her organisation — BYC — has not been banned.

Officials said that an improvised explosive device was used to target a car at Muskan Chowk of Pishin town of Gwadar district late night, resulting in the killing two security personnel travelling in the car while another man was injured.
“The car was blown up and badly damaged in the powerful blast, causing panic among the people of Pasni town,” a senior police officer said, adding that soon after the blast the personnel of law enforcement agencies rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and injured to the district hospital.
 
 

The deceased were identified as Nawab Salman, a resident of Pasni, and Muhammad Nawaz, a resident of Khushab district of Punjab.
Also, some armed men hurled hand grenades at the Police Lines area of Dhahar in Kacchi district and at a livestock office in Sibi. However, no loss of life was reported in the grenade attacks.
Clash over land dispute
Meanwhile, three Bugti tribesmen were killed and two others injured in an armed clash in the Sui area of Dera Bugti over land dispute.
Levies officials said two groups of the Bugti tribe took arms against each other in the Jani Beeri area of Sui tehsil and an exchange of fire left three people dead and two others injured.

The arrests were carried out across  multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian, and Kulgam, according to the Kashmir Media Service.
In the Islamabad district of held-Kashmir alone, cordon-and-search operations and house raids resulted in the arrest of over 175 people. The detainees have been transferred to police stations and army camps.
A police spokesperson said that 175 individuals had been detained during house raids and search operations across various areas of the district, adding that additional checkpoints had been set up and patrolling had been intensified, particularly in densely forested regions.

Following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian troops and paramilitary forces escalated operations across the valley, carrying out widespread house raids and arbitrary arrests.
 
 

Indian forces have also launched a campaign of demolishing the homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris. Since Saturday, the ancestral homes of seven  Kashmiris have been destroyed using explosives by Indian forces, the Kashmir Media Service reported.
On the other hand, the houses of five more Kashmiris were demolished in what critics described as ‘collective punishment’.
The demolished houses belonged to the families of Amir Nazeer Wani, Jameel Ahmad Sher Gojri, Adnan Safi Dar, Amir Ahmed and Farooq Ahmad Tedwa. High-intensity explosives caused extensive damage to surrounding homes, leaving dozens of families homeless and in distress.
Critics accuse Indian authorities of mimicking Israeli tactics of occupation and dispossession to render Kashmiris homeless and break their resistance to Indian rule.
Abdul Rashid Minhas, a spokesman for the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), condemned the demolitions and arrests in a statement issued in Srinagar.

Most headed home with more questions than answers.
Many participants in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Spring Meetings had a sense that Trump’s administration was still conflicted in its demands from trading partners hit with his sweeping tariffs.
During the whirlwind week, many finance and trade ministers sought to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other key Trump administration officials, to no avail.

Foreboding persists as financial leaders unable to meet Trump admin officials

Those that did were often told to be patient — even as the clock steadily ticks down on the 90-day pause Trump had granted on the steepest levies.
“We know that they think — that it won’t be that bad,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski.
“They think it’s a short-term pain, long-term gain. And I’m afraid that we’ll have short-term pain, long-term pain.”
 
 

The Trump administration’s most substantial trade negotiations during the week were with Japan and South Korea, but the results were inconclusive as Bessent cited “productive” talks with both countries.
The IMF took a slightly more optimistic view of the economic fallout from the US tariffs, slashing growth forecasts for most countries in its World Economic Outlook but stopping far short of predicting recessions — even for the US and export-dependent China.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged that member countries were anxious about the uncertainty shock to a global economy buffeted by pandemic, inflation and wars but held out hope that trade negotiations would ease the tariff strains.
Several finance officials told Reuters that odds of recession were higher than the IMF’s 37 per cent chance, citing private sector forecasts.
Debt risk rises
Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based nonprofit group advocating debt relief, said that the IMF’s forecasts were clearly aimed at preventing market panic, even as officials in private meetings expressed concerns about new debt crises emerging.
“It was a do-nothing kind of week,” LeCompte said, adding that debt discussions were inconclusive and overshadowed by tariff talks.
Reza Baqir, a former Pakistan central bank governor who now heads sovereign debt advisory at Alvarez & Marsal, said: “For many developing countries, especially in the Global South, there is a real sense of despair that the agenda on Financing for Development is really not center-stage. And who is going to be there to champion that debate?”
World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill also sounded an alarm on rising debt levels for emerging markets, noting that tariffs had prompted a sharp slowdown in trade and foreign direct investment that are crucial to developing country growth.
No US withdrawal
Policymakers did breathe a sigh of relief when Bessent expressed US support for the IMF and the World Bank, declaring that they have “enduring value” but criticising their “mission creep” into climate, gender and equality issues.
Participants at the meetings, along with financial markets, were encouraged by Bessent’s comments early in the week that US tariffs on Chinese goods and vice versa were unsustainable, suggesting a deal to ease them could be reached soon.
But China denied Trump’s assertions that tariff negotiations were underway with Beijing, adding to the confusion over tariffs.

• Kh Asif calls for int’l probe
• No official word on Nawaz-Shehbaz huddle
ISLAMABAD: The country’s political leadership continued to engage with foreign capitals over the weekend to highlight India’s attempts to cloak its provocative actions and false accusations in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
In separate calls with leaders from China, UK and Iran, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar drew attention to the “baseless propaganda and unilateral measures” taken by New Delhi, including the decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which is a clear violation of the country’s international obligations.
Mr Dar, who also hold the foreign affairs portfolio, spoke to his counterparts from the UK and China and stressed Islamabad’s unwavering resolve to defend its national interests, while continuing to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Mr Dar that Beijing was paying close attention to the evolving situation between Pakistan and India.
He reaffirmed China’s consistent support for Pakistan’s firm counterterrorism efforts.
 
 

“As an ironclad friend and an all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and supports Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty and security interests,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
“China advocates for a swift and fair investigation and believes that conflict does not serve the fundamental interests of either India or Pakistan, nor does it benefit regional peace and stability,” Wang noted.
The Chinese foreign minister, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China’s Central committee, hoped that both sides would remain restrained, move toward each other, and work together to de-escalate the situation.
In a separate call with the UK foreign secretary, Mr Dar briefed David Lammy on “India’s false accusations, baseless propaganda, and unilateral measures”, while reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to a Foreign Office readout of the call, the UK foreign secretary emphasised the imp­o­rtance of de-escalating the situation thro­ugh dialogue and peaceful resolution of issues.
Appreciating these efforts, Mr Dar conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to participate in any independent and transparent investigation to ascertain the facts.
Both leaders agreed to maintain active contact regarding the evolving situation.
Call for int’l commission
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khaw­aja Asif called on India to stop levelling baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, he said the UN Security Council and key regional powers should investigate the Pahalgam incident, warning that if two nuclear powers collided, world peace would also be destroyed.
Calling for the formation of an international commission to investigate the incident, he said that the UN should consider including China, Russia, Iran and Arab countries in the body. Who could better understand the issue than the UK, he said, referring to the region’s colonial past.
He accused Indian PM Narendra Modi of staging a political drama to save his skin, just as he had done after the Pulwama incident in 2019.
Call with Iranian president
Speaking to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the prime minister shared Pakistan’s position on India’s provocative actions, adding that Pakistan desired peace in the region and would welcome it if Iran also wanted to play a role in this regard.
During their call, the two leaders exchanged views on recent developments in the region, a PM Office statement said. Both also extended invitations to each other to visit their respective countries.
Referring to India’s unilateral decision on the Indus Water Treaty, PM Shehbaz said the use of water as a weapon was unacceptable and Pakistan would defend its right at all costs.
The PM said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, reaffirming that the country had no linkage, either direct or indirect, with the Pahalgam attack, adding that Islamabad was ready for a neutral investigation into the incident.
PM Shehbaz also conveyed Pakistan’s condolences on the loss of precious lives in the tragic explosion at Bandar Abbas, which claimed dozens of the lives and left more than 500 people injured.
 
 

Pakistan stood with the brotherly people of Iran at this difficult hour and would extend all possible assistance, the PM said.
Separately, media reports suggested that PM Shehbaz Sharif had met his elder brother, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, at Jati Umrah on Sunday to brief him on the Pahalgam attack and its aftermath.
However, there was no official word from the PM Office or PML-N circles in this regard.

• Condition applies to both contract, regular re-employment after age 60
• Move aims to curb rising pension costs under IMF requirements
• Govt pension bill estimated at over Rs1tr in current fiscal year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has formally notified that retired public servants rejoining government service, whether on a contract or regular basis, will now have to choose between drawing a salary or receiving their pension and may no longer claim both simultaneously.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” said a notification issued by the regulation wing of the Ministry of Finance.
Earlier, rehired government employees used to avail of the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously — and in some cases, multiple pensions. This not only had an additional financial burden on the government exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
The latest measure is part of pension reforms the government has taken in hand to contain ever-increasing pension liabilities, a key requirement of the IMF programme.
 
 

The measure was initially announced by the then finance minister Ishaq Dar in the 2022-23 budget, but it could not be implemented until reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget before the IMF signed off a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel — may be further delayed until 2026 despite a notification for its implementation with effect from June 2025, according to sources.
In September last year, the government notified the introduction of a contributory fund scheme for new entrants in the civil government and armed forces. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance said last year that federal government employees would contribute 10 per cent of their respective basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc of the basic pay of the employees.
According to the Sept 3, 2024, notification, the scheme would apply to civil servants joining after July 1, 2024, and armed forces personnel appointed after July 1, 2025. The government has allocated Rs10 billion for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget.
The scheme had been introduced on the advice of the international lending agencies, particularly the World Bank, to contain rising pension liabilities described as a “ticking bomb”. The new scheme does not apply to existing employees. The government believes the contribution pension fund would slow down the growth in pension liabilities in future budgets.
The federal government’s total expenditure for pensions has been estimated at Rs1.014 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from Rs821bn in FY24, up by almost 24pc in a single year. This included pension liabilities of the armed forces at Rs662bn for the current fiscal year, up from Rs563bn, showing an increase of about 18pc.
On the other hand, the pension expenditure of civilians has been budgeted at Rs220bn for the current year against Rs228bn last year, a reduction of 3.5pc.
Subsequently, in January this year, the government notified further pension reforms, including abolishing multiple pensions and shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of the past 24 months of salaries instead of the last pay drawn before retirement.
It had been notified that “in the event where a person becomes entitled to more than one pension, such person shall only be authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”.
This was subject to the provision that “where a federal government employee becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee shall not be eligible to receive such pension”.
However, certain quarters were still pushing for a salary for re-employment and one pension.

• Ports anticipate crisis; manufacturers face raw material shortages
• President wades in to resolve situation
KARACHI: Efforts to disperse protesters, who have paralysed cross-country traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh, remained futile on Sunday, with manufacturers saying they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The road closures in several parts of Sindh are due to continuing protests against the controversial proposal to build new canals on the River Indus.
Although the federal government and the PPP regime in Sindh have agreed to postpone the project, nationalist parties, lawyers and other civil society groups do not appear convinced by the assurance and have vowed to continue their protests until the government makes the postponement official.
According to Dawn’s correspondent in Sukkur, thousands of heavy vehicles are stuck in long queues on different roads in the Kandhkot, Kashmore, Ghotki, Sukkur and Khairpur areas.
Manufacturers and transporters are surprised by the persisting impasse, even though the provincial government has been calling on protesters to clear the roads.
 
 

On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, where the issue of the controversial projects and its fallout also came under discussion.
Sources privy to the meeting said the chief minister expressed concern over attempts by some political parties to exploit the issue for what he termed “vested interests”, referring to the ongoing protesters, staged mainly by nationalist parties in different parts of the province.
The CM also briefed the president about measures the Sindh government was taking to address public concerns and restore normalcy in affected areas, sources said.
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House at 4pm today (Monday).
Transport at a standstill
An official at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) told Dawn that export cargo was not arriving, while imported cargo was piling up and not moving out of the port due to the closure of roads in Sindh.
“We are managing this situation to avoid congestion at the port, especially with the continuous arrival of imported goods . But in case goods movement remains held up, the port will face severe congestion, the official said.
Transporters say that in addition to worrying manufacturers and exporters, their drivers and helpers are also in a dire situation. Nisar Jafry of the All Pakistan Goods Transporters Associa­tion said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded.
He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be their meant for import, export or locally produced.
Giving an estimated headcount, he said that around 90,000-100,000 drivers and their helpers have been stranded alongside their vehicles on the highways for over 10 days now. They are also facing food and water shortages.
 
 

Transporters also alleged that protesters had damaged dozens of vehicles parked on the roads, and that over 100 sacrificial animals that were part of their cargo had already died.
Mr Jafry said he had received a call from Sindh transport minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, requesting him to call off Monday’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Memon called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Due to the closures, the public, livestock, import and export sectors, farmers, and the poor are being severely affected, he said, adding that if the sit-ins must continue, the roads should be opened so that the flow of traffic is not hampered.
Representatives of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Oil Companies Advisory Council and the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council have all warned that the disruptions to the logistics supply chain are creating a severe crisis.
Although around 800-1,000 oil trucks are also stranded, the OCAC representative ruled out the possibility of a fuel shortage just yet.

Between February 1 and April 20, 2025, election tribunals decided 24 petitions related to the 2024 general elections, bringing the total number of decided petitions to 136, or 36.5 per cent of the total 372 matters being heard across four provinces. Of these, 26pc relate to Nati­onal Assembly seats and 42pc to provincial assembly seats.
Of the 24 petitions decided, 21 were from Punjab, two from Baloc­histan, and one from Sindh. In Punjab, two tribunals in Lahore decided eight cases, one in Rawa­lpindi decided seven, and one in Bahawalpur decided six.
The two tribunals in Quetta disposed of one case each, while a tribunal in Karachi disposed of only one case. No petitions from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were decided during this period.
 
 

Despite an increase in the number of petitions decided in Punjab compared to previous months, the overall pace of decisions has slowed, Fafen said.
This may be because four tribunals remained largely dysfunctional during the reporting period, including two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one in Punjab, and the sole tribunal of the Islamabad Capital Territory.
To date, Balochistan’s three election tribunals have collectively decided 43 (83pc) of the total 51 petitions filed for national and provincial constituencies in the province. Punjab’s eight tribunals have decided 66 (34pc) of 192 petitions. Sindh’s five tribunals have decided 18 (22pc) of 83 petitions. KP’s six tribunals have decided nine (21pc) of 42 petitions.
Of the 136 petitions decided so far, 133 were dismissed and three were accepted. Among the 133 dismissals, 52 were dismissed on non-maintainability grounds, including 10 related to National Assembly constituencies and 42 to provincial assembly constituencies.
Petitioners
The independent candidates supported by PTI make the largest group of petitioners, with 55pc of total petitions filed by them, followed by PML-N candidates (13pc), PPP candidates (8pc), unaffiliated independent candidates (7pc) and JUI-F candidates (6pc).
As many as 16 other party candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 11pc of the petitions.
Around 56pc petitions of independent candidates, 50pc of PPP candidates, 42pc each of PML-N and JUI-F candidates, and 58pc of those by other parties have been decided so far.
The returned candidates belonging to PML-N make the largest group of defendants with 39pc of the petitions challenging their victory, followed by PTI-backed candidates (16pc), MQM-P candidates and PPP candidates (13pc each), unaffiliated independents (6pc), and JUI-F (5pc).
As many as 11 other defendant parties’ candidates cumulatively acc­o­unt for the remaining 8pc petitions.
Around 58pc petitions filed against unaffiliated independents, 45pc against PTI-backed independents, 39pc against JUI-P candidates, 36pc each against PML-N and PPP candidates, 27pc against MQM-P candidates, and 21pc against other parties’ candidates have been decided so far.
Appeals
According to the Fafen report, 54 decisions of election tribunals have been contested before the Supreme Court. Among these, three appeals were initiated by the winning candidates against whom election petitions were accepted.
Additionally, 51 appeals have been filed against the rejection of election petitions by respective election tribunals. Among these, four have been heard and dismissed by the Supreme Court. The remaining 47 appeals are still under adjudication.
Of the 51 petitions filed against the dismissal of election petitions, 11 were lodged by losing candidates of the National Assembly elections. Similarly, 40 were submitted by losing candidates of provincial assembly elections, including 24 from Balochistan, 12 from Punjab, and four from Sindh.
Among the 51 appeals filed against the rejection of election petitions, 22 have been filed by PTI-backed independent candidates, six by PPPP candidates, five by the PML-N candidates, four by JUIP candidates, three by independent candidates, and two each by the National Party, Awami National Party, and Jamhoori Watan Party candidates.
Similarly, one petition each was filed by candidates from the Hazara Democratic Party, Balochistan National Party, Balochistan National Party Awami, Khadameen-i-Sindh, and Balochistan Awami Party candidates.
In terms of the respondents, 25 appeals were filed against the winners of PML-N, six against PPP, five against independent candidates backed by the PTI, four each against the MQM-P, JUI-F, and unaffiliated independent candidates, two against National Party, and one against the winner belonging to Balochistan Awami Party.

“Trump is much more radical now than he was eight years ago,” said Elliott Abrams, a conservative who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush before being appointed US special envoy on Iran and Venezuela in Trump’s first term.  “I have been surprised.” 
Trump’s second-term  “America First” agenda has alienated friends and emboldened adversaries while raising questions about how far he is prepared to go. His actions, coupled with that uncertainty, have so unnerved some governments that they are responding in ways that could be difficult to undo, even if a more traditional US president is elected in 2028.
All this comes amid what the Republican president’s critics see as signs of democratic backsliding at home that have raised concerns abroad. These include verbal attacks on judges, a pressure campaign against universities and the transfer of migrants to a notorious El Salvador prison as part of a broader deportation drive.
“What we’re seeing is a huge disruption in world affairs,” said Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations.  “No one is certain at this point what to make of what’s happening or what will come next.” 
This assessment of Trump’s shakeup of the global system comes from interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials, foreign diplomats and independent analysts in Washington and capitals around the world.
Many say that while some of the damage already done could be long-lasting, the situation may not be beyond repair if Trump softens his approach. He has already backtracked on some issues, including the timing and severity of his tariffs.
But they see little chance of a dramatic shift by Trump and instead expect many countries to make lasting changes in their relationships with the US to safeguard against his erratic policy-making. The fallout has already begun.
Some European allies, for instance, are looking to boost their own defence industries to reduce reliance on US weapons. Debate has intensified in South Korea about developing its own nuclear arsenal. And speculation has grown that deteriorating relations could prompt US partners to move closer to China, at least economically.
The White House rejects the notion that Trump has hurt US credibility, citing instead the need to clean up after what it calls former President Joe Biden’s  “feckless leadership” on the world stage.
“President Trump is taking swift action to address challenges by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table to end their war, stemming the flow of fentanyl and protecting American workers by holding China accountable, getting Iran to the negotiating table by reimposing Maximum Pressure,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement.
He said Trump was also  “making the Houthis pay for their terrorism ... and securing our southern border that was open to invasion for four years.”  More than half of Americans, including one in five Republicans, think Trump is  “too closely aligned” with Russia, and the American public has little appetite for the expansionist agenda he has laid out, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on April 21.
High stakes
At stake, say experts, is the future of a global system that has taken shape over the past eight decades largely under US primacy. It has come to be based on free trade, rule of law and respect for territorial integrity.
But under Trump, who has been scornful of multilateral organisations and often views global affairs through the transactional lens of a former real estate developer, that world order is being shaken up.
Accusing trading partners of  “ripping off” the US for decades, Trump has set in motion a sweeping tariffs policy that has roiled financial markets, weakened the dollar and triggered warnings of a slowdown in worldwide economic output and increased risk of recession.
Trump has called the tariffs necessary  “medicine” but his objectives remain unclear even as his administration works to negotiate separate deals with dozens of countries.
At the same time, he has all but reversed US policy on Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine and engaged in an Oval Office shouting match with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in late February. He has warmed to Moscow and stirred fears that he will force Nato-backed Kyiv to accept the loss of territory while he prioritises improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The administration’s belittling of Europe and Nato, long the central pillar of transatlantic security but accused by Trump and his aides of freeloading off the US, has caused deep unease.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, after winning February’s election, expressed concern about European relations with the United States, saying it would be difficult if those who put  “America First” actually made their motto  “America Alone”. “This really is five minutes to midnight for Europe,” Merz said.
In a further blow to Washington’s global image, Trump has employed expansionist rhetoric long avoided by modern-day presidents, which some analysts say could be used by China as justification if it decides to invade self-governed Taiwan.
With his blustery style, he has insisted that the US will  “get” Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish island. He has angered Canada by saying it has little reason to exist and should become part of the US. He has threatened to seize the Panama Canal, which was handed over to Panama in 1999. And he has proposed that Washington take over war-ravaged Gaza and transform the Palestinian enclave into a Riviera-style resort.
Some analysts say Trump may be seeking to resurrect a Cold War-style global structure in which big powers carve up geographic spheres of influence.

It also states that a country with a low financial literacy rate, high inflation and high cash in circulation (cash printed but not in any bank account) will have a very low national savings rate.
Pakistan fits this diagnosis perfectly. Firstly, the official savings rate (savings in banks as a percentage of GDP) stood at 14 per cent. Secondly, although inflation has eased in the recent past, rates provided by banks for savings products were well below the inflation rate, hence providing a negative rate of return. Thirdly, we remain a cash economy; money in circulation as of March 14 stood at Rs9.1 trillion.
This perfect storm will make increasing the official savings rate very challenging. Regulators and providers must use the customer lens if they are to make a dent in our savings habit. The solution must provide a real rate of return without high risk, must be safe (no Ponzi schemes), must be easily accessible (no 10-page documentation with twenty signatures), must have an affordable ticket size and must be liquid.
Research suggests that Pakistanis save in cash, cryptocurrency, dollars, gold, real estate, stocks and animals (mostly in the rural areas). Let us look at each asset class and see what can be done to entice the savers to move from rupee savings outside the system to an asset class within the system. 

There is a major opportunity to bring trillions of rupees in circulation into one of the many asset classes provided that access and knowledge is simplified

This will not only document the economy and raise the official savings rate but potentially also allow the banks to lend more. In addition, let us also examine what Rs10,000 invested five years ago in the asset classes mentioned would be worth today.
As seen in the table, investments in cryptocurrency, gold and company shares provided a positive rate of return after adjusting for inflation, yet the biggest asset class that we save in is Pakistani rupees. While Rs34tr is within the system, banks and the national savings schemes, Rs9.1tr is in circulation, and we can assume this to be in private lockers, office vaults and under pillows. The return on Rs10,000 invested five years ago would, if deposited in a savings account, show a negative rate of return given the five-year inflation rate.
So, in order to attract more people to save in rupees, we need to do four things. Firstly, educate the potential savers that there are rupee instruments, like the 90-day T-bill, that provide a rate better than inflation. Secondly, the opening of an Investor Portfolio Securities account — needed to invest in capital market instruments — must be made as easy as opening a digital wallet. Thirdly, the denomination of the investment must be made palatable (the T-bill already has a Rs5,000 denomination but is not offered to customers), and lastly, the investment must be made liquid.
Cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, has become extremely popular in Pakistan. While the figures cannot be verified directly from the exchanges, analysts suggest that the holding of crypto assets by Pakistanis ranges between $10 billion and $30bn with over 10 million people holding a crypto wallet in one or more crypto exchanges. 


*Assuming that in 2020, a uniform Rs10,000 was invested in each of the various asset classes.
Note: A three-bedroom apartment at Emaar in DHA has been used as a proxy for real estate owing to a lack of market indices. The price of a cow has been taken as a proxy for animal prices. All other asset classes are based on published values at the time of writing. Based on auhtor’s calculations

 
Unfortunately, this activity is not regulated, and these assets are acquired via institutionalised hawala systems. 
Although crypto investments can potentially be used for money laundering, are a major drain on foreign currency reserves and are speculative in nature, they are here to stay. The best immediate course of action would be to create a synthetic contract that mimics one or more cryptocurrencies and the exchange element. 
In this manner, once the ‘know your customer’ and ‘anti-money laundering’ processes have been done, customers can invest the cryptocurrencies without risks. Pakistanis also save in physical dollars. While the physical dollar is a dead asset, the charm is in the dollar’s value appreciating.
Moving on, gold is one of the most popular asset classes. Gold is not saved via financial instruments or gold bricks but in gold ornaments. It is estimated that over $10bn worth of gold ornaments exist in the country. In order to make investing in gold as easy as buying a cold drink, we must fractionise and tokenise it.
Imagine an app that allows you to buy gold worth Rs100; it allows you to pay from your digital wallet and/or credit card, always provides a bid-offer spread so that you can buy or sell at any time, and offers the option of getting physical gold once you reach an agreed weight. The entity providing this service could be reg­u­lated and have physical gold against which it has fractionalised and tokenised the service. This can be a game changer and will start to bring in the money in circulation in the system.
Although the Pakistan stock exchange provided resounding returns over the past few years, most Pakistanis don’t invest in equities for three main reasons: they are unaware of the returns and the risks associated with equity investments; financial literacy is low, and as a consequence, individual broking accounts are less than 100,000; and opening a broking account is a very painful exercise. 
So financial literacy related to the risks and rewards of investing in company shares and the ease of opening an account must be improved if we are to see wider representation in the stock exchange.
There is a major opportunity to bring trillions of rupees from cash in circulation into one or more asset classes discussed. This will not only document the economy and improve the savings rate but also provide additional liquidity to the banks. To achieve this objective, the regulators, the existing banks and cutting-edge start-ups will need to work together.
